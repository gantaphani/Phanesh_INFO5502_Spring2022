special agent matt larson of the federal bureau of investigation sought an interview with chee as the only suspect to the crime.i.at.he unsuccessfully tried to contact chee at his residence,and then left a business card with chee daughter at her apartment,telling her that he wanted to speak to her father about a firearm chee found in a car he had purchased at a government auction months before.id.at.chee eventually called agent larson and they an appointment at the blanding police department for the following day,october.id.at.
that morning,chee arrived at the department on foot with his wife and was met by agent larson and criminal investigator henry lee,an investigator for the navajo nation department of public safety.id.at.chee,agent larson,and investigator lee then went to blanding police chief mike halliday office,not a formal interview room,to talk.id.agent larson told chee wife to stay outside.id.at.investigator lee sat behind the desk,agent larson sat in a chair in front of the desk,and chee sat in a chair positioned alongside the wall with the door.id.at.both agent larson and investigator lee were in plain clothes and did not have any firearms or handcuffs that were visible.id.at.chee was never handcuffed or restrained in any way during the course of the interview,but the door was closed.id.at.
agent larson began the conversation by telling chee that he was not under arrest,he was not in any trouble,he could leave if he wanted,and he did not have to talk.id.at.he began questioning chee about the firearm that chee had found in his car months earlier.id.at.thereafter,agent larson asked him about the sexual assault on perry.id.agent larson told him that perry grandmother was very upset about what had happened,and chee replied that he knew she was upset and had tried to apologize.id.agent larson then asked chee to tell him what happened,and chee initially denied having sex with perry.id.at.after his denial,agent larson informed him that the police had obtained dna evidence from the scene when,in fact,agent larson knew they had not.id.chee admitted at this point that he had sex with perry against her will and,at agent larson suggestion,agreed to write a letter of apology to perry and her grandmother.id.at.chee wrote the letter for approximately ten minutes while agent larson made suggestions for what to include.id.at.no threats or promises of leniency were ever made.id.at.

discussion 
on appeal,chee argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress on the basis that he was not in custody and in determining that his oral and written confessions were voluntarily made did not make adequate findings as to whether chee had an extraordinary physical impairment due to his age and mental disabilities that would warrant a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines,and incorrectly applied sentencing enhancements for the use of force,a vulnerable victim,and the abuse of a position of trust.
we first address whether chee oral and written confessions were obtained in violation of his fifth amendment rights articulated in miranda.we review the district court denial of chee motion to suppress and whether chee was in custody for miranda purposes de novo.see united states thomson,cir united states erving,cir.we accept the district court factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.thomson,at.
the supreme court in miranda held that any confession obtained during a custodial interrogation may not be used by the prosecution against the defendant unless the prosecution demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the fifth amendment privilege against.see at.prior to questioning,the person being interrogated must be warned of his miranda rights,including his right to remain silent.see id.miranda rights need only be given to a suspect at the moment that suspect is in custody and the questioning meets the legal definition of interrogation.united states perdue,cir.as the government concedes that chee was interrogated by agent larson and was never read his miranda rights,aplee.br.at,we need only determine whether chee was in custody.
an individual is in custody of the authorities under miranda if he is deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way,at,or his freedom of action is curtailed to a degree associated with formal arrest.perdue,at quoting california beheler,d per curiam.we therefore must determine whether a reasonable person in the suspect position would have understood the situation as the functional equivalent of formal arrest.berkemer mccarty,d.
this is a inquiry focusing on the totality of the circumstances.united states griffin,cir.helpful to our analysis is whether the suspect is made aware that he or she is free to refrain from answering questions or to end the interview at will and the nature of the questioning,including whether the questioning is prolonged and accusatory.id.in addition,we analyze whether the environment was police dominated.id.indications of whether the police are in full control may include whether the suspect was separated from his family and isolated in a nonpublic questioning room,whether there was the threatening presence of several officers,whether there was any display of weapons or physical contact with the suspect,and whether the officer language and tone indicated that compliance might be compelled.id.at.
the district court denied the motion to suppress with respect to miranda because chee was not in custody at the time he confessed.at.chee argues that he was in custody under miranda once the topic of the interrogation moved from the firearm to the sexual assault and that,at a minimum,he should have received miranda warnings once he orally confessed.aplt.br.at.he argues that once the topic shifted,the interrogation became accusatory rather than investigatory and a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave.id.at.his oral and written confessions,he contends,therefore should have been suppressed by the district court.id.at.
we are unpersuaded.the supreme court addressed a very similar factual situation in oregon mathiason,d per curiam and reached the same conclusion that we reach.in mathiason,an officer was investigating a burglary and suspected that the defendant might have been involved.id.at.after attempting to contact the defendant three or four times,the officer left his card at the defendant apartment with a note to call him to discuss something.id.the defendant then called and they set up a meeting at the state patrol office.id.the officer met the defendant in a hallway at the appointed time and took him to an office,closing the door.id.the officer then told the defendant that he was not under arrest.id.before advising the defendant of his miranda rights,the officer began questioning the defendant about the burglary and falsely stated that the defendant fingerprints had been found at the scene.id.the defendant then confessed to the crime.id.at the end of the interview,the officer told the defendant that he would refer the case to the district attorney and that the defendant was not under arrest.id.at.the defendant then left the office.id.
the defendant argued that his confession should have been suppressed because he was not advised of his miranda rights before he gave it.id.at.the supreme court held,however,that there was no miranda violation because the defendant was not in custody.id.at.he came voluntarily to the police station,where he was immediately informed that he was not under arrest.at the close of a interview respondent did in fact leave the police station without hindrance.it is clear from these facts that the defendant was not in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.see beheler,at.per curiam holding that miranda warnings are not required when the suspect is not placed under arrest,voluntarily comes to the police station,and is allowed to leave unhindered by police after a brief interview.
chee contention that he had to be given miranda warnings once the investigative process moved to the point where agent larson was trying to obtain a confession is simply incorrect.chee reliance on escobedo illinois,d is of little assistance.escobedo was decided prior to miranda and concerned the sixth amendment right to counsel.id.at.the defendant in that case was denied a lawyer after repeatedly requesting one during an interrogation.id.at.there is no evidence that chee requested counsel at any time during the interrogation.
the fact that the interrogation moved from one topic to another topic that chee did not expect does not change our conclusion.although chee was told by officer larson that he was not under arrest and was free to leave at the beginning of the he was still under the impression that the interrogation would only concern the environment did not change once the topic shifted to the sexual assault.the district court was persuaded that the tone remained calm and conversational throughout the interrogation,even after chee confessed.at.n o supreme court case supports the contention that admission to a crime transforms an interview by the police into a custodial interrogation.locke cattell,cir.although interviews taking place at the police department are more likely to be,see united states ollie,cir,the mere fact that chee was questioned by himself in a nonpublic office at the police department after his wife was asked to remain outside does not transform this interview into a custodial interrogation.this is especially true given the duration of the interview less than an hour and the fact that chee was told that he was free to leave and did leave thereafter.viewing all of the circumstances,we conclude that a reasonable person in chee situation would not believe he was effectively under arrest and that chee,therefore,was not in custody under miranda.see at.berkemer,at.
ii.extraordinary physical impairment 
we next consider whether the district court failed to make adequate findings with respect to whether chee had an extraordinary physical impairment at the time of his sentencing that would justify a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines.united states slater,cir quotation omitted.chee argues that the district court did not make adequate findings with respect to his age and physical condition under and,respectively.aplt.br.at.alternatively,if this court finds that he did not raise this issue below,chee argues that we should still review it because trial counsel failure to raise the issue created an impediment to the district court ability to address it,the result of which was manifest injustice.id.at 
we review compliance with the federal rules of criminal procedure de novo.united states,cir.rule i b states that a sentencing court any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing,or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.the district court may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact.i a.t o invoke the district court rule obligation,the defendant is required to make specific allegations of factual inaccuracy,at.an objection to the ultimate conclusions in the presentence report does not necessarily imply that a controverted matter exists.id.chee had an affirmative duty to make a showing that the information in the presentence report was unreliable and articulate the reasons why the facts contained therein were untrue or inaccurate.id.at quoting united states terry,cir internal edit omitted.
in this case,after a careful review of the record,we believe that the issue was not raised before the district court.chee trial counsel did request a departure from the sentencing guidelines for diminished capacity at the time of the crime under,both in her written objections to the presentence report and at the sentencing hearing i.at iv.at.this was the sole focus of chee trial counsel argument for a downward departure,and and were never mentioned.iv.at.chee trial counsel made two scattered statements at the sentencing hearing about how anything more than five or six years is likely going to be a
