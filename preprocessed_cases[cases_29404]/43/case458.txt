opinion on remand from the united states supreme court 
plaintiff prairie band potawatomi nation the nation,a federally recognized kansas indian tribe,originally filed this action against kansas state officials to obtain a court order requiring that the state recognize motor vehicle registrations and titles issued by the nation.the district court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of plaintiff,affirmed by this court on june,prohibiting enforcement of the state motor vehicle registration and titling laws with respect to vehicles registered and titled by the nation.prairie band of potawatomi indians pierce,cir prairie band i.on august,following the outline and guidance provided by this court in prairie band i,the district court granted plaintiff motion for summary judgment,permanently enjoining defendants from further application and enforcement of kansas motor vehicle and titling laws against plaintiff and any persons who operate or own a vehicle properly registered and titled pursuant to tribal law.on october,the district court denied defendants motion to reconsider,and this court subsequently affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff and its issuance of the permanent injunction.prairie band potawatomi nation wagnon,cir prairie band ii,vacated,d mem.

the district court opinions and our opinion in prairie band i provide a comprehensive history of the dispute,which therefore need not be repeated in detail here.the relevant facts follow.on march,in order to address the increase in motor vehicle traffic on the reservation,the nation enacted the prairie band motor vehicle code pbmvc to implement reasonable rules,regulations,and penalties essential to maintaining a safe and efficient transportation system on its reservation appellee,vol.i,at pbmvc ch.pursuant to the pbmvc,tribal registrations and titles are required for all vehicles owned by tribe members who reside on the reservation and for all tribal government vehicles.id.at pbmvc ch,b.the pbmvc requires those seeking tribal registrations to surrender any certificate of title issued by another jurisdiction,including kansas.id.at,pbmvc ch,a.the tribal certificates of title are of banknote quality and resemble titles of other jurisdictions,and the license plates conform to the national standards for visibility,design,and size.id.at.
prior to the enactment of the pbmvc,the nation members complied with kansas motor vehicle code,which requires that all vehicles operating in kansas be registered and titled by the state.see.stat.ann.nonresidents operating vehicles in kansas are not considered in violation of kansas law if they are properly registered and titled in the state of their residence,provided that their state grants reciprocal recognition to kansas registrations and titles.see.stat.ann.
it is defendants position that,in absence of an injunction,drivers of tribally licensed vehicles will be in violation of kansas state law for failure to present a properly registered vehicle.according to defendants,since the nation is within the state of kansas,the exception of does not apply to the nation because its members are residents of kansas.as a result of this policy decision,prior to this litigation and the issuance of the preliminary injunction three citations and a warning ticket were issued by state law enforcement to tribal members,pursuant to kan stat.ann,for driving tribally registered vehicles off the reservation.plaintiff submits that it is necessary for privately and tribally owned vehicles to occasionally leave the reservation not only for individual purposes,but also in the exercise of tribal government functions 
because our decision in prairie band ii was vacated in its entirety,we must readdress each issue raised by defendants on appeal.as succinctly stated in our prior opinion,the issues on appeal are whether the district court abused its discretion in issuing the permanent injunction erred in its ruling that defendants were not entitled to sovereign immunity and erred in ruling that the relief requested by the nation a permanent injunction did not violate the tenth amendment.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standard employed by the district court,to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact and whether a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.zamora elite logistics,cir sac fox nation of pierce,cir.the first issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in issuing the permanent injunction.sec pros int l,cir w e review the district court grant or denial of a permanent injunction for an abuse of discretion.a district court abuses its discretion when it issues an arbitrary,capricious,whimsical,or manifestly unreasonable judgment.coletti cudd pressure control,cir internal quotation omitted.
for a party to obtain a permanent injunction,it must prove actual success on the merits irreparable harm unless the injunction is issued the threatened injury outweighs the harm that the injunction may cause the opposing party and the injunction,if issued,will not adversely affect the public interest.fisher.health care,cir.this standard is remarkably similar to the standard for a preliminary injunction.the only measurable difference between the two is that a permanent injunction requires showing actual success on the merits,whereas a preliminary injunction requires showing a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.see prairie band i,at citing fed.lands legal consortium united states,cir.given our determination in prairie band i that the nation will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not issued,that the balance of the harms favors the tribe,and that the granting of the injunction will not adversely affect the public interest,it follows that the only real controversy that this court must decide is whether the district court abused its discretion in ruling that the nation has succeeded on the merits 
plaintiff originally argued during the summary judgment appeal that,pursuant to the law of the case doctrine,our decision in prairie band i negated the need to revisit certain issues.according to plaintiff,these issues included subject matter jurisdiction standing presence of an article iii case or controversy and use of the bracker balancing test.as an initial matter,the first three issues were resolved by this court in favor of plaintiff in prairie band i,at,and defendants do not persist in questioning our resolution of those issues as to the final issue,plaintiff supplemental briefing following remand reflects that the law of the case doctrine is no longer able to justify using bracker.nevertheless,we address this issue more fully here given our repeated reliance on the bracker interest balancing test in our previous decisions,which have been called into question in light of the supreme court instruction on remand.although the law of the case doctrine provides that where a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case,arizona california,d,the rule is a flexible one that allows courts to depart from erroneous prior rulings,as the underlying policy of the rule is one of efficiency,major benton,cir,not restraint of judicial power,messinger anderson.see also wilson meeks,cir citing arizona,at.the presence of subsequent contradictory precedent is a legitimate basis for not applying the law of the case doctrine.major,at see also wilson,at listing limited reasons justifying departure from law of case doctrine,including where controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues quoting united states monsisvais,cir in turn quoting white murtha,cir.the supreme court began its decision in prairie band iii by clarifying that the bracker test applies only where a state asserts authority over the conduct of engaging in activity on the reservation.at quoting bracker,at.the supreme court decision in prairie band iii therefore compels our departure from reapplication of the bracker interest balancing test.
the conduct of,whether on or,is not at issue here.nor does this case merely concern the conduct of indians.the fact that motor vehicle titling and registration is a traditional government function,see prairie band i,at see also queets band of indians washington,cir indian tribes possess the sovereign authority to license and register tribal vehicles,vacated as moot,cir accord red lake band of chippewa indians state,finding motor vehicle registration ordinance an appropriate exercise of governmental authority vested in the tribal council of the red lake band,makes clear that the issue does not concern the location of any individual vehicle or residency of any individual driver,but the sovereign right to make equally enforceable and equally respected regulations in an arena free of discrimination.cabazon band of mission indians smith,cir finding proper comparison for assessing discriminatory application of emergency light bar regulation was between law enforcement agencies.accordingly,we must no longer concern ourselves with the severity of the effect of the state regulation on the nation sovereign interests,but determine whether the state law discriminates against the nation right to make such regulations other sovereigns see mescalero apache tribe jones,d.
the nation,like any governmental entity,has a significant interest in regulating motor vehicles traveling on its land,and w e have no cause to believe that the tribes have been implicitly divested of that power by virtue of their dependent status.queets band,at.the nation has attempted to regulate the effects of increased motor vehicle traffic on its reservation through the pbmvc and through the issuance of tribal registrations and titles.the pbmvc is a comprehensive code that applies to all vehicles that are driven on the reservation.the stated purposes of the pbmvc are to control and regulate reservation traffic to provide for the orderly registration and licensing of vehicles to assist law enforcement in identifying the owners of such vehicles to prevent fraudulent transfers,theft,conversion,or other wrongful transactions or use of vehicles to provide positive identification of vehicles in cases of emergency to provide revenue to the nation and to allow for the orderly transfer of title and other commercial transactions.appellee,vol.i,at pbmvc ch,a.
no one disputes the nation authority to apply the pbmvc on reservation land the dispute arises solely because the tribally tagged vehicles must sometimes leave the reservation and drive on kansas roads and because the tribal and state motor vehicle registration and titling regulations can not coexist ignoring the fact that the nation will be forced to rescind its regulation in order to avoid regulating its members into violating state law,it is apparent to this court that simultaneous application of these two regulations is not possible.as a practical matter,vehicles can not display multiple license plates.at an early stage of the proceedings,defendants contended that tribal vehicles could bear kansas license plates on the rear of the vehicle and tribal license plates on the front of the vehicle.see prairie band i,at.this resolution strikes the court as disingenuous and is wholly unsupported by the record.the confusion such a practice would cause in vehicle identification alone renders it unworkable.
nor can a vehicle have more than one official title.dual certificates of title would stifle the pbmvc stated purposes of provid ing for the orderly registration and licensing of vehicles,prevent ing fraudulent transfers,theft,conversion,or other wrongful transactions,and allow ing for the orderly transfer of title and other commercial transactions.appellee,vol.i,at pbmvc ch,a.in addition,the pbmvc does not allow for concurrent registration each applicant for a tribally issued certificate of title shall surrender to the registrar any and all other certificate of title issued by any other governmental agency of any state.appellee,vol.i,at pbmvc ch,a.it also does not appear that the kansas motor vehicle statutes permit multiple registrations.see.ann.stat.referring to original certificate of title.
in order to circumvent the unique problem posed by these incompatible concurrent regulations,defendants assert that,once the tribally registered vehicles leave the reservation,kansas can choose not to recognize these vehicles as validly registered and titled under state law,and that to find otherwise would subject states to the exercise of a tribe powers.appellants supp.br.at.we disagree.such an absolute position ignores the fact that kansas laws must still be nondiscriminatory under mescalero.under kansas law,residents of other states,territories,or possessions of the united states,the district of columbia,the commonwealth of puerto rico,foreign countries,and states or provinces of foreign countries are permitted to drive their vehicles on kansas roads without registering or titling their vehicles in kansas so long as their vehicles are duly licensed in their own state of residence and that jurisdiction grants vehicles reciprocal privileges.see.ann.stat.with the exception of iran and possibly cuba,out of the universe of vehicles that appear on kansas highways,the state recognizes and is willing to accept registration and titling by practically every jurisdiction except in the case of indian tribes.prairie band ii,at mcconnell,concurring see oral arg.tr.may.indeed,pursuant to state wakole,the state had to grant reciprocity to oklahoma vehicles where oklahoma recognized the tribal registrations.at.
the parties spend a great deal of time on the issue of residency in relation to tribal members.we note that the law leaves their status unclear where,as here,the nation has exercised its sovereign rights in creating a concurrent law regardless,we have already explained that because the right to make motor vehicle titling and registration regulations is a traditional government function,the discriminatory effect is to be analyzed between sovereigns,not individual drivers.as a consequence,defendants argument that the nation and its members are residents of kansas and,therefore,can not invoke the reciprocity statute falls flat.
the sole reason offered by defendants to justify their refusal to recognize the nation registration and titling law is that of public safety.see prairie band ii,at citing oral arg.tr,prairie band i,at.indeed,defendants conceded at two separate oral arguments that revenue was not at issue the sole concern was that of safety and protection of a state police powers.see oral arg.tr,oral arg.tr.may.defendants make much of the fact that the nation tribal vehicle registrations do not appear in the national criminal database,thereby endangering the lives of law enforcement personnel by preventing them from obtaining crucial vehicle information.see prairie band i,at recounting arguments.judge mcconnell,in his concurrence in prairie band ii,questioned whether kansas refused to recognize registrations from other jurisdictions not linked to the same database.prairie band ii,at mcconnell,concurring.the answer to that question is no.the record reveals that oklahoma tribal by not included in the database.appellants,vol.iv,at.as judge mcconnell stated if nonparticipation in the database is a genuine problem,kansas could amend its reciprocity statute to recognize only those registrations that are included in the database,or meet other public safety criteria.prairie band ii,at mcconnell,concurring.moreover,although safety is a legitimate concern,we previously commented that defendants had exaggerated the severity of that concern here.see prairie band i,at.kansas recognizes license plates from other states,canada,and mexico,and tribally issued tags from other jurisdictions,including minnesota and oklahoma,without any safety concerns.
