rarely does a probate matter find its way into federal court.here we are presented with a will contest involving a member of an indian tribe in a department of the interior probate proceeding where we must decide whether state or federal law of evidence applies.
matilda covington,a colville indian died on july.on july,shortly before her death,covington executed a will leaving all her indian trust allotments to her,brandon austin francis,a minor covington children predeceased her and she left no property to her three living grandchildren.the will listed one of covington grandchildren,jolene mother of brandon austin the decedent personal representative for purposes of administering the estate.jolene francis is also listed as a contingent beneficiary for the trust property.staff attorneys from the colville tribal legal services ctls assisted covington in drafting her will.
two of covington palmer and robert her will alleging that she lacked testamentary capacity and was subjected to undue influence.the department of the interior interior office of hearings and appeals oha hears will contests involving indian trust allotments.see supra.at the third hearing,testimony by the will scrivener and witnesses cast doubt on covington state of mind.further,two of covington relatives testified that she was unable to recognize or to speak with them in the days before she executed the will.
testimony at the probate hearings revealed that covington had prepared a handwritten worksheet to aid her attorney in drafting the new will.debra palmer and robert francis sought a subpoena for all materials related to the preparation of the will,presumably hoping that they would shed light on covington mental state.oha administrative law judge alj william hammett oversaw the probate of the will and issued a subpoena duces tecum to james of him to produce copies of all documents relating to the preparation of the will and to appear at a supplemental hearing.edmonds refused to turn over the documents,claiming that they were privileged communications,confidential,and protected work product.jolene francis,the personal representative of covington estate,refused to waive any privilege.
the alj rejected edmonds claim of privilege and directed him to produce the relevant materials.shortly thereafter,edmonds filed a motion to quash the subpoena in the eastern district of washington the district court granted the motion to quash on the grounds that privilege protected the materials.
interior timely appeals.
interior contends that under the regulations,the alj may admit evidence that does not comport with state evidentiary rules 
as a threshold matter,we must address interior assertion that its interpretation of its own regulations is due deference.interior is indeed correct that an agency interpretation of its own regulations is generally entitled to deference.see,auer robbins,d league of wilderness mts.biodiversity project forsgren,cir an agency interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to deference unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.though interior may be due deference,we are reminded that congress has delegated to the administrative official and not to appellate counsel the responsibility for elaborating and enforcing statutory commands.investment company institute camp,d.in bowen georgetown university hospital,d,however,the supreme court refused to extend chevron deference when the agency itself has articulated no position on the question.the court explained that d eference to what appears to be nothing more than an agency convenient litigating position would be entirely inappropriate.id.despite these admonitions,auer explained that an agency litigating position may be entitled to deference if it reflects the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question and is not a post hoc rationalization.at.quoting bowen,at.if interior position meets these requirements,and is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations,we will defer to it 
interior has published regulations regarding indian trust probate proceedings pursuant to,which authorizes the head of any executive department to prescribe regulations to conduct the business of the department.
the relevant oha regulation on form and admissibility of evidence states 
a interested parties may offer at a formal hearing such relevant evidence as they deem appropriate under the generally accepted rules of evidence of the state in which the evidence is taken,subject to the administrative law judge or indian probate judge supervision as to the extent and manner of presentation of such evidence.
b the administrative law judge or indian probate judge may admit letters or copies thereof,affidavits,or other evidence not ordinarily admissible under the generally accepted rules of evidence.the weight to be attached to evidence presented in any particular form is within the discretion of the administrative law judge or indian probate judge,taking into consideration all the circumstances of the particular case.
c stipulations of fact and stipulations of testimony that would be given by witnesses were such witnesses present,agreed upon by the interested parties,may be used as evidence at the hearing.
d the administrative law judge or indian probate judge may in any case require evidence in addition to that offered by the interested parties.
another oha regulation limits production of privileged materials 
a an interested party may make a written demand to produce documents for inspection and copying or photographing.this demand 
may demand any documents,papers,records,letters,photographs,or other tangible things that are 
i relevant to the issues 
ii in the other party or custodian possession,custody,or control and 
iii not privileged.
c on his or her own motion,the administrative law judge or indian probate judge may issue an order to any interested party or custodian of records for the production of material or information that is relevant to the issues and not privileged.
emphasis added.
while under,the alj lacks authority to subpoena privileged materials,the regulation does not specify whether federal or state privilege law applies.the parties agree that if federal evidentiary law applies to these proceedings,would not bar the admission of covington notes obviously,the first question is whether adopts federal or state evidentiary rules.second,we must determine whether the relevant source has incorporated the testamentary exception to the privilege.
does adopt state or federal law ctls contends that subsection a applies the evidentiary rules of the state in which the evidence is introduced.interior,on the other hand,contends that subsection a only determines what evidence the parties may offer as a matter of right,and that subsections b and d allow the alj to admit evidence on the basis of federal common law.
subsection a is the only provision of either regulation that mentions state or federal law,noting that the parties may offer relevant evidence as they deem appropriate under the generally accepted rules of evidence of the state in which the evidence is taken.a.the plain text of the regulation supports ctls interpretation the evidence the parties may offer is determined by state law,not federal law.as to substantive evidentiary issues surrounding proffered as whether covington communications with her attorney are privileged or,conversely whether they may be offered as evidence subsection a identifies state law as the relevant authority.
but the question remains where subsection a fits as part of the overall regulatory scheme.campesinos unidos dep t of labor,cir our task is to interpret the regulation as a whole,in light of the overall statutory and regulatory scheme,and not to give force to one phrase in isolation.ctls interpretation also fits with the structure of the whole regulation.if subsection a adopts state law as the relevant evidentiary law for substantive questions,then subsection b as we discuss further the alj from the strictures of generally accepted rules of evidence in order to allow evidence of different forms and to retain a relaxed procedure.though we agree with interior that subsection a does not necessarily set a limit as to what evidence may come b and d may expand this a clearly sets the baseline.
the text of is plain we need not defer to the agency interpretation of subsection a.indeed,interior interpretation is not even supported by its own interior board of indian appeals ibia case law.specifically,estate of charles hall,ibia,concluded that adopts the rules of evidence of the state where the hearings are held.similarly,in estate of elizabeth frank green,ibia,the ibia concluded that a provides the rules for submitting and receiving evidence in indian probate proceedings.we think it clear from these cases that the ibia decisional law construes subsection a,and generally,as having selected state evidentiary law as the relevant law for the proceedings.
interior contends that subsections b and d give the alj broad authority to admit evidence that would not be allowed under state rules,but would be allowed under federal rules.ctls contends that the alj remains bound by state law except under the narrow exceptions provided for in the other subsections.
subsection b states that the alj may admit letters or copies thereof,affidavits,or other evidence not ordinarily admissible under the generally accepted rules of evidence.b.interior argues that subsection b allows the alj to admit evidence in accordance with federal privilege law,meaning that would no longer prohibit the admission of the materials.
the term other evidence not ordinarily admissible is a general term following specific examples,so we must interpret it with reference to the preceding list according to the ejusdem generis canon of construction.see,circuit city stores adams,d w here general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration,the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.quoting singer,sutherland on statutes and statutory construction.under this reading,or other evidence must refer to other evidence similar to letters or copies thereof and affidavits.given the preceding terms,the provision is limited to form and related issues of presentation,whether the evidence is properly authenticated,whether it is presented as hearsay,rather than questions of substance,whether privilege extends 
the second sentence of subsection b,which interior does not explain,reinforces this conclusion the weight to be attached to evidence presented in any particular form is within the discretion of the administrative law judge emphasis added.that is,the alj may admit evidence in a variety of forms,but because such evidence may be suspect,the alj is free to discount its weight.were interior correct that subsection b broadly authorizes the alj to admit any evidence he so chooses,the reference to form in the second sentence would be inappropriate.
interior interpretation of subsection b that it allows the alj broadly to admit evidence not ordinarily admissible excises the prefatory examples and ignores the second sentence of the subsection.we decline to adopt such interpretation.rather,we read subsection b as a whole as such,it allows the alj to ignore technical evidentiary requirements and to admit evidence in various forms or types,but the alj may not adopt different standards for substantive evidentiary questions,such as whether communications are privileged as a matter of law.
such interpretation also fits with the prior ibia case law.for example,hearsay evidence may not be admissible under state evidentiary rules,but the alj can still admit such evidence under subsection b.see,estate of harold humpy,ibia,june,approving the alj use of b to admit hearsay testimony that would not be admissible under state law estate of alexander joseph williams,ibia,approving the use of testimony by affidavit where a witness health prevented a live appearance,even though state evidentiary law would not allow testimony in this form estate of thomas jones,ibia,hearsay rule not applicable to administrative proceedings.for example,in estate of alexander joseph williams,a witness was too ill to travel and to present testimony.the ibia concluded that it was acceptable for the alj to consider the witness testimony by affidavit,though applicable state rules would not have allowed the testimony to be delivered in that form.ibia at.as the ibia explained,cfr adopts the rules of evidence of the state where the hearings are held,but permits a relaxed procedure.estate of charles hall,ibia at emphasis added.see also estate of larry michael oskolkoff,ibia,june,noting that subsection b gives the alj some discretion in determining what kinds of evidence will be considered.these cases go to the form of evidence,and none would allow the alj to admit evidence whose than its manner of be prohibited by state law.
in support of its interpretation of subsection b,interior argues that i t is a well established principle that federal evidentiary rules govern proceedings in federal court where federal law provides the rule of decision.federal rule of evidence,however,states that federal common law will apply unless otherwise provided.here the regulations specifically adopt state evidentiary rules.further,given that the ibia has previously interpreted as adopting state evidentiary rules,the litigating position proffered by interior that federal common law not entitled to any deference.
in sum,subsection b expresses the relatively uncontroversial proposition that administrative proceedings need not cleave to strict state evidentiary rules.see,opp cotton mills adm r of wage and hour div.of dep t of labor.noting that technical evidentiary rules,applicable in jury trials,do not apply to proceedings before federal administrative agencies in the absence of a statutory requirement that such rules are to be observed.this interpretation also fits within the regulatory scheme subsection b gives the alj somewhat broader authority to admit evidence,but does not jettison the selection of state substantive law evinced in subsection a.subsection b does not go further to adopt federal common law or give the alj broad authority.further,while there are many ibia decisions relying on subsection b to admit evidence whose form or presentation does not comport with state law,interior can not point to any ibia decision that extends to the alj authority to circumvent evidentiary rules on questions of substance.
interior also notes that t he department has consistently held that the execution and interpretation of a will disposing of trust or restricted property are questions of federal,not state,law.estate of florence night chase,ibia,citations omitted see also estate of elizabeth frank green,ibia,the department has long adhered to the rule that state laws have no application in indian trust probate proceedings involving wills.however,this line of cases stands only for the proposition that federal law supplies the standards for determining valid execution and proper interpretation of wills.these cases do not support interior position that federal evidentiary law applies to questions of privilege as well.indeed,the same cases which note the role of federal law also explain that state evidentiary law applies.see,green,ibia at noting that a provides for submitting and receiving evidence in indian probate proceedings.even if the ibia decisions supported interior position,interior proffered interpretation is not supported by the text of the regulation,which does not distinguish between proceedings involving wills and other proceedings.such interpretation would not be entitled to deference.auer,at.
finally,interior argues that subsection d gives the alj broad authority to require evidence in addition to that offered by the parties.interior contends that subsection d allows the alj to admit any evidence admissible under federal law.
first,we note that nowhere does subsection d explicitly adopt federal law.in contrast,subsection a explicitly adopts state law as the baseline for admissibility.further,were we to adopt interior interpretation of subsection d,that provision would swallow subsection b.that is,if subsection d
