the united states petitions for a writ of mandamus to direct the court of federal claims trial court to vacate its orders requiring the united states to produce documents that it asserts are protected by the privilege.jicarilla apache nation jicarilla opposes.we hold that the united states can not deny an indian tribe request to discover communications between the united states and its attorneys based on the privilege when those communications concern management of an indian trust and the united states has not claimed that the government or its attorneys considered a specific competing interest in those communications.accordingly,we adopt the fiduciary exception in tribal trust cases.under the fiduciary exception,a fiduciary may not block a beneficiary from discovering information protected under the privilege when the information relates to fiduciary matters,including trust management.because we find that the trial court correctly applied the fiduciary exception to the united states privileged communications,we deny the united states petition for a writ of mandamus.
background 
jicarilla sued the united states in the court of federal claims for a breach of fiduciary duties,alleging that the united states mismanaged the tribe trust assets and other funds.jicarilla apache nation united states.the trial court divided the case into phases.the first phase only concerns the government management of jicarilla trust accounts from to.id.during this phase,the tribe moved to compel discovery of documents related to the management of the trust funds that the united states asserted were protected by the privilege,the doctrine,and the deliberative process privilege.id.in response,the united states agreed to produce of the documents listed in its privilege log based,in part,upon withdrawing any deliberative process privilege claims,but maintained its privilege claims over the remaining documents.id.per court order,the trial court reviewed the remaining documents in camera.id.
the trial court held that the united states could not deny jicarilla request to discover communications between the united states and its attorneys based on the privilege because those communications were subject to the fiduciary exception.id.at.the trial court explained that under the fiduciary exception,fiduciaries may not shield from their beneficiaries communications between them and their attorneys that relate to fiduciary matters,including the administration of trusts.id.at.according to the trial court,the fiduciary exception applied to the general trust relationship between the united states and the indian people,which comprises a distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the government.id.at quoting united states mitchell,d.the trial court opined that basic trust principles are readily transferable to the united states fiduciary relationship with indian tribes.id.at.the trial court noted that congress had enacted legislation appointing the united states as trustee over million acres of land and billions of dollars in tribal assets and created an office of special trustee to ensure that each tribe received as complete a trust fund accounting as soon as possible.id.at citing.though statutes undoubtedly delimit somewhat the government obligations,the trial court explained that the supreme court had evaluated the fiduciary relationship using principles of common law and had judged tribal trust cases with the most exacting fiduciary standards.id.at quoting seminole nation united states.
with these principles in mind,the trial court applied the fiduciary exception,requiring the united states to produce many of the documents that were not otherwise protected as work product.id.at.the trial court organized the documents that jicarilla requested into five categories,including department of the interior interior personnel requests for advice from the interior solicitor office solicitor office on administration of tribal trusts,solicitor office advice to interior and department of the treasury treasury personnel,accounting firm arthur andersen llp documents generated under contracts with interior,interior documents concerning litigation with tribes other than jicarilla,and miscellaneous documents such as cover sheets and other documents not falling into the other categories.id.at.the court applied the fiduciary exception to all the documents in the first category except for duplicates because the documents involve matters regarding the administration of tribal trusts,either directly or indirectly implicating the investments that benefit jicarilla.id.at.with few exceptions,the trial court also applied the fiduciary exception to documents in the second category because the documents contained legal advice relating to trust administration.id.at.in contrast to the first two categories,the trial court allowed the united states to withhold most of the documents in the third category from production as attorney work product.id.at.as to the fourth category,the trial court allowed the united states to withhold most of the documents as work product,but required the government to produce four documents with the exception of two footnotes.id.at.according to the trial court,those documents either did not constitute attorney work product at all or,if privileged,were subject to the fiduciary exception.id.finally,the trial court required the united states to produce two documents that fell under the fiduciary exception in the fifth category because the documents concerned trust management and various cover sheets that did not appear to be protected by either the privilege or the doctrine.id.at.
the united states now petitions for a writ of mandamus to vacate the trial court order requiring production of the above documents under the fiduciary exception.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
this court has the authority to issue a writ of mandamus against a lower court under common law as codified in the all writs act.a ll courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.a.mandamus is available only in extraordinary cases to correct a lower court usurpation of judicial power or clear abuse of discretion.cheney dist.court,d see also in re regents of the of.a party seeking a writ of mandamus bears the burden of proving that it has no other means of attaining the relief desired,mallard dist.court,d,and that its right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable,bankers life cas.holland.quoting united states ex rel.bernardin duell.accordingly,the writ is a drastic and extraordinary remedy reserved for really extraordinary causes.cheney,at.quoting ex parte fahey.
notwithstanding the extraordinary nature of mandamus,this court has issued the writ in appropriate cases to prevent the wrongful exposure of privileged communications.regents,at see also mohawk,carpenter,d noting that an appellate court may grant a writ of mandamus to correct a particularly injurious or novel privilege ruling.specifically,mandamus review may be granted of discovery orders that turn on claims of privilege when there is raised an important issue of first impression,the privilege would be lost if review were denied until final judgment,and immediate resolution would avoid the development of doctrine that would undermine the privilege.in re seagate,llc,en banc quoting regents,at.accordingly,mandamus may be appropriate to correct a lower court that ordered a party to produce documents in violation of the privilege.see id.at granting mandamus to correct a district court that held a party had waived the privilege protecting trial counsel client communications and work product by asserting the defense in patent infringement suit regents,at granting mandamus to correct a district court that misconstrued the community of interest doctrine by ordering patent licensee counsel to testify about advice given to patentee during prosecution when licensee and patentee entered into an exclusive option contract and counsel assumed responsibility for patent prosecution.
as a matter of first impression,the united states petitions for a writ of mandamus,asserting,inter alia,that the fiduciary exception does not apply to it because its relationship to the tribe is different than a traditional fiduciary relationship.the united states explains that the fiduciary exception is based on two primary rationales,including the fiduciary duty of loyalty to the beneficiaries and the fiduciary duty to provide information to beneficiaries.based on these rationales,the united states argues the following first,it argues that the fiduciary exception rationales should not apply to its duties to tribes because the united states has competing interests to consider when administering the trust.second,the united states argues that the privilege should protect the documents here because the payment for the legal services did not come from the trust corpus.third,the united states argues that applying the exception to the privilege would improperly impair its ability to seek confidential legal advice.finally,the united states argues that it does not have a fiduciary duty to disclose information to beneficiaries.
the united states petition for mandamus thus asks us to interpret the bounds of the privilege.this court interprets privileges on a basis according to principles of the common law when federal law is at issue.see also upjohn united states,d.accordingly,we will begin with a summary of the privilege and the fiduciary exception before examining how the privilege should apply in this case.
i.the privilege and the development of the fiduciary exception 
the privilege is the client right to refuse to disclose confidential communications between attorney and client made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.genentech,int l trade comm n,see also fisher united states,d confidential disclosures by a client to an attorney made in order to obtain legal assistance are privileged.black law dictionary ed.the privilege encourag es full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and recognizes that sound legal advice depends upon the lawyer being fully informed by the client.upjohn united states,d.but the privilege belongs to the client,who alone may waive it.in re seagate,llc,en banc.an attorney may not assert the privilege against the client wishes or against the client himself.see am.standard,pfizer,the privilege is that of the client,not that of the attorney.
while t he privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law,upjohn,at,it is not an ironclad veil of secrecy,garner wolfinbarger,cir.the supreme court has recognized exceptions to the privilege,for example,holding that it does not protect communications made in the furtherance of a crime or fraud.see united states zolin,d t he purpose of the exception to the privilege is to assure that the seal of secrecy between lawyer and client does not extend to communications made for the purpose of getting advice for the commission of a fraud or crime.internal quotation marks omitted see also in re spalding sports worldwide,discussing the exception.moreover,we have recognized the joint client or community of interest doctrine when the same attorney represents the interests of two or more entities on the same matter,those represented are viewed as joint clients for purposes of privilege.in re regents of the of.under this doctrine,communications between a client and the attorney may be privileged as to outsiders,but they are not privileged between clients in a community of interest relationship.wachtel health net,cir.several courts have recognized another limitation on the privilege,known as the fiduciary exception.
as early as,english courts required a trustee to produce legal advice to a beneficiary when the beneficiary sued the trustee for mismanagement and the advice related to trust administration.devaynes robinson,beav,eng,c ases and opinions taken by the trustees must be produced to the beneficiaries as long as the trustee did not obtain them in contemplation of litigation recent cases,in re whitworth,ch,harv.however,the privilege still applied to advice that the trustee sought in anticipation of litigation.id.after devaynes,english courts have followed the exception to the privilege in beneficiary suits against a trustee for trust mismanagement.see,talbot marshfield,sm,eng,i f a trustee properly takes the opinion of counsel to guide him in the execution of the trust,he has a right to be paid the expense of so doing out of the trust estate and that alone would give any beneficiary a right to see the case and opinion.wynne humbertson,beav,eng,t he rule is that,where the relation of trustee and beneficiary is established,all cases submitted and opinions taken by the trustee to guide himself in the administration of his trust,and not for the purpose of his own defense in any litigation,must be produced to the beneficiary.in re mason,ch,holding that the trustees must produce documents containing communications by and to the trustees and their solicitors in relation to the trust estate,made before the action was brought.these english courts reasoned that a beneficiary was entitled to access the advice of counsel because the trustee sought the advice on how to execute the trust for the beneficiary benefit and because the trust fund paid for the advice.see wynne,beav.at,eng.at talbot,sm.at,eng.at.
though much later,courts in the united states also adopted the fiduciary exception.in,the fifth circuit held that shareholders could pierce a corporation privilege to discover legal advice given to corporate management in a suit for breach of fiduciary duty upon a showing of good cause.garner,at.the fifth circuit identified nine factors courts should consider in finding good cause.id.at in reaching its conclusion,the court recognized that a corporation or its managers may sometimes have conflicting interests with shareholders and that shareholders may have conflicting interests among themselves.id.at.but when all is said and done management is not managing for itself,rather it has duties which run to the benefit ultimately of the stockholders.id.at.analogizing to the exception and the community of interest doctrine,the fifth circuit reasoned that the privilege had limits when the person seeking legal advice had a superseding obligation to shareholders or some other client was entitled to the advice.id.at.
since garner,courts have applied the fiduciary exception in contexts other than derivative shareholder actions.for example,courts have applied the exception in trust cases when trustees assert the privilege against beneficiaries,as in the leading american case riggs bank of,zimmer.courts have also relied on the exception in other fiduciary relationships,such as when employers managing plans regulated under the employee retirement income security act erisa have asserted privilege against plan beneficiaries and when unions have asserted privilege against union members.see becher long island lighting in re long island lighting,cir employer acting as an erisa fiduciary asserting privilege against plan beneficiaries aguinaga john morrell,union asserting privilege against union members.
the fiduciary exception to the privilege is now well established among our sister circuits.at least five circuits recognize some form of the exception,including the second,fifth,sixth,ninth,and circuits.see,united states mett,cir in re lindsey,becher,at recognizing the fiduciary exception in the second circuit wildbur arco chem,cir fausek white,cir sandberg.bankshares,cir,vacated,l,wl cir.though we are aware of some state courts that have expressly rejected the fiduciary exception,no federal court of appeals has rejected the principle,but have only declined to apply the exception in cases where the facts did not justify its application.compare wells fargo bank,superior court,cal th,d,rejecting the fiduciary exception in a case because statutory privilege did not permit judicially created exceptions,and huie deshazo,rejecting the fiduciary exception in a case,with wachtel,at declining to apply the fiduciary exception to an insurer who sells,but does not manage,insurance to parties,and bland fiatallis,cir declining to apply the fiduciary exception to an employer amending or terminating an erisa plan,and cox adm r steel carnegie,cir declining to apply the garner doctrine to a union in a suit brought by union members because only a tiny percentage of union members were members of the class and the union class members interests conflicted with union members not in the class.
as developed in the united states,courts have based the fiduciary exception on two justifications.see riggs,at.first,the fiduciary is not the attorney exclusive client,but acts as a proxy for the beneficiary.see,mett,at a t least as to advice regarding plan administration,a trustee is not the real client and thus never enjoyed the privilege in the first place.internal quotation marks omitted riggs,at as a representative for the beneficiaries of the trust which he is administering,the trustee is not the real client in the sense that he is personally being served.under this justification,the fiduciary exception is but a logical extension of the client control of the privilege.second,the fiduciary has a duty to disclose all information related to trust management to the beneficiary.see,becher,at an erisa fiduciary must make available to the beneficiary,upon request,any communications with an attorney that are intended to assist in the administration of the plan.riggs,at t rustees can not subordinate the fiduciary obligations owed to the beneficiaries to their own private interests under the guise of privilege.under this second justification,the fiduciary exception can be understood as an instance of the privilege giving way in the face of a competing legal principle,the duty to disclose.mett,at.
no federal court of appeals has addressed whether the fiduciary exception applies to the united states as trustee over tribal assets and funds.however,federal trial courts have previously applied the fiduciary exception to the united states in at least three tribal trust in the court of federal claims and once in a district court.see osage nation united states,cobell norton,shoshone indian tribe of wind river reservation,wy.united states,and.may,attached at jicarilla apache nation united states.with this background in mind,we now turn to the question that the united states raises in its petition.
ii.the fiduciary exception applied to indian trusts 
the united states relationship with the indian tribes is sufficiently similar to a private trust to justify applying the fiduciary exception.therefore,we hold that the united states can not deny an indian tribe request to discover communications between the united states and its attorneys based on the privilege when those communications concern management of an indian trust and the united states has not claimed that the government or its attorneys considered a specific competing interest in those communications.the united states general assertion that the secretary of the interior other statutory obligations may occasionally be in tension with interests regarding tribal lands or other assets,does not diminish its exacting responsibilities as a trustee so as to warrant shielding the trust beneficiary from legal advice on trust management.accordingly,we adopt the fiduciary exception in tribal trust cases.we do not address whether the fiduciary exception applies when the government or its attorneys considered a specific competing interest in those communications,such as statutes governing endangered species or natural resources.nor do we address whether the fiduciary exception applies to documents privileged as attorney work product.in the case before us,however,both justifications for the fiduciary exception support its application.
identity of the client 
as the court of federal claims described,the communications at issue here were for the benefit of jicarilla and other indian tribes.jicarilla apache nation united states.interior was seeking advice on behalf of the tribes on how to manage trust funds and other tribal assets,and the attorneys were giving advice on trust management ultimately for the benefit of the tribes.accordingly,interior was not the government attorneys exclusive client,but acted as a proxy for the beneficiary indian tribes.
jicarilla status as the real client stems from its trust relationship with the united states.riggs bank of,zimmer.the supreme court has affirmed the undisputed existence of a general trust relationship between the united states and the indian people.united states mitchell,d see also cherokee nation,pet.describing the relationship of the indian tribes to the united states as ward to his guardian and clearly establishing the now longstanding and accepted basis of the trust relationship between the united states and indian tribes.all of the necessary elements of a trust are present a trustee the united states,a beneficiary the indian allottees,and a trust corpus indian timber,lands,and funds.id.this general trust relationship rests on a long history of asset management and statutory mandates to interior.as the trial court noted,nearly every piece of modern legislation dealing with indian tribes contains a statement reaffirming the trust relationship between tribes and the federal government.jicarilla.at quoting felix cohen,handbook of federal indian law a.we think that the statutes that the trial court cites amply demonstrate that relationship.see see also a trust investment contract administration funding agreements forest resources education agricultural resources trust fund management special trustee.indeed,like the fiduciary duties in other statutory trusts,the united states trust duties to tribes draw much of their content from the common law of trusts.varity howe,d comparing fiduciary duties under erisa to the common law of trusts.accordingly,common law trust principles should generally apply to the united states when it acts as trustee over tribal assets.see united states white mtn.apache tribe,d applying the common law principle that a trustee must preserve the trust corpus to the united states as trustee of tribal assets shoshone indian tribe of wind river reservation united states,applying the common law principle of trustee repudiation to the united states as trustee of tribal assets.moreover,the general trust relationship justifies straightforward application of the fiduciary exception in this case,instead of the multifactor balancing test that courts apply in derivative shareholder actions.compare wynne humbertson,beav,eng,fiduciary exception applied in trust case,and riggs,at same,with garner,at shareholder derivative action identifying nine factors for good cause to pierce privilege.we find the government arguments to the contrary unpersuasive and address each in turn.
duty of loyalty to the tribes 
the united states relies primarily on nevada united states,d for its argument that its relationship with the tribes is very different from a traditional fiduciary relationship to beneficiaries.
in nevada,the supreme court held that res judicata barred an action by the united states in seeking additional water rights on behalf of the pyramid lake indian reservation because the united states had already sued in to adjudicate those same water rights.id.at.the court also addressed the united states obligations to the reservation and its obligation to comply with the reclamation act of.the reclamation act required the secretary of the interior to assume substantial obligations with respect to the reclamation of arid lands in the western part of the united states.id.at.the court explained that the united states would not violate its trust obligations to a tribe by performing another task also required in the reclamation act.the court noted that congress delegated to the secretary of the interior both the responsibility for the supervision of the indian tribes and the commencement of reclamation projects in areas adjacent to reservation lands.id.based on this dual responsibility,the court wrote that it is simply unrealistic to suggest that the government may not perform its obligation to represent indian tribes in litigation when congress has obliged it to represent other interests
