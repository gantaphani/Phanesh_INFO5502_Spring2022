this case is the latest in a long line of lawsuits in our circuit regarding the efforts of the oneida indian nation of new york the tribe to assert tribal jurisdiction over a portion of its indigenous homeland in central new york state after the supreme court rejected the tribe claim to existing,jurisdiction over a portion of the homeland,see city of sherrill oneida indian nation,the tribe requested that the united states take approximately acres of land into trust on its behalf in procedures prescribed by of the indian reorganization act of.the entrustment that the federal government approved in gave the tribe jurisdiction over approximately acres of land in central new york,allowing the tribe,among other things,to continue to operate its turning stone casino in verona,new york.
plaintiffs appellants two towns,a civic organization,and several residents of the area near the trust land filed these lawsuits in an attempt to reverse the decisions.they now appeal from judgments of the northern district of new york lawrence kahn,granting the summary judgment motions of defendants appellants,the united states and several federal officials the district court rejected plaintiffs claims that the procedures are unconstitutional and that certain provisions of the indian land consolidation act ilca,adopted in,bar the united states from taking land into trust for the tribe.
we agree with the district court that the entrustment procedure generally,and this entrustment in particular,lie within the federal government plenary power over indian tribes neither principles of state sovereignty nor the constitution enclave clause which requires state consent for the broadest federal assertions of jurisdiction over land within a state prevents the federal government from conferring on the tribe jurisdiction over these trust lands.we further hold that the oneida nation of new york is eligible as a tribe within the meaning of and for land to be taken into trust on its behalf accordingly,we affirm the judgments of the district court.
background 
procedures of the indian reorganization act 
the origins of this dispute lie in the evolution of federal indian policy in the late and early centuries.beginning in the late century,congress began to partition tribal lands and allocate parcels to individual indians in a policy known as allotment.cty.of yakima confederated tribes bands of yakima indian nation.as the supreme court has described,t he objectives of allotment were simple and clear cut to extinguish tribal sovereignty,erase reservation boundaries,and force the assimilation of indians into the society at large.id.at.in the years in which the allotment policy was followed,congress also stripped tribes of their authority to govern themselves,instead providing that indians residing on allotted lands would eventually be subject to state civil and criminal jurisdiction.id.at.
because indians could still sell their allotted lands to,however,many of the early allottees quickly lost their land through transactions that were unwise or even procured by fraud.id.at.for this and other reasons,the allotment policy came to an abrupt end in.id.at.the indian reorganization act of ira including its,originally codified at fundamentally restructured the relationship between indian tribes and the federal government,reversing the nineteenth century goal of assimilation and embodying principles of tribal and.connecticut ex rel.blumenthal dep t of the interior,cir.connecticut quoting cty.of yakima,at.the ira repudiated the allotment policy and aimed to restore to tribes,or replace,the lands and related economic opportunities that had been lost to them under it.see felix cohen,handbook of federal indian law a cohen,handbook.
the ira therefore authorized the secretary of the interior,in her discretion,to acquire land and other property interests within or without existing reservations for the purpose of providing land for indians.pub,stat,codified at title to any lands or rights acquired pursuant to this act,it provides,shall be taken in the name of the united states in trust for the indian tribe or individual indian for which the land is acquired.id.land held by the federal government in trust for indians under this provision is generally not subject to state or local taxation local zoning and regulatory requirements or,state criminal and civil jurisdiction over indians,unless the tribe consents to such jurisdiction.connecticut,at citations omitted.under the ira as passed in,tribes were entitled to opt out of its provisions,including the provisions of,by majority vote see pub,stat,codified at.
the ira implementing regulations,promulgated by the department of the interior,create a process by which tribes and individual indians can request that the department take land into trust on their behalf.see.upon receiving such a request,the secretary must provide notice to state and local governments whose rights would be affected by the acquisition and give them an opportunity to respond.see.in making her final decision,the secretary is to consider enumerated criteria,including the tribe need for land to facilitate tribal,economic development,or indian housing,a,and the impact on the state and its political subdivisions resulting from the removal of the land from the tax rolls,e.the secretary is also directed to consider jurisdictional problems and conflicts of land use that would be created by an entrustment.id.
ii.factual background 
for more than four decades,the tribe has clashed with state and local governments and residents in upstate new york over its efforts to regain governmental authority with respect to a portion of its extensive indigenous homeland.prior opinions of this court and the supreme court have detailed the complex history of the relationship between new york and the tribe,and in particular their disputes regarding the tribe jurisdiction over its reservation in central new york.see oneida indian nation of cty.of oneida,oneida i cty.of oneida oneida indian nation of,oneida ii city of sherrill oneida indian nation of,sherrill oneida indian nation of city of sherrill,cir.oneida iii,rev,sherrill,at.we offer only a brief summary of that history here,to provide context for our decision.
the tribe is a federally recognized indian tribe and a direct descendant of the oneida nation,one of the six nations of the iroquois,the most powerful indian tribe in the northeast at the time of the american revolution.sherrill,at quoting oneida ii,at.the aboriginal homeland of the oneida nation comprised some six million acres in what is now central new york.id.but under the treaty of fort schuyler,the oneida nation ceded all their lands save for a reservation of about acres to new york state in exchange for payments in money and in kind.id.
in a pivotal development,w ith the adoption of the constitution,indian relations came exclusively under federal authority.oneida iii,at.in the nonintercourse act,congress prohibited selling tribal land without the acquiescence of the federal government.id.at see also restricting alienability of indian land.then,in,the federal government entered into the treaty of canandaigua with the six iroquois nations.the treaty acknowledge d the oneida reservation as established by the treaty of fort schuyler and guaranteed the oneidas free use and enjoyment of the reservation.sherrill,at.
notwithstanding the nonintercourse act and the canandaigua treaty,however,new york state continued to purchase land from the oneidas,largely without federal interference.id.at.beginning in,the federal government for a while encouraged the oneidas to relocate to a new reservation in kansas.although the tribe never completely relocated to that site,id.at,the oneidas who remained in new york by owned only acres of the reservation original.id.at.nonetheless,the oneidas original reservation was never officially disestablished.see oneida indian nation of madison,cir.
in the,the tribe began to repurchase new york reservation land in transactions and to use those lands for various commercial enterprises.in those years,the tribe took the position that because the purchased parcels lay within the boundaries of the reservation originally occupied by the oneidas,the properties were exempt from local property taxes.the tribe opened and operated the turning stone resort casino on a portion of the land.
the town of sherrill eventually moved to evict the tribe from land within the town boundaries for nonpayment of property taxes.in response,the tribe sought an injunction barring both the eviction and the assessment of property taxes.the district court held,and our circuit agreed,that the tribe land was exempt from property taxes because it lay within the boundaries of the reservation established for it by the fort schuyler and canandaigua treaties.see oneida indian nation of city of sherrill,new york,supp,aff by oneida iii,at.
but the supreme court rejected the tribe claim,reasoning that the oneidas had as a practical matter lost rights to their land more than two hundred years earlier.see sherrill,at.during those two centuries,state and local governments continuously exercised sovereignty over the putative reservation land,and the character of the land changed dramatically.id.as a result,the court held,equitable considerations precluded restoration of the tribe sovereign rights over land since purchased on the market.id.at.the court pointed out,however,that an alternative was available to the tribe congress has provided a mechanism for the acquisition of lands for tribal communities that takes account of the interests of others with stakes in the area governance and.id.at.describing the provisions enacted in of the ira,the court suggested that offered the proper avenue for the tribe to reestablish sovereign authority over territory last held by the oneidas years ago.id.at.
on april,almost immediately after the supreme court decision in sherrill and in accordance with the court suggestion,the tribe requested that the secretary of the interior take more than acres of land in central new york into trust for the tribe.all of the land was already owned by the tribe.its government,health,educational,and cultural facilities were located in the tract,as were tribal housing,businesses,and hunting lands,and the turning stone casino.
three years later,in may,and over the objection of state and local governments,the department of the interior announced its decision to accept into trust for the tribe approximately of the acres requested.see dep t of the interior,record of decision oneida indian nation of new york request may record of decision,joint appendix.the secretary found that the entrustment was necessary to support tribal,tribal housing,and economic development.record of decision.it acknowledged that the acquisition may negatively impact the ability of state and local governments to provide cohesive and consistent governance,and would incrementally increase the demand for local government services.but it concluded that those negative effects did not warrant denying the entrustment.id.
iii.procedural history 
plaintiffs appellants moved quickly in to challenge the secretary decision in federal district court.see upstate citizens for equality,united states,cv,filed june,town of verona salazar,cv,filed june,invoking federal jurisdiction pursuant to the administrative procedure act,plaintiffs contended that the statutory mechanism exceeds the federal government constitutional authority and unlawfully infringes on state sovereignty.the verona and vernon plaintiffs also argued that the department statutory authority does not extend to taking land into trust for the tribe.
in the following year,while the challenges were still pending,the supreme court issued its decision in carcieri salazar.in carcieri,the court held that only tribes under federal jurisdiction when the law was passed in are eligible to avail themselves of the entrustment procedures.id.at.the district court in the litigation now before us accordingly remanded these cases to the department for an initial determination of whether the oneidas were under federal jurisdiction in.new york salazar,cv,wl,at.and,in december,the agency issued an addendum to its record of decision on the tribe entrustment request,ruling that the oneidas were indeed under federal jurisdiction in.at 
the government moved for summary judgment in both cases,asserting the legality of the decision under both the constitution and the applicable statutes,and its availability with respect to the tribe.the district court granted the motions.town of verona salazar,cv,wl,at,upstate citizens for equality jewell,cv,wl,at march.the court ruled that congress power under the indian commerce clause encompassed taking the land into trust for the tribe,and that principles of state sovereignty did not prevent the action.the court further held that new york consent to the entrustment was not needed because the federal government did not fully oust the state of jurisdiction over the entrusted lands,and therefore the constitution enclave clause was not implicated.jewell,wl,at.the court rejected the verona plaintiffs argument that the federal government could not take land into trust for the tribe because the oneidas had opted out of qualifying for that remedy in.salazar,wl,at.and the court held that plaintiff upstate citizens for equality uce lacked standing to dispute the legitimacy of the tribe leadership in the context of its legal attack on the decision.jewell,wl,at.
the instant appeals followed.
discussion 
plaintiffs challenge the secretary decision to take land into trust on behalf of the oneida tribe of new york as violative of the constitution,the indian removal act,and the indian land consolidation act.we review de novo the district court rejection of those legal arguments on summary judgment.see citizens against casino gambling in erie cty.chaudhuri,cir.
as a threshold matter,the government contends that plaintiff uce lacks standing to challenge the decision on appeal because it has dropped some of the claims it pursued before the district court,where its standing was undisputed 
standing is an irreducible constitutional minimum that must be satisfied for a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a case.chabad lubavitch of litchfield,litchfield historic dist.comm n,cir.quoting lujan defs.of wildlife.to establish standing,a plaintiff must show that it suffered an injury in fact,a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,and that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan,at internal quotation marks omitted.an injury in fact consists of an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
uce asserts that it has standing to challenge the secretary action based on harms that it contends are or will be caused to its members by the tribe assertion of jurisdiction over the entrusted land.among other harms,its complaint asserts that the casino continued operation on the entrusted land will cause its members loss of enjoyment of the aesthetic and environmental qualities of the agricultural land surrounding the casino site,loss of tax revenue currently generated by the agricultural land that comprises the casino site,and the loss of business and recreational opportunities,such as retail stores and restaurants,that will be forced out by the casino.uce first am.compl.iii.as relief it seeks,among other remedies,an injunction requiring the government to take enforcement action against unlawfully operating casinos presumably including turning stone.id.vi.
the government argues that these alleged injuries no longer confer standing on uce because the group has now abandoned its claim that the turning stone casino operates in violation of the indian gaming regulatory act igra on appeal,uce challenges only the secretary decision to take land into trust on behalf of the tribe.the casino operation will be lawful regardless of whether the underlying land is taken into trust,the government argues,and therefore uce lacks standing to pursue this appeal the casino operation on which uce asserted harms rest will be undisturbed no matter how the entrustment decision is resolved.
we disagree with the government that the lawfulness of the casino operations will not be affected by the result in this case.under the igra,turning stone is a class iii casino,meaning that it may offer a wide range of gaming activities.the igra allows class iii gaming activities to be conducted on indian lands,however,only if the activities are authorized by the governing body of the indian tribe having jurisdiction over such lands.d a i emphasis added.thus,as we recently observed,a ny tribe seeking to conduct gaming on land must have jurisdiction over that land.chaudhuri,at.jurisdiction,in this context,means tribal jurisdiction a combination of tribal and federal jurisdiction over land,to the exclusion with some exceptions of state jurisdiction.id.at see infra.
the supreme court has already rejected the tribe claim that it may exercise tribal jurisdiction over the turning stone land without the department first taking the land into trust on the tribe behalf.see sherrill,at.indeed,among the stated purposes of the department decision is to provid e a tribal land base and homeland that is subject to tribal sovereignty.record of decision,if the decision is reversed,the tribe will be stripped of tribal jurisdiction over the turning stone casino site,and the tribe operation of the casino may become unlawful.
because uce attack on the decision will have repercussions for the lawfulness of the turning stone casino operations,and because the organization has plausibly alleged that the casino operations cause them allegations that the government does not dispute,we conclude that uce has standing to pursue this appeal,and we turn to the merits of the parties substantive arguments.
ii.constitutionality of procedures 
scope of constitutional authority 
uce contends that the federal government lacks authority under the constitution to take this land into trust for the tribe pursuant to of the ira.their position is,primarily,that the indian commerce clause does not permit the federal government to take action with respect to tribes when that action would take place entirely within a single state 
uce argument is at odds with the supreme court longstanding general view that the federal government power under the constitution to legislate with respect to indian tribes is exceptionally broad.see united states lara,t he constitution grants congress broad general powers to legislate in respect to indian tribes,powers that we have consistently described as plenary and exclusive.quoting washington confederated bands and tribes of yakima nation,see also seminole tribe florida,t he states have been divested of virtually all authority over indian commerce and indian tribes.this expansive power has been understood to originate in two constitutional provisions the indian commerce clause,art.i,cl,and the treaty power,art.ii,cl.lara,at.thus,the central function of the indian commerce clause is to provide congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of indian affairs.cotton petroleum new mexico,emphasis added.the treaty power,pursuant to which the executive branch entered into treaties with indian tribes until,when congress prohibited the practice has been construed to give congress the related authority to legislate in furtherance of those treaties that were lawfully consummated.lara,at.congress has long used the powers arising under these provisions to legislate extensively in the matter of indian affairs,including with respect to tribal property rights.see,id.at see also cohen,handbook.
uce urges us to disregard that lengthy line of authority,however,and instead to import restrictions developed with respect to the interstate commerce clause into the indian commerce clause context.in particular,uce contends that congress plenary authority to legislate with respect to indian tribes analogous to congress power vis interstate commerce is limited to the regulation of trading activities that cross state borders.under uce theory,if an indian tribe lands are like the tribe located entirely within the boundaries of a single state,then that tribe is subject to state legislation only.
this argument has some superficial appeal.the two provisions are tightly intertwined in the constitutional text 
the congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.
const.art.i,cl.and some historical research suggests that the contemporaneous understanding may have been that congressional authority over indian affairs was not so expansive as the word plenary suggests.see adoptive couple baby girl,thomas,concurring arguing that ratifiers of constitution understood indian commerce clause to regulate only trade with indian tribes living beyond state borders robert natelson,original understanding of the indian commerce clause,denv,arguing that indian commerce clause confers power only to regulate trade with indian tribes.
but the supreme court has already rejected the proposed correspondence between the interstate and indian commerce clauses.in its decision in cotton petroleum,the court observed that the purpose of the interstate commerce clause was to maintain free trade among the states even in the absence of implementing federal legislation,whereas the purpose of the indian commerce clause was to provide congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of indian affairs.at.consistent with those purposes,the court explained,interstate commerce clause case law is premised on a structural understanding of the unique role of the states in our constitutional system that is not readily imported to cases involving the indian commerce clause.id.on this reasoning,the court concluded that the indian commerce clause does not contain an implicit interstate limitation.although justice thomas has urged a more restrictive reading of the clause in recent concurrences,see,adoptive couple,at thomas,concurring lara,at thomas,concurring,the supreme court majority has continued to adhere to the view that the indian commerce clause vests congress with plenary power over indian tribes and that this power is not delimited by state boundaries 
uce argues in the alternative that is unconstitutional because the acquisition of land for indian use is not a regulat ion of commerce within the meaning of the indian commerce clause.again,however,precedent deprives this argument of any traction.the supreme court has ruled that congress may purchase or exercise eminent domain over land within state boundaries as an exercise of its general constitutional power to regulate commerce.see monongahela navigation united states,cherokee nation kansas ry.further,the court has established that,when exercising indian commerce clause powers,the federal government may,by acquiring land for a tribe,divest a state of important aspects of its jurisdiction,even if a state previously exercised wholesale jurisdiction over the land and even if federal supervision over a tribe has not been continuous.united states john,limiting state criminal jurisdiction over reservation land see also cohen,handbook.we therefore reject this alternative argument as well.
state sovereignty 
both groups of plaintiffs contend that,even if permitted under congress broad indian commerce clause powers,the procedures violate underlying principles of state sovereignty when the federal government takes land into trust for an indian tribe,the state that previously exercised jurisdiction over the land cedes some of its authority to the federal and tribal governments.the parties disagree about whether,by implicitly requiring that cession,the entrustment unconstitutionally infringes on new york sovereign rights.
principles of state sovereignty do impose some limits on congress power,otherwise plenary,over indian affairs.thus,in seminole tribe florida,the supreme court considered whether congress could permit indian tribes to sue a state and its officials in federal court to enforce the state duty to negotiate with the tribe in good faith regarding a gambling compact.id.at.the state maintained that to allow such a remedy would violate the eleventh amendment directive that t he judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state.const.amend.xi.the court agreed even when the constitution vests in congress complete lawmaking authority over a particular area,the eleventh amendment prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against unconsenting states.seminole tribe,at.
the linchpin of the decision in seminole tribe,however,was the eleventh amendment express protection of the states from the exercise of federal judicial power.no equivalent constitutional provision shields the states exercise of jurisdiction over indian land within their borders.to the contrary,t he states inherent jurisdiction on reservations can of course be stripped by congress.nevada hicks,citing draper united states,see also creating exclusive federal and indian jurisdiction for criminal offenses committed in indian country.
the supreme court decision in united states john is instructive in this regard.john concerned whether the federal government,the mississippi state government,or both,had jurisdiction to prosecute a choctaw man for a violent crime committed against a on a choctaw reservation in mississippi.john,at.the dispute arose because the federal government had in the century removed many although not all of the choctaws from their traditional homeland in mississippi.id.at.following the removals,the state of mississippi exercised civil and criminal jurisdiction over the tribe former territory and those choctaws who remained there.id.at.decades later,in the,the federal government began to purchase land in mississippi for use by those remaining choctaws,eventually declaring that the land thus acquired would be held in the united states in trust for the tribe and proclaiming the land to be a reservation.id.at.despite the federal proclamation,mississippi claimed continuing criminal jurisdiction over the choctaw lands.id.at.
in an argument similar to that made by plaintiffs here although not framed precisely in terms of state sovereignty mississippi asserted that the federal government lacked the power to displace state criminal law authority over the new reservation lands.it contended that since the choctaws residing in mississippi have become fully assimilated into the political and social life of the state,and the federal government long ago abandoned its supervisory authority over these indians.id.at.as a result,mississippi urged,the state had established an irrevocable right to exercise criminal jurisdiction over the tribe former territory.id.
the supreme court conclusively rejected this argument.t he fact that federal supervision over the choctaws has not been continuous does not destroy the federal power to deal with them,it declared.id.at.because the land had once been set apart for the use of the indians as such,under the superintendence of the government,id.at,the federal government retained the power the court held to oust the state of criminal jurisdiction over the territory and to assert federal criminal jurisdiction there.id.at.
the court reasoning in united states john comports with its later favorable assessment albeit in dicta of the procedure and the procedure sensitiv ity to the complex interjurisdictional concerns that arise when land is transferred from state to tribal authority.sherrill,at.we therefore conclude that underlying principles of state sovereignty do not impair the federal government power under the ira to acquire land on behalf of the tribe even if,by doing so,new york governmental power over that land is diminished.
c.the enclave clause 
plaintiffs final constitutional challenge rests on text that is known as the enclave clause.this rarely invoked constitutional provision provides that congress has the following power 
to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever,over such district as may become the seat of the government of the united states,and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be,for the erection of forts,magazines,arsenals,and other needful buildings.
const.art i,cl.the clause is intended to ensure that places on which the security of the entire union may depend are not in any degree dependent on a particular member of it.fort leavenworth lowe,quoting the federalist james madison.plaintiffs argue that,in its essence,the clause requires congress to obtain the state legislature express consent as it typically does when establishing a military base in a state,for example before it can take state land into trust for indians.although in deciding whether to take land into trust,the department of the interior must take into account the effects of the entrustment on state and local government,see,neither the ira nor its associated regulations currently require the state express consent to the entrustment.
case law construing the clause instructs that state consent is needed only when the federal government takes exclusive jurisdiction over land within a state.see paul united states.exclusive jurisdiction for enclave clause purposes is equivalent to the sweeping power that congress exerts over the district of columbia,the first subject of the clause.id.after exclusive jurisdiction is assumed,state laws have no effect on the federal enclave see pacific coast dairy,dep t of agric.of.but federal control is not exclusive and state consent is not needed when the state in which the federal property sits is,for instance,free to enforce its criminal and civil laws on those lands.kleppe new mexico.
when land is taken into trust by the federal government for indian tribes,the federal government does not obtain such categorically exclusive jurisdiction over the entrusted lands.see surplus trading cook,indian reservation is not federal enclave because state civil and criminal laws still apply to see also carcieri kempthorne,cir.enclave clause does not bar application of ira procedures,rev on other grounds,carcieri,at.states retain some civil and criminal authority on reservations,subject to the caveat that in exercising that authority they may not infringe on the right of reservation indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.fisher dist.court of sixteenth judicial dist.of,per curiam.states may,for instance,require indians to collect state sales taxes on goods sold on the reservation to nonmembers.washington confederated tribes of colville indian reservation.also,their agents may enter the reservation to execute a search warrant related to conduct.hicks,at 
state jurisdiction is thus only reduced,and not eliminated,when the federal government takes land into trust for a tribe.because federal and indian authority do not wholly displace state authority over land taken into trust pursuant to of the ira,the enclave clause poses no barrier to the entrustment that occurred here.
iii.tribe eligibility for procedures 
plaintiffs remaining arguments challenge the government interpretation of the terms indians and tribe in the ira and related statutes.in their view,the oneida indians of new york are not a tribe eligible to be the beneficiary of land taken into trust by the united states,both because they are excluded from the benefits of the ira by the terms of that statute,and because the language of the indian land consolidation act does not reach them.
definitions of tribe 
we begin by reviewing the applicable statutes.as noted above,of the ira authorizes the secretary of the interior to acquire land in trust for the purpose of providing land for indians.the statute defines indians for purposes of this section as all persons of indian descent who are members of any recognized indian tribe now under federal jurisdiction it defines tribe as any indian tribe,organized band,pueblo,or the indians residing on one reservation.at the time of its enactment,tribes could opt out of the ira provisions,including,by vote at a special election.see.as we have mentioned,the oneidas did so in by a tribal vote.
in,however,acting in response to requests by tribes that had earlier opted out but since changed their views,congress overrode the tribes votes with the indian land consolidation act ilca,pub,stat.codified at,et.the ilca directs that of the ira shall apply to all tribes notwithstanding the provisions of section.emphasis added.the ilca further defines tribes as any indian tribe,band,group,pueblo,or community for which,or for the members of which,the united states holds lands in trust.
applicability of the ira to new york indians 
in plaintiffs view,congress did not intend in to make the new york indian tribes eligible for the procedures established by the ira.those procedures,they assert,were intended to remedy the specific effects of the allotment policy and in particular,the dawes act of the dawes act authorized the president to transfer ownership of indian tribal lands from the tribes to individual indians in allotments,in furtherance of the policy we described above.see stat.in,responding to the ill effects of the act,congress repudiated the allotment policy by adopting the ira and creating the procedures,giving the federal government a tool with which to reestablish tribal land holdings.see cohen,handbook c.
the oneidas lost their land not through the dawes act or the allotment policy,but rather through repeated land sales made by the tribe to new york state in violation of federal law.see sherrill,at.but nothing in the ira text limits its remedial reach to tribes affected by the dawes act.indeed,the ira definition of indians is notably it covers all persons of indian descent who are members of any recognized indian tribe now under federal jurisdiction.when congress intended to exclude a geographic area or a particular tribe from the statute reach,it did so explicitly.for example,the ira procedures by their terms do not apply to land in the territories,colonies,and insular possessions of the united states,except for the of alaska.it also excludes certain named indian tribes not including the oneidas from some of its provisions.id.that,in contrast,congress excluded neither new york nor any of its tribes from the statute reach implies that congress in fact intended the ira including to embrace new york and tribes located there,including the oneidas.see doe bin laden,cir.applying expressio unius est exclusio alterius canon of construction in declining to read additional exceptions into statute.we comfortably conclude that the ira unambiguously permits the united states to take land into trust for tribes unaffected by the dawes act,including tribes in new york.
in reaching this conclusion,we do not rely on the ira legislative history,but we note that so much of it as is available provides further confirmation of our conclusion.as uce points out in its brief,the new york indians were shut out of the ira provisions in an early draft of the bill.see hearings before the committee on indian affairs on,cong.statement of john collier,comm r of indian affairs.commissioner collier testified that the new york indians were omitted from the draft because they did not want land reform and their condition was entirely peculiar.id.but that provision was removed from the bill as unnecessary and inadvisable later in the legislative process and replaced with the voluntary procedure of,which was made available to all tribes.id.at.the legislative record is thus consistent with our conclusion,based on the text and scheme of the ira,see hess cohen slamowitz llp,cir,that the ira contains no implicit exclusion of the new york tribes.see doe chao.
effect of the ilca 
even if the ira as passed applied to the oneidas,plaintiffs argue,the ilca does not override votes except as to tribes for which,or for the members of which,the united states holds lands in trust.observing that the united states did not hold land in trust for the tribe in when the secretary made the decision,plaintiffs contend that the oneidas vote is still valid and that the tribe is therefore not eligible for the ira procedures.
the united states interprets the ira and the ilca differently.the government first contends that the tribes referred to in of the ilca overriding past votes should not be limited to groups meeting the narrowest definition of tribes presented in because that reading would incongruously undermine the ilca broad remedial purpose.section,it says,should instead be governed by the definition of tribes set forth in.it further asserts that its view is embraced by agency interpretations that are entitled to this court deference.see b dep t of the interior,office of the solicitor,the meaning of under federal jurisdiction for purposes of the indian reorganization act,at march,new york acting reg l,bd.of indian affairs,applying broader definition in context of related decision the government argues second and in the alternative that construing in light of a broader reading of would similarly restore the tribe eligibility for the procedures of.it rejects plaintiffs reading of and instead construes the last clause of to apply only to the word community.
deference to agency interpretations 
we first consider what,if any,deference we owe to the agency pronouncements presented in support of the first argument.we may defer to an agency interpretation of the statute it administers only if the statute is ambiguous in relevant part.estate of landers leavitt,cir.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,nat.res.def.council.an interpretive regulation qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.estate of landers,at.
the agency interpretations identified by the government as bearing on the question do not,upon closer examination,actually address the interplay of the definitions at issue here,even were we to consider them ambiguous.first,the united states contends that it has promulgated its view that s definition of tribe does not limit the effect of in a regulation adopted pursuant to statute and through rulemaking,see fed.reg,and therefore that the interpretation is entitled to chevron deference.see b defining tribe for purposes of regulation as any indian tribe,band,nation,pueblo,community,rancheria,colony,or other group of indians which is recognized by the secretary as eligible for the special programs and services from the bureau of indian affairs.this definition does not,however,purport to define the scope of the agency authority indeed,the next section of the agency regulations acknowledges that l and not held in trust or restricted status may only be acquired for an individual indian or a tribe in trust status when such acquisition is authorized by an act of congress.emphasis added.
the origins of the regulation further support our understanding that b does not interpret the effect of on the scope of the agency authority.the regulatory definition of tribe set forth in b has not changed since it was promulgated in,before the ilca passage in.see fed.reg.moreover,although the doi has amended the part land acquisition regulations on one occasion,in,that amendment did not affect b,and the doi has not revisited part regulations in light of.see land acquisitions,fed.reg,fed.reg.june.tellingly,in the record of decision,the doi seemed to rely on the language of itself,rather than on any regulation.no one disputes that,in,the government could not take land into trust for tribes that,like the oneidas,had opted out of the ira.accordingly,we decline to treat b as reflecting a statutory interpretation to which we owe deference.
second,we find similarly inapt the solicitor legal opinion of march and the decision of the interior board of indian appeals to which the government also points.both of these analyses focus on the meaning of under federal jurisdiction in the ira definitional provision and the effect of carcieri salazar,on the agency authority to take land into trust.see dep
