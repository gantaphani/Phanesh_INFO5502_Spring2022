background 
a.the accident 
on the day of the accident,farner and his two friends,shawn killebrew and chad white,went to fish at the fort loudoun dam reservation in eastern tennessee.they originally fished from the rocks along a portion of the riverbank well below where the turbines and the powerhouse are located.according to killebrew,they decided to proceed from their first location to a location that was closer to the dam because farner had caught fish there on a previous occasion.they had to go through a gap between a fence and the water edge in order to enter the upstream shoreline area,approximately yards from the dam.
at some point after they entered the upstream area,farner slipped and fell from the rocks into the swirling water and current created by the discharge of the water through the dam hydroelectric turbines.killebrew and white tried to rescue farner,with killebrew using a fishing pole and white leaving to get additional help.they were unable to save farner.by the time white returned with a police officer from the lenoir city police department,farner had drowned.the officer later stated that he tried to get the life ring that was nearby but the subject had moved into the turbulence and went underwater.
b.the physical layout of fort loudoun dam 
tva maintains and operates an integrated system of multipurpose dams on the tennessee river,one of which is fort loudoun dam.on the fort loudoun dam reservation,tva has provided a parking lot located on a bluff about yards downstream from the dam.this parking lot is used by members of the public who desire to fish from the riverbank at the base of the bluff.visitors can access the riverbank by using a sidewalk that leads down from the parking lot.another sidewalk extends upstream along the base of the bluff for approximately yards.at this point the sidewalk ends,with the shoreline becoming steep and rocky.
a fence extends from a high concrete wall to the vicinity of the water about yards from the dam.this fence replaced another fence that was in pieces on the rocks.according to a signed declaration by gary brock,the manager of navigation and structures engineering in tva river operations organization,the purpose of the fence was to help convey a warning message to persons proceeding up the shoreline that the area upstream of the fence is an area of increased danger.the declaration also stated that the fence was constructed so that a gap exists between the end of the fence and the water in order to avoid subject ing it to destruction by forces imposed upon it during,conditions.the length of the gap varies according to the water level.finally,brock declaration points out that the short section of the chain link which extends about three feet beyond the last fence post is not anchored but is flexible such that it can be pushed by persons seeking to go around the fence because of the,conditions which sometimes occurs in that location.
tva had posted numerous warning signs throughout the area near the dam.there are,for example,large billboards stating warning dangerous waters at the end of the parking lot nearest the dam and on the shore about yards from the dam.a large sign at the bottom of the sidewalk down the bluff declares that state law requires boaters to wear a life jacket from this point upstream to dam.smaller signs at various locations along the sidewalk at the base of the bluff and the rocky shoreline state danger water may rise rapidly without warning and state law requires boaters to wear life jacket in this area.finally,two warning signs are posted on the chain link fence,one stating danger keep out and the other stating restricted area keep out.
mounted in a box on the railing of the powerhouse transformer deck above the area where farner fell into the river was a circular floatation device a life preserver.this device,however,was not marked in any way,nor could it be seen by persons using the shoreline.

application of the discretionary function exemption 
tva is a corporate agency and instrumentality of the united states.hill united states dep t of labor,cir.one of tva functions as an instrumentality of the united states is the maintenance of an integrated system of multipurpose dams,including fort loudoun dam,on the tennessee river.see tennessee power tva.as provided for in the tva act,tva m ay sue or be sued in its corporate name.b.courts have interpreted this language as making the tva liable to suit in tort,subject to certain exceptions.united states smith,d citing cases from the sixth and eleventh circuits.
