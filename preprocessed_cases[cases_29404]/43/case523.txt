frederick douglas,an employee of the department of housing and urban development hud,argues he was discriminated against when his department head failed to recommend him for a highly coveted award.because this is not an adverse employment action,we affirm summary judgment in favor of hud.
a presidential rank award,as measured by purse and prestige,is the highest recognition given to federal senior executives career employees.see.there are two types of presidential rank awards meritorious executive,for sustained accomplishment,or distinguished executive,for sustained extraordinary accomplishment.c.the number of awards given annually is tightly restricted and the financial benefits are substantial 
the presidential rank award process is labyrinthine,with numerous ways to fail,but only one to succeed.an eligible executive must be recommended by his agency within hud,department heads recommend employees to hud performance review board prb,which evaluates the candidates and then forwards a slate of prospective nominations to hud deputy secretary and secretary,least which candidates will be recommended to the office of personnel management opm.opm review s such recommendations and provide s to the president recommendations as to which of the agency recommended appointees should receive such rank.id.b.the president of the united states makes the final call.
in,douglas,a black male,became hud deputy assistant secretary for single family housing,a senior executive position.in november,assistant secretary for housing john weicher,douglas department head,transferred him to a different department.in december,douglas learned that weicher had not recommended him for a presidential rank award.instead,weicher recommended margaret young,a white female,who received an award.
after hud denied relief,douglas sued under title vii,alleging he was discriminated against on the basis of race when weicher failed to recommend him for a presidential rank award.the district court granted summary judgment to hud,ruling that douglas did not suffer an adverse employment action.douglas appeals our review is de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.tao freeh.
in order to present a viable claim of employment discrimination under title vii,a plaintiff must show he suffered an adverse employment action.see,ginger dist.of columbia.an adverse employment action is a significant change in employment status,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing significant change in benefits.taylor small,quoting burlington,ellerth,d.an employee must experience materially adverse consequences affecting the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment or future employment opportunities such that a reasonable trier of fact could find objectively tangible harm.forkkio powell,see also holcomb powell,distinguishing between purely subjective injuries which are not actionable,and objectively tangible harm,which is.further,a tangible employment action in most cases inflicts direct economic harm.burlington,at.emphasis added.thus,not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse action.russell principi.
because significant and objectively tangible harm is required,performance evaluations ordinarily are not actionable under title vii t he result of an evaluation is often speculative,making it difficult to remedy.for example,a single poor evaluation may drastically limit an employee chances for advancement,or it may be outweighed by later evaluations and be of no real consequence.id.see also taylor,at f ormal criticism or poor performance evaluations are not necessarily adverse actions and they should not be considered such if they did not affect the employee grade or salary.on the other hand,a bonus is a tangible,quantifiable award,more analogous to one salary or to a benefit of one employment than to a performance evaluation.it has a more direct,measurable,and immediate effect,meaning the denial of even a purely discretionary bonus can be actionable.russell,at.at the same time,however,if an employee is denied the opportunity to compete for a promotion,she has suffered an adverse employment action we do not inquire whether she would have received the position but for the discrimination.see cones shalala.thus,under our precedent,in some cases we consider whether any alleged harm is speculative,but we do not always do so.
the distinction between cases in which,to establish an adverse employment action,we consider the speculativeness of the harm and those in which we do not reflects the difference between a categorical presumption and a causation requirement.although we do not categorically reject a particular personnel action as nonadverse simply because it does not fall into a cognizable type,holcomb,at,we have described an adverse employment action as a significant change in employment status,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing significant change in benefits.taylor,at quoting burlington,at.emphasis added.the first four examples hiring,firing,failing to promote,and reassignment with significantly different responsibilities all relate to one work responsibilities and position,and are categorically phrased.although there may be subjective elements to all of these decisions,it is obvious that each significantly changes an employee status.consequently,under our caselaw,employment decisions of this type are conclusively presumed to be adverse employment actions,even if any alleged harm is speculative.see,cones,at.
on the other hand,some actions do not obviously cause a significant change in employment status.the last example of an adverse employment action discussed in taylor a decision causing significant change in benefits alone requires an employee to explain how the employer action harmed his employment status.for employment actions that do not obviously result in a significant change in employment as giving a poor performance evaluation,reassigning office space and equipment,or,for that matter,fielding a company softball employee must go the further step of demonstrating how the decision nonetheless caused such an objectively tangible harm.as russell indicates,this additional step which,by the way,is not newly minted,dis.op.at,as illustrated by russell itself requires us to consider whether the alleged harm is unduly speculative.showing that harm is not speculative need not be a difficult task,and it often is not.for example,a benefit such as a,by logical extension,a pay objectively tangible because it has a direct,measurable,and immediate effect upon the employee compensation.russell,at.by parity of reasoning,the loss of a bonus or of a raise likewise has such an effect.other changes in benefits,however,do not have such a straightforward effect upon employment status.for example,under russell,the effect of a poor evaluation is ordinarily too speculative to be actionable.see id.at.if,however,that evaluation determines the bonus,as in russell,id.at,and weber battista,then the employee may show the evaluation caused an objectively tangible harm.
the presidential rank award recognizes extraordinary performance.it is not earned in the ordinary course of employment for adequate or even superior work or for meeting or exceeding established goals.instead,it is intended to reward outstanding leadership and star qualities that are by their very nature subjective.see c meritorious executive award for sustained accomplishment and distinguished executive award for sustained extraordinary accomplishment.failure to make the cut for such an award can not be deemed a significant change in responsibilities nor would elimination from the competition affect employment opportunities in an objectively tangible way.therefore,unlike failure to be promoted,failure to be recommended for a presidential rank award is not categorically an adverse employment action.
moreover,the inherent uncertainty in the presidential rank award process means there can be no direct tie between a nomination and an award.a departmental recommendation is but a single point in the assessment,one cog in a complex machine.as observed by the district court,of the candidates nominated by their department heads in,only sixteen ultimately received an award.in fact,douglas himself was recommended but not selected in.because of the many moving parts involved in selecting a presidential rank award multiple rounds of independent evaluation both inside and outside of hud,with a final decision by the if weicher had recommended douglas,it is quite uncertain whether the president ultimately would have selected douglas to receive an award,rendering any harm from the failure to recommend speculative and difficult to remedy.russell,at.because a recommendation for a presidential rank award does not automatically or even consistently lead to receipt of one,neither russell nor weber aids douglas.
in an attempt to escape this reasoning,douglas cites griffin washington convention center.but the adverse employment action in griffin was obvious termination.the dispute on appeal was what evidence was appropriate to establish an inference of discrimination,id.at discussing whether the bias of a decision maker subordinate is admissible in a suit challenging a decision to fire an employee,a wholly separate question than the one at issue here,namely,whether douglas suffered an adverse employment action when weicher did not recommend him for a presidential rank award.douglas also argues that whether weicher failure to recommend him resulted in douglas not receiving an award should be deemed a question of fact,not law,he contends the refusal to recommend was an adverse employment action,and a jury should decide if that action harmed douglas.however,under douglas logic,a performance evaluation alone could also be adverse employment action,with a jury deciding whether the evaluation,in fact,harmed the employee.we rejected that notion in russell.
douglas finally cites cones.there we held an employer refusal to allow an employee to compete for a job could be actionable because the refusal to advertise the position competitively was tantamount to refusing to promote him,and failure to promote can be an adverse employment action.cones,at.douglas argues that weicher was tantamount to a denial of a bonus,and thus was also an adverse employment action.
we disagree with this extension of cones.unlike being considered for a promotion,the question at issue in that case,being recommended less extraordinary distinction of a presidential rank award is not an ordinary expectation of employment.indeed,as explained above,under our precedent failure to be promoted categorically is an adverse employment action,meaning unlike with other types of employer decisions such as giving a negative performance evaluation,we do not consider whether any alleged harm is unduly speculative.with this distinction in mind,cones should be understood as closing a potential loophole in title vii.it established that agencies may not prevent minority employees from advancing to higher positions simply by refusing to open positions to competition and laterally transferring higher ranked.but that unobjectionable proposition can not be read to support douglas much broader argument that a title vii plaintiff has an actionable claim whenever he was not selected to move to the next level of competition for any award accompanied by a prize,even if entitlement is not objectively ascertainable and the decisionmaking is unavoidably subjective.see holcomb,at explaining that although employment actions need not fall into cognizable categories to be considered adverse,cones does not abrogate the requirement that a plaintiff must show an action constituted objectively tangible harm.the mere failure to be nominated for such a lofty and rare distinction is insufficient to establish an adverse employment action under title vii.
in any event,cones is inapposite because the decision whether to promote an employee is made by an employer the most objective criteria,see aka.hosp,en banc acknowledging limited role for an employer subjective considerations but also noting jury could reasonably find that the plaintiff was otherwise significantly better qualified than the successful applicant notwithstanding use of subjective criteria it is therefore unremarkable that an employer decision to foreclose competition for a promotion may be actionable.here,by contrast,hud never decides who receives a presidential rank president does,based on subjective criteria.douglas,however,can not sue the president under title vii because he is not douglas employer.see c.on the other hand,in cones,the same entity,cones employer,decided whom to hire,as well as whom to interview,and how the hiring process would be conducted,making it unremarkable that cones could bootstrap the agency failure to allow him to compete to the agency failure to promote him.not so with the presidential rank award,where congress,by statute,has created a decisionmaking process that includes both those inside and outside of an agency,with the final decision being made by the president.thus cones tells us nothing about the loss of opportunity to compete for consideration by the president,whose unfettered discretion in selecting presidential rank award recipients would not be subject to review under title vii.because the ultimate decision to give a presidential rank award is unconstrained by objective criteria and beyond the reach of title vii,weicher decision to not recommend douglas is also beyond that reach 
finally,a few words about the dissent.though we share his revulsion for racial animus,the secret memo scenario,apparently consequential to our colleague,is not unique to douglas case,but could be offered in any case where the requirement of an adverse employment action has not been satisfied.if,for example,discovery unearthed a memo stating a supervisor would never give a black person a positive performance evaluation and if the administrative conciliation process failed to offer relief,our precedent holds that such an evaluation would not be deemed an adverse employment action unless it affect ed the employee grade or salary.taylor,at.in this regard,our colleague quarrel is not with us,but with the adverse employment action requirement itself.we let him fight that battle alone.
likewise,while conceding that some harms are not adverse employment actions,such as those threatened by negative performance evaluations,the dissent seems to suggest without saying so directly that russell was wrongly decided,or at least that it should be read narrowly,more as a statistical blip than a doctrinal principle.dis.op.at.we think the court in russell was correct.just as the harm resulting from a single performance evaluation viewed in isolation is speculative,weber,at,so too is it speculative whether douglas would have received a presidential rank award had he been recommended.douglas can not show he suffered an objectively tangible harm because he can not show that losing the opportunity to compete significantly changed his employment status.the same can not be said of the loss of opportunity to compete for a promotion under our caselaw decisions relating to one work responsibilities and position like hiring,firing,failing to promote,and reassignment with significantly different responsibilities categorically are adverse employment actions.taylor,at quoting burlington,at.hence,the dissent just gets it wrong in both precedent and principle,there is a meaningful distinction between eliminating an employee from consideration for the presidential rank award and eliminating her from consideration for a promotion or job opening.
as douglas can not show he suffered an adverse employment action,we affirm the grant of summary judgment 
so ordered.
imagine that discovery in this case had turned up a memo from frederick douglas former supervisor,john weicher,expressly stating that he would never nominate a black person for the presidential rank award.under this court disqualification from competing for a lucrative employment award is not an adverse employment would have no recourse to title vii even in the face of such direct evidence of discriminatory intent.because this result can not be squared with title vii,and because there is no principled difference between the hypothetical case and douglas with respect to the only issue we address weicher rejection of douglas qualifies as an adverse employment respectfully dissent.
it is true that not everything that makes an employee unhappy is actionable under title vii.op.at quoting russell principi.indeed,even given an openly discriminatory memo,douglas would be unable to sustain a title vii discrimination claim for a p urely subjective injur y,such as dissatisfaction with a reassignment,or public humiliation or loss of reputation,forkkio powell,citation omitted,or for a negative performance evaluation unconnected to a financial or other benefit,op.at.but weicher rejection of douglas as a contender for the presidential rank award was far more tangible than any of these merely definitively closed douglas only available door to an award equal to percent of his salary.thus when douglas lost the opportunity to compete for this valuable award,he experienced materially adverse consequences affecting the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment such that a reasonable trier of fact could find objectively tangible harm,forkkio,at.
to be sure,we have recognized that some harms,such as those threatened by negative performance evaluations standing alone,may be too speculative to constitute adverse employment actions.see op.at citing russell,at.the reasoning underlying that principle,though entirely correct where applicable,has nothing to do with this case.as we explained in russell principi the result of an evaluation is often speculative,making it difficult to remedy.for example,a single poor evaluation may drastically limit an employee chances for advancement,or it may be outweighed by later evaluations and be of no real consequence.at.in this case,by contrast,we need speculate at all as to the negative consequences of weicher rejection of douglas candidacy.it represented the final word,irremediably foreclosing douglas from competing for the award.see appellee br.conceding that the took douglas out of the running for the award.unlike a single poor evaluation,which merely adds to the overall mix of information in an employee personnel file,russell,at,weicher rejection had the direct and immediate effect of terminating douglas chances for a substantial monetary award.no future action could mitigate this adverse impact and render the rejection of no real consequence,id.
the proper analogy is thus not to a negative performance evaluation,but rather to excluding a candidate from the selection process for a promotion or a job opening,either of which would qualify as an adverse employment action.like hiring and promotions,the presidential rank award involves a formalized,selection process for a specific,tangible employment significant sum of money.this case is thus much like cones shalala,where we held that refusing to allow an employee to compete for a job opening qualified as an adverse employment action without regard to how likely it was that the employee would actually be hired.we neither asked how many other individuals would have applied for the job nor required the employee to show that he would automatically have been the successful candidate.we simply reasoned that refusing to allow an employee to compete for a benefit is tantamount to refusing to grant the benefit.id.so too here.refusing to allow douglas to compete for the presidential rank award was tantamount to refusing the award.
seeking to avoid the obvious implications of cones for this case,the court attempts to distinguish the presidential rank award selection process from selection processes for hiring and promotions.relying on language in burlington industries,ellerth a tangible employment action for purposes of vicarious liability constitutes a significant change in employment status,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits,d the court says there is a difference between actions related to one work responsibilities and position like hiring,firing,failing to promote,and reassignment,and decisions causing a significant change in benefits.op.at.according to the court,actions in the first,firing,failing to promote,and reassignment are conclusively presumed to be adverse employment actions,even if any alleged harm is speculative,id.at,as are decisions relating to such actions,like the refusal to allow an employee to compete for a promotion in cones,op.at.for the second category,however,the court offers up a strict causation requirement applicable only to employment benefits a decision causing a significant change in benefits alone requires an employee to explain how the employer action harmed his employment status,id.at.under this new rule,for decisions such as refusal to hire or promote that cause an employee to lose out on a better job,rejected candidates need show only that they were eliminated at some point in the process.by contrast,for decisions that cause an employee to lose out on an employment benefit,rejected candidates apparently must now prove that they would have ultimately received the benefit had they not been eliminated at an earlier stage of competition.because receiving the presidential rank award represents a change in benefits rather than a change in work responsibilities or position,id.at,the court concludes that denial of the opportunity to compete for the award does qualify as an adverse employment action unless the employee can show that he would have otherwise received the award,id.at.
the distinction the court draws fails to hold up.the court nowhere explains why actions related to one work responsibilities and position,id.at,fall more squarely under title vii ban on discrimination in compensation,terms,conditions or privileges of employment,a,than do actions related to,for example,work hours,vacation time,bonuses,or any other employment benefit.see george leavitt,explaining that the title vii provision governing federal employers,a,is construed in terms of the provision governing private employers,a.nor is it clear whether the court means to include all employment benefits in its disfavored category now subject to the causation requirement.the court seems to place pay and bonuses in the benefits category.op.at.but why surely pay directly relate s to one position,so why would pay decisions,just like promotion decisions,categorically qualify as adverse employment actions without regard to how speculative the ultimate harm for that matter,why does the presidential rank award also relate to one work responsibilities and position after all,the award is based on an employee achievements in carrying out his work responsibilities and is calculated as a percentage of the salary for his position.
in any event,regardless of where the court draws the line,burlington industries provides no support for treating benefits differently from position and work responsibilities.every item on burlington industries list refers to the end result sought a new job,retention of one job,a promotion,or a decision causing a significant change in the president decision to award a substantial sum of money.if definitively barring a candidate from consideration for one of these desired outcomes constitutes an adverse employment the court acknowledges with respect to barring a candidate from consideration for any of them does.
not only does the court distinction find no support in burlington industries,but it makes no sense.for example,suppose an employer asks line supervisors to nominate candidates for one available vacancy and separately for one available bonus.now suppose a line supervisor refuses to nominate a minority employee for either the promotion or the bonus,and two white employees are ultimately chosen.under the court causation requirement the minority employee has suffered an adverse employment action as to the promotion but not as to the bonus.the minority employee would now have a title vii claim related to the bonus only if she could show that had the line
