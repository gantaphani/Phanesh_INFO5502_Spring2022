the pechanga band of the luiseño mission indians pechanga tribe disenrolled a number of its members appellants for failing to prove their lineal descent as members of the tribe.federal courts generally lack jurisdiction to consider any appeal from the decision of an indian tribe to disenroll one of its members.see santa clara pueblo martinez,d.appellants,therefore,brought this petition for habeas corpus under of the indian civil rights act icra,claiming their disenrollment by members of the pechanga tribal council appellees was tantamount to an unlawful detention.despite the novelty of this approach,we nonetheless lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider this claim,because appellants were not detained.we hold that appellants can not bring their claims under of the icra and therefore affirm the district court.
background 
the pechanga tribe is a indian tribe.the tribe ultimate governing authority consists of all of the adult members of the tribe general membership.on december,the pechanga tribe adopted the constitution and bylaws of the temecula tribe of luisenño mission indians pechanga constitution.article ii of the pechanga constitution provides 
membership is an enrolled member documented in the band official enrollment book of.
qualifications for membership of the temecula band of luiseno mission indians are 
applicant must show proof of lineal descent from original pechanga temecula people.
adopted people,family or band,and can not be enrolled.exception people who were accepted in the indian way prior to will be accepted.
c.if you have ever been enrolled or recognized in any other reservation you can not enroll in pechanga.
at issue here is subsection a,requiring applicants to show proof of lineal descent from original pechanga temecula people.in late and early,the enrollment committee received information from its members alleging that a number of pechanga tribe members were not lineal descendants from the original pechanga temecula people.therefore,according to the pechanga enrollment disenrollment procedure disenrollment procedures,the enrollment committee was required to investigate the allegations.allegations surrounded five lines of descent that allegedly did not qualify for membership under the pechanga constitution.
according to the pechanga disenrollment procedure,disenrollment is revoking a person membership when it is found that they do not meet the requirements set forth on the enrollment application which was approved by the band.the disenrollment procedures were adopted by the pechanga tribe to correct mistakes that resulted when tribal membership was mistakenly approved and to provide a process that would allow a fair hearing in the disenrollment procedure.under the disenrollment procedures,the enrollment committee initiates a disenrollment process against those individuals allegedly not qualifying for membership in the tribe.after the initiation of the disenrollment,the enrollment committee must provide adequate notice to the individual to be summoned to a meeting with the enrollment committee.the notice must state that the enrollment committee has questions regarding enrollment stress the importance of responding to the notice and request a meeting within thirty days of the response.unless the person receiving the notice chooses to be automatically disenrolled,he or she must respond.once a response has been filed,the enrollment committee has thirty days to set up a meeting.at that meeting,the enrollment committee must show specific evidence that would prove that the documentation provided for enrollment does not provide evidence of lineal descent.if the enrollment committee provides such evidence,the individual then is allowed another thirty days to provide additional information to prove her or his lineal descent.if the individual provides further evidence that satisfies the enrollment committee as to his lineal descent,the process is terminated and the individual keeps his or her membership status.if the enrollment committee is not satisfied by the further evidence,the individual will be disenrolled and the tribal council is notified of the disenrollment.
if the enrollment committee fails to follow these steps or is negligent in any way,the individual can appeal to the tribal council for a fair hearing.at the hearing,the tribal council only reviews the documentation that the enrollment committee reviewed.the individual is not entitled to legal representation at the hearing.if the tribal council finds there was an error,the enrollment committee reevaluates the case.if the appeal is successful,membership will be reinstated.
disenrollment does not mean that a person is banished from the pechanga reservation.the pechanga tribe instead has specific procedures for exclusion and eviction.these requirements are set forth in the exclusion and eviction regulations.under these regulations,the pechanga tribe may exclude and or evict someone from the reservation for v iolating tribal laws and ordinances c reating conditions which pose a threat to the public health,safety and welfare e ngaging in criminal activities on the pechanga reservation,by finding of the tribal council,or being convicted of one or more felony crimes b eing declared a public nuisance by the tribal council or c reating a breach of peace,including but not limited to public drunkenness.the exclusion and eviction regulations dictate the procedure to evict and or exclude and the opportunity to appeal such exclusion.
in early,the enrollment committee began addressing the allegations regarding the lineal descent of certain members.on march,the tribal council issued a notice and order regarding pending disenrollment matters.the notice and order mandated that the enrollment committee use a fair and impartial decision by a majority of the committee to review a file follow robert rules of order and allow adequate time for presentation of evidence as required under the disenrollment procedures.
sometime before march,the enrollment committee determined that the first three lines of descent met the membership criteria.then it turned its attention to those members who claimed a lineal descent through paulina hunter.on may,after a proper vote,the enrollment committee summoned appellants and notified them that the enrollment committee believed there were grounds to initiate the disenrollment process.the summonses notified appellants that the disenrollment procedures had been initiated,requested additional information concerning appellants family history,and notified appellants that they were required to set up an initial meeting with the enrollment committee.
meetings were held with appellants in june of.the enrollment committee provided appellants with a copy of all factual records in its possession.the enrollment committee then stated its concerns about each appellant claim of lineal descent.appellants were also notified that they had thirty days to submit information supporting their claim of lineal descent.the enrollment committee emphasized that appellants enrollment would be measured by the pechanga constitution requirements.the enrollment committee advised each appellant that no decision would be made until it received all additional information.
on march,the enrollment committee after review of the full record disenrolled appellants for failure to prove lineal descent from an original pechanga temecula person.appellants exercised their right to appeal to the tribal council.the tribal council held hearings on july.the tribal council affirmed the enrollment committee,finding there was no evidence of unfair or partial treatment of appellants by the enrollment committee there was no evidence of negligence in the handling of appellants case by the enrollment committee and there was insufficient proof that the enrollment committee violated the disenrollment procedures.
appellants then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the central district of california.appellants moved for summary judgment.appellees filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,claiming that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.the district court granted the motion to dismiss.appellants appealed the district court decision here.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under rule b.carson harbor village,city of carson,cir.we also review de novo a district court denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus under the icra.selam warm springs tribal corr.facility,cir.
ordinarily,federal courts lack jurisdiction to consider an appeal from the decision of an indian tribe to disenroll one of its members.a tribe right to define its own membership for tribal purposes has long been recognized as central to its existence as an independent political community.santa clara pueblo,at.cherokee intermarriage cases.because of this precedent,appellants did not directly appeal the tribe decision.instead,they petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus under the icra to collaterally challenge their disenrollment.
section of the icra provides the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall be available to any person,in a court of the united states,to test the legality of his detention by order of an indian tribe.the term detention in the statute must be interpreted similarly to the in custody requirement in other habeas contexts.see moore nelson,cir there is no reason to conclude that the requirement of detention set forth in the indian civil rights act is any more lenient than the requirement of custody set forth in the other habeas statutes.citation omitted.therefore,an icra habeas petition is only proper when the petitioner is in custody.id.at explaining the custody requirement.
we have also held that a litigant must first exhaust tribal remedies before properly bringing a petition for writ of habeas corpus.selam,at explaining the exhaustion requirement see also felix cohen,handbook of federal indian law.even when a federal court has jurisdiction over a claim,if the claim arises in indian country,the court is required to stay its hand until the party has exhausted all available tribal remedies.cohen,handbook of federal indian law citing iowa mut.ins.laplante,d farmers union ins.crow tribe,d.the supreme court policy of nurturing tribal selfgovernment strongly discourages federal courts from assuming jurisdiction over unexhausted claims.selam,at.there is authority for relaxing the exhaustion requirement where the party can show that exhaustion would be futile or that tribal courts offer no adequate remedy.see id.at.
therefore,all federal courts addressing the issue mandate that two prerequisites be satisfied before they will hear a habeas petition filed under the irca the petitioner must be in custody,and the petitioner must first exhaust tribal remedies.cohen,handbook of federal indian law.we therefore have no jurisdiction to hear a petitioner claim for habeas corpus,unless both of these conditions are met.
additionally,some courts have further imposed a third requirement that the tribal proceeding be criminal and not civil see,quair sisco quair i,d,alire jackson,d,see also cohen,handbook of federal indian law noting that while custody and exhaustion are prerequisites before a reviewing court will hear a habeas petition,courts have struggled with whether there is also a third requirement that the proceedings be criminal in nature.
appellants do not meet the requirements for the court to have jurisdiction under of the icra.
appellants were not custody.
appellants contend that the actual restraints,the potential restraints,and their lost pechanga identity all amount to detention under.we do not agree.
appellants contend that,because they have been denied access to the senior citizens center,can not go to the health clinic,and their children can no longer go to tribal school,they have been detained.we disagree.jones cunningham requires that conditions and restrictions significantly restrain one liberty in order to invoke jurisdiction,d.the second circuit has said that under jones and its progeny,a severe actual or potential restraint on liberty is necessary for jurisdiction under.see poodry tonawanda band of seneca indians,cir see also shenandoah halbritter,d,quoting poodry for the same proposition.we agree with our colleagues on the second circuit and hold that does require a severe actual or potential restraint on liberty.poodry,at.
in the case before us,the denial of access to certain facilities does not pose a severe actual or potential restraint on the appellants liberty.appellants have not been banished from the reservation.appellants have never been arrested,imprisoned,fined,or otherwise held by the tribe.appellants have not been evicted from their homes or suffered destruction of their property.no personal restraint other than access to these facilities has been imposed on them as a result of the tribe actions.their movements have not been restricted on the reservation.faced with a similar situation,the second circuit also determined that less severe restraints such as loss of one voice in the community,loss of health insurance,loss of access to tribal health and recreation facilities,loss of quarterly distributions to tribal members,and loss of one place on the membership roles of the tribe are simply insufficient to bring plaintiffs within the icra habeas provision.shenandoah of interior,cir.
appellants contend that the denial of access to these facilities is similar to the restraint found in poodry.this is not poodry.in poodry,the petitioners were convicted of treason,sentenced to permanent banishment,and permanently lost any and all rights afforded to tribal members.see poodry,at.appellants have not been convicted,sentenced,or permanently banished.we therefore hold that the limitation of appellants access to certain tribal facilities does not amount to a detention.
appellants contend that,as of the tribe,they are under a continuing threat of.no court has held that such a threat is sufficient to satisfy the detention requirement of.
the custody requirement of the habeas corpus statute is designed to preserve the writ of habeas corpus as a remedy for severe restraints on individual liberty.since habeas corpus is an extraordinary remedy whose operation is to a large extent uninhibited by traditional rules of finality and federalism,its use has been limited to cases of special urgency,leaving more conventional remedies for cases in which the restraints on liberty are neither severe nor immediate.
hensley mun.court,d.applying this principle,we previously held that a threat of confinement is not severe nor immediate enough to justify the remedy.edmunds won bae chang,cir denying habeas relief under.in edmunds,the petitioner was subject to a fine,which could be enforced by jail time.id.at.the court held,however,that until confinement is imminent like the confinement in hensley there can be no justification for use of the habeas corpus remedy.id.we see no reason not to analogize to the court construction of the criminal habeas corpus provisions in edmunds.therefore,we hold that the potential threat of future eviction is not sufficient to satisfy the detention requirement of.
appellants argue that,while no such procedures have been commenced to exclude or evict appellants,there is a potential that they could be excluded.under the pechanga reservation access and rental ordinance a ccess to and residency within the reservation is a privilege which may be granted or denied to an individual upon proper authority of the pechanga band.however,the pechanga tribe enacted exclusion and eviction regulations that provide a process for eviction in an effort to protect law and order on the reservation and to provide uniform procedures for exclusion and eviction.these provisions apply equally to those who have been disenrolled and those who are current members of the tribe.appellants admit they have never been subjected to exclusion or eviction proceedings.
appellants lastly contend that disenrollment,stripping them of their pechanga citizenship,is enough of a significant restraint on their liberty to constitute a detention.while we have the most sympathy for this argument,we find no precedent for the proposition that disenrollment alone is sufficient to be considered detention under.while congress authority over indian matters is extraordinarily broad the role of courts in adjusting relations between and among tribes and their members is correspondingly restrained.santa clara pueblo,at.further,a tribe right to define its own membership for tribal purposes has long been recognized as central to its existence as an independent political community.id.at.citing roff burney.cherokee intermarriage cases.thus while congress may have authority in these matters in the complete absence of precedent,we can not involve the courts in these disputes.
this court is without jurisdiction to review direct appeals of tribal decisions regarding disenrollment of members.see,santa clara pueblo,at.we can not circumvent our lack of jurisdiction over these matters by expanding the scope of the writ of habeas corpus to cover the exact same subject matter.at its heart,this case is a challenge to disenrollment of certain members by the tribe.it is precisely because we lack jurisdiction to hear such claims,however,that appellants brought this case under habeas corpus law.we find and the parties direct us to nothing in the legislative history of that suggests the provision should be interpreted to cover disenrollment proceedings.because nothing in the legislative history suggests otherwise and because binding precedent precludes review of disenrollment proceedings,we can not accept appellants invitation to expand habeas corpus here.
appellants contend that their disenrollment is analogous to denaturalization.we disagree.appellants cite trop dulles,d,to support this proposition.the court in trop was confronted with the constitutionality of a statute that revoked united states citizenship for desertion during wartime even if the desertion was unrelated to any actions on behalf of a foreign government.id.at.trop is inapposite to this case.in trop the statute left the defendant stateless.id.further,the statute was penal in nature.id.at.here appellants have not been left stateless,and nothing in the record indicates that the disenrollment proceedings were undertaken to punish appellants.therefore,trop is not controlling.
appellants have not exhausted their tribal remedies in order to challenge a claim of banishment from the reservation.
appellants argue that disenrollment is similar to banishment and that they are therefore detained.however,appellants have not been banished from the reservation.the pechanga tribe has established uniform exclusion and eviction regulations for excluding both members and nonmembers of the tribe from the reservation.the exclusion and eviction regulations also establish the procedures for appealing one exclusion or eviction.appellants have not been subjected to any exclusion or eviction proceedings.therefore,they have not exhausted their claims for exclusion from the reservation or denial of access to it as established in the exclusion and eviction regulations.we then lack jurisdiction over any of appellants claims for exclusion or eviction.
c.the tribal proceeding was not criminal in nature.
failure to establish detention alone is sufficient to defeat a habeas claim under the icra.however,because some courts also require that icra habeas petitions be criminal proceedings,we address that issue here.the parties agree that the disenrollment procedures are civil proceedings.whether habeas relief under the icra can be granted in a context is an issue of first impression for this court.three of our circuit district courts have previously determined that only applies to tribal criminal proceedings.see quair sisco quair ii,wl.may,petitioners seeking relief under must establish that the proceeding at issue is criminal and not civil in nature citing quair i,d at alire,d at w rit of habeas corpus available under section is limited to unlawful detentions arising out of tribal criminal decisions.we agree 
the supreme court has found that habeas corpus under the icra is the exclusive means for review of tribal criminal proceedings.santa clara pueblo,at.the court has also found that congress considered and rejected proposals for federal review of alleged violations of the icra arising in a civil context.id.we also note i n interpreting,courts should hesitate to so expand the meaning of criminal and detention such that,as a practical matter,all tribal decisions affecting individual members in important areas of their lives become subject to review in federal court.such a result would be inconsistent with the principle of broad,unreviewable tribal sovereignty in all but criminal cases involving physical detention.quair ii,wl at.lastly,g iven the often vast gulf between tribal traditions and those with which federal courts are more intimately familiar,the judiciary should not rush to create causes of action that would intrude on these delicate matters.santa clara pueblo,at.
appellants contend that both poodry and quair i,support their position that habeas relief may be granted in a civil tribal proceeding.we disagree.in poodry,the petitioners were convicted of treason and sentenced to banishment from the tonawanda reservation.poodry,at.the specific issue addressed in poodry was whether of the icra allows a federal court to review punitive measures imposed by a tribe upon its members,when those measures involve banishment rather than imprisonment.id.at.the second circuit performed an extensive analysis of whether a habeas petition could be brought in a civil context,but ultimately stated,b ecause we conclude the tribal action in this case indeed arose in a criminal context,we ultimately need not resolve the question of whether habeas review is restricted to cases involving a tribal criminal conviction.id.at.therefore,any citation to poodry for the proposition that habeas relief may be granted from a civil tribal proceeding would be dicta.
the allegations in quair i were also criminal in nature.in fact,the court in quair i found that petitioners seeking relief under must establish that the proceeding at issue is criminal and not civil in nature.quair i,d at.these decisions,therefore,do not support appellants position that habeas relief may be granted from a civil tribal proceeding.
because the extension of habeas relief to civil proceedings would circumvent tribal sovereignty and cause undue or precipitous interference with matters such as enrollment,we hold that appellants in this case are not eligible for relief under the icra habeas provision.
iii.conclusion 
the district court properly dismissed appellants action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.appellants were not detained,did not exhaust their tribal remedies,and their disenrollment was the result of a civil proceeding.therefore,they can not get relief under the habeas corpus provision of the icra.accordingly,we affirm the district court.
appellants,enrolled members of the pechanga tribe since birth,filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under the indian civil rights act icra asserting that their tribal council violated the due process,equal protection,free speech and cruel and unusual punishment clauses of the act when it stripped them of membership in the tribe.the membership criteria that the tribal council applied were not established until the procedures it used to disenroll tribal members were not established until and the tribal council did not begin disenrolling large numbers of members until recently,when the tribe casino profits became a major source of revenue appellants allege that they are victims of the tribal council greed associated with these casinos.
the majority concludes that the district court properly dismissed appellants petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because appellants were disenrolled as the result of a civil proceeding,were not detained and did not exhaust their tribal remedies.i respectfully dissent and address each argument in turn.
indian civil rights act icra 
beginning in,through hearings and surveys,congress commenced an investigation into the conduct of tribal governments due to abuses that some tribal members were enduring at the hands of tribal officials.in,congress enacted icra to protect against such abuses by imposing restrictions upon tribal governments similar to those contained in the bill of rights and the fourteenth amendment.the enforcement mechanism congress provided was that of habeas corpus in federal courts.a central purpose of icra was to secur e for the american indian the broad constitutional rights afforded to other americans,and thereby to protect individual indians from arbitrary and unjust actions of tribal governments.santa clara pueblo martinez,d quoting.
criminal civil action 
i disagree with the majority view that icra provides a federal court with jurisdiction to review only a tribal criminal proceeding,not a civil proceeding.
the plain language of does not limit the court habeas jurisdiction to criminal proceedings.section simply provides,the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall be available to any person,in a court of the united states,to test the legality of his detention by order of an indian tribe.
in other contexts,the writ of habeas corpus has historically been available to contest detention resulting from civil proceedings.see,rex clarkson,strange gegiow uhl.the supreme court has held more recently that nothing in the language of the provisions for federal habeas relief for a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court requires that the state court judgment pursuant to which a person is in custody be a criminal conviction.duncan walker,d.as examples,the court cited cases in which federal courts had applied federal habeas review to petitions brought to challenge the legality of a state court order of civil commitment or a state court order of civil contempt.id.citations omitted.no reason appears in the plain language of to give it a narrower reach than the cognate statutory provisions governing collateral review of state and federal action s.poodry tonawanda band of seneca indians,cir,cert.denied,d.
the majority relies primarily on santa clara pueblo to support its conclusion.in that case,a female member of the santa clara pueblo indian tribe and her daughter brought suit in federal court against the tribe and its governor seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of a tribal ordinance denying membership in the tribe to children of female members who marry outside the tribe,while extending membership to children of male members who marry outside the tribe.
the issue before the supreme court in santa clara was whether icra could be interpreted to impliedly authorize the bringing of civil actions for declaratory or injunctive relief to enforce its substantive provisions.santa clara,at.the court held that it could not.
the court stated that its holding was strongly reinforced by the specific legislative history underlying.id.at.as part of its discussion of the legislative history,the court explained that congress had considered and rejected two proposals that would have allowed for federal review of alleged violations of the act arising in a civil context.id.at.one of these proposals would have required the attorney general to prosecute deprivations of an indian statutory or constitutional rights and the other would have authorized the department of the interior to adjudicate civil complaints concerning tribal actions.id.at.while congress rejected these two particular proposals,the legislative history does not indicate that it rejected any possible review of civil proceedings,and the court did not so find.
the court also noted,in settling on habeas corpus as the exclusive means for review of tribal criminal proceedings,congress opted for a less intrusive mechanism than had been initially proposed.id.at.the initial proposal to which the court referred here would have allowed for de novo review in federal court of all convictions in tribal courts.from the premise that habeas corpus is the exclusive means for review of criminal proceedings,it does not follow as a matter of logic or grammar that habeas corpus is a means that can be used to review criminal proceedings exclusively.in other words,the court statement does not preclude habeas review of civil proceedings that result in detention.the court held only that habeas corpus,and not any other federal remedy such as a direct appeal,is provided by icra.the court had no need to,and did not,decide that habeas jurisdiction under icra applied only to criminal proceedings.such is the second circuit interpretation of the case santa clara pueblo obviously does not speak directly to the scope of title i habeas provision,which was a matter not raised in that case.poodry,at.in poodry,the second circuit also found that it is not possible to draw from icra legislative history a definitive conclusion as to whether congress intended that habeas review be restricted to criminal convictions,or whether other circumstances of detention by a tribal court order could trigger habeas review.id.at.
the fact that the challenged proceedings in the case before us were civil,not criminal,does not,in my view,bar the district court from hearing the matter under.
detention by order of an indian tribe is the sole jurisdictional prerequisite for federal habeas review.the requirement in that an individual be detained is akin to the in custody and detention requirement in other habeas statutes.poodry,at congress appears to use the terms detention and custody interchangeably in the habeas context.the habeas statutes analogous to refer to detention as well as in custody throughout.see,and.there is no reason to conclude that the requirement of detention set forth in the indian civil rights act is any more lenient than the requirement of custody set forth in the other federal habeas statutes.moore nelson,cir.nor is there any reason to conclude that the requirement of detention in is any more strict than the requirement of custody or detention in the other federal habeas statutes.
the custody or detention requirement may be met if the habeas petitioner is not physically confined.jones cunningham,d see dow court of the first circuit through huddy,cir per curiam holding that a requirement to attend fourteen hours of alcohol rehabilitation constituted custody requiring petitioner physical presence at a particular place significantly restrain ed his liberty to do those things which free persons in the united states are entitled to do,cert.denied,d.
this requirement is designed to limit the availability of habeas review to cases of special urgency,leaving more conventional remedies for cases in which the restraints on liberty are neither severe nor immediate.hensley mun.court,d.therefore,the inquiry into whether a petitioner has satisfied the jurisdictional prerequisites for habeas review requires a court to judge the severity of an actual or potential restraint on liberty.
the combination of the current and potential restrictions placed upon appellants and the loss of their pechanga citizenship constitutes a severe restraint on their liberty.the majority analyzes each of these grounds separately,instead of collectively,and determines that none amounts to a detention.i respectfully disagree with this approach.
when tribal members are disenrolled,they become nonmembers of the tribe and lose all rights associated with being a pechanga citizen.one of those rights is access to the pechanga reservation.the pechanga reservation access and rental ordinance reservation access ordinance states,the custom,tradition and practice of the pechanga band has always been,and remains,that the pechanga reservation is closed to.access to and residency within the pechanga reservation is a privilege which may be granted or denied to an individual upon proper authority of the pechanga band.
elsewhere,the reservation access ordinance provides,use by of roads within the pechanga reservation is by permission of the tribal council and is subject to revocation at any time and for any reason.the ordinance establishes that a may enter the pechanga reservation only upon invitation by the tribal council or by an enrolled member of the pechanga band.otherwise,access to the pechanga reservation by is prohibited.
since being disenrolled,appellants have been excluded fro
