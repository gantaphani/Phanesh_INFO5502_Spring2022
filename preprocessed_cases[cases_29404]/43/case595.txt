amber appeals from orders terminating her parental rights to her minor children,and together minors,under welfare and institutions code section.statutory references are to the welfare and institutions code unless otherwise noted.amber appeal raises issues relating to the substantive provisions of the indian child welfare act icwa et,and related california statutes.we conclude the juvenile court erred by refusing to hear testimony on the issue of active efforts at the permanency planning hearing,but that the court error was harmless.we also reject amber contention that insufficient evidence supported the juvenile court finding that continued parental custody would likely result in serious physical or emotional damage to the minors,and affirm the orders.
factual and procedural background 
in november,amber arrived at a probation drug test appointment with her daughter,and told her probation officer that she had used heroin just hours before.amber told the officer father,manuel,was waiting in the car and could care for the child.when officers went to the car,manuel also appeared to be under the influence of drugs.officers searched manuel and found a hypodermic needle in his pocket.officers also searched the car and found marijuana and another needle in amber purse.both parents were arrested and was taken to polinsky children center.at the time of their parents arrest,and her,were living with their paternal grandmother.neither amber nor manuel lived with the paternal grandmother.amber was staying in hotels and manuel was homeless.manuel parental rights to were also terminated,as were father rights,but neither father is a party to this appeal.
as a result of the parents arrests,the san diego county health and human services agency agency filed petitions on behalf of the minors under section,subdivision b,alleging they had suffered,or were at a substantial risk of suffering,serious physical harm as a result of their parents inability to care for them because of drug use.the agency report for the detention hearing revealed amber history with the agency,including failing to reunify with an older son as a result of drug abuse and several referrals related to her drug use in the years preceding the current petitions.tested positive for methadone at birth,but amber successfully completed voluntary services and avoided further intervention by the agency at that time.
amber is an enrolled member of the iipay nation of santa ysabel.at the time of her arrest,she told the agency social worker the minors might be eligible for enrollment as members of the tribe.before the jurisdiction and disposition hearing,the agency provided the tribe with formal notice of the hearing and the family social worker,who was part of the agency indian specialty unit,contacted the tribe director of family services,linda ruis.ruis indicated the children should be considered indian children under icwa,and that she intended to file a declaration for the jurisdiction and disposition hearing on behalf of the tribe.
jurisdiction and disposition hearing 
before the jurisdiction and disposition hearing,the agency social worker,sara whitney,met with amber while in custody at las colinas detention and reentry facility.the social worker discussed services available to amber as a member of a native american tribe and provided contact information for specific service providers.at the hearing in december,the agency recommended the court order reunification services for amber and that the minors remain in the home of the paternal grandmother.ruis also testified at the hearing.at the conclusion of the hearing,the juvenile court made true findings on the petitions,declared the minors dependants,and found reasonable efforts were made to prevent their removal.
the juvenile court also separately found by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to section,and based in part upon the testimony of a qualified expert witness,the continued custody of the child ren by the parent or indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child,and that under title united states code section d active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of this indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.the juvenile court ordered the minors removed from their parents custody and placed with their paternal grandmother in accordance with icwa placement preferences.the court also ordered reunification services for both parents and supervised visitation for amber upon her release from custody.the court set a review hearing for june.
six month review hearing 
during the review period,amber made little progress in addressing her drug abuse and failed to participate in the reunification services she was referred to by the agency.amber did not stay in contact with whitney or follow through on whitney repeated efforts to engage amber in drug treatment.in early march,ruis informed whitney that amber told ruis she was in treatment,but that amber had not provided any details about the treatment facility.days later amber left a message for whitney indicating she was waiting for a bed to open at a residential treatment program,but when whitney returned the call the phone number did not have an operational voicemail.whitney finally met with amber in late march,and amber told whitney she had been in touch with southern indian health to obtain parenting and individual counseling,and that she had been attending narcotics anonymous meetings twice a week.
shortly thereafter,whitney spoke with the parenting coordinator at one of southern indian health partners,who indicated she would follow up with amber to help her obtain counseling.whitney then followed up with amber and provided her with contact information for the parenting coordinator,as well as additional referrals for residential drug treatment services.whitney and ruis continued their follow up efforts,and amber finally entered a residential drug treatment program at the end of april,just six weeks before the review hearing.after just four days,however,amber tested positive for methamphetamines and morphine and left the program.
during the review period,amber visitation with the minors at the paternal grandmother home was sporadic.she would sometimes arrive unannounced,once after the minors were already asleep,and frequently failed to show up after promising to visit.in january,the paternal grandmother told the social worker she stopped telling the minors amber would be visiting to prevent their disappointment when amber did not follow through.amber visitation somewhat improved in march and april,but at amber final visit just days after she left the drug treatment program the paternal grandmother found a hypodermic needle in the couch where amber had fallen asleep during the visit.
in the agency report for the review hearing it recommended termination of reunification services,and that the court set a hearing under section to select a permanent plan for the minors.the agency report indicated whitney had consulted with ruis,who agreed with the recommendation.the agency recommended the court find by clear and convincing evidence and pursuant to icwa d,active efforts were made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of this indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.the agency also recommended the court find,beyond a reasonable doubt,pursuant to section f and based in part upon the testimony of a qualified witness,the continued custody of the child ren by the parent or indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage 
the parents contested the agency recommendations but failed to appear at the july review hearing.at the hearing,the court denied the parents request for a continuance and received the agency report into evidence.whitney was available for,but no questions were posed to her.amber counsel asked the court to continue reunification services without providing any specific basis for the request.the juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence that return of the minors to their parents would be detrimental and that reasonable services designed to reunify the family were offered,but were unsuccessful.the court also adopted the agency recommended findings under title united states code sections d and f of icwa.the court terminated services,continued placement with the paternal grandmother and set a permanency planning hearing under section for november.
termination of parental rights and permanency planning hearing 
as a result of continuances requested by the agency for additional time to obtain an indian expert declaration from ruis,the permanency planning hearing did not occur until may.in the period between the termination of reunification services and the hearing,amber visited the minors only sporadically.she was again incarcerated during a period of that time,and after failing to show up for a supervised visit in march was unreachable for several weeks directly preceding the permanency planning hearing.
the paternal grandmother continued to care for the minors and was committed to adopting them.shortly after the final review hearing,the paternal grandmother was displaced and was living in hotels with the minors for several weeks.by april,however,the paternal grandmother housing stabilized and she and the minors were living with a maternal aunt and doing well.had some development delays as a result of the trauma and upheaval they had experienced,and was participating in therapy.therapist did not think even visits with amber were in best interest,who was five at the time of the permanency planning hearing understood the concept of adoption and wanted to live with her grandmother.stated she loved amber but did not want to live with her.also expressed a desire to stay with the paternal grandmother.
in its report for the permanency planning hearing,the agency recommended the termination of parental rights and opined the minors were generally and specifically adoptable.ruis submitted an expert declaration in advance of the permanency planning hearing that echoed the agency recommendations.ruis stated it was her opinion that the minors would suffer serious emotional or physical harm if returned to the care and custody of the parents.ruis based her opinion on amber and manuel extensive histories of drug abuse and criminal activity,the parents failure to participate in services and visitation provided during the dependency proceeding,and amber failure to reunify with her oldest child in a prior dependency proceeding.ruis also opined that active efforts were made to provide remedial and rehabilitative services designed to prevent the breakup of th e indian family or eliminate the need for the removal.
at the permanency planning hearing,the court received the agency reports and ruis declaration into evidence,and heard the testimony of the family current social worker,ruis,amber,and the paternal grandmother.while ruis,amber counsel asked ruis if amber had access to remedial services after reunification services were terminated.ruis responded she did not know.the juvenile court then asked if the portion of ruis declaration that addressed the agency active efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs under icwa was relevant in light of the fact that the court had already found adequate active efforts were made by the agency at the review hearing.in response,amber counsel stated the only opinion provided was that active efforts were made to provide remedial and rehabilitative services designed to prevent the of the indian family.the court concluded the issue of active efforts had already been determined,and the only expert testimony properly before the court concerned the issue of continued custody under title united states code section f.the agency counsel agreed with the ruling and amber counsel stated she would accept that ruling from the court.the court then excluded the portion of ruis declaration concerning the agency active efforts.
amber attorney continued her examination of ruis.ruis testified she met amber in person for the first time that day and learned amber had recently enrolled in a methadone program and had clean drug tests.ruis also stated that she had based her declaration on the agency reports and two phone conversations she had with amber during the proceedings.she admitted her husband had passed away a few months earlier,and so a lot of things that i read probably i do know.i not saying that i would change my opinion because she gotten into the methadone program.it just that i been like very emotional and in and out.
amber testified that after the termination of reunification services she sought help for her drug addiction and had enrolled in treatment.the court admitted a letter from a treatment program indicating amber was enrolled,and an attendance sheet showing amber had attended eight step meetings between april,and may.amber also testified she visited the minors regularly without the agency knowledge.the paternal grandmother,however,denied the visits occurred.
after arguments of counsel,the juvenile court found by clear and convincing evidence the minors were generally adoptable and that none of the exceptions to adoption applied.the court also found,beyond a reasonable doubt,that continued custody of the minors by the parents was likely to result in serious emotional and physical danger to the minors.the court terminated parental rights and referred the minors to adoptive placement.
discussion 
amber asserts the juvenile court erred at the permanency planning hearing by excluding evidence related to the agency active efforts to provide remedial and rehabilitative programs to prevent the breakup of her family and by failing to make a finding that active efforts were made.amber also asserts the juvenile court finding of active efforts at the review hearing was not adequate.the agency responds that amber failure to challenge the finding made at the review hearing by writ petition under california rules of court,rule subsequent rule references are to the california rules of court,resulted in a forfeiture of her challenge to that finding.the agency also contends that even if amber challenge is properly before this court,the juvenile court active efforts finding at the review hearing was adequate and the court did not err by precluding further litigation of the issue at the permanency planning hearing.
legal standards 
congress enacted icwa in to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families.the law defines an indian child as any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.icwa provides that any party seeking foster care placement or termination of parental rights of an indian child must first satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.d.
in,california statutes were amended to bring them into greater conformity with icwa.the new legislation,which became effective on january,amended section to add new subdivision c b i and added section.stats ch.amended section states that the court shall not terminate parental rights if,in the case of an indian child i at the hearing terminating parental rights,the court has found that active efforts were not made as required in section,subd.c b i.new section states,in relevant part a a party seeking an involuntary foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights over,an indian child shall provide evidence to the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.b what constitutes active efforts shall be assessed on a basis.the active efforts shall be made in a manner that takes into account the prevailing social and cultural values,conditions,and way of life of the indian child tribe.active efforts shall utilize the available resources of the indian child extended family,tribe,tribal and other indian social service agencies,and individual indian caregiver service providers.
active efforts have been described as timely and affirmative steps taken to accomplish the goal which congress has set to avoid the breakup of indian families whenever possible by providing services designed to remedy problems which might lead to severance of the relationship.letitia superior court th,see also in re th.this court recently held that t he adequacy of reunification plans and the reasonableness of the agency efforts are judged according to the circumstances of each case.citation.the agency must make a good faith effort to develop and implement a family reunification plan.citation.t he record should show that the supervising agency identified the problems leading to the loss of custody,offered services designed to remedy those problems,maintained reasonable contact with the parents during the course of the service plan,and made reasonable efforts to assist the parents in areas where compliance proved difficult in re th.

forfeiture 
the agency contends amber is foreclosed from challenging the juvenile court active efforts finding at the final review hearing because she did not challenge that finding by writ petition.section,subdivision l states that a n order by the court that a hearing pursuant to this section be held is not appealable at any time unless all of the following apply a a petition for extraordinary writ was filed in a timely manner.b the petition substantively addressed the specific issues to be challenged and supported that challenge by an adequate record.c the petition for extraordinary review was summarily denied or otherwise not decided on the merits,subd.l.under this statute,a ll court orders,regardless of their nature,made at a hearing in which a section permanency planning hearing is set must be challenged by a petition for extraordinary writ.in re merrick th,merrick.
the provision ensures that challenges to findings made at the time reunification services are terminated are resolved expeditiously,and do not interfere with later proceedings.see merrick,supra,th at the goals of expedition and finality would be compromised if such orders are permitted to be raised by appeal from the order itself or from a later permanent planning order and therefore allowed to remain undecided until well after the permanent plan was decided upon.joyce superior court th,the purpose of the statute is to provide for immediate writ review of meritorious issues subsumed within the order setting a section hearing to ensure that the hearing is not infected with reversible error even before it commences.
amber was not present at the final review hearing but the court ordered her counsel to notify her of her right to file a writ petition and ordered the court business office to serve her with a writ packet at her designated address.amber did not subsequently seek writ review and she does not allege defective notice of her right to obtain review of the orders made at the review hearing.as a result,we agree with the agency that amber forfeited her right to challenge the juvenile court active efforts finding at the final review hearing.even though amber did not preserve a challenge to that finding,we must still address her assertion that the juvenile court erred by failing to allow further litigation on the issue of active efforts and not making the finding a second time at the permanency planning hearing.
juvenile court failure to make active efforts finding at termination 
as discussed,amber asserts the court erred by failing to allow evidence related to the issue of the agency active efforts under icwa and california related provisions at the time her parental rights were terminated.we agree that the court erred by foreclosing evidence on this point on its own motion and by failing to make a new active efforts finding.
this case highlights a gap between federal law and the manner in which california dependency proceedings are conducted.b ecause the critical decision s regarding parental rights and that the minor can not be returned home are made at the earlier review hearing,the issues at the section hearing are generally limited to the questions whether the child is adoptable and whether there is a statutory exception to adoption.in re matthew th.u nlike the termination hearings in most states,the purpose of the final termination hearing in california is not to accumulate further evidence of parental unfitness and danger to the child,but to begin the task of finding the child a permanent alternative family placement.ibid.
icwa active effort requirement under title united states code section d parallels the reasonable efforts finding that must be made at the final review hearing under state law.specifically,before setting the permanency planning hearing the juvenile court must first find the return of the child to his or her parent or legal guardian would create a substantial risk of detriment to the safety,protection,or physical or emotional of the child.welf,subds.e f,subds.a b.under this scheme,it is efficient for the juvenile court to make the requisite icwa findings,including the active efforts finding under title united states code section d,at the final review hearing where the court sets the matter for a determination on a permanent plan since those same findings form the factual basis for a later termination decision.in re matthew,supra,th at.
section,subdivision c b i,however,explicitly allows the issue to be addressed at the permanency planning hearing.see quarterman kefauver th,words of a statute are to be given a plain and commonsense meaning.when the words are clear and unambiguous,there is no need for statutory construction or resort to other indicia of legislative intent,such as legislative history.the provision states that at the hearing terminating parental rights the court shall not terminate parental rights if it finds active efforts were not made,subd.c b i,italics added see also rule,subd.a the court may only terminate parental rights to an indian child or declare an indian child free of the custody and control of one or both parents if at the hearing terminating parental rights or declaring the child free of the custody and control of one or both parents,the court f inds by clear and convincing evidence that active efforts to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family were made,italics added.if the legislature intended to foreclose reconsideration of the active efforts requirement at the permanency planning hearing,it could have easily done so.indeed,the preceding subdivision of the statute c a precludes terminating parental rights unless a t each hearing at which the court was required to consider reasonable efforts or services,the court has found that reasonable efforts were not made or that reasonable services were not offered or provided,subd.c a,italics added.
here,when amber attorney attempted to question ruis on the portion of her declaration addressing whether the agency had made the active efforts required under icwa and sections and,subdivision c b i,the court on its own motion prohibited further questions and struck the portion of ruis declaration which stated the agency made the requisite active efforts.this was error under the plain language of section,subdvision c b i.the provision clearly contemplates consideration of the active efforts requirement at the permanency planning hearing.the juvenile court decision to preclude evidence on the issue and fa
