petitioners,defendants in the trial court,are members of the enrollment committee of the temecula band of luiseno mission indians of the pechanga indian reservation,commonly known as the pechanga band band.real parties in interest real parties,plaintiffs below,were enrolled members of the band at the time of the commencement of this action.
according to the complaint,defendants have initiated disenrollment procedures against plaintiffs on the general ground that the ancestor from whom plaintiffs claimed descent was not one of the original pechanga people and her descendants therefore did not qualify as band members.plaintiffs objections to the procedures are generally as follows the disenrollment proceedings had been improperly instituted by fewer than percent of the committee members the tribal chairman had removed several members,leaving an insufficient number to take valid action members of the committee were improperly reinstated to create a false quorum the committee is imposing proof requirements on plaintiffs that are more strict than set out in pechanga law and the committee acts inconsistently and arbitrarily in deciding whether a person is entitled to membership.
plaintiffs asserted causes of action for violation of pechanga band law,and violation of law,citing the indian civil rights act of,title united states code section.
after certain proceedings,which need not be recounted in detail including a brief sojourn in federal court,which determined that it did not have jurisdiction and remanded to california,defendants,appearing specially,demurred and moved to quash service of summons on them.the bases for the motions,although related,were technically separate for the demurrer,that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute and for the motion to quash,that the individual defendants had been acting in the capacity of tribal officials and were therefore immune from suit.
the trial court eventually disagreed and this petition followed.
discussion 
the issues raised by the petition are significant,but we have elected not to attempt a detailed treatise on indian law.although we acknowledge the excellence of the briefs submitted by plaintiffs as well as those on behalf of defendants,we believe the resolution of the case is relatively clear.in addition,our resolution of the case means that plaintiffs grievances must be resolved in the political arena,not the judicial forum.
plaintiffs base their position that california state courts have jurisdiction over this dispute on public law.in pertinent part,it provides that,each of the states listed shall have jurisdiction over civil causes of action between indians or to which indians are parties which arise in the areas of indian country to the same extent that such state has jurisdiction over other civil causes of action ibid.they argue that as the band does not have a tribal court,the state courts therefore operate as de facto tribal courts to decide disputes between tribal members.as we will explain,california courts act as tribal courts,if at all,in only a limited sense,and that sense does not extend as far as plaintiffs argue.plaintiffs have cited no case,and our research has disclosed none,which purports to apply public law to a dispute such as the one here.with some reluctance we conclude that congress did not intend the statute to authorize state courts to intervene in a case such as this 
although it is not directly on point,the seminal case of santa clara pueblo martinez,d martinez is not only authoritative but instructive.martinez was a proposed class action brought by a female tribal member and her daughter,suing to obtain membership in the tribe for children who were excluded under a recent tribal ordinance affecting the children of tribal women who married outside the tribe.the children of men who married outside the tribe were not excluded,and the plaintiffs charged that the ordinance constituted a violation of the equal protection clause of the indian civil rights act of.et.
it had previously been held,and is not now disputed,that indian tribes are unconstrained by those constitutional provisions framed specifically as limitations on federal or state authority.martinez,supra,at.and see cases cited at fn.the indian civil rights act represented an affirmative act of congress to impose statutory obligations on the tribes.however,without reaching the merits of the plaintiffs claim,the supreme court relied on the absence of an express remedy or language conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts,and noted that,creation of a federal cause of action for the enforcement of the rights plainly would be at odds with the congressional goal of protecting tribal.martinez,supra,at.the court also commented that resolution of statutory issues under will frequently depend on questions of tribal tradition and custom which tribal forums may be in a better position to evaluate than federal courts the tribes remain nations which,by government structure,culture,and source of sovereignty are in many ways foreign to the constitutional institutions of the federal and state governments.accordingly,it held that federal courts had no jurisdiction over actions to enforce the indian civil rights act of martinez,supra,at.
martinez stands as the primary case recognizing the importance of tribal rights and sovereignty,and the limited extent to which the federal government has chosen to intrude on these concepts.significantly for our case,the supreme court also commented that a tribe right to define its own membership for tribal purposes has long been recognized as central to its existence as an independent political community.martinez,supra,at,fn.although martinez arose under the indian civil rights act rather than public law,its construction of congressional intent and the general disavowal of any congressional purpose to allow general judicial intervention in tribal matters stands as a valuable cautionary statement.
we agree with those courts that have found that,in light of martinez,public law can not be viewed as a general grant of jurisdiction to state courts to determine intratribal disputes.see also ackerman edwards th,d.rather,t he primary concern of congress in enacting pub l was with the problem of lawlessness on certain indian reservations,and the absence of adequate tribal institutions for law enforcement.bryan itasca county,d bryan.accordingly,public law allowed state courts to enforce their own criminal laws with respect to offenses committed either by or against indians on indian land.
with respect to the grant of civil jurisdiction,the supreme court has acknowledged that the legislative history reflects a virtual absence of expression of congressional policy or intent bryan,supra,at.however,this provision seems to have been primarily intended to redress the lack of adequate indian forums for resolving private legal disputes between reservation indians,and between indians and other private citizens id.at.its effect is therefore to grant jurisdiction over private civil litigation involving reservation indians in state court.id.at.in our view,this is not a private legal dispute between reservation indians,but rather goes to the heart of tribal sovereignty.
it is very clear that public law does not provide jurisdiction over disputes involving a tribe.as the court noted in bryan,there is notably absent any conferral of jurisdiction over the tribes themselves bryan,supra,at.see also ackerman edwards,supra,th at,d.plaintiffs tacitly acknowledge this fact,as they have not attempted to sue the band,but have only sued the individual members of the enrollment committee.they insist that the individual member defendants are subject to jurisdiction and the dispute is justiciable.we disagree.
it is quite true that individual tribal members have no sovereign immunity from suit unless they are acting in official capacities on behalf of a tribe.see turner martire th,d.plaintiffs argue that defendants do not qualify for two reasons first,they exercised only ministerial authority in reviewing enrollment matters,and second,that in taking the actions of which complaint is made,they acted
