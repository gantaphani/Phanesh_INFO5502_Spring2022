the first three contracts contained explicit clauses waiving the tribe sovereign immunity.each stated

the three contracts also provided for claims resolution,stating 
the parties agree to bring any and all claims in the first instance to the oglala sioux tribe executive committee for mediation,and thereafter to the south dakota federal district court,and in the absence of federal court jurisdiction,the parties agree to arbitration in accordance with the construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association in effect at the time of this contract.in the event there exists no federal court jurisdiction and the parties proceed to arbitration,the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final,and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with the applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.in the event either party does not timely comply in accordance with the construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association,said party waives its right to arbitration and judgment may be entered in the amount in dispute in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

arbitration of contract disputes 
the paving path did not run smooth.disputes arose concerning c w performance and payment therefor.on august,the parties attempted to resolve their disputes through mediation by the oglala sioux tribal executive committee.the attempts were unsuccessful.
on january,c w filed a claim with the american arbitration association aaa concerning all four contracts,seeking million.the tribe communicated to c w its agreement to arbitrate,and although not required to do so,agreed to include the base and blotter project in the arbitration.the tribe answered c w aaa claim,and particularly asserted its own counterclaims under the base and blotter contract.it sought damages of over million for breach of that contract.the tribe answer did not assert sovereign immunity.
the tribe moved to dismiss certain claims on grounds of sovereign immunity,but not with respect to the base and blotter contract.in support of that motion,the tribe filed a memorandum with the arbitrator,acceding to him consideration of the base and blotter contract.the memorandum stated,in part 
in the base and blotter contract,the limited waiver of sovereign immunity extends only to the oglala sioux tribal court.the tribe has not objected to the claimant inclusion of the base and blotter claim in the arbitration demand,however,for the sake of expediency in resolving the dispute on its merits.
