roger fiander,a member of the confederated tribes and bands of the yakama nation,was charged with several other defendants in a indictment with numerous violations related to trafficking in contraband cigarettes.the charges included violations of the contraband cigarette trafficking act ccta,a conspiracy to violate the ccta,and a conspiracy to violate the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,d and money laundering,and.fiander agreed to plead guilty to count one of the indictment,conspiracy to violate rico,and the government agreed to move to dismiss the numerous other counts.shortly thereafter,however,we decided united states smiskin,cir,holding that the application of the ccta to yakama indians violated the yakama treaty of.we therefore upheld the dismissal of an indictment against two members of the yakama nation.pursuant to smiskin,after briefing,the district court dismissed the indictment.the government timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and,and we now reverse.
the district court decision to dismiss the indictment is reviewed de novo.united states jackson,cir.generally,an indictment is sufficient if it sets forth the elements of the charged offense so as to ensure the right of the defendant not to be placed in double jeopardy and to be informed of the offense charged.united states fernandez,cir quoting united states rodriguez,cir,modified by cir.
fiander was a member of an organization called the mahoney enterprise,which trafficked in contraband cigarettes between idaho and washington.louie mahoney owned and operated jkl enterprises on the coeur indian reservation in idaho.jkl enterprises ordered cigarettes from washington wholesalers using the tribal tobacco license and retail addresses of christine and margaret jose.jkl enterprises then took cigarette orders from washington tribal retailers.fiander role was to deliver cigarette orders to two retailers on the yakama indian reservation in washington.fiander picked up checks from the retailers in washington,drove to idaho to pick up the cigarettes,and transported the cigarettes to washington.
fiander was charged under the ccta,which provides that it is unlawful for any person knowingly to ship,transport,receive,possess,sell,distribute,or purchase contraband cigarettes or contraband smokeless tobacco.a.contraband cigarettes are defined by reference to state law 
t he term contraband cigarettes means a quantity in excess of cigarettes,which bear no evidence of the payment of applicable state or local cigarette taxes in the state or locality where such cigarettes are found,if the state or local government requires a stamp,impression,or other indication to be placed on packages or other containers of cigarettes to evidence payment of cigarette taxes,and which are in the possession of any person other than a person otherwise authorized to possess such cigarettes.
in order to enforce its cigarette tax,washington law requires cigarettes sold in the state to have a stamp showing either that the tax was paid or that the cigarettes were.it is illegal to transport unstamped cigarettes in the state unless authorized to possess unstamped cigarettes.
a person authorized to possess unstamped cigarettes means 
a a wholesaler,licensed under washington state law 
b the united states or an agency thereof and 
c any person,including an indian tribal organization,who,after notice has been given to the board as provided in this section,brings or causes to be brought into the state unstamped cigarettes,if within a period of time after receipt of the cigarettes as the department determines by rule to be reasonably necessary for the purpose the person has caused stamps to be affixed in accordance with rcw or otherwise made payment of the tax required by this chapter in the manner set forth in rules adopted by the department.
under federal law the state may not tax indians or indian tribes in indian country.admin.code.however,washington law requires that cigarettes destined for sale to indians be by the washington state department of revenue.grey poplars assorted brands of cigarettes,cir.washington law further prohibits the transportation of unstamped cigarettes other than by a licensed wholesaler in the wholesaler own vehicle,or by a person who has given notice to the liquor control board in advance of the commencement of transportation.see.defining board to mean the liquor control board.because fiander did not provide notice to the state prior to transporting the cigarettes,the cigarettes he transported were contraband within the meaning of the ccta.see smiskin,at concluding that the cigarettes were unauthorized under state law and contraband under the ccta because the smiskins did not provide prior notice to the state of washington.
federal laws of general applicability are presumed to apply with equal force to indians,subject to three exceptions.united states baker,cir.one exception is that,if a statute of general applicability is silent on the issue of applicability to indian tribes,it will not apply if its application would abrogate rights guaranteed by indian treaties.id.quoting donovan coeur tribal farm,cir.smiskin held that the application of the ccta,a law of general applicability,violated the right to travel guaranteed by the yakama treaty.smiskin,at.
the right to travel provision of the yakama treaty of secures to yakama tribal members the right to travel upon the public highways.id.at.like fiander,the defendants in smiskin were members of the yakama nation who were suspected of transporting unstamped cigarettes from idaho to smoke shops on indian reservations in washington.they were charged with substantive violations of the ccta by failing to comply with washington requirement to give notice to the liquor control board prior to transporting unstamped cigarettes within the state.the district court held that the requirement violated the yakama treaty and dismissed the indictment.
on the government appeal,we relied on cree flores,cir,which held that the state of washington imposition of fees on truck drivers for yakama logging companies violated the yakama treaty guarantee of the right to transport goods to market over public highways without payment of fees for that use.smiskin,at quoting cree,at.we cited the finding made in cree that the parties to the treaty intended the yakamas to retain the right to travel the public highways without restriction for purposes of hauling goods to market.id.at quoting yakama indian nation flores,aff by cree.washington requirement was a restriction on the right to travel,in violation of the yakama treaty.id.thus,the smiskins alleged transportation and possession of unstamped cigarettes without providing notice to the state can not be the basis for prosecution under the ccta.id.at.
fiander ccta prosecution relies on the same requirement that was addressed in smiskin.thus,pursuant to smiskin,fiander can not be prosecuted for a substantive violation of the ccta.the government protests,however,that fiander pled guilty to conspiracy to violate rico under d and that he can be liable for the rico conspiracy charge even if he can not be charged with the substantive ccta offense 
the government argument rests on salinas united states,d which held that a defendant who was acquitted of the substantive racketeering charge nonetheless could be convicted of conspiracy to violate rico.
the rico statute,d,to which fiander pleaded guilty,provides,in full,that i t shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection a,b,or c of this section.the indictment charged fiander and his coconspirators with a conspiracy to violate c,which provides 
it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
c.racketeering activity is defined to include any act that is indictable under the ccta.id.b.a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts o
