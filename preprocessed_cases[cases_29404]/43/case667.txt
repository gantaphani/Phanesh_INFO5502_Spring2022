since the seminole tribe of florida opened its first bingo hall in and succeeded in blocking legal challenges to the hall operation the indian gaming industry has seen a meteoric rise in popularity and profitability.according to data from the national indian gaming commission,revenues from indian gaming nationwide rose from about billion in to about billion in 
unquestionably,these figures reflect a substantial increase in the number of nonindians entering and engaging in activities on indian land.this influx of people onto reservations and rancherias throughout the country is probably nowhere more prevalent than in california,where,at the end of,tribes were conducting gaming operations in locations across the state 
unfortunately,more people on indian land means a greater potential for crime on indian land,which raises interesting and difficult questions about the role limitations police officers involved in investigating suspected criminal activities and the use of evidence obtained by those officers.this case raises one such question,namely,whether the exclusionary rule applies in a state criminal prosecution to evidence obtained as the result of an unreasonable search conducted by indian law enforcement officers on indian land.
here,two tribal police officers who suspected possible narcotics activity in the parking garage of an indian casino searched a car without probable cause and found drugs and drug paraphernalia.charged in amador county superior court with possession of drugs for sale,defendant gilbert ramirez succeeded in having the evidence suppressed and the case dismissed.
on appeal,the people contend the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence because tribal police officers are not bound by the fourth amendment and therefore the exclusionary rule does not apply.the people further argue that subdivision d of article,section of the california right to provision hereafter section d required the trial court to admit the evidence at trial in the absence of a federal constitutional basis for suppression.
we find no error.as will be seen,section of the indian civil rights act,hereafter section prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by tribal police officers just like the fourth and fourteenth amendments prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures by federal and state law enforcement officers.given that the purpose of the indian civil rights act was to impose on indian governments the same restrictions applicable to the federal and state governments under the federal constitution,we find no principled basis for concluding that evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment must be suppressed,but evidence obtained in violation of the same proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures in section can be used.furthermore,we conclude that under the supremacy clause of the federal constitution,section d can not require the admission of evidence that is subject to an exclusionary rule imposed by federal law.accordingly,we will affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the jackson rancheria band of miwuk indians is a federally recognized indian tribe that conducts indian gaming operations under a compact with the state of california see,subd.a.the tribe also operates its own police force,the jackson rancheria tribal police department.
as two uniformed officers of the tribal police patrolled a parking garage at the tribe casino in november,they spotted defendant sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car,digging through the center console.they also noticed a woman in the driver seat nervously looking around front,back,and side to side.with little further ado,the officers searched the car.they found narcotics and related paraphernalia.the officers then summoned the amador county sheriff department 
defendant was charged by information in amador county superior court with possession of heroin,methamphetamine,and marijuana for sale.before trial,defendant moved to suppress all of the evidence obtained as a result of the search by the tribal officers.in response,in addition to arguing the search was proper,the prosecutor argued the exclusionary rule did not apply because the fourth amendment did not govern the tribal officers search.the prosecutor further argued that because the federal constitution did not mandate exclusion of the evidence,the court had to admit it under section d.
the trial court,however,analyzed the lawfulness of the search under section of the indian civil rights act.the court concluded it would be a complete denial of due process not to apply that statute to the actions of the tribal officers in the same manner the fourth amendment is applied to the actions of state law enforcement officers through the fourteenth amendment because the statute mimic s practically the language of the fourth amendment.accordingly,after concluding the officers lacked probable cause to search,the court granted defendant motion to suppress.
thereafter,the prosecutor filed a statement of insufficient evidence to proceed to trial,and the trial court dismissed the case.the people appealed.after defendant failed to file a respondent brief,this court invited the central california appellate program to file an amicus curiae brief,and it accepted the invitation.
discussion 
the people argue the exclusionary rule does not apply here because tribal police officers are not bound by the fourth amendment.they further assert that section d required the trial court to admit the evidence.we reject these arguments.
the fourth amendment provides that t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,amend.this guarantee is basic to a free society and is therefore implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and as such enforceable against the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.wolf colorado,overruled on other grounds in mapp ohio,d.moreover,the standard of reasonableness is the same under the fourth and fourteenth amendments.ker california,d.
generally,the provisions of the constitution of the united states have no application to indian nations or their governments groundhog keeler cir.as separate sovereigns the constitution,tribes have historically been regarded as unconstrained by those constitutional provisions framed specifically as limitations on federal or state authority.santa clara pueblo martinez,d.
an exception to this rule exists,however,when the provisions of the constitution are made applicable to indian nations by an act of congress.groundhog keeler,supra,at.the constitution is,of course,the supreme law of the land,but it is nonetheless a part of the laws of the united states.under the philosophy of the decisions,it,as any other law,is binding upon indian nations only where it expressly binds them,or is made binding by treaty or some act of congress.native american church navajo tribal council cir.
section of the indian civil rights act is one such act of congress.that statute provides in relevant part as follows no indian tribe in exercising powers of shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects against unreasonable search and seizures this language is,for all intents and purposes,identical to the language of the fourth amendment see above and thus evidences a congressional intent to extend,as against the indian tribes,t he security of one privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the is at the core of the fourth amendment.wolf colorado,supra,at.at.
this intent is confirmed by the legislative history of the indian civil rights act.a central purpose of the indian civil rights act was to secur e for the american indian the broad constitutional rights afforded to other americans,and thereby to protect individual indians from arbitrary and unjust actions of tribal governments.santa clara pueblo martinez,supra,at.at,d at,quoting,see generally burnett,an historical analysis of the indian civil rights act harv.on legis.as the tenth circuit court of appeals explained in groundhog keeler,supra,at pages 
the original bill to provide an indian bill of rights,considered by the senate subcommittee,was brief and badly worded.it read as follows 
any indian tribe,in exercising its powers of local shall be subject to the same limitations and restraints as those which are imposed on the government of the united states by the united states constitution.
there were many objections to the broad language of the bill at the hearing,particularly as to the fifteenth amendment restraints embraced in the original bill.
the department of the interior submitted a substitute bill,which,with minor revisions,was introduced in the congress and eventually enacted into law as the present indian bill of rights.
in its endorsement of the substitute bill,the summary of the report of the senate subcommittee on the judiciary stated 
the department of interior bill would,in effect,impose upon the indian governments the same restrictions applicable presently to the federal and state governments with several notable exceptions,the amendment,certain of the procedural requirements of the,and amendments,and,in some respects,the equal protection requirement of the amendment.
the summary of the report of the subcommittee was endorsed and adopted by the senate committee on the judiciary.italics added.
thus,by act of congress,indian tribal governments have no more power to conduct unreasonable searches and seizures than do the federal and state governments under the fourth amendment the question is whether in extending the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures to indian tribal governments through its enactment of section,congress also intended that the exclusionary rule which unquestionably applies to evidence obtained by federal and state law enforcement officers in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments would likewise apply to evidence seized by tribal police officers in violation of section.
this question is one of first impression in california.some lower federal courts have touched on the issue in cases involving federal criminal prosecutions,but those decisions are of little value to us because the courts generally have assumed the exclusionary rule applies if tribal law enforcement officers violated the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures in the indian civil rights act they have not actually decided whether the rule applies,cir,and cases cited therein.
the decision of the eighth circuit court of appeals in united states lester cir is an exception however,the lester court gave the question of whether the exclusionary rule applies sparse consideration,noting only as follows the language of the indian civil rights act parallels the fourth amendment guarantee to the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures.the act purports to give indians constitutional rights which other americans enjoy.citation.in light of the legislative history of the indian civil rights act and its striking similarity to the language of the constitution,citation,we consider the problem before us under fourth amendment standards,at.
it is significant to note the lester court went on to conclude the search and seizure in that case were reasonable under fourth amendment standards and thus there was no basis to suppress the evidence.united states lester,supra,at.indeed,no appellate court of which we are aware has ever affirmed the exclusion of evidence because it was obtained in violation of section.since we are called on to do that very thing here,we believe the question whether congress intended the exclusionary rule to apply to evidence obtained in violation of section warrants a more thorough examination than that provided by the federal courts to date.
the people point out that the indian civil rights act contains no exclusionary rule.although congress has,on at least one occasion,expressly included an exclusionary rule in a statute see part of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of hereafter the federal wiretapping statute,its failure to do so in the indian civil rights act is of little significance because congress is understood to legislate against a background of principles.citations.thus,where a principle is well established,the courts may take it as given that congress has legislated with an expectation that the principle will apply except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.astoria solimino,d.in such cases,congress does not write upon a clean slate.united states texas,d.
the exclusionary rule has been a part of fourth amendment search and seizure jurisprudence for nearly a century.in,the united states supreme court announced the basic rule evidence obtained by federal officers in violation of the fourth amendment must be excluded on proper objection in a federal criminal prosecution.weeks united states.in,the supreme court determined the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures was applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,but the court refused to extend the exclusionary rule to the states at that time.wolf colorado,supra,at.at.in,the court expanded the exclusionary rule to prohibit the use in federal courts of evidence illegally seized by state agents,thus putting an end to what had been known as the silver platter doctrine.elkins united states,d.finally,in the supreme court partially overruled wolf and extended the exclusionary rule to cover evidence obtained by state officers used in state criminal prosecutions.mapp ohio,supra,at.at,d at.
t he precise constitutional status of this rule has been a subject of intense debate.lafave,search and seizure ed f.in mapp,the exclusionary rule was declared to be part and parcel of the fourth amendment limitation upon governmental encroachment of individual privacy and an essential part of both the fourth and fourteenth amendments.ibid.twelve years later,however,in calandra,the court described the rule as a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard fourth amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect,rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.united states calandra,d.the court went even further in united states leon,d,reiterating its characterization of the exclusionary rule as a judicially created remedy but also specifically rejecting any implication from mapp that the exclusionary rule is a necessary corollary of the fourth amendment.leon,at.at,d at.
whatever the precise constitutional status of the exclusionary rule may be,for our purposes it is most significant that when congress enacted the indian civil rights act in,the supreme court had not yet retreated from its assertions in mapp that the exclusionary rule was an essential part of the fourth and fourteenth amendments.because congress acted against this background,we take it as given that congress expected this common law exclusionary be as much a part of the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures in section as it was then considered a part of the identical prohibition in the federal constitution.
of course,this presumption in favor of the rule application to violations of section could be overcome by evidence of congressional intent to the contrary however,we are aware of no such evidence.certainly nothing in the legislative history evidences any intent to abrogate the exclusionary rule or suggests congress intended to allow tribal police officers to operate free from the deterrent effects of the rule.on the contrary,as we have noted,the legislative history of the indian civil rights act supports the conclusion that in extending the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures to indian tribal governments,congress intended to subject those governments to the same restrictions understood to be applicable to the federal and state governments at that time.this intent can not be achieved unless the exclusionary rule applies to unreasonable searches and seizures by tribal police officers in the same manner it applies to unreasonable searches and seizures by agents of the federal and state governments.
even as it has backed away from mapp characterization of th
