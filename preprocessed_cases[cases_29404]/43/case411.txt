this case raises issues at the intersection of administrative,indian,and law.we must decide whether the district court properly enforced an administrative subpoena issued to an indian tribe in connection with an investigation.robert grant,a member of the karuk tribe the tribe and an employee of the karuk tribe housing authority the housing authority,filed an administrative complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc,alleging that he had been terminated because of his age.the eeoc opened an investigation and issued a subpoena to the tribe,which refused to comply on the grounds that the age discrimination in employment act,the adea,does not apply to indian tribes,and that the tribe enjoys sovereign immunity from the eeoc investigation.
the eeoc sought judicial enforcement of the subpoena.the district court issued an order enforcing the subpoena,from which the tribe now appeals.we reverse.
the threshold question is whether the tribe is immune from suit.we conclude that it is not.we next address whether the tribe is subject to the adea in these circumstances.we conclude that it is not.resolution of this issue is a pure question of law that is currently ripe for review and,therefore,is best resolved at the stage,rather than in potential downstream litigation.to hold otherwise would frustrate the regulatory scheme,ignore the special status of the tribe,and subject the tribe to an unnecessary compliance burden.thus,because the adea does not apply to the tribe employment relationship with grant,we conclude that the tribe need not comply with the subpoena.
background 
the karuk tribe housing authority owns housing units on tribal trust land in northern california.the tribe does not have its own reservation but instead occupies land held in trust by the united states.the housing authority,organized and authorized through a tribal ordinance,is a governmental arm of the tribe.the housing authority,which provides safe and affordable housing to members of the tribe,receives funding under the native american housing assistance and act.this legislation,passed in,was particularly concerned with the right of indian and tribal.id.although there is no formal requirement that only tribe members may occupy the units,according to the of the karuk tribe and acting executive director of the karuk tribe housing authority,of the units are occupied by indian families.the record does not reveal how many of the indians who occupy the units are members of the tribe.according to the district court order enforcing the subpoena,the housing authority employed twenty indians and four.
grant,an enrolled member of the tribe,worked as a maintenance supervisor for the housing authority for almost seven years,until he was terminated in november.he was years old at the time of his termination.grant challenged his firing in internal tribal administrative proceedings,which are governed by written policies and procedures.after a hearing,the board of commissioners upheld the housing authority actions.grant further appealed to the tribal council,the highest governing body of the tribe,which rejected his claim as well.
in february,grant filed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc on a standard form,alleging that he had been terminated because of his age the eeoc subsequently opened an investigation based on its purported authority under a.section a provides,the equal employment opportunity commission shall have the power to make investigations and require the keeping of records necessary or appropriate for the administration of this chapter in accordance with the powers and procedures provided in sections and of this title.section a,which is relevant here,provides,
the administrator or his designated representatives may investigate and gather data regarding the wages,hours,and other conditions and practices of employment in any industry subject to this chapter,and may enter and inspect such places and such records and make such transcriptions thereof,question such employees,and investigate such facts,conditions,practices,or matters as he may deem necessary or appropriate to determine whether any person has violated any provision of this chapter,or which may aid in the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
the eeoc served on the tribe a copy of the charge,along with a request for a written position statement and a list of questions.the tribe responded that it would not provide the information,based on its position that the adea does not apply to indian tribes.in march,the eeoc served on the housing authority custodian of records an administrative subpoena seeking various employment records.the tribe responded with a letter explaining that it would not provide the requested information,again based on its view that the eeoc does not have jurisdiction over indian tribes.
the eeoc filed an application to enforce the administrative subpoena in the united states district court for the northern district of california.the district court held that the eeoc has jurisdiction over indian tribes for the purpose of enforcing the adea,granted the eeoc application,and issued an enforcement order.the tribe timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse.
discussion 
tribal sovereign immunity 
as a threshold matter,we first address the tribe contention that it enjoys sovereign immunity from the eeoc inquiry and thus from this lawsuit.it is true that indian tribes do,as a general rule,enjoy sovereign immunity from private lawsuits.santa clara pueblo martinez,d.indian tribes do not,however,enjoy sovereign immunity from suits brought by the federal government.quileute indian tribe babbitt,cir united states yakima tribal court,cir united states red lake band of chippewa indians,cir we conclude that just as a state may not assert sovereign immunity as against the federal government,united states mississippi,d,neither may an indian tribe,as a dependent nation,do so.tribal sovereign immunity may not be asserted against the united states william canby,american indian law ed.tribes are not immune from suits by the united states.
the tribe attempts to circumvent the clear rule that indian tribes do not enjoy sovereign immunity against suits brought by the federal government by arguing that,for these purposes,the eeoc is merely a federal commission and does not act as the united states itself.this argument finds no support.the eeoc is an entity created by congress and is specifically authorized by statute to enforce the adea,through both administrative action and litigation.we know of no principle of law and the tribe does not cite any that differentiates a federal agency such as the eeoc from the united states itself for the purpose of sovereign immunity analysis.
ii.administrative subpoena enforcement 
it bears repeating that we are not confronted here with an suit brought under the adea.rather,the parties to this action have only reached the investigative stage,and this litigation is a suit to enforce an administrative subpoena.before considering the applicability of the adea to the tribe,therefore,we must first determine whether we should reach that question at this stage of the proceedings.
we begin with the supreme court decision in endicott johnson perkins.in endicott johnson,secretary of labor frances perkins issued an administrative subpoena to the petitioner,a government contractor,in the course of an investigation to determine whether the petitioner had violated the act.id.at.notably,the act applies only to contractors who voluntarily enter into competition to obtain government business on terms of which they are fairly forewarned by inclusion in the contract.id.at.the petitioner argued that he was not required to comply with the subpoena because the alleged violations of the act occurred in plants that were not involved in government work and,therefore,were not covered by the act.id.at.stating that t he evidence sought by the subpoena was not plainly incompetent or irrelevant to any lawful purpose of the secretary in the discharge of her duties under the act,the supreme court concluded that the subpoena should be enforced and that the question whether the secretary had identified true violations of the act could be resolved at a later stage of the proceedings.id.at.
the principle of endicott courts should not refuse to enforce an administrative subpoena when confronted by a claim regarding coverage or compliance with the been consistently reaffirmed by the supreme court.press publ g walling.united states morton salt.united states powell,d.it is also alive and well in this circuit,as illustrated by eeoc children hospital medical center,cir en banc,which sets forth current law governing the permissible grounds for challenging an administrative subpoena.in children hospital,a private,race discrimination suit ended with a consent decree.after entry of the consent decree,three employees filed claims with the eeoc against the hospital.the eeoc issued administrative subpoenas to the hospital,which refused to comply on the ground that any claims against the hospital were barred by the res judicata effect of the consent decree.the district court agreed with the hospital,reasoning that the eeoc lacked jurisdiction over the hospital because of the consent decree.id.at.
this court reversed,holding that it was premature to address the res judicata issue when the only action pending was litigation over enforcement of the administrative subpoenas.as we explained 
the scope of the judicial inquiry in an eeoc or any other agency subpoena enforcement proceeding is quite narrow.the critical questions are whether congress has granted the authority to investigate whether procedural requirements have been followed and whether the evidence is relevant and material to the investigation.
id.at citing,inter alia,endicott johnson,at.press publ g,at.morton salt,at.powell,at.put another way,courts must enforce administrative subpoenas unless the evidence sought by the subpoena is plainly incompetent or irrelevant to any lawful purpose of the agency.fed.comm port of seattle,cir quoting endicott johnson,at.thus,in children hospital,whether res judicata might bar a subsequent lawsuit was simply irrelevant to the inquiry whether the eeoc could issue administrative subpoenas that might uncover evidence for use in a later lawsuit a party may not defeat agency authority to investigate with a claim that could be a defense if the agency subsequently decides to bring an action against it.at see also,pac.ass quinn,cir party may not raise a factually disputed defense in a challenge to an administrative subpoena.
the general rule of endicott johnson in favor of enforcement of administrative subpoenas thus stands.but it is not absolute.although a party may not avoid an administrative subpoena on the ground that it has a valid defense to a potential subsequent lawsuit,such a challenge may,in limited circumstances,be mounted when the defense raised is jurisdictional in,when the agency lacks jurisdiction over the subject of the investigation.see marshall burlington northern,cir noting that judicial determination of agency jurisdiction prior to exhaustion is limited.but even where this exception is concerned,the role of a court reviewing a subpoena attacked on jurisdictional grounds is strictly limited.casey ftc,cir.as long as the evidence sought is relevant,material and there is some plausible ground for jurisdiction,or to phrase it another way,unless jurisdiction is plainly lacking,the court should enforce the subpoena.children hospital,at quoting burlington northern,at.
despite these seemingly straightforward ground rules,the inquiry into administrative subpoenas has been complicated by the fact that the words coverage and jurisdiction are sometimes used interchangeably,and often imprecisely.see,marshall able contractors,cir port of seattle,at reich great lakes indian fish wildlife comm n,cir.it is important to differentiate coverage from jurisdiction,because these two different sorts of challenges lead to different results factual challenges based on a lack of statutory coverage are clearly not permitted,see endicott johnson,at.press publ g,at,while challenges based on jurisdiction may,in certain circumstances,result in a refusal to enforce a subpoena,see great lakes,at burlington northern,at.
this distinction is not merely semantic.there is a difference,particularly in the case of an indian tribe,between the determination whether an agency has regulatory jurisdiction to enforce a subpoena in the first instance,and the very different question whether a subpoena recipient has a defense to liability under the applicable statute.
here,the tribe challenge to the eeoc the adea does not apply to indian tribes,and that it enjoys sovereign immunity from the eeoc into a narrow category of cases that is ripe for determination at the enforcement stage.our approach is consistent with burlington northern,where we held in the context of an occupational safety and health administration osha inspection that 
j udicial intervention prior to an agency initial determination of its jurisdiction is appropriate only where there is clear evidence that exhaustion of administrative remedies will result in irreparable injury the agency jurisdiction is plainly lacking and the agency special expertise will be of no help on the question of its jurisdiction.
at.assuming that the tribe is correct in its analysis with respect to jurisdiction,the prejudice of subjecting the tribe to a subpoena for which the agency does not have jurisdiction results in irreparable injury the tribe sovereignty.in addition,the eeoc does not have special expertise in interpretation of statutes with respect to indians.by contrast,this special circumstance was not present in burlington northern.
for similar reasons,this case is also unlike endicott johnson and children hospital.both of those decisions involved parties that were clearly subject to the federal laws that authorized the administrative investigations.the questions that those courts declined to resolve concerned potential defenses to enforcement actions.in both cases,because the subpoenaed parties could,under some set of facts,be found in violation of federal law,it made sense for the court not to adjudicate the parties defenses at the administrative subpoena stage.
in juxtaposition,this case presents the question whether the karuk tribe housing authority,in its role as grant employer,is subject to the adea at all,whatever the facts of the actual discrimination charge may be.the tribe asserts that it falls into a category of entity not subject to the adea,and thus not subject to investigation by the eeoc.whether this is so is a pure question of law,the resolution of which does not depend on a factual inquiry,and which would not undermine the role of subpoena enforcement actions as summary procedure s designed to allow speedy investigation of eeoc charges.eeoc regis paper,cir.
here the jurisdictional question is particularly sensitive because it involves the karuk tribe,which,like other tribes,enjoys a unique legal status as a sovereign.see montana blackfeet tribe,d.in this context,the prejudice from compliance is real.see great lakes,at the commission should not be burdened with having to comply with a subpoena if,as the district court believed,the agency issuing it has no jurisdiction to regulate the wages that the commission pays.questions of regulatory jurisdiction are properly addressed at the stage if,as here,they are ripe for determination at that stage.compliance with a subpoena is a burden,and one that a person or institution that can show it is not subject to the regulatory regime in aid of which the subpoena was issued should not be required to bear.citations omitted see also eeoc cherokee nation,cir adjudicating issue of applicability of the adea to indian tribes in the context of a subpoena enforcement action.the tribe challenge to the eeoc administrative subpoena is jurisdictional in nature and thus may be resolved here as a matter of law.
iii.applicability of the adea to indian tribes 
we thus turn to the substantive issue in this case whether the tribe is subject to the adea in its role as grant employer.our starting point in analyzing whether a federal statute applies to tribes is federal power commission tu
