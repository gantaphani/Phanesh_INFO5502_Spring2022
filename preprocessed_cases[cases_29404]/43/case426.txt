the cabazon band of mission indians the tribe appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to appellees,officials of the riverside county,california,sheriff department the sheriff,in the tribe suit challenging the application of certain provisions of the california vehicle code to tribal police vehicles traveling on public highways located off the reservation.we affirm.
the essential facts of this case are undisputed.the cabazon indian reservation is located in southern california.the tribe has a public safety department which provides law enforcement services on the reservation.armed and uniformed cabazon public safety officers drive dark blue vehicles marked on the sides and the rear with the words tribal law enforcement and with the name cabazon marked on the sides.
the reservation consists of three noncontiguous parcels of land.because of physical and geographical barriers,it is not possible to drive between the different parcels without leaving the reservation.consequently,the public safety department vehicles must drive on sections of public highways located off the reservation in order to provide law enforcement services to the entire reservation.
prior to the instant conflict,the public safety vehicles had emergency light bars affixed to their roofs.however,various provisions of the california vehicle code limit the use or display of emergency light bars to authorized emergency vehicles performing emergency services moreover,only such authorized emergency vehicles are exempt from certain traffic safety regulations when responding to an emergency on several occasions before the commencement of this suit,the sheriff stopped cabazon public safety officers driving their official vehicles on public highways located off the reservation and cited the officers for displaying emergency light bars,on the ground that the tribal vehicles were not authorized emergency vehicles within the meaning of the code to avoid further conflict,the tribe director of public safety ordered the light bars removed.however,the director maintains that operating the public safety vehicles without light bars,or with covered light bars,threatens the safety of his officers and compromises their ability to perform their duties.
the tribe and its director of public safety,in his official capacity,filed suit in the united states district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against appellees individually and in their capacities as officials of the riverside county sheriff department.plaintiffs argued,in the words of the district court,that cabazon public safety department vehicles should be treated like those of other law enforcement agencies operating in california.the tribe sought,inter alia,a declaration that the sections of the california vehicle code regulating the use of emergency light bars were preempted by the tribe sovereign authority to establish and operate a police department to enforce the criminal law on reservation lands and an injunction preventing the sheriff from interfering with tribal public safety vehicles displaying emergency light bars when they travel between these noncontiguous parcels of reservation land.
the district court found,and the parties do not dispute,that the cabazon public safety department police vehicles do not fit within california definition of authorized emergency vehicles,contained in section of the vehicle code.the court also found that the state interests in regulating the operation of emergency vehicles are sufficient to overcome whatever interference with tribal law enforcement efforts has been caused by precluding the use of light bars,and,as a result,the general federal policy of supporting tribal law enforcement efforts does not preempt valid state regulation of activities in this situation.finally,it also found that application of the state vehicle code in this situation did not constitute an undue or excessive burden on the tribe ability to perform effectively its law enforcement functions.as a result,the court denied the tribe motion for summary judgment on its claims and entered judgment for the sheriff.that decision is the subject of the present appeal 
the district court order granting or denying summary judgment is reviewed de novo summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
it may be helpful to begin our discussion of the law applicable to this complex area with a brief statement of what this case does not involve.we are not here dealing with an assertion of state law over indians who undertake activity on an indian reservation nor is this a case where the state seeks to reach who undertake activity on an indian reservation rather,this case involves the issue of whether a state may enforce its vehicle code against tribal police vehicles when they travel on public highways located off the reservation.
the principle governing resolution of this case was announced in mescalero apache tribe jones mescalero i in that case,the supreme court stated that a bsent express federal law to the contrary,indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the state.the court then applied this principle to uphold new mexico rights to collect a nondiscriminatory gross receipts tax from a ski resort owned and operated by the tribe but located in doing so,the court reasoned that because tribal activities conducted outside the reservation present different considerations than those on the reservation,the s tate authority over indians is yet more extensive over activities not on any reservation.furthermore,the mescalero i court concluded that this principle was not limited to the facts or particular context of the case before it 
the tribe claim that sections of the california vehicle code regulating the use of emergency light bars are preempted by the tribe sovereign authority to establish and operate a police department ignores this principle governing a state regulatory authority over tribal activities.the tribe does not claim that a specific federal law expressly provides for the preemption of the vehicle code provisions at issue here instead,it merely points to a number of federal laws that purportedly demonstrate a general federal policy of promoting tribal and encouraging tribal law enforcement efforts.thus,because there is no express federal law to the contrary,and because it is undisputed that california vehicle code is state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the state,the challenged code sections apply to the tribe police vehicles when they travel on public highways located off the reservation.
the district court did not rely on mescalero i,but instead invoked the court decision in white mountain apache tribe bracker for the proposition that t he extent of tribal sovereignty clearly involves more than simple geographical limits,but includes the tradition of indian sovereignty over the reservation and tribal members.in white mountain,the court undertook a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,federal,and tribal interests at stake and held that arizona application of its motor carrier license and use fuel taxes to a logging company operation was preempted by federal law consistent with white mountain instruction,the district court weighed the competing interests in this case and concluded that the state interest in regulating the operation of emergency vehicles sufficiently outweighed the federal and tribal interests at stake such that the sections of the california vehicle code regulating the use of emergency light bars were not preempted as applied to the tribe.
however,white mountain preemption analysis is not applicable to activity white mountain involved only the activity of a company in fact,the white mountain court expressly recognized the dichotomy between a state authority to enforce otherwise nondiscriminatory state law off and,stating that i n the case of indians going beyond reservation boundaries,a nondiscriminatory state law is generally applicable in the absence of express federal law to the contrary.
the dissent suggests that the white mountain court intended for its preemption analysis to apply more generally,as when difficult questions arise concerning the interplay between state law,tribal sovereignty and federal policy concerning of the tribes.however,that proposition is mistakenly derived from the following statement in white mountain 
when conduct involving only indians is at issue,state law is generally inapplicable,for the state regulatory interest is likely to be minimal and the federal interest in encouraging tribal is at its strongest.more difficult questions arise where,as here,a state asserts authority over the conduct of engaging in activity on the reservation.in such cases we have conducted a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,federal,and tribal interests at stake 
this passage clearly indicates that the white mountain court was only addressing the difficult question of applying state law to the activity of when it announced its now famous preemption analysis.in light of this passage and the white mountain court recognition of the dichotomy between a state authority to enforce otherwise nondiscriminatory state law off and,there is simply no basis for concluding that white mountain preemption analysis can apply to activity.
moreover,supreme court authority interpreting white mountain makes clear that white mountain preemption with its concern for sovereignty not apply when the issue is whether state law applies.in new mexico mescalero apache tribe mescalero ii,the state application of its hunting and fishing laws to nonmembers of the tribe on the reservation was preempted by operation of federal law the court stated 
in white mountain apache tribe bracker,we reviewed our prior decisions concerning tribal and state authority over indian reservations and extracted certain principles governing the determination whether federal law preempts the assertion of state authority over nonmembers on a reservation.we stated that that determination does not depend on mechanical or absolute conceptions of state or tribal sovereignty,but calls for a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,federal,and tribal interests at stake.
the mescalero ii court went on to note that,in white mountain,it emphasized the special sense in which the doctrine of preemption is applied in this context and that b y resting preemption analysis principally on a consideration of the nature of the competing interests at stake,our cases have rejected the proposition that preemption requires an express congressional statement to that effect.however,at the same time,the mescalero ii court noted that o ur cases have recognized that tribal sovereignty contains a significant geographical component,and,as a result,the activities of indians are generally subject to the prescriptions of a nondiscriminatory state law in the absence of express federal law to the contrary.this statement,appearing after the court rejected the requirement for an express congressional statement when applying white mountain preemption analysis,confirms that white mountain preemption analysis does not apply when the issue is whether state law applies 
salt river indian cmty.yavapai county buttresses this conclusion.in that case,we applied mescalero i to uphold arizona imposition of its property tax on a tribe commercial property located off the reservation in doing so,we did not discuss any sovereignty considerations,nor did we undertake a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,federal,and tribal interests at stake instead,we only addressed whether imposition of the tax was discriminatory 
the tribe reliance on kiowa tribe of oklahoma manufacturing technologies,is misplaced.kiowa tribe concerned whether a tribe sovereign immunity barred a civil suit against the tribe in state court,where the activity giving rise to the suit occurred off the reservation in holding that immunity did bar the suit,the supreme court clearly indicated that its decision did not erode the principle that generally applicable laws apply to indians the court explained to say substantive state laws apply to conduct,however,is not to say that a tribe no longer enjoys immunity from suit there is a difference between the right to demand compliance with state laws and the means available to enforce them.
for its part,the government,as amicus,points to our decision in in re blue lake forest products,as support for the position that this case is not governed by mescalero i,but rather must be decided under white mountain preemption analysis.blue lake involved a dispute between a tribe and a bank over the proceeds of the tribe sale to blue lake,a commercial company located off the reservation,of logs harvested from tribal lands.blue lake gave the bank a security interest in its property,failed to pay for the logs,and went bankrupt.the bankruptcy court authorized blue lake to process and sell the logs and then deposit the proceeds with the bank.the tribe claimed the proceeds under a federal statute which specified that title to indian timber held in trust by the united states can not pass until the buyer first pays for it,and the bank claimed the proceeds under state commercial law we concluded that the relevant tribal activity occurred 
even though this case implicates an relationship between two actors blue lake and the bank,we deem it an case for purposes of preemption because the essential conduct at issue occurred on the reservation the severance of timber and its removal without proper compensation,in contravention of the governing contract and federal regulations.furthermore,the indian enterprise at the heart of this timbering located on,not off,the reservation 
contrary to the government argument,blue lake does not stand for the proposition that,in certain limited instances,tribal activities occurring may be deemed to occur for purposes of applying white mountain preemption analysis.blue lake merely stands for the proposition that,when determining whether to apply white mountain preemption analysis,a court should focus on the location of the tribal activity which gave rise to the dispute over application of state law,even if that dispute also involves an relationship between actors.here,unlike in blue lake,the tribe activity that gave rise to this dispute over application of certain sections of the california vehicle code occurred.thus,nothing in blue lake requires us to reach a different result here.
finally,the dissent argues that even if we apply the principle announced in mescalero i,the sections of the california vehicle code regulating the use of emergency light bars could not be applied to the tribe police vehicles because doing so would discriminate against the tribe.it cites our decision in salt river indian community,which held that arizona tax on a tribe commercial property located off the reservation was not discriminatory because the tribe was similarly situated with arizona sister states whose property in arizona was not exempt from taxation according to the dissent,because law enforcement vehicles from border states can operate inside california within miles of the border,light bars intact the tribe must also be permitted to display emergency light bars when it drives its police vehicles on public highways between its three noncontiguous parcels of land.
in salt river,we applied the rule that a tax is discriminatory if it is not imposed equally upon similarly situated groups.in doing so,we could not have intended to make the similarly situated rule applicable in every case which requires us to decide whether a tribe is subject to state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the state.the similarly situated rule is not appropriate in all such cases,and it is certainly not appropriate in this case,where it is undisputed that the challenged vehicle code sections apply,with limited exceptions,to all individuals and entities within california 
that california permits law enforcement vehicles from its sister states to drive on its highways while displaying emergency light bars does not make enforcement of these code sections against the tribe discriminatory.t ribal reservations are not states,and the decision whether to grant the tribe the same status as these other states rests with the legislature.while there may be policy arguments in favor of permitting the tribe to display emergency light bars when it drives its police vehicles on public highways between its three noncontiguous parcels of land,it is inappropriate for us to substitute our judgment for that of the state elected representatives we simply can not accept the argument that exceptions to a law of general applicability automatically make that law discriminatory when applied to someone else.
supreme court authority instructs that the principle governing the instant case is as follows absent express federal law to the contrary,indians going beyond reservation boundaries are generally subject to state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the state.here,because there is no express federal law to the contrary,and because it is undisputed that california vehicle code is state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the state,the challenged code sections apply to the tribe police vehicles when they travel on public highways located off the reservation.
i respectfully dissent.
the cabazon indian reservation is located in southern california,but because of the vagaries of geography and history,is not contiguous.rather,it is divided into four different sections,which requires one to travel on either state and county maintained roads or interstate to get from one section to another.
on several occasions before the commencement of this suit,the riverside county sheriff stopped cabazon tribal police,driving in official vehicles on public highways,and cited the officers for displaying emergency light bars.in one instance,the tribal officer was on his way to a situation in another part of the reservation in which an individual died.because of the continued enforcement against the tribal police by the sheriff department,the tribe director of public safety first ordered the light bars covered when,then removed because of problems with covering the lights.the director maintains that operating the public safety vehicles without light bars,or with covered light bars,threatens the safety of his officers and comprises their ability to perform their duties.
applicable law 
the appellees have suggested that this is a case dependent on the issue of whether a state may enforce its vehicle code against tribal members when they travel on public highways located off the reservation.for the proposition that the state law is enforceable against the tribe without consideration of tribal interests,they rely on mescalero apache tribe jones mescalero i in mescalero i the supreme court stated a bsent express federal law to the contrary,indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to non discriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the state.the court applied this principle to uphold new mexico right to collect a nondiscriminatory gross receipts tax from a ski resort owned and operated by the tribe but located off the reservation 
the issue in this case is more complex than that stated by appellees.the tribe police cars are equipped with light bars,like those of almost every jurisdiction police force.light bars are useful,even necessary,in the tribe pursuit of law and order on its reservation.however,in order to fulfill its duties to the members of its tribe,the tribal police must incidentally and occasionally use state and federal highways patrolled by riverside county.thus,the tribal police infringement on the state ability to regulate the use of light bars on its roads is both limited and necessary to accomplish the tribe federally mandated duties to provide police services to its members.
moreover,unlike the cases cited by the appellees and the majority,the case before us concerns an essential government than merely fiscal matters such as the imposition of state taxes which do not implicate threats to life and limb.
the district court appears to have recognized this complexity and did not rely on mescalero i,but instead invoked the court later decision in white mountain apache tribe bracker for the proposition that t he extent of tribal sovereignty clearly involves more than simple geographical limits,but includes the tradition of indian sovereignty over the reservation and tribal members.
appellees and the majority suggest,however,that the application of white mountain apache bracker was incorrect,because the preemption analysis used in that case is only applicable in situations that occur on the reservation.the supreme court stated in a footnote to white mountain apache,that i n the case of indians going beyond reservation boundaries,however,a nondiscriminatory state law is generally applicable in the absence of express federal law to the contrary.however,since the decision on white mountain apache bracker in,the court has continued to reiterate the more flexible analysis used in that case,without any particular emphasis on it applying only in situations occurring on reservations particularly instructive is the court statement that when difficult questions arise concerning the interplay between state law,tribal sovereignty and federal policy concerning of the tribes,the inquiry should not be dependent on mechanical or absolute conceptions of state or tribal sovereignty,but calls for a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,federal and tribal interests at stake,to determine,whether in that particular context,the exercise of state authority would violate federal law even the court in mescalero apache tribe jones recognized that the application of state law was only a generality and not carved in stone on sinai this is particularly true in this case,where the tribe ability to police its own members on the reservation is affected by state laws that affect de minimus conduct off the reservation.
the appropriate application of this analysis is evident in queets band of indians state of washington queets,although vacated by this court,is well reasoned and a proper statement of the law after a complete review of the applicable supreme court cases.queets is instructive and persuasive,although the vacation of the opinion does not allow us to rely on it as controlling.it was vacated at the request of the parties to accommodate a legislative resolution,not because it was defective.since the court has never renounced the result or rationale of queets on substantive legal grounds we should accept the vacated opinion as solidly reasoned and formally embrace it as of precedential value.
the queets,a federally recognized tribe,had asked the state of washington to provide license plates for tribal vehicles at the nominal fee charged to state agencies and local governments.the state refused,and so the tribe adopted its own licensing and registration system for tribal vehicles engaged in government services.although the tribe made allowances for reciprocity with other jurisdictions,the state did not consider the tribe to be a jurisdiction entitled to reciprocity under its statutes and cited tribal vehicles,traveling on state patrolled highways within the reservation,for being improperly licensed.
as a starting point for its analysis the court determined that the tribe had the inherent authority to register tribal vehicles and issue tribal license plates for their government vehicles.the court held the tribe licensing and registering of their tribal vehicles carried with it sufficient preemptive force to require that the state of washington afford reciprocal recognition.this decision was an accommodation of the interests of the tribe and federal government in promoting and sovereignty and those of the state likewise,here the balance between the state interest in regulating the use of light bars on emergency vehicles is preempted by the tribe interest in maintaining an effective police force on its reservation.
b.the state interest 
although the state allows public and ambulances,forestry and fire department vehicles,vehicles owned by the state or bridge and highway districts,vehicle
