cascadia wildlands,oregon wild and umpqua watersheds collectively,cascadia challenge the bureau of indian affairs bia approval of the middle forks kokwel timber sale the kokwel project,a plan by the coquille indian tribe the tribe to harvest acres of timber in the coquille forest in southwest oregon.cascadia argues the bia violated the national environmental policy act nepa,et,because it did not adequately consider the cumulative environmental impact of the kokwel project in light of a previously approved harvest,the project,on adjacent and overlapping land.cascadia also argues the kokwel project violates the coquille restoration act cra,et,because the project is inconsistent with the fish and wildlife service fws recovery plan for the northern spotted owl.
the district court granted summary judgment to the bia and the tribe on both claims we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.first,the bia and the tribe did not violate nepa by aggregating the project,which had been approved,but not yet completed,as part of the environmental baseline against which the incremental impact of the kokwel project was considered.second,the cra does not require compliance with the recovery plan for the northern spotted owl.
background 
the coquille forest comprises acres of land along the southwest oregon coast that was restored to the coquille indian tribe in by an amendment to the coquille restoration act.see.under the cra,the forest is held in trust by the federal government and managed for the benefit of the tribe.see id.b,d.
in and,the bia approved two different proposals by the tribe to harvest timber in the coquille forest.in,the bia approved the project,which called for acres of regeneration harvest,acres of density management and acres of commercial thinning between and the purposes of the project were to generate money for the tribe and manage forest growth.the project also called for the construction of miles of roads in the forest.the bia and the tribe conducted an environmental assessment ea,which estimated the project would create between and jobs and over million in revenue through the sale of million board feet of timber.
the ea also found the project likely would adversely affect the northern spotted owl,an endangered species living in the coquille forest,by removing acres of suitable habitat.the ea noted,however,that there were no occupied owl habitats within the project area,and no owl nest sites within miles of the project area.based on the ea,the bia issued a finding of no significant impact fonsi and approved the project in february,without conducting an environmental impact statement eis.
in,the bia approved a second project the kokwel project to conduct an additional acres of regeneration harvest,acres of commercial thinning and acres of density management in the coquille forest over years.the kokwel project was planned on land adjacent to,and overlapping with,the project.the primary purpose of the kokwel project was to generate money for the tribe.the bia and the tribe conducted an ea,which estimated the kokwel project would create direct jobs,indirect jobs and over million in revenue through the sale of million board feet of timber.
fws performed a biological assessment and concluded the kokwel project likely would adversely affect the northern spotted owl,and would take up to northern spotted owls at four sites therefore,fws concluded the kokwel project was inconsistent with its recovery plan for the northern spotted owl the recovery plan calls for the conservation of spotted owl habitat to provide additional demographic support to the spotted owl population,and directs land managers to work with fws to maintain and restore particularly spotted owl habitat stands.fws also found,however,that b ecause there will be less than one percent of nesting,roosting and foresting habitat loss in the acre analysis area,this habitat loss will not significantly impact the provincial habitat conditions that provide for spotted owls,or jeopardize the continued existence of the spotted owl.
in the ea,the bia and the tribe agreed with the fws that the kokwel project was likely to adversely affect the northern spotted owl by removing acres of suitable habitat.the ea then analyzed the cumulative impact of the kokwel project by comparing it against an environmental baseline,or no action alternative.the no action alternative described the existing condition and the continuing trends,assuming o ngoing activities would continue to occur on existing projects,including other projects covered by earlier decision records.the ea explained that it would aggregate other projects into the no action alternative,rather than individually discuss them 
the following descriptions of the no action alternative and the proposed action assume the combined relevant effects of all past actions.it is not necessary to individually identify or catalog these past actions as the description of the affected environment incorporates all those actions.for the cumulative effects analysis the description of the potential resulting impacts is the cumulative effect of all past,present and reasonably foreseeable actions.reasonably foreseeable future actions are assumed to be the same for the no action as well as the proposed action.stands are expected to be selectively harvested approximately every to years current timber management on the surrounding private land is more intensive and occurs on a larger scale at rotations as short as to years table lists treatments proposed for the foreseeable future on the tribe lands in the analysis area that will be considered in the following cumulative impact discussions.other incidental use of the tribe lands such as recreational use is expected to continue at rates similar to those of the past ten years.
table listed only one treatment proposed for the foreseeable future the project.the ea cumulative impact discussions did not individually analyze the impact of any specific past,present or reasonably foreseeable action.with respect to the northern spotted owl,the ea said the middle fork coquille river watershed,which contains the coquille forest,has approximately acres of habitat,and approximately acres of current nesting,roosting and foraging habitat.the ea presented a table,called impacts of the proposed action on northern spotted owl nest patches,core areas,and home ranges.the table compared current acres of northern spotted owl habitat,elsewhere listed as acres,with post acres.the table showed the kokwel project would not reduce any northern spotted owl habitat within a nest patch meters or core area half mile,and would reduce habitat within the home ranges miles of four historic owl sites from to acres.thus,the ea concluded the kokwel project would reduce the amount of nesting,roosting and foraging habitat within northern spotted owl home ranges by a cumulative of approximately seven percent.
based on these data,the ea concluded the cumulative effects from the kokwel project and other foreseeable projects would not appreciably diminish spotted owl suitable habitat.it explained,m ost of the owl core areas occur on bureau of land management lands within the watershed these areas are not expected to change substantially over time.furthermore,though the project would have an incremental impact of reducing habitat by seven percent,the ea also found,o verall,the habitat would benefit from opening of the canopy,encouraging development of a canopy and encouraging tree and understory growth.
relying on the ea,the bia in february issued a fonsi and approved the project,without conducting an eis.cascadia challenged the bia decision in the district court,and the court granted summary judgment to the bia and the tribe.cascadia appeals.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see.wilderness ass connell,cir.we review cascadia nepa and cra claims under the administrative procedures act apa.see id.under the apa,an agency decision will be set aside if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.review under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow,and we do not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.ecology ctr.castaneda,cir alterations omitted quoting lands council mcnair lands council ii,cir en banc,overruled on other grounds by winter natural res.def.council,d internal quotation marks omitted.rather,we will reverse a decision as arbitrary and capricious only if the agency relied on factors congress did not intend it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,or offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence before the agency or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.id.quoting lands council ii,at internal quotation marks omitted.
discussion 
cascadia argues the bia and the tribe violated nepa because they did not adequately consider the cumulative impacts of the kokwel project in light of the project.the purpose of nepa is to require disclosure of relevant environmental considerations that were given a hard look by the agency,and thereby to permit informed public comment on proposed action and any choices or alternatives that might be pursued with less environmental harm.lands council powell,cir.to that end,nepa imposes procedural requirements,but not substantive outcomes,on agency action.id.at.
nepa requires the preparation of an eis for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.as a preliminary step,an agency may prepare an ea to decide whether the environmental impact of a proposed action is significant enough to warrant preparation of an eis.blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir citing.
an ea is a concise public document that b riefly provide s sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis or a finding of no significant impact.a.if an agency decides not to prepare an eis,it must supply a convincing statement of reasons to explain why a project impacts are insignificant.the statement of reasons is crucial to determining whether the agency took a hard look at the potential environmental impact of a project.blue mountains biodiversity project,at citation omitted quoting save the yaak comm.block,cir.
to determine whether a proposed action will significantly impact the human environment,nepa directs agencies to consider w hether the action is related to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant impacts.b.significance exists if it is reasonable to anticipate a cumulatively significant impact on the environment.id.cumulative impact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.id.emphasis removed.
t he general rule under nepa is that,in assessing cumulative effects,the agency must give a sufficiently detailed catalogue of past,present,and future projects,and provide adequate analysis about how these projects,and differences between the projects,are thought to have impacted the environment.lands council,at.an agency,however,may satisfy nepa by aggregating the cumulative effects of past projects into an environmental baseline,against which the incremental impact of a proposed project is measured.see castaneda,at league of wilderness defenders blue mountains biodiversity project forest serv.lowd,cir.
cascadia concedes the cumulative impact of past actions may be aggregated.it contends,however,that the bia was not permitted to aggregate the project,because it is not a past action,but a reasonably foreseeable future action castaneda and lowd did not reach that question.both cases involved disputes regarding the aggregation of past projects.see castaneda,at wildwest complains the cumulative impact statements do not contain discussion of prior projects on an individual basis.lowd,at lowd contends that the cumulative effects analysis regarding past timber sales is insufficient because it only mentions one past timber sale and otherwise generally states that timber harvest has occurred in the past.second alteration in original.
agencies,however,have discretion in deciding how to organize and present information in environmental assessments.see.wilderness ass n,at.lowd explained 
o ur law requires us to defer to an agency determination in an area involving a high level of technical expertise and we are not free to impose on the agency our own notion of which procedures are best or most likely to further some vague,undefined public good accordingly,to the extent that does not explicitly provide otherwise,the forest service is free to consider cumulative effects in the aggregate or to use any other procedure it deems appropriate.it is not for this court to tell the forest service what specific evidence to include,nor how specifically to present it.at citations,alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
that reasoning applies to projects that have been approved,following an independent environmental assessment under nepa,just as it applies to projects that have been completed.thus,does not explicitly require individual discussion of the impacts of reasonably foreseeable projects,and,absent such a requirement,it is not for the court to tell the agency how specifically to present such evidence in an ea.
our role is to ensure that the agency takes a hard look at the cumulative environmental consequences of the proposed project,and provides a clear explanation of its analysis to enable informed public comment on the project and possible alternatives.see lands council,at.an agency can take a hard look at cumulative impacts either by individually discussing a previously approved project,or incorporating the expected impact of such a project into the environmental baseline against which the incremental impact of a proposed project is measured.under either approach,what is important is that the agency make clear it has considered the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions.
our holding that the aggregation of future projects can be permissible under nepa does not require the public to blindly accept an agency conclusory assertions,as cascadia argues.we are mindful that one of the twin aims of nepa is to ensure that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.balt.gas natural res.def.council,d.when an agency chooses to aggregate reasonably foreseeable projects,it must be clear from the record that the cumulative effects of the prior proposals were considered by both the drafting and approving agencies.piedmont heights civic club,moreland,cir.here,the kokwel ea identified the project as a reasonably foreseeable project that would be considered as part of the baseline,the no action alternative.the expected impacts of the project,in turn,were set forth in detail in the ea.
our holding also is in accord with two circuits that have addressed this question.see coal.on sensible,dole,it makes sense to consider the incremental impact of a project for possible cumulative effects by incorporating the effects of previously approved projects into the background data base of the project at issue,rather than by restating the results of the prior studies.piedmont heights civic club,at nepa does not require an agency to restate all of the environmental effects of other projects presently under consideration.where the underlying data base includes approved projects and pending proposals,the statutory minima of nepa has been met.quoting.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d.as the circuit recognized in coalition for sensible transportation,incorporating the effects of other projects into the background data base of the project at issue can be sufficient to alert interested members of the public to any arguable cumulative impacts involving these other projects.at.any further analysis would be redundant and in no material way serve the purposes of nepa.id.at.
cascadia argues that,even if it is permissible to agg
