this case construes an appropriation made under the indian and education assistance act.we hold that the agency interpretation of the congressional appropriation of funds was consistent with congressional intent and reverse the district court award of additional funding for contract support costs.
under the indian and education assistance act indian tribes are encouraged to take over administration of various programs that the federal government used to administer for their benefit.on the fort hall reservation in idaho,the tribes took over administration of various health programs from the indian health service,which had previously funded community health care programs.
under the indian and education assistance act,the tribes may take over not only the direct operations of the programs,but also administrative functions of the agency that support the delivery of services to the indians.the statute provides that along with the programs,the tribes get the money that the government would otherwise have used to administer and perform the services the government is not allowed to save money by hiring the tribes to perform the programs for less money than the government would have spent.the statute provides that contracts between the government and the tribes for tribal takeover of programs have to include money that shall not be less than the appropriate secretary would have otherwise provided for the operation of the programs or portions thereof for the period covered by the contract.nor is the government allowed to save money on administration.it has to include in contracts with the tribes money covering contract support costs for management expenses,even for tasks that normally are not carried on by the respective secretary in his direct operation of the program.
this appeal concerns contract support costs,that is,overhead that the tribes attribute to managing the health care program they took over from the government.the money at issue is from the appropriation for the fiscal year.the statute at issue is the appropriation for that year not a codified law of general application.the indian health service contends that the money for contract support costs was limited to a single pot too small to cover all the tribes that applied,so it awarded it on a first come,first served basis the service says that it ran out of money before the tribes got to the head of the line.
argues that the way the appropriation law is worded,the service has to provide the money for contract support costs,either out of that appropriation,or out of other money appropriated to the service if the part of the indian health service appropriation designated for contract support costs is exhausted.the district court ruled in favor of the tribes on summary judgment,and the government appeals.the tribes and the government have agreed on the amount of money the tribes should get if they prevail,and it has been deposited in the registry of the district court.
the district court had jurisdiction,because the statute expressly confers jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the indian and education assistance act on the district courts the final judgment was timely appealed 
argues that it had a contractual right,not just a statutory right,to contract support cost funding.but the language in its contract expressly precludes an independent claim on that basis.it says that the secretary obligation is subject to the availability of appropriations.thus,the argument has to come back to what the appropriation means.
because of the express language subjecting provision of indian and education assistance act funds to availability of appropriations,and the clear statement that this limitation applies notwithstanding any other provision in this act,congress has plainly excluded the possibility of construing the contract support costs provision as an entitlement that exists independently of whether congress appropriates money to cover it.thus,the only substantial issue in the case is whether congress did or did not appropriate the money.the federal circuit and the district of columbia circuit have reached the same conclusion 
congress appropriated approximately billion to the indian health service in of the billion,million was appropriated for transitional costs of tribal contracts,which the parties agree are what is at issue the parties disagree on how to construe the appropriation.the government argues that it had no obligation to spend more than the million appropriation on contract support costs.the tribes argue that the million is not a ceiling,and where additional contract support costs were applied for,the indian health service was obligated to pay for them out of its remaining billion appropriation.similar issues were litigated in the federal circuit and the district of columbia circuit.the federal circuit concluded,and the district of columbia circuit noted,that the smaller appropriation for contract support costs was all that was available to the tribes in those cases that would be the end of the case,and we would simply note our agreement with our sister circuits,except that those cases considered a different appropriation with slightly different wording.
in oglala sioux,congress had appropriated billion for native american programs of which not to exceed shall be for contract support costs.the appropriation for fiscal year,at issue in the case at bar,does not say not to exceed million by contrast,the fiscal year appropriation said not to exceed roughly million instead the appropriation now at issue says f or expenses necessary to carry out the act followed by a string of provisos the last of the provisos says that of the billion,million shall remain available until expended for items including the contract support costs at issue the question is whether this wording means that only million is available for contract support costs,or that the entire billion is available.
the district court granted summary judgment to the tribes on the theory that,unless the indian health service showed that covering the tribes contract support costs would reduce availability of funds to other tribes,the service had to use its general billion appropriation,not just the million,to cover contract support costs.
the problem of tribal claims exceeding amounts appropriated for them has gone on for some time,so the indian health service issued indian memorandum in july of to establish an administrative policy for dealing with it.the memorandum defines contract support costs and establishes procedures for computing and awarding them.it has various procedures to deal with shortfalls in different circumstances,such as putting unfulfilled requests first in a subsequent year,selecting requests based on the earliest receipt date,and distributing funds according to each contractor proportion of total need.the memorandum treats the total available as the indian fund,and the service allocated the million to this fund for the fiscal year.
the appropriation language is arguably ambiguous.the language,million shall remain available until expended is not an unambiguous cap,as was the of which not to exceed language of the earlier appropriatio
