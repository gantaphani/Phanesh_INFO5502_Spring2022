in this action for a declaratory judgment,the ottawa tribe of oklahoma the tribe seeks to establish that,under various treaties,it retains the right to fish in lake erie,and that the state of ohio,through the director of the ohio department of natural resources,defendant sean logan the state,lacks the authority to regulate this activity.we hold that,because the tribe,under these treaties,retained at most a right of occupancy to the lands in ohio,and this right was extinguished upon abandonment,any related fishing rights it may have reserved were similarly extinguished when the tribe removed west of the mississippi.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
the facts of this case are a matter of historical record.the tribe,through a series of treaties executed during the late and early centuries,was displaced from northern ohio to kansas and then later to oklahoma,where its members currently reside.invoking several of these treaties,the tribe now seeks to begin a commercial fishing enterprise on lake erie.the tribe claim that it has the right to operate this enterprise without regard to ohio commercial fishing regulations,and the state rejection of that claim,resulted in this lawsuit.
the treaties at issue in this case are not those by which the united states,over a period of several decades,dealt with the tribe and ultimately removed it from northern ohio.they are the treaty of greenville,stat.hereinafter treaty of greenville the treaty of fort industry,which actually consists of two separate treaties the connecticut land company treaty,july,gales seaton,american state papers indian affairs,available at.unl.edu treaty.html hereinafter clc treaty,and the united states treaty,july,stat.hereinafter treaty the treaty of detroit,stat.hereinafter treaty of detroit the treaty of maumee rapids,sept,stat.hereinafter treaty of maumee rapids and the treaty of,stat.hereinafter treaty of.we briefly summarize those treaties.
by the treaty of greenville,which brought to an end a conflict between the united states and a number of indian tribes residing in ohio and indiana,the tribes ceded to the united states more than one half of the present state of ohio.under the treaty,the united states relinquish ed their claims to all other indian lands with a few irrelevant exceptions in ohio.treaty of greenville.the eastern boundary of the indian territory began at the mouth of the cuyahoga river on lake erie,and generally ran south to the site of fort laurens,for just over miles.the southern border of the lands reserved to the tribes began there and runs into indiana.to the northwest of this boundary was the land to which the united states relinquished its claims,which in ohio consisted largely of royce areas,and all of the smaller royce areas encompassed in them.see charles royce,indian land cessions in the united states,royce map of ohio,reprinted in ii annual report of the bureau of american hereinafter royce,land cessions.the treaty is silent as to any northern border for the land to which the united states relinquished its claims,and the parties dispute whether the indian lands encompassed part of lake erie.
the indian tribes later ceded some of the land relinquished to them by the greenville treaty in the treaty of fort industry,which,as noted above,actually is comprised of two treaties the clc treaty and the treaty,both signed on july.the clc treaty conveyed royce area to the connecticut land company,and the treaty similarly conveyed royce area to the united states.clc treaty treaty art.ii.taken together,these treaties ceded away all of the land the indian tribes had retained under the treaty of greenville to the east of a line running north and south drawn miles west of the pennsylvania border.the tribe does not argue that either of these treaties created fishing rights in lake erie,but instead contends that they did not extinguish the ottawas fishing rights reserved under the treaty of greenville.
at this point various indian tribes,including the ottawa,still retained possession of a significant portion of ohio,but the expansion of our young republic was to continue at the expense of the tribes.in the treaty of detroit,signed in,the indian tribes ceded royce area to the united states.the portion of royce area lying in ohio was a relatively small right triangle of land,bordered on the north for our purposes by the border,on the west by a line running directly north from the mouth of the auglaize river to the border of michigan,and on the southeast hypotenuse by the middle of the maumee river from its mouth on lake erie upriver to the mouth of the auglaize river.treaty of detroit art.i.the legal description used in the conveyance included a portion of lake erie bordering the present state of michigan,but not ohio.the treaty further provided that i t is further agreed and stipulated,that the said indian nations shall enjoy the privilege of hunting and fishing on the lands ceded as aforesaid,as long as they remain the property of the united states.treaty of detroit art.v.the tribe argues that this is evidence both that it retained fishing rights to lake erie in the treaty of greenville,and also that it continued to retain these rights in the treaty of detroit.
ten years later,in,the wyandot indian tribe ceded royce area to the united states through the treaty of maumee rapids,bringing ownership of the state of ohio nearly to completion.royce area includes most of the indian territory in ohio lying west of royce areas and,and south of the miami river six other tribes,including the ottawas,accede d to the cession.treaty of maumee rapids.also by the treaty,the ottawa,pottawatomie,and chippewa tribes ceded to the united states royce area,a conveyance not at issue in this appeal.
finally,in the treaty of,the united states purchased the small tracts of land reserved to the ottawas in the treaties of detroit and maumee rapids.treaty of,preamble.in addition,members of the tribe living on those tracts agreed to remove west of the mississippi river.the treaty of was the first removal treaty entered into between the united states and the ottawa tribe,and effectively removed the tribe from ohio,leaving only a handful of ottawas on some small plots of land.more removal treaties followed,and by the end of the decade,the ottawas had conveyed all of their lands in ohio to the united states.although a few ottawas remained in ohio for some time,to our knowledge all of them eventually departed,and the tribe does not suggest otherwise.by,the main tribal organization had transferred to kansas.the tribe argues that,even though it was effectively removed from ohio by the treaty of,the treaty language was insufficiently explicit to extinguish the fishing rights the indians retained under the treaty of detroit.moreover,because the treaty of expressly limits itself to purchasing rights established in the treaties of detroit and maumee rapids,it has no effect on the fishing rights established in the treaty of greenville.
relying on the treaties described above,the tribe brought suit in the district court against the state,seeking a declaratory judgment that,among other things the tribe could carry out its plan to fish commercially in lake erie,with only minimal regulatory intrusion by the state.the state first moved to dismiss based on its interpretation of the treaties discussed above,and the district court denied this motion.the state then moved for summary judgment based on laches.the district court requested supplemental briefing on interpretation of the relevant treaties,and the parties complied.the district court granted the state motion for summary judgment based on laches for all claims except that regarding fishing rights on lake erie.for that claim,it granted summary judgment to the state based on its interpretation of the above treaties.id.at.the tribe appeals only the latter decision.

this is a deceptively straightforward case.there are numerous treaties at issue here,but essentially,under the treaty of greenville the united states acquir
