in this petition for writ of mandate brought by,a limited partnership that develops and manages commercial real estate on indian land warburton,significant issues are raised concerning the showing required to establish an express authorization of an indian tribe waiver of its sovereign immunity from suit.in addition to the defendant and real party in interest,tribe of louisiana the tribe,warburton action for breach of contract and fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation names as a defendant a limited liability company of which the tribe is a member,first nation gaming,llc first nation,and makes alter ego allegations about first nation and the tribe.the petition arises out of the trial court denial of warburton motions to compel discovery of information from the tribe regarding subject matter jurisdiction issues in connection with warburton efforts to prepare opposition to a pending motion for summary judgment brought by the tribe on the sovereign immunity issue.code civ.
the challenged order denying the motions to compel discovery made findings that the tribe had not effectively waived its right to sovereign immunity,and further,that any order of the court as requested by warburton in this discovery motion would be void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.thus,the order denying the requested discovery also served to grant the tribe summary judgment motion in advance of its scheduled hearing date,and without allowing any opposition.
in opposition to the petition for writ of mandate,the tribe has filed an answer and a motion to dismiss,again asserting a lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the california courts of warburton action for breach of contract and misrepresentation,due to sovereign immunity of the tribe that was not properly or adequately waived.as we will show,the motion to dismiss presents the same questions as the petition.we find the trial court ruling was both substantively and procedurally flawed,and we grant the petition with directions,first,to allow the requested discovery regarding subject matter jurisdiction to proceed,and second,to allow the tribe to renotice its motion for summary judgment on the jurisdictional question,if it wishes to do so.depending upon the outcome of those proceedings,the trial court must determine if the related discovery on the merits of the allegations must also be permitted and reschedule the trial date accordingly.
factual and procedural background 
warburton allegations of breach of contract and misrepresentations arise out of an agreement entered into october,between warburton,first nation,and the tribe the agreement,pursuant to which warburton referred certain gaming opportunities with designated indian tribes to first nation.these gaming opportunities are projects involving the planning,creation and operation of casinos and related facilities.first nation is a delaware limited liability company of which the tribe is a member,owning percent as of the time of the filing of the complaint.see,et,similar california law governing limited liability companies.in return for these referrals,first nation agreed to pay warburton a flat fee per project and percent of gross management fees.the agreement provided that it was to be governed by the laws of the state of california and contained the following language regarding tribal sovereign immunity 
because it may be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that first nation is a tribally controlled entity,hereby agrees that it will not assert its tribal immunity in any action brought by warburton to enforce any or all provisions of this agreement.
the agreement,as executed by the three parties,warburton,first nation,and the tribe,shows there was originally another related provision that was stricken out by interlineation,as follows the tribal resolution waiving its sovereign immunity in any action brought by warburton against first nation is attached hereto as addendum a.it is not disputed that no such addendum was ever executed or attached,although it is heavily disputed whether the parties mutually intended that this be done.the agreement,paragraph,further states that it is not intended as an admission by warburton that first nation enjoys the tribe sovereign immunity.
the agreement was signed on behalf of the tribe by the tribal council chairman,earl barbry,in the presence of four of the other six tribal council members marshall pierite,alfred barbre,harold pierite and david rivas.the signing took place in a meeting room at the casino the hall of the chiefs,as opposed to the tribal council chamber at which tribal council meetings were ordinarily held.
disputes arose about the performance of the agreement and in august,warburton filed this complaint for damages for breach of contract,fraud,negligent misrepresentation and an accounting.the agreement was attached as an exhibit to the complaint.the complaint makes allegations that the tribe was an alter ego of first nation,in that the tribe managed and controlled it,it was undercapitalized,monies were commingled between the tribe and first nation,and necessary corporate formalities were not observed.
in january,the tribe brought a demurrer and motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction,due to the lack of a tribal resolution expressly waiving sovereign immunity.the tribe points and authorities acknowledge the waiver paragraph was conditional and the stated condition was unclear whether the tribe was precluded from raising sovereign immunity only if a court found first nation to be tribally controlled.the declaration of the tribal council member who was the custodian of records,and who was present at the signing of the agreement,stated there was no such resolution and the chairman was not authorized to waive sovereign immunity by signing the agreement.no information is included about the procedures for calling a noticed meeting of the tribal council and whether such notice could be waived by the participants,if sufficient in number.
in opposition to the motion to dismiss,warburton submitted its representative hank quevedo declaration,giving his account of the signing of the agreement in the presence of five members of the tribal council.quevedo declaration stated that all those present went through the agreement reading each paragraph out loud,and he explained that the reason the second sentence of paragraph was stricken was because the resolution waiving sovereign immunity was not ready and therefore could not be attached as an exhibit to the agreement.quevedo suggested at the time that since the majority of the tribal council was present,chairman barbry could ask for the resolution at the meeting,but the chairman told him he would have to call a formally noticed meeting of the tribal council to do so,but not to worry about it and that it would be taken care of soon.none of the tribal council members present objected.quevedo asked chairman barbry about the resolution four or five times,and was told it would be taken care of,but this never occurred.
the trial court judge zvetina,who has since retired overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to dismiss,and the order stated,there is a factual issue raised by the presence of the majority of the tribal members council at the execution of the agreement in determining whether a formal resolution was required in order to find a waiver of sovereign immunity.the tribe then filed its answer,asserting a number of affirmative defenses relating to excuse from or prevention of performance,among others,and reiterating its objection to subject matter jurisdiction 
warburton served a total of seven discovery requests on the tribe.the first four discovery requests were directed to the issue of sovereign immunity,and sought information about the circumstances of the signing of the agreement on october,and events related thereto,and production of documents such as resolutions,ordinances,delegations of authority or other documents pertaining to the waiver of sovereign immunity.in addition,warburton served requests for admission relating to the authority of the chairman of the tribe to sign the october,agreement.warburton also served notices of deposition of the tribal council members present at the signing of the agreement.the next three discovery requests pertained to nonjurisdictional issues,about the circumstances and events related to the negotiation and performance of the agreement and its alleged breach,and any documents supporting the affirmative defenses pled in the tribe answer.
in april,the tribe served partial answers and objections to the discovery requests.the tribe did not respond to the requests for admission,which warburton interpreted as entitling it to an order that the truth of the matters requested therein be deemed admitted,subd.k.in the tribe view,it gratuitously provided certain information,such as the affidavits of the tribal council members present at the signing of the agreement,stating that no tribal resolution was ever passed concerning the agreement,and petitioner was entitled to no more discovery.
in march,the tribe filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground of sovereign immunity.it was supported by the affidavits of the tribal council members who had been present at the signing of the agreement.the tribe points and authorities for both the dismissal motion and the summary judgment motion refer to the text of the tribal constitution,article iv,sovereignty,as follows 
the sovereignty of the tribe is its most sacred possession and birthright.nothing in this constitution shall be deemed or construed to be a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the tribe.sovereign immunity may be waived only by express resolution enacted by a majority vote of the tribal council,and only to the extent specified in such resolution.before such resolution is enacted,the tribal council will seek the advice of legal counsel.
the summary judgment hearing date was continued by stipulation.meanwhile,warburton filed and obtained a hearing date for its motions to compel discovery,later continued by stipulation.in opposition to the discovery motions,and shortly before their hearing date,the tribe filed a document entitled,motion to limit discovery,set aside stipulation,quash notices of deposition and proceed to determine motion for summary judgment filed by tribe.warburton filed opposition,contending that this new motion was untimely six days notice given as opposed to the required days.this opposition pointed out to the court that the tribe codefendant,first nation,was originally owned percent by the tribe,but that the tribe now represents that it owns percent of first nation as of the time of these proceedings.
at the hearing date on the discovery motions,the respondent court ruled that the tribe had not waived its right to sovereign immunity,such that any order of the court as requested by warburton in this motion would be void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in relevant part,it reasoned that the tribe voluntarily provided information to confirm for plaintiff warburton that the tribal council never passed a resolution affirming or approving the october,agreement,as shown by the affidavits of which the court took judicial notice,as previously filed with the moving papers for the tribe motion for summary judgment.the court made a factual finding that the tribe had adopted a constitution stating that sovereign immunity may be waived only by express resolution,only to the extent specified in such resolution,and legal counsel would be sought before such a waiver.the indian reorganization act of.the trial court found there was no conflict between paragraph of the agreement,which specifies the liability of the tribe in terms of its submission to california law,and paragraph,dealing with the tribe waiver of sovereign immunity as to warburton 
with respect to the extrinsic evidence presented the affidavits by the tribal council members,the court found they were relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument was reasonably susceptible citing pacific gas electric thomas drayage rigging cal d.accordingly,the court made these factual findings 
the agreement had printed language lined out deleting the waiver of sovereign immunity,
the chairman only signed the agreement,
the chairman had an available quorum or majority to call into session to pass a resolution to waive the tribe immunity,but he did not call them into session and were not present in the tribal council chamber versus were present in the hall of the chiefs,and,
no resolution waiving or ratifying waiver of sovereign immunity as to wb warburton was ever passed as verified by a review of the records of the tribal council actions,including resolutions,ordinances,codes and other legislation as well as minutes of the council proceedings,by the council custodian of such records marshall pierite.
the trial court also found probative the evidence supplied by the tribe concerning a number of other tribal resolutions in which the tribal chairman was expressly authorized to execute agreements wherein the tribe expressly waived its sovereign immunity as to other parties related to the transaction,as supporting a finding of the intent of the tribe not to waive its sovereign immunity as to warburton.
the trial court noted further that although the tribe was vigorously asserting its own sovereign immunity,this did not appear to be true as to the entity first nation.thus,the trial court order stated,the tribe in the october,agreement does bind itself not to assert its sovereign immunity bar in an action by warburton against first nation even though the tribe is a member of first nation finally,the court ruled that there were no remaining causes of action as to which subject matter jurisdiction would be proper,so as to require the requested discovery to be performed.the trial court accordingly denied the motions to compel discovery,and at the oral argument on the motions,set a trial date as to the remaining defendant first nation.
this petition for writ of mandate followed.we entered an order on june,summarily denying the petition.after granting a petition for review,the supreme court returned the case to this court and stayed all proceedings in the trial court,pending further action by this court.we issued an alternative writ and held oral argument on both the petition and the tribe motion to dismiss filed in response to it 
discussion 
warburton challenges the trial court ruling denying the requested discovery on the issue,asserting both substantive and procedural objections.the procedural arguments concern its need for discovery in order to prepare opposition to the pending summary judgment motion on the jurisdictional issue,and the trial court shortcutting of all the pending motions by making a finding of lack of subject matter jurisdiction before allowing discovery,effectively terminating the case as to the tribe,in its favor,based only on evidence voluntarily given by the tribe.
while these procedural problems raise serious concerns about the fairness of these motion proceedings,the fundamental question presented is whether warburton is justified in contending that it has a substantive entitlement to discovery about the circumstances and events surrounding the entry into the agreement by the tribe,and its performance of it,as well as the alter ego issues presented about first nation in the complaint,as they affect the jurisdiction and sovereign immunity issues.as instructed by the supreme court,we have issued an alternative writ and set the matter for hearing,and now set forth our analysis of the subject petition,which will in turn dispose of the responsive motion to dismiss.
standard of review 
generally speaking,the issue of whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction over an action against an indian tribe is a question of law subject to de novo review.tamiami partners miccosukee tribe cir.similarly,the interpretation and construction of a written instrument,such as the agreement here,may be conducted de novo where a the trial court contractual interpretation is based solely upon the terms of the written instrument without the aid of extrinsic evidence b there is no conflict in the properly admitted extrinsic evidence or c the trial court determination was made on the basis of improperly admitted incompetent evidence.citation.morey vannucci th,d,italics omitted,citing parsons bristol development cal d at.by the same token,however,where the interpretation of the contract turns upon the credibility of conflicting extrinsic evidence which was properly admitted at trial,an appellate court will uphold any reasonable construction of the contract by the trial court.citation.morey vannucci,supra,th at,d.when construing contracts,the courts will look for the expressed intent of the parties,under an objective standard.brant california dairies cal d,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.
in the case before us,the application of these rules is complicated by the fact that this is a discovery writ concerning factual issues that allegedly affect the subject matter jurisdiction issue of law.specifically,warburton is contending that numerous triable issues of material fact exist on the sovereign immunity issue,including the intent of the parties in signing the agreement,ratification of the agreement through performance by the tribe,alter ego issues concerning the tribe and its entity,first nation,and whether the tribe should be estopped from contending that it did not approve the agreement.an appellate court review of the trial court construction of allegedly ambiguous contractual language depends on the circumstances.appleton waessil th,d.where there is conflicting parol evidence that requires a resolution of credibility issues,the appellate court will be guided by the substantial evidence test.ibid.in this case,warburton seeks discovery of information about the circumstances of signing and performance of the agreement to support its showing of conflicting parol evidence on the jurisdictional issue.
california law permits a plaintiff seeking to assert claims against a corporation to obtain discovery against it about whether it has been doing business in this state,since such facts are normally within the knowledge of the corporate officers and such jurisdictional issues are subject to discovery.superior court cal d.further,the california courts have adopted the federal procedural approach to this specific type of jurisdictional problem,involving discovery,by allowing a trial court faced with a claim of sovereign immunity to engage in sufficient pretrial factual and legal determinations to satisfy itself of its authority to hear the case before trial.great western casinos,supra,th,d,citing jungquist sheikh sultan bin khalifa al nahyan,smith hopland band of pomo indians th,d,fn.smith.the reason for this rule is that the lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time,and no specific procedural method is required to bring the matter to the court attention.great western casinos,supra,th at,d see gould,pechiney ugine kuhlmann cir,where sovereign immunity issues are presented,putting subject matter jurisdiction into question,discovery and should be limited to the essentials necessary to determining the preliminary question of jurisdiction.thus,a court considering a jurisdictional question regarding sovereign immunity may go beyond the pleadings and contract language to consider testimonial and documentary evidence relevant to that issue.great western casinos,supra,th at,d smith,supra,th at,fn,d.

in the case before us,the application of these rules clearly indicates that the trial court was justified in considering the tribal council member affidavits in ruling on the jurisdictional question.however,we will next analyze the rules for asserting sovereign immunity in the indian tribal context in order to determine if warburton should have been allowed discovery in order to prepare an opposing showing on that issue.
standards for assertion of sovereign immunityaintroduction 
a valuable introduction to the rules in this area is provided in stephen indian high school cir,
indian tribes are domestic dependent nations that exercise inherent sovereign authority over their members and territories.as an aspect of this sovereign immunity,suits against tribes are barred in the absence of an unequivocally expressed waiver by the tribe or abrogation by congress.citation.it is settled that a waiver of sovereign immunity can not be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.santa clara pueblo martinez,d internal quotations omitted.
it must be recognized that sovereign immunity is not a discretionary doctrine that may be applied as a remedy depending on the equities of a given situation.citation.chemehuevi.tribe cal.bd.of equal.cir,fn.reversed in other pt.in cal.bd.of equalization chemehuevi indian tribe,d.rather,it presents a pure jurisdictional question.chemehuevi.tribe cal.bd.of,supra,at see also ute distribution ute indian tribe cir,the requirement that a waiver of tribal immunity must be clear and express is not a doctrine that may be flexibly applied or disregarded based upon the particular facts.
in trudgeon fantasy springs casino th,d,the court of appeal addressed the applicability of sovereign immunity to a tort case against a separate business entity organized by an indian tribe,as opposed to immunity from a tort claim against the tribe itself.the court noted that other jurisdictions have reached varying conclusions in considering whether sovereign immunity applies to tribal business entities.id.at,d.it then applied a test setting forth the relevant criteria to address the immunity issue,including these considerations whether the business entity is organized for a purpose that is governmental in nature,rather than commercial whether the tribe and the business entity are closely linked in governing structure and other characteristics and whether federal policies intended to promote indian tribal autonomy are furthered by the extension of immunity to the business entity.citation.id.at,d also see redding rancheria superior court th,d.essentially,warburton appears to be raising similar issues in its alter ego claims.also see ute distribution ute indian tribe,supra,remanding a case dealing with water rights to the district court because it had not been determined whether the ute tribe as constitutional organization or the ute tribe as a federal corporation was the proper defendant here,for purposes of interpreting a waiver of sovereign immunity.
as explained in the american indian law deskbook ed.conference of western attorneys general,chapter,section b,pages through the deskbook,the issue of a waiver by an indian tribe of its sovereign immunity from suit has arisen in three general contexts,the first of which is the effect of provisions in individual contracts,such as arbitration clauses.the leading case of c l enterprises potawatomi indian tribe,d c l,which we next discuss,deals with the effect of such a contractual clause.another form of conduct that may give rise to waiver issues is an indian tribe taking of certain legal positions during litigation,raising counterclaims or intervening in litigation.deskbook,supra.the authors continue,the final context is the most complicated and turns on whether the tribal defendant was acting in a sovereign or a corporate status at the time the controversy arose.this complexity derives in large part from sections and of the indian reorganization act,which authorize tribes to adopt,respectively,constitutions for their internal governance and charters of incorporation for entities whose purpose is to acquire property or engage in commercial enterprises.the latter charters frequently have sue and be sued provisions to facilitate involvement in commerce.id.at,fns.omitted.the authors note that a substantial amount of litigation has focused on the difference between incorporation and chartering of such entities.id.at.this type of distinction was explained in linneen gila river indian community cir,linneen,in which a tribe corporate charter contained a sue and be sued clause,which waived immunity with respect to a tribe corporate activities,but not with respect to its governmental activities the indian reorganization act,authorizes indian tribes to organize as a constitutional entity,and of the act authorizes organization of a corporate entity.citation.most courts that have considered the issue have recognized the distinctness of these two entities.citation.the sue and be sued clause in the indian community corporate charter in no way affects the sovereign immunity of the community as a constitutional,or governmental,entity.linneen,supra,at.thus,the relevant immunity question should be whether the alleged actions that form the basis of a particular suit are clearly governmental rather than corporate in nature.ibid.
although the trial court order made passing reference to this issue and linneen,supra,this distinction between a tribe governmental or corporate activities has not been well briefed by the parties in this case,and it is unclear at this point whether it may prove to be relevant in the subject discovery efforts regarding the jurisdictional questions.
contentions and case law 
in this case,there is no contention of any congressional abrogation of the tribe sovereign immunity rather,warburton argues there was an explicit or express waiver of immunity by the tribe in the form of some or all of the agreement provisions that the agreement was to be governed by the laws of the state of california the following language regarding tribal sovereign immunity was an express waiver of immunity because it may be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that first nation is a tribally controlled entity,tunica biloxi hereby agrees that it will not assert its tribal immunity in any action brought by warburton to enforce any or all provisions of this agreement further,the agreement admittedly contained a related provision that was stricken out by interlineation,as follows the tribal resolution waiving its sovereign immunity in any action brought by warburton against first nation is attached hereto as addendum a however,it is warburton claim that the parties mutually intended that this be done later because the document was not ready then and the agreement,paragraph,further states that it is not intended as an admission by warburton that first nation enjoys the tribe sovereign immunity,thus showing the anticipated separateness of first nation and the tribe,that was allegedly fraudulently disregarded,giving rise to the alter ego allegations.warburton contends that it is entitled to discovery concerning the tribe execution and performance of the agreement,allegedly ratifying the agreement,in order to confirm and support its reading of the agreement itself.
to evaluate these arguments,we turn to c l,supra,d,in which the united states supreme court found that a tribe had waived,with the requisite clarity,immunity from the suit a construction company c l brought to enforce its arbitration award,through the construction contract provision for arbitration and related provisions for the enforcement of an arbitration award.the high court first reiterated that to relinquish its immunity,a tribe waiver must be clear.id.at.the arbitration clause in that case required resolution of all disputes between c l and the tribe by binding arbitration,and stated that any ensuing arbitral awards could be reduced to judgment in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.id.at.the supreme court based its analysis on the contract clause,which made it plain that the court having jurisdiction to enforce the award in question was the oklahoma state court in which c l filed suit by selecting oklahoma law the law of the place where the project is located to govern the contract,citation,the parties have effectively consented to confirmation of the award in accordance with the oklahoma uniform arbitration act,and the tribe thereby waived its sovereign immunity by contract the court found it significant that it was the tribe which proposed and signed the agreement,and therefore it had clearly consented to arbitration and to the enforcement of arbitral awards in oklahoma state court,and thus waived its sovereign immunity from suit on the agreement.id.at.
according to a treatise in the area,the c l decision supra,d stands for the general proposition that,while clarity of expression is essential to a tribe waiver of immunity from suit,particular words of art are not.deskbook,supra supp.
recently,in smith,supra,th,d,the court applied the rule of the c l case by finding that the agreement between the plaintiff,an architect,and the tribe,was indistinguishable from the contract in c l enterprises,and the only reasonable interpretation of its terms is that it clearly,and explicitly waives tribal sovereign immunity.id.at,d,italics omitted.the contract contained an arbitration clause,and agreed to enforcement of an arbitral award,in any court having jurisdiction thereof.ibid.this amounted to a tribe explicit contractual waiver of its sovereign immunity from suit.
in smith,supra,th at pages through,d,the court of appeal analyzed sanderlin seminole tribe of florida cir,as shedding light on the method of waiver issue.there,the federal court of appeals rejected an argument by the plaintiff,who was claiming disability discrimination as against an indian tribe,that the actions of the tribal chief and chairman in accepting certain federal funds had constituted a voluntary and implicit waiver of the tribe right to immunity from lawsuits under applicable federal legislation,the rehabilitation act.the court rejected both of the plaintiff theories that the tribal chief had actual or apparent authority to waive the tribe sovereign immunity when he entered into contracts with the government for the tribe receipt of federal funds,or that there was a specific waiver of the tribe sovereign immunity from suit,through such acceptance of funds.sanderlin,supra,at.rather,the court found that even if the tribal chief had authority to waive sovereign immunity,which he did not,the contracts in question merely conveyed a promise not to discriminate,and did not constitute an express and unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity or a consent to be sued in federal court on a claim such as sanderlin.ibid.in smith,supra,th,d,the court distinguished the facts of the sanderlin case,in part because in that federal case,there was no showing that a person with actual authority to execute a contract on behalf of the tribe did so,or that the tribal council passed a resolution approving the contract.in smith,supra,th at pages,d to,both those factors were present.
accordingly,in smith,the court accepted the view that an otherwise binding contract was effective to waive sovereign immunity,under the applicable tribal sovereign immunity ordinance,even where the explicit waiver was made by contract,instead of pursuant to a tribal ordinance or resolution.the court analysis depended on several factors first,the court did not interpret the reference in the tribal ordinance to an explicit waiver to mean that a resolution must use the magic words waiver or sovereign immunity.smith,supra,th at,d.rather,it was enough that the tribal council,with full knowledge of its terms,approved the contract by resolution,because this satisfied the purpose of the tribal sovereign immunity ordinance to ensure that no waiver of sovereign immunity is made by a single tribal officer,and that instead such waivers be made only by formal action of its governing body,the tribal council.ibid.
second,the court in smith adhered to the statement in c l,supra,at page,footnote,d,that reference to uniform federal law governing the waiver of immunities by foreign sovereigns was instructive in deciding whether a particular act constituted a waiver of tribal immunity.the court of appeal in smith,supra,th,d,ruled that federal law,not the tribal provisions,had to be applied to decide the enforceability of a contract that was negotiated and signed by a person who was authorized to do so,where the tribal council approved the contract.under federal law,w hen a
