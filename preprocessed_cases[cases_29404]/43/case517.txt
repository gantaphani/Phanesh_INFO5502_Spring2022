the district court dismissed david patchak suit to prevent the secretary of the interior from holding land in trust for an indian tribe in michigan.patchak appeal presents two jurisdictional issues whether,as the district court held,he lacks standing and whether,if he has standing,sovereign immunity bars his suit.
the land consists of acres in wayland township,michigan,a rural,sparsely populated farming community.the secretary published in the federal register his decision to take this bradley trust for the band,also known as the gun lake band.may.the band owned the land and wanted to construct and operate a gambling facility there.to do this,the band had to convince the interior secretary to take title to the land into trust pursuant to the indian gaming regulatory act.see butte,cal.hogen.
the secretary notice in the federal register announced that he would wait at least thirty days before consummating the transaction.the purpose of the delay,which b required,was to afford interested parties the opportunity to seek judicial review of the final administrative decisions to take land in trust for indian tribes and individual indians before transfer of title to the property occurs.at.
during the period,an organization michgo brought an action claiming that the secretary had violated the national environmental policy act and the indian gaming regulatory act.the district court issued a stay of the secretary action.the court later dismissed the organization suit,and this court affirmed.see.gambling opposition michgo norton,d,aff sub nom.gambling opposition kempthorne.
in the meantime,patchak filed his complaint.he alleged that he lived near the bradley tract that the tribe gaming facility would attract million visitors per year that this would destroy the peace and quiet of the area that there would be air,noise and water pollution that there would be increased crime in the area and a diversion of police and medical resources and that the secretary proposed action was ultra vires.patchak invoked general federal question jurisdiction and the administrative procedure act.he claimed that because the gun lake band was not under federal jurisdiction in,the indian reorganization act of,did not authorize the secretary to take the band land into trust.the gun lake band intervened as a defendant.
after this court affirmed the dismissal of the michgo action,the stay expired.the district court then denied patchak emergency motion for an order preventing the secretary from proceeding with the land transaction.on january,the secretary took the bradley tract into trust.three weeks later,on february,the supreme court issued its opinion in carcieri salazar.the court agreed with patchak argument that of the indian reorganization the secretary trust authority to indian tribes under federal jurisdiction when the ira became law in.
despite carcieri,the secretary urged the district court to dismiss patchak suit.he argued that the quiet title act,precluded any person from seeking to divest the united states of title to indian trust lands.in other words,by taking the bradley tract into trust for the gun lake band while patchak suit was pending,the secretary deprived the court of jurisdiction.
in august,the district court dismissed the suit on a different,that patchak,at a minimum,lacks prudential standing to challenge interior authority pursuant to section of the ira.patchak salazar,d.the court reasoned that patchak interests do not only not fall within the ira,but actively run contrary to it.id.at.the court also expressed doubt about its subject matter jurisdiction in light of the quiet title act.id.at.
there is no doubt that patchak satisfied the standing requirements derived from article iii of the constitution.neither the secretary nor the band argues otherwise.in terms of article iii standing,the impact of the band facility on patchak way of life constituted an fairly traceable to the secretary decision,an injury the court could redress with an injunction that would in effect prevent the band from conducting gaming on the property.see lujan defenders of wildlife.
we believe,contrary to the district court,that patchak also fulfilled the judicially created test for standing.the test began as a gloss on of the administrative procedure act.clarke sec.indus.ass n.section allows judicial review of agency action by a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.as the supreme court formulated the test in association of data processing service organizations camp,the adversely affected or aggrieved plaintiff must be trying to protect an interest of his that is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected by the relevant statutory provisions.see credit union admin.first bank trust.
the supreme court introduced the test in recognition of the trend toward enlargement of the class of people who may protest administrative action.data processing,at.the apa had pared back traditional prudential limitations.faic,united states.given the apa generous review provisions,bennett spear,internal quotation marks omitted,and the drive for enlarging the category of aggrieved persons,data processing,at,the test is not especially demanding,clarke,u.at.
the secretary tells us that the indian reorganization act is not concerned with the interests that patchak asserts in this litigation.doi br.the band adds that the function of the ira is to give the indians the control of their own affairs and of their own property.see mescalero apache tribe jones,u,quoting cong.rec.but application of the test does not turn on such generalities.see credit union,at.patchak did not have to show that the indian reorganization act was meant to benefit those in his situation.see mova pharm.shalala,am.chiropractic ass leavitt.the analysis focuses,not on those who congress intended to benefit,but on those who in practice can be expected to police the interests that the statute protects.mova,at.
as the secretary announcement in the federal register stated,ira and the definition of indians in served as the predicate for the government taking the gun lake band property into trust for the purpose of gaming under b b ii of the gaming act the ira provisions interpreted in carcieri salazar.at,limit the secretary trust authority.he may act only on behalf of tribes that were under federal jurisdiction at the time of the ira enactment in.when that limitation blocks indian gaming,as patchak claims it should have in this case,the interests of those in the surrounding at least those who would suffer from living near a gambling arguably protected.and because of their interests,they are proper parties to enforce the ira restrictions.
in reaching this conclusion,we have the secretary would have the ira provisions in isolation.patchak asserted injuries are the negative effects of building and operating a casino in his community.the secretary claims that these vague and generalized grievances have nothing to do with the purposes for which congress enacted and thus do not grant him prudential standing.doi br.but patchak purposes of both article iii and the be evaluated in light of the intended use of the property.the ira provisions are linked to the gaming act.see air courier conference of am.am.postal workers union.in its application filed with the secretary,the gun lake band invoked both statutes.one of the considerations in the secretary decision whether to take land into trust pursuant to the ira is whether doing so would further economic development among the tribes.see.gambling opposition,at.indian gaming is meant to do just that.taken together,the limitations in these statutes arguably protected patchak from the negative effects of an indian gambling facility.
the interior department itself recognizes the interests of individuals like patchak who live close to proposed indian gaming establishments.a regulation already mentioned b gives affected members of the public thirty days to seek judicial review before the secretary takes land into trust for an indian tribe.by any measure,patchak fits within the category of affected members of the public.other regulations require the secretary to consider the purpose for which the land will be used and whether taking a tribe land into trust would give rise to potential conflicts of land use.c,f.internal memoranda regarding the band application show that members of the interior department considered such conflicts here and accepted the wayland township supervisor assertion that the gaming facility would be compatible with the surrounding land use.we realize that the apa and data processing require the litigant interests to be measured by statutes not regulations.see fed of fed.emps.cheney.but regulations implementing statutes may cast some light on what the statutes arguably protect.
the secretary argues that the state of michigan,not patchak,is the proper entity to police the secretary authority to take lands into trust under the ira.he acknowledges cases in which states or municipalities or their officials have been allowed to sue to prevent the secretary from taking land into trust for the purposes of indian gaming.see,nebraska ex rel.bruning dep t of interior,cir sac fox nation of norton,cir.carcieri salazar is another example,although the land there was to be used for indian housing rather than gaming.at.the plaintiffs in carcieri were a town,a state and the governor.the secretary offers a distinction between those cases and patchak a state in which the land is located is a proper entity to police the secretary trust decision because it stands to lose some of its regulatory authority as a result of interior trust acquisition.doi br.but the distinction can not hold.if the interests of a state or a municipality are within the zone of interests the ira protects then so are patchak interests.a state may,as the secretary contends,lose some regulatory authority and,depending on the intended use of the trust land,some tax revenue.but see cotton petrol.new mexico.but the secretary is merely describing the nature of the state injuries.patchak injuries may be different,but they are just as cognizable.among other things,he alleged that the rural character of the area would be destroyed,that the value of his property would be diminished and that he would lose the enjoyment of the agricultural land surrounding the casino site.these sorts of injuries have long been considered sufficient for purposes of standing.see,sierra club morton.
as a practical matter it would be very strange to deny patchak standing in this case.his stake in opposing the band casino is intense and obvious.the test weeds out litigants who lack a sufficient interest in the controversy,litigants whose interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.clarke,at.patchak is surely not in that category.we therefore hold that he had prudential standing to bring this action.
this brings us to the question whether the government has consented to patchak suit.
section of the apa waives the government sovereign immunity in the following terms an action in a court of the united states seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the united states or that the united states is an indispensable party.patchak does not seek money damages and he has stated a claim that an interior its secretary acted under color of legal authority.
patchak action therefore seems to fit within the waiver of sovereign immunity in.but the last clause of the section states nothing herein confers authority to grant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.the secretary argues that the quiet title act is such a statute.
we set forth the relevant provisions of the quiet title act in the margin the act,in its first subsection,waives sovereign immunity the united states may be named as a party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the united states claims an interest,other than a security interest or water rights.a.this is followed by the provision that directly concerns us this section does not apply to trust or restricted indian lands ibid.the supreme court has held that the act provides the exclusive means by which adverse claimants c an challenge the united states title to real property,block north dakota,and that,when applicable,the indian lands exception operates to retain the united states immunity to suit,united states mottaz.
the proper question therefore is whether patchak suit is,in the words of the statute,the sort of action under this section for which the united states has waived sovereign immunity except with respect to indian lands.that is,did patchak bring a quiet title act case transohio savings bank director,office of thrift supervision.if not,the quiet title act does not forbid the relief patchak seeks,and the apa has waived the government immunity from suit.id.at see also block north dakota.
the official name of the quiet title act,passed in,was an act to permit suits to adjudicate certain real property quiet title actions,stat.this provides a clue about the statute coverage.actions to quiet title originated in the courts of equity as a means of preventing a multiplicity of suits at law.pomeroy,equity jurisprudence ed.referred to as either bills of peace or bills quia timet,they existed in two forms.the first allowed the holder of legal title to land to prevent a single adverse claimant from bringing successive actions of ejectment against the plaintiff for the same parcel.id.for equity to intervene,the plaintiff was required to be in possession of the land and to have sufficiently established his title in at least one previous action at law.ibid.the second form allowed the holder of legal or equitable title to land to bring one suit against many persons asserting equitable titles to the same land.id.like the first form,plaintiffs were required to be in possession of the land in dispute.ibid.later statutes expanded quiet title actions,sometimes removing the requirement of possession,and often allowing the actions to determine ownership.see douglas laycock,modern american remedies ed.
as should be apparent from this summary,a common feature of quiet title actions is missing from this case.in each of the forms just mentioned,the plaintiff would seek to establish his rightful title to the real property.the modern definition of the action is the same a proceeding to establish a plaintiff title to land by compelling the adverse claimant to establish a claim or be forever estopped from asserting it.black law dictionary ed.patchak is not requesting relief of that sort he mounts no claim of ownership of the bradley tract.we recognize that the title of a statute can not alter the meaning of the statute operative language.see pennsylvania dep t of corrections yeskey.but it is of some interpretive use.ibid.and here there is more than just the title.as part of the same legislation,congress amended the venue statute to provide that a ny civil action under section to quiet title to an estate or interest in real property in which an interest is claimed by the united states shall be brought in the district where the property is located.d congress also gave the district courts jurisdiction over civil actions under section to quiet title.f.congress thus viewed as authorizing a proceeding known as a quiet title action.and the language of firmly indicates that congress intended to enact legislation building upon the traditional concept of an action to quiet title 
this much is apparent from the act pleading requirement.the complaint shall set forth with particularity the nature of the right,title,or interest which the plaintiff claims in the real property,and the circumstance under which it was acquired d.failure to comply may result in dismissal of the complaint.see,kinscherff united states,cir.this pr
