this appeal involves the intersection of two statutes concerning indian tribes.the indian gaming regulatory act,igra,prescribes the conditions under which indian tribes may engage in commercial gaming on their reservations.the auburn indian restoration act,aira,restored the auburn indian band located near sacramento,california to federal recognition as an indian tribe and authorized the creation of a new reservation on its behalf.see id.the cities of roseville and rocklin,both located near land approved by the secretary of the interior as part of the tribe new reservation,and citizens for safer communities,a local nonprofit organization hereafter the cities,challenge the district court interpretation of section of igra.they contend that the plain language of igra required the secretary,prior to deciding the land was eligible to be used for gaming,to find that gaming would not be detrimental to the surrounding community and to secure the consent of the governor.see b a.we hold,in light of igra language,structure,and purpose,that the auburn tribe land qualifies as the restoration of lands under igra b b iii even though the land is not located on the tribe former reservation as of the time the auburn tribe lost federal recognition and is being put to a different use than the lands on the former reservation,the rancheria.hence,the secretary was not required to proceed under b a as the cities contend.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of the cities igra cause of action and,as this is the only issue raised on appeal,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the auburn indian band is a small tribe,numbering somewhere around members,most of whom live near the village of auburn in central california,not far from sacramento.the auburn band currently has no reservation in fact,the auburn tribe had no federally recognized existence between and.the band appears to have been formed when several surviving families of the maidu and meiwok tribes,both devastated by the settlement policies of the nineteenth century,grouped into a small community that survived much of the depredation that came with the settlement of california.in,the federal government provided the auburn tribe with a small reservation,which was expanded to acres in,known as the auburn rancheria.as part of policies on indian assimilation,however,congress withdrew the auburn tribe recognition and terminated its reservation in,distributing most of the rancheria land in fee to individual holders,pursuant to the terms of the rancheria act,pub.the policy of attempting to assimilate indians by terminating federal trust responsibilities has since been repudiated by the president and congress,and many tribes terminated as part of those policies have now been restored to federal recognition.
congress restored the auburn band rights as a federally recognized tribe in and authorized the secretary of the interior to take land into trust to serve as the auburn tribe reservation.see aira,pub.tit.ii.aira directs the secretary to accept lands located on the tribe former reservation into trust,id.b,but also authorizes the secretary to accept other unencumbered lands located elsewhere in placer county,id.a.aira also references the secretary authority,pursuant to the indian reorganization act,et,to take additional land into trust within the tribe service area,which includes several neighboring counties,id.a.under aira,all land taken into trust pursuant to its terms shall be part of the tribe reservation.id.c.
rather than apply to the secretary to their reservation on the rancheria,most of which land was unavailable because held in fee by individual indians or,the auburn tribe applied for three separate parcels of land one for residential and community use,one for commercial use as a gaming casino,and a third,containing a church within the boundaries of the old reservation,for community use.the tribe submitted a revised application in,however,to request only the gaming site,reserving the other two sites for later applications.the gaming site consists of acres located in an unincorporated portion of placer county,california,and photographs of the area indicate that the land is flat,barren,and virtually uninhabited.the parties disagree over how far the land is from the auburn tribe rancheria,but viewing the record most favorably to the cities,see browning clinton,it is at least clear that the land is neither on nor close to the tribe former reservation,and is possibly as far as miles away.what is clear,however,is that the land is close to the cities.
in response to the bureau of indian affairs notice and request for comments,see,the cities opposed the auburn tribe application,arguing that the casino would increase crime in their communities and interfere with planned residential developments nearby,as well as with the nature of the area.moreover,they argued that because the proposed gaming was to take place on land acquired after the igra effective date of october,the secretary was not authorized to permit gaming on the land unless she made a threshold determination under igra b a,b a,that the proposed gaming activity would not be detrimental to the surrounding communities and obtained the concurrence of the governor.the bureau,relying on opinions of two associate solicitors of the interior department,took the position that the land was exempt from the threshold finding normally applicable under igra b a to indian lands acquired after because aira brought the auburn tribe land within igra exception for a restoration of lands to a restored tribe under b b iii.the cities objections based on local community detriment were therefore not legally relevant,as igra does not require a finding on lands that are part of a restoration of lands before the secretary can authorize gaming.the cities objections were not entirely irrelevant,however,because the bureau considered the tribe land a discretionary acquisition,and interior department regulations,see pt,require the secretary to consider potential land use conflicts and jurisdictional problems.id.f,a.additionally,the secretary must balance the need of a tribe for additional land,the use to which the land will be put,and the distance of the land from the tribe reservation,before exercising discretion to take new land into trust for indians.id.b,c id.a,b.the bureau found that the balance of these factors favored the auburn tribe planned use of the land for gaming.ultimately,the secretary,through her designees,agreed with the legal and factual determinations and approved the tribe application.notice was published in the federal register of the secretary intent to take the land into trust.
the cities filed suit against the secretary,other interior department officials,and the united states under a variety of legal theories,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as a decision on the merits of their igra cause of action to prevent the secretary from permitting gaming on the acres to be taken into trust for the auburn tribe.as relevant here,the cities alleged that the secretary had failed to comply with the requirements of igra b a.the tribe intervened,and the secretary moved to dismiss the igra cause of action based on her interpretation of the restoration of lands exception in igra b b iii.following the secretary agreement to delay taking the land into trust,the district court ruled that the only reasonable interpretation of igra restoration of lands exception under b b iii applied to the land that the secretary had agreed to take into trust for the tribe.city of roseville norton,d.the court dismissed the cities igra cause of action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,and also dismissed or entered summary judgment against the cities on their remaining causes of action.
the igra was enacted in to regulate gaming on indian land.it does not treat all indian land equally.class iii gaming,which encompasses most games,is generally permitted on indian reservations,subject to certain conditions not at issue here including a valid compact and a validly enacted tribal ordinance,id.d.section of igra,however,imposes some limits.section a creates a prohibition gaming is not permitted on indian land taken into trust by the secretary after igra effective date,october,unless the land borders an existing reservation or is within the last recognized reservation of a tribe that was landless at the time igra was enacted unless the tribe is in oklahoma,in which case lands bordering its former reservation are exempted as well.this prohibition is subject to two exceptions in b.the first,b a,allows the secretary of the interior to override a and permit gaming on a newly acquired parcel when,after consultation with the indian tribe and appropriate state and local officials the secretary determines that a gaming establishment would be in the best interest of the indian tribe and its members,and would not be detrimental to the surrounding community,but only if the governor of the state concurs the second,b b,exempts lands taken into trust as part of the settlement of a land claim,the initial reservation of an indian tribe acknowledged by the secretary,or the restoration of lands for an indian tribe that is restored to federal recognition.b b i,b b ii,b b iii.the igra does not define a restoration of lands.
on appeal,the cities contend that the district court erred as a matter of law in holding,contrary to the plain meaning of igra b a,that the secretary was not required to make a threshold determination that the use of the auburn tribe land for gaming would not be detrimental to the surrounding communities and to obtain the governor concurrence.the cities do not challenge the secretary authority under aira to take the land into trust for the tribe.nor do they contend on appeal that the secretary decision to accept the tribe application improperly balanced the factors set forth in the department regulations,pt,by failing to give adequate weight to the cities concerns.thus,the cities appeal presents a single question of statutory interpretation.they contend that the secretary violated igra because the auburn tribe acquisition of the acres can not be a restoration of lands under igra b b iii as the tribe never owned those acres in the past as part of its former reservation,the rancheria,and the tract of land is too different from the rancheria to be a restoration of it.igra b a therefore forbids gaming on the land absent a finding by the secretary,concurred in by the governor,that gaming will not have a detrimental effect on the local community a finding the secretary did not make pursuant to b a.the cities maintain that the restoration of lands exception can bear only one meaning,namely,that lands must be either identical or almost identical to those previously owned in order to be a restoration,and that that reading is necessitated by the igra overall policy of limiting the expansion of indian gaming.
a few preliminary comments on the nature of our review.the district court dismissed the cities igra cause of action on the merits,holding that igra restoration of lands exception applied,and no party has challenged the district court decision to interpret the statute de novo.all parties urge this court to decide the matter as a question of law.the secretary,while noting that her interpretation is due deference,and invoking limited deference under skidmore swift,in the district court,does not invoke deference now as a basis for affirming the district court,and seeks affirmance of her interpretation of b b iii on the grounds relied upon by the district court.
we hold,in light of igra language,structure,and purpose,that the auburn tribe land qualifies as the restoration of lands under igra b b iii even though the land is not located on the tribe former reservation as of the time the auburn tribe lost federal recognition and is being put to a different use than the lands on the former reservation,the rancheria.the secretary,therefore,was not required to proceed under b a as the cities contend.see infra part ii b.this holding is consistent with the secretary interpretation.to the extent that the secretary interpretation of the restoration of lands provision may include nuances regarding its application to indian lands not acquired pursuant to a restoration act,the court has no occasion to reach the issue of deference to her interpretation in such circumstances.therefore,we turn to the merits of the cities contentions,examining the text of the statutory exception,its context within igra,and igra structure and purposes to determine the intent of congress in enacting the restoration of land exception.see generally babbitt sweet home chapter of communities for a great oregon,d engine mfrs.ass.
all parties urge plain meaning constructions of the exception,albeit with different nuances.the cities,citing webster dictionary,urge the narrowest construction of the word restoration as bring ing back to an original state,in light of their view that igra is designed to restrict gambling on indian reservations and to protect surrounding communities.the secretary and the tribe,also referring us to the dictionary,urge an interpretation of the word restoration that encompasses the concept of restitution.the tribe also points to this meaning of the word in ancient times as encompassing a broader concept of compensation.the book of exodus,for instance,at chapter,verse,requires that someone guilty of killing or selling another stock must restore five oxen for an ox,and four sheep for a sheep.
no circuit court of appeals has yet had occasion to address the scope of igra restoration of lands exception under b b iii,and district courts have assumed that lands are restored when included in a tribe restoration act.when the exception has been litigated,the question has usually been whether there can be a restoration of lands for an indian tribe restored to federal recognition even though the recognition of the tribe and the land grant did not occur as a result of the same statute implying that when they do it is the paradigm restoration of lands.for example,in confederated tribes of coos babbitt,d,the court rejected the secretary interpretation,since modified,that the restoration of lands exception applies only to lands taken into trust pursuant to a statute restoring a tribe to federal recognition,and held that lands a tribe acquires by other means might also qualify under certain circumstances.similar cases include oregon norton,d,grand traverse band of ottawa and chippewa indians attorney for western dist.of,d,grand traverse i and grand traverse band of ottawa and chippewa indians attorney for western dist.of,d,grand traverse ii.even assuming the instant case is not at the center of the paradigm because the aira does not identify these particular acres in placer county,the term restoration can nonetheless readily be construed to include lands acquired pursuant to the restoration statute aira from within the restored tribe service area designated in the aira.other cases interpreting the exception have also interpreted it broadly,for instance,in tomac norton,d,and sault marie tribe united states,d,as well as in grand traverse i,d at,and grand traverse ii,d at,district courts have read the other term in the exception indian tribe that is restored to federal recognition expansively,so as to include tribes whose termination or recognition is accomplished administratively rather than by an act of congress.
because the auburn tribe land is located in placer county,which was a designated area in the aira,and thus became,by operation of law,the tribe reservation,see c,the court has no occasion to decide whether land obtained by a tribe other than through the tribe restoration act is the restoration of lands for igra purposes,nor whether restored tribes include those whose termination or recognition has not been the result of congressional action.instead,the court must decide the ancillary question presented by the cities appeal of whether lands identified in a tribe restoration act as its reservation must meet the additional qualification of prior tribal ownership before the land can be considered a restoration of lands for an indian tribe that is restored to federal recognition.
all parties contend that the plain meaning of b b iii controls.the cities point to the dictionary definition of the word restore,and contend that the plain meaning of the term restoration of lands can not encompass lands over which a tribe did not exert prior ownership,or which are dissimilar from those the tribe previously owned.because to restore something means to bring it back to an original state,they maintain that the only lands that can be restored to the auburn tribe are those on its prior reservation,the rancheria,or lands sufficiently similar in nature that they can be said to bring the reservation back to its original state.other land acquired pursuant to aira,such as the acres that the secretary has agreed to take into trust,are simply lands acquired by the secretary in trust for the benefit of an indian tribe after october,for which the auburn tribe,like any other tribe that acquires new land,must meet the requirements of igra b a before the land can be used for commercial gaming.the cities maintain that the narrow reading of the word restore is supported by igra general ban on indian gaming because if a restoration of lands is allowed to encompass lands to which a tribe does not demonstrate a prior connection,such as prior ownership,the exception will swallow the rule.however,the secretary and the tribe respond with dictionary definitions of their own,contending that restoration encompasses the concept of restitution,such that it can be a restoration to give the auburn tribe lands to make restitution for past wrongs.they point out that this meaning of the word,even if less common in everyday parlance,is also included in the dictionary,fits far better with the structure of igra and the remedial purposes of aira,and is supported by aira provision that all lands taken into trust pursuant to the act shall be part of the tribe reservation.c.
there is much to commend the interpretation of the secretary and the auburn tribe regarding the scope of the restoration of lands exception.the igra plainly includes exceptions to its general prohibition of gaming on sites,and congress purpose in enacting igra includes the promotion of tribal economic,see,a purpose with which congress enactment of aira is entirely consistent.moreover,the syntax of the statute,which discusses not simply the restoration of the lands themselves,but their restoration for an indian tribe,fits more comfortably with the concept of restitution.even the definitions of restore the cities quote in their own brief include the notion of restitution.see appellants br.at,quoting webster ii new riverside university dictionary the riverside publishing.but,for the reasons advanced by the cities,a narrower construction of the exception is not without a measure of plausibility.in sum,neither side can prevail by quoting the dictionary.
we turn,therefore,to context,for the court is to consider not only the bare meaning of the word but also its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme,bailey united states,d.the force of the cities interpretation fades upon closer analysis,particularly in light of the general environment in which igra was enacted,its structure and general purpose.even assuming that the cities definition of restore as to bring back to an original state is the more common meaning of the word,the statutory context makes broader readings of b b iii more plausible.that a restoration of lands could easily encompass new lands given to a restored tribe to its land base and compensate it for historical wrongs is evident here,where much of the auburn tribe rancheria is,as a practical matter,unavailable to it.further,even under the cities definition of restore as to bring back to an original state,there would appear to be no reason to limit the original state to,rather than the earlier period before the tribe was granted only a reservation.section b b iii refers to the restoration of lands,not the restoration of a reservation.the maidu and meiwok tribes from which the auburn tribe descended once occupied much of central california.for the cities to now argue that the acres are a windfall,as if the tribe ancestors had never possessed any more,is ahistorical.given the history of indian tribes confinement to reservations,it is not reasonable to suppose that congress intended restoration to be strictly limited to land constituting a tribe reservation immediately before federal recognition was terminated.
the cities interpretation is also difficult to reconcile with igra other provisions.limiting a restoration of lands to the return of lands on a tribe prior reservation practically reads the restoration of lands provision out of existence.as one of the exemptions under b,the restoration of lands in b b iii,unless it is surplusage,must exempt some land that would otherwise fall within the gaming prohibition of a.but a b explicitly excludes the last recognized reservation of a tribe that has no reservation on october,from a prohibition.under the cities plain meaning interpretation whereby the only lands that can be part of a restoration are those in a tribe former reservation,the exception would be virtually bereft of meaning because gaming on such lands is not prohibited in the first place.if the auburn tribe had reacquired some of the land on its former reservation,the rancheria,it would have no need to look to the restoration of lands exception in b b iii in order to use the land for commercial gaming because a b would have excluded its rancheria from a ban on gaming.while a few scenarios might exist where b b iii would remain applicable under the cities interpretation such as in the case of tribes who held other reservations prior to their last recognized reservation,the scope of the exemption would be substantially diminished in a manner that would appear inconsistent with congress general goal under igra of promoting tribal economic development and,diamond game enterprises,reno.it is generally presumed that congress does not intend to enact surplusage,see babbitt sweet home chapter of communities for a great oregon,d.the difficulty of reassembling a former reservation as a result of the passage of substantial periods of time between the loss of federal recognition and its restoration is illustrated by the experience of the auburn tribe its rancheria is largely held in fee by individuals and unavailable as a practical matter more than a quarter of a century later.to be given meaningful effect,then,a restoration of lands would seem to encompass more than only the return of a tribe former reservation.
to the extent that the cities contend,as a fallback position,that,at the very least,land can not be considered brought back to its original state unless it is at least similar to the reservation it replaces,the cities effectively concede that a broader interpretation of the term restoration is appropriate.while this fallback interpretation would still allow the exception in b b iii to retain some meaning independent of a b,it concedes that lands different than those previously held by a tribe can still be part of a restoration.indeed,the cities view that the secretary violated igra by failing to make a factual determination that the accepted tract of land was substantially identical to the old rancheria depends on their view that the acres can not meet this standard because is too geographically distant,considerably more valuable,and to be put to commercial rather than residential use.but to the extent the cities rely on the notion that the auburn tribe new land can not be a restoration because it is not being used residentially,like the old rancheria was,their argument is nonsensical.the point of the restoration of lands exception is that such lands may be used for commercial gaming it would make no sense if a tribe use of land for gaming could defeat the land eligibility for gaming.moreover,these considerations undermine the cities plain meaning interpretation by admitting that a restoration of lands to a tribe can include different lands than those on its former reservation,as occurred here.
essentially,the cities maintain that the restoration of lands exception can not be read in a manner that would allow the auburn tribe t
