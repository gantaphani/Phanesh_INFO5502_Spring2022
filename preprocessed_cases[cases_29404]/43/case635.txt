the issue presented by this petition is whether provisions of the indian child welfare act apply in juvenile delinquency proceedings where the child is at risk of entering foster care,but where a termination of parental rights is not involved.
congress passed the indian child welfare act of icwa in response to a concern over the consequences to indian children,indian families,and indian tribes of abusive child welfare practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of indian children from their families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement,usually in homes.mississippi band of choctaw indians holyfield,d.icwa creates concurrent,but presumptively tribal jurisdiction in custody cases of indian children not domiciled on the reservation.id.at.at,d at.for custody proceedings that do take place in state court,icwa provides certain procedural safeguards,including requirements for notice,appointment of counsel,parental and tribal rights of intervention and petition for invalidation of illegal proceedings,and for consent to termination of parental rights.ibid.substantively,icwa mandates placement preferences for indian children.id.at.at,d at.
federal law expressly exempts from icwa reach cases involving the placement of a child based upon an act by the child that would be deemed a crime if committed by an adult.historically,this has meant that most juvenile delinquency proceedings have been exempt from icwa,because they are based on a juvenile act of committing a crime.however,in california passed legislation imposing upon the court,county welfare department,and probation department a duty of inquiry and notice in any proceeding brought pursuant to welfare and institutions code section where the child is at risk of entering foster care or is in foster care section brings within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court cases involving the commission of a crime by a minor.the duty in such cases is to inquire whether a child is or may be an indian child,and to provide notice to the child parents or guardian,indian custodian,and tribe of the right to intervene in the proceeding,the right to counsel for the parents or indian custodian,and the right to transfer the proceeding to tribal court.
in addition to this statutory mandate,the judicial council has adopted rules of court governing the requirements of inquiry and notice,as well as rules governing intervention,transfer,and the ultimate placement of the child.cal.rules of court,rules.these rules are specifically made applicable to proceedings under section in which the child is at risk of entering foster care or is in foster care.cal.rules of court,rule.
in spite of this authority,respondent sacramento county juvenile court determined pursuant to its own standing order that california law does not require the application of icwa to a juvenile delinquency proceeding where the case plan does not include the termination of parental rights 
we disagree with the juvenile court conclusion.while icwa may not by its own terms apply to a juvenile delinquency case in which the case plan anticipates foster care placement,the california legislature has expressly made the inquiry and notice requirements of icwa applicable in such cases,and impliedly made the remaining icwa requirements applicable in such cases as well.because icwa sets the minimum standards for the protection of indian children with respect to their tribal relationships,california law imposing a higher standard is not inconsistent with the purpose of the federal law,and is not preempted.
factual and procedural background 
first appeared in sacramento county juvenile court pursuant to a section petition alleging misdemeanor battery with serious bodily injury and felony assault with a deadly weapon.the petition alleged beat his mother boyfriend with a baseball bat during an argument between the mother and the boyfriend.
at the time of the initial detention,was under the jurisdiction of the contra costa juvenile court as a dependent child pursuant to section.admitted the misdemeanor battery,and the felony assault allegation was dismissed in the interest of justice.the court determined best interest would be served through dependency,and the matter was transferred to contra costa county.contra costa county placed on six months probation.when violated probation,contra costa terminated dependency jurisdiction and transferred the delinquency case to sacramento,where mother lived.
was adjudged a ward of the sacramento juvenile court in april,and was committed to the warren thornton youth center.in june,the probation department filed a motion for violation of probation,alleging failed to follow youth center rules,engaged in fighting,and participated in gang related activities.was arraigned on the violation and ordered detained in juvenile hall.the probation department recommended that after completed a commitment to juvenile hall,he should be committed to the custody of the probation officer for suitable foster care placement.specifically,the probation officer determined such placement was appropriate based on previous dependency history,the fact that all his siblings remain in long term placement and the minor s refusal to participate in counseling programs.
at a regularly scheduled settlement conference,counsel requested the court find icwa applicable to case.is a registered member of the crow creek sioux tribe of fort thompson,south dakota.the icwa matter was argued to the referee,and the referee issued a ruling finding that was an indian child and that icwa applied.the judge of the juvenile court became aware of the ruling,and granted a rehearing on the court own motion.
relying on its own standing order,the juvenile court vacated the referee order and found icwa was not applicable to the proceeding.standing order concluded that senate bill does not require application of the inquiry and notice provisions of icwa in a juvenile delinquency proceeding for a minor for whom the case plan does not include the termination of parental rights.for purposes of this discussion,senate bill is now codified at sections,et.
the standing order further concluded that rule of the california rules of court,which requires the application of icwa to any delinquent minor case when the minor is at risk of entering foster care or is in foster care directly contradicted the expressed intent of congress and the california legislature.in reaching this conclusion,the standing order pointed to title united states code section,which states that child custody proceedings for purposes of icwa shall not include a placement based upon an act which,if committed by an adult,would be deemed a crime,and section,subdivision c,which states that an indian child custody proceeding means a child custody proceeding within the meaning of section of the indian child welfare act 
the juvenile court found that the judicial council exceeded its authority to clarify the federal icwa statute and california statutory scheme by applying california rules of court,rule to delinquency cases 
filed a petition for writ of mandate to compel the juvenile court to vacate its order refusing to apply icwa.we issued an alternative writ,directing the juvenile court to grant the requested relief or show cause why it had not done so.further proceedings in this matter were stayed pending disposition of this petition 
discussion 
ithe federal indian child welfare act does not apply by its own terms in most juvenile delinquency proceedings 
in passing icwa,congress expressly assumed the responsibility for the protection and preservation of indian tribes and their resources.congress found that the most vital resource to the continued existence and integrity of the tribes was their children,and that the united states has a direct interest in protecting indian children.congress also found that too many indian families had been broken up by the often unwarranted removal of their children by nontribal public and private agencies,which agencies placed the children in foster care,adoptive homes,and institutions.
therefore,congress explicit purpose in passing icwa was to protect the best interests of indian children and to promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum federal standards for the removal of indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of indian culture,and by providing for assistance to indian tribes in the operation of child and family service programs.icwa seeks to protect the rights of the indian child as an indian and the rights of the indian community and tribe in retaining its children in its society.citation.it does so by establishing a federal policy that,where possible,an indian child should remain in the indian community,and by making sure that indian child welfare determinations are not based on a white,standard which,in many cases,forecloses placement with an indian family.citation.mississippi band of choctaw indians holyfield,supra,at.at,d at,fn.omitted.
as is relevant to this case,if icwa applies,the consequences are to require notice to the child parent or indian custodian and to the child tribe,to provide for the transfer of the proceedings to the jurisdiction of the tribe if the parent,indian guardian,or tribe petitions for transfer and the tribe accepts such jurisdiction,to allow the intervention of the child tribe in the state court proceeding,and to mandate placement preferences for the child,a,b.in determining whether icwa applies in this case,we turn to the language of the federal statute.
the transfer and intervention provisions of icwa are applicable,i n any state court proceeding for the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child b c.the notice provisions are applicable,i n any involuntary proceeding in a state court,seeking the foster care placement of a child,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved a.the placement preferences apply to a ny child accepted for foster care b.
foster care placement is defined by icwa as removing an indian child from its parent or indian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or indian custodian can not have the child returned upon demand,but where parental rights have not been terminated.i.however,the placement terms defined by icwa do not include a placement based upon an act which,if committed by an adult,would be deemed a crime or upon an award,in a divorce proceeding,of custody to one of the parents.
accordingly,the guidelines for state courts indian child custody proceedings guidelines,published by the bureau of indian affairs bia,provide that most juvenile delinquency proceedings are not covered by icwa.the only juvenile delinquency proceedings that are covered by icwa are proceedings involving status offenses such as truancy and incorrigibility,which can be committed only by children,and to delinquency proceedings that result in the termination of a parental relationship.ibid.
argues he was not subject to the crime exception set forth in icwa because his risk for foster care placement was based on violations of probation rather than on criminal acts.he argues his placement is being recommended as a direct result of his violation of the youth center contract,which would not be deemed a crime if committed by an adult.
the people argue that in determining whether the exception for placements based upon an act which,if committed by an adult,would be deemed a crime applies,we must look to the underlying fact that brings the juvenile within the court jurisdiction.in this case,that act is the misdemeanor battery admitted committing.
we need not determine in this case whether the criminal act exception should be based on the act upon which the court jurisdiction rests or upon the act immediately preceding the placement.we assume for purposes of this discussion that icwa does not by its own terms apply to the case before us because of the criminal act exception.we conclude the provisions contained in icwa nonetheless apply as provided by california law.
california law provides that icwa is applicable in delinquency proceedings where the child is at risk of entering foster care 
prior to,it had long been accepted in california that icwa did not apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings.see in re enrique th,d it has long been presumed that the icwa does not apply to placements that arise from delinquency proceedings adoption of lindsay d.the language of the act makes but two exceptions it does not apply to the custody provisions of a divorce decree nor to delinquency proceedings.
in,the california rule of court dealing with the application of icwa was amended.rule was amended to make it applicable to proceedings under section delinquency proceedings in which the child was at risk of entering foster care or was in foster care.the rule was amended to clarify that the probation department had a duty in juvenile wardship proceedings where the child was at risk of entering foster care or was in foster care,to inquire whether the child may be an indian child.
in,the legislature passed senate bill.senate bill,in pertinent part added sections through,and amended section to the welfare and institutions code.as is relevant here,section makes its provisions applicable to proceedings under a section delinquency petition.
the purpose of the state law is to protect the essential tribal relations and best interest of an indian child by promoting practices,in accordance with the icwa and other applicable law,designed to prevent the child involuntary placement and,whenever that placement is necessary or ordered,by placing the child,whenever possible,in a placement that reflects the unique values of the child tribal culture and is best able to assist the child in establishing,developing,and maintaining a political,cultural,and social relationship with the child tribe and tribal community,subd.a.
state law differs from federal law in that it imposes on the court and probation department an affirmative and continuing duty to inquire whether a child for whom a petition under section is to be,or has been,filed is or may be an indian child in all dependency proceedings and in any juvenile wardship proceedings if the child is at risk of entering foster care or is in foster care,subd.a.section provides for the jurisdiction of the juvenile court to adjudge a person under the age of to be a ward of the court when he or she violates the law.thus,california law,unlike icwa,imposes a duty of inquiry in juvenile proceedings arising out of an act which would be deemed a crime if committed by an adult,where the child is at risk of being placed in foster care or is in foster care.
in addition to the duty of inquiry,section,subdivision d imposes a duty to provide notice in cases involving an indian child.notice must be given to the parents,indian custodian,tribe,and bureau of indian affairs bia,subd.a.the notice must contain information generally identifying the proceeding,the child,the child tribe,and the child ancestors,and must contain a statement of the following 
i the absolute right of the child parents,indian custodians,and tribe to intervene in the proceeding.
ii the right of the child parents,indian custodians,and tribe to petition the court to transfer the proceeding to the tribal court of the indian child tribe,absent objection by either parent and subject to declination by the tribal court.
iii the right of the child parents,indian custodians,and tribe to,upon request,be granted up to an additional days from the receipt of the notice to prepare for the proceeding.
iv the potential legal consequences of the proceedings on the future custodial and parental rights of the child parents or indian custodians.
v that if the parents or indian custodians are unable to afford counsel,counsel will be appointed to represent the parents or indian custodians pursuant to section of the indian child welfare act et.
vi that the information contained in the notice,petition,pleading,and other court documents is confidential,so any person or entity notified shall maintain the confidentiality of the information contained in the notice concerning the particular proceeding and not reveal it to anyone who does not need the information in order to exercise the tribe rights under the indian child welfare act et,subd.a g.
if such notice is provided and no determinative response that the child is or is not a member of or eligible for membership in a tribe is received from either a tribe or the bia within days of receipt of notice,the court may determine that icwa does not apply to the proceedings,subd.e.
section is the only section of the california legislation implementing icwa that expressly applies to juvenile delinquency proceedings the duties expressly imposed under section on the court,county welfare department,and probation department are duties of inquiry and notice.however,the notice required under section includes notice of the right to intervene,the right to transfer the proceeding to tribal court,and the right to counsel.since the notice would be meaningless without the underlying substantive right,we may imply section confers these rights in delinquency matters as well.
additionally,section,subdivision e,states that if notice has been provided and neither a tribe nor the bia responds within the statutory time frame,the court may determine that icwa does not apply to the proceedings,provided the court shall reverse such determination and apply the act prospectively if it is subsequently confirmed that the child is an indian child.the converse is implicit.thus,if the tribe or the bia makes a timely confirmation that the child is an indian child,then icwa does apply to the proceedings.
the people argue that the legislature was almost exclusively focused on dependency cases,evidenced by the fact that the legislative counsel summary does not mention delinquency,the legislation itself contains only two statutes that concern delinquency,and the governor signing statement makes no mention of extending icwa to delinquency cases.
even if the legislature were almost exclusively focused on dependency rather than delinquency cases in reforming indian child placement procedures,it was not completely focused on dependency cases.we can not simply ignore the language of section requiring inquiry and notice in delinquency proceedings.furthermore,the clear implication of this section is that all of the icwa protections be applied in delinquency proceedings if the child is at risk of entering foster care or is in foster care.
the legislative counsel summary of the bill does not provide that the legislation is inapplicable to delinquency proceedings.even if it did,we would have to disregard it because of the conflicting statutory language.the summary does not have the force of law,and it is for this court to interpret the statutory language.katie superior court th,d.nor are the statements by the governor binding,since the interpretation of a statute is a judicial function.guillen schwarzenegger th,d.
the people also argue that we should look to section to determine whether icwa applies.that section defines a number of terms used in the statutes relating to indian children.as is relevant here,it provides that an indian child custody proceeding means a child custody proceeding within the meaning of title united states code section,including a proceeding for temporary or foster care as previously discussed,child custody proceedings under title united states code section do not include delinquency proceedings to the extent they are based on an act which,if committed by an adult,would be deemed a crime 
section and section are not in conflict,they merely cover different proceedings.section specifically applies to juvenile wardship proceedings brought under section section,and is not limited by the section definition of an indian child custody proceeding.any conflict may be reconciled by giving each statute its appropriate range of application.to conclude otherwise would require us to ignore the plain language of section,which specifically imposes upon the court,the county welfare department,and the probation department a duty of inquiry and notice in cases involving a petition under section where the child is at risk of entering foster care or is in foster care.
as previously noted,the notice required by this section includes the notice of certain rights provided under icwa.if we accept the people argument,we would also have to ignore the clear implication of section,subdivision e that icwa applies to the proceedings if either the tribe or bia acknowledge that the child is a member of or eligible for membership in the tribe.
the people argue that certain rules of court mandate results that the legislature could not have intended.specifically,rule a provides that the court can not order placement of an indian child unless it finds by clear and convincing evidence that remaining with the parent is likely to cause the indian child serious emotional or physical damage the people argue that while this requirement makes sense in dependency cases,in delinquency cases it could bar placement for a minor who needs treatment for the protection of society.also rule mandates the transfer of a case to the tribal court of the child tribe if the child is a ward of the tribal court or if the child resides on the reservation of a tribe that has exclusive jurisdiction over child custody proceedings.the people argue this rule,if applied in delinquency cases,would substantially interfere with the duty of the delinquency court to protect society from the minor delinquent behavior.
we conclude these concerns are addressed by the california statutory definition of children who are at risk of entering foster care based upon the juvenile court jurisdiction over them pursuant to sections and.while the federal definition of foster care placement is broad,encompassing temporary placement in a foster home or institution or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or indian custodian can not have the child returned upon demand,but where parental rights have not been terminated,foster care for purposes of a section or proceeding are strictly limited by state statute.i,subd.d.moreover,at risk of entering foster care as used with reference to a section or proceeding,means that conditions within a minor family may necessitate his or her entry into foster care unless those conditions are resolved,subd.d.
the definition of the phrase,at risk of entering foster care found in section,subdivision d is the appropriate definition of the phrase in section because the same wording is used and because section specifically deals with placements in delinquency cases.
thus,if,as the people speculate,there are minors who are placed in foster care to protect society from their delinquent behavior,they would not be subject to the application of icwa.the distinction to be drawn is between children for whom foster care placement is being considered because they can not or should not be returned to their homes for their own safety,security,or,and children for whom foster care placement is being considered for the protection of society.this is a factual determination for the trial court.only indian children who are at risk of entering foster care or are in foster care are covered by the application of icwa 
this distinction is consistent with the following comments regarding the coverage of icwa found in the federal guidelines.
the entire legislative history makes it clear that the act is directed primarily at attempts to place someone other than the parent or indian custodian in charge of raising an indian on a permanent or temporary basis.although there is some overlap,juvenile delinquency proceedings are primarily designed for other purposes.where the child is taken out of the home for committing a crime it is usually to protect society from further offenses by the child and to punish the child in order to persuade that child and others not to commit other offenses.
placements based on status offenses actions that are not a crime when committed by an adult,however,are usually premised on the conclusion that the present custodian of the child is not providing adequate care or supervision.
