the omaha tribe of nebraska the tribe appeals from a final judgment entered in the district court refusing to vacate or modify an arbitration award in favor of missouri river services,mrs.the award directed the tribe to pay,plus interest,to mrs for its capital investment in an unsuccessful casino project on the tribe lands in nebraska.for reversal,the tribe argues that the judgment violates its sovereign immunity.the tribe also argues that the district court erred because the award failed to draw its essence from the agreement between the parties and is contrary to public policy.the tribe especially challenges the arbitrator decision directing that the award be satisfied from profits generated by a casino operating on the tribe lands in iowa.for the reasons stated below,we reverse and remand.
background 
on december,the tribe and steicher sons,later renamed mrs,entered into an agreement in which the tribe gave mrs the exclusive right to construct and operate a gaming facility on the tribe lands.the agreement provided that the facility would be suitable for the purpose of operating highstakes bingo and other gaming activities,as well as complementary businesses,collectively referred to as the enterprise.under the agreement,mrs was responsible for securing the necessary funds to construct the casino,and its capital investment would be repaid from revenues of the enterprise.
in the event of disputes arising under the agreement,article xi provided for binding arbitration.article xi also provided for a waiver of the tribe sovereign immunity as follows 
the tribe hereby waives its sovereign immunity from suit with respect to any disputes arising under this agreement,but only to the extent of all real and personal property purchased pursuant to this agreement,and the tribe further agrees that judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof any monetary judgment or award may be satisfied only out of such property out of the tribe share of any future net operating profits under this agreement.
pursuant to article vi of the agreement and,the parties submitted the agreement to the bureau of indian affairs bia for approval.article vi provided that mrs was not obligated to proceed with its obligations herein until such approval shall have been obtained.as relevant here,provided that an agreement with an indian tribe for the payment or delivery of any money or for the granting or procuring any privilege in consideration of services for said indians relative to their lands shall bear the approval of the secretary of the interior and the commissioner of indian affairs indorsed upon it.section further provided all contracts or agreements made in violation of this section shall be null and void.
by memorandum of april,the bia requested that the parties make certain changes to the agreement.to obtain the necessary approval,the parties amended the agreement to add article xix,which stated the location of the enterprise was thurston county,nebraska and article xx,which stated the enterprise shall conduct bingo and activities.on february,the bia approved the agreement,as amended the agreement.
in october,congress passed the indian gaming regulatory act,et.igra,which requires that all contracts dealing with gaming on indian land be approved by the chairperson of the national indian gaming commission nigc.igra defines three classes of gaming,with class i being social games,class ii being bingo and similar games,and class iii being all other forms of gambling.igra permits class iii gaming on indian lands,provided that such activities are located in a state that permits such gaming,and are conducted in conformance with a compact.d.although mrs knew of the pending passage of the igra,knew that nebraska prohibited class iii gaming,and a facility without class iii gaming would not be economically feasible,it nonetheless had begun construction of a class iii gaming casino,assuming that it would be grandfathered in under the igra.
in november,mrs opened the facility for bingo and announced a full casino with class iii gaming would open on december.on december,the united states attorney for the district of nebraska informed the parties that they could not conduct class iii gaming,threatening prosecution.on january,mrs sought federal judicial relief,asserting that the casino fell within the scope of the grandfather clause of the igra.the district court disagreed and denied relief,and mrs did not appeal.as mrs believed,the bingo operation was not financially feasible.in september,mrs closed the casino,after having invested in excess of six million dollars in capital and operating expenditures.
in october,the tribe and mrs executed a second amendment to agreement,which was never approved by the bia nor the nigc.the amendment stated that although the parties had intended that the enterprise include class iii gaming,the enterprise had ceased operations due to the passage of the igra and the inability of the tribe to reach a compact with the state of nebraska to permit class iii gaming.in order that the tribe could conduct gaming at other locations within its lands,mrs agreed to waive the exclusivity clause of the agreement.in,the tribe contracted with another company to open and operate a casino to conduct class iii gaming on the tribe lands in onawa,iowa.the tribe and the state of iowa entered into the necessary compact.the casino opened in approximately july.according to mrs,the casino generated more than million in profits in the first year,most of which resulted from class iii gaming.
mrs demanded arbitration,seeking,among other things,reimbursement of its capital investment in the nebraska facility.the tribe resisted,asserting that mrs had not exhausted tribal court remedies.mrs filed a state court suit,seeking to enjoin the tribal court proceedings.the tribe removed the suit to federal district court,which eventually held that exhaustion of tribal court remedies was not required.in submissions to the arbitrator,each party accused the other of having breached the agreement.the tribe also argued that the agreement limited mrs right to recover its capital investment to the extent that there were any operating profits from the bingo operation or to the property purchased pursuant to the agreement.the arbitrator found in favor of mrs on its reimbursement claim,awarding it for its capital investment,plus interest.the arbitrator directed that t he award is to be paid from the enterprise,which includes all gaming operations on the reservation of the omaha tribe of nebraska the property,including specifically the gaming operation at onawa,iowa or from any other funds the tribe may elect to use.
mrs filed a motion in the district court to confirm the award.the tribe filed a motion to vacate,or in the alternative to modify the award.in confirming the award,the district court rejected the tribe argument that entry of the award would violate its sovereign immunity.the court noted that a waiver of immunity must be clear and unambiguous,that a court must construe a waiver narrowly,and that the tribe waiver of immunity was limited.however,the court believed the arbitrator had determined the scope of the waiver and that it wa s not at liberty to disturb that interpretation.the court also rejected the tribe arguments that the arbitration award failed to draw its essence from the agreement.
discussion 
waiver of tribal immunity 
we first consider the tribe arguments concerning waiver of immunity from suit.the tribe argues that the district court erred in deferring to the arbitrator interpretation of the scope of its waiver.assuming the arbitrator attempted to interpret the scope of the waiver of immunity,which we doubt,we agree with the tribe that the district court erred in believing it could not disturb her interpretation.because a waiver of immunity from suit implicates jurisdictional concerns,a court must satisfy itself that jurisdiction exists.see jones united states,cir.contrary to mrs suggestion,the tribe attorney could not expand the scope of the tribe waiver from suit in the submission to the arbitrator.see united states united state
