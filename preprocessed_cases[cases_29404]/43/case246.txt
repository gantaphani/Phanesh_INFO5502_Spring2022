background

section is part of the indian gaming regulatory act igra,stat.igra regulates tribal gaming activity on indian lands.to facilitate igra objectives,congress established the national indian gaming commission commission.
igra requires that an indian tribe have a gaming ordinance or resolution before offering certain classes of gaming activity.b,d.even though igra limits tribal gaming to locations on indian lands,cnty.cmty.alliance salazar,cir,a proposed ordinance need not specify the location of a proposed gaming establishment,id.at,and the commission is not obligated to make an indian lands determination as part of the process of approving a proposed ordinance,id.at.
factual and procedural background 
livingston was the general manger of the chukchansi gold resort and casino from may through january.chukchansi gold is owned and operated by the picayune rancheria of the chukchansi indians.chukchansi gold gaming ordinance was approved by the commission for gaming only on indian lands.
livingston was indicted in july of on two counts of theft by an officer of a gaming establishment on indian lands under b.the original indictment alleged that livingston used a chukchansi gold credit card to purchase a personal vacation and to make a down payment on a personal vehicle.before trial,livingston orally moved to dismiss the indictment.he argued the government would be unable to prove chukchansi gold was operated pursuant to a ordinance because it would be unable to prove that chukchansi gold is actually located on indian lands.the district court denied the motion to dismiss because it was unclear what the government would be able to prove at trial.the first jury deadlocked.
before the case was,livingston moved again to dismiss the indictment on the same general grounds.the district court order denying the second motion to dismiss reviewed the title history of the relevant land and concluded that livingston had not met his burden of showing that the government would be unable to prove that chukchansi gold was operated pursuant to a ordinance.but the district court also ruled that,at trial,the government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the chukchansi gold casino is located on indian lands.in ruling that this proof would be required,the district court apparently reasoned that chukchansi gold ordinance was approved for gaming only on indian land.
the government filed a superseding indictment in september alleging a third violation of b based on livingston use of a chukchansi gold credit card to purchase sports and music memorabilia.it also alleged six counts of mail fraud.livingston moved to dismiss the superseding indictment on the ground that it was insufficiently specific with respect to the mail fraud counts.he also renewed his argument that the indictment should be dismissed because it did not allege that the chukchansi gold casino is on indian lands.the district court concluded the mail fraud counts were alleged with sufficient specificity and that the location of the casino is not a separate element of b.the case went to trial a second time and a jury convicted livingston on all counts.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the indictment 
on appeal,livingston argues the superseding indictment was insufficient because it did not allege that the chukchansi gold casino is on indian lands,did not provide adequate notice of one of the alleged violations of b,and did not provide sufficient notice of the mail fraud charges.
we review the sufficiency of an indictment de novo.united states milovanovic,cir en banc.
an indictment must provide the defendant with a description of the charges against him sufficient to enable him to prepare his defense ensure him that he is being prosecuted on the basis of facts presented to the grand jury enable him to plead double jeopardy against a later prosecution and inform the court of the facts alleged so that it can determine the sufficiency of the charge.
united states bohonus,cir.to satisfy these requirements,the indictment must allege the elements of the offense charged and the facts which inform the defendant of the specific offense with which he is charged.id.citing hamling united states.
theft from a gaming establishment on indian lands 
we first consider whether b requires proof that the gaming establishment is located on indian lands,and we begin that inquiry by examining the language of the statute.see united states johnson,cir.
the text of b requires only that the gaming establishment be operated pursuant to a ordinance or resolution.livingston argues the title of the statute,theft by officers or employees of gaming establishments on indian lands,creates an ambiguity when juxtaposed against the statutory language.but because the statute itself is unambiguous,its title is immaterial.see carter united states,t he title of a statute is of use only when it sheds light on some ambiguous word or phrase in the statute itself.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
livingston also argues that the location of the gaming establishment is an implicit jurisdictional element of.we do not agree that congressional authority to criminalize theft from a tribal gaming establishment derives from the location of the gaming establishment.the indian commerce clause provide s congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of indian affairs.cotton petroleum new mexico.section of title criminalizes embezzlement and theft from indian tribal organizations.in united states anderson,cir,we held that regulates conduct within the scope of the indian commerce clause.anderson relied on cases upholding the major crimes act and the federal enclave act as legitimate exercises of congressional authority under the indian commerce clause.at citing united states lomayaoma,cir,and united states keys,cir.anderson reasoned that,i f it is within congress power to regulate crimes committed by or against an indian in indian country,then congress did not exceed its power under the indian commerce clause by making it a crime for anyone,including an indian,to steal funds or property of an indian tribal organization.id.
because congress authority under the indian commerce clause extends to theft from tribal organizations generally,it also extends to theft by an officer from a gaming establishment operated or licensed by an indian tribe.therefore,federal jurisdiction does not depend on proof that the gaming establishment at issue in a b prosecution is located on indian lands.
livingston also argues that b requires proof that the gaming establishment is on indian lands because it is part of an overarching statutory scheme that applies only to tribal gaming activity
