this case requires us to decide whether a federal court has jurisdiction to hear an indian tribe suit to stop a state agency from investigating tribal employees complaints of workplace discrimination.the maine human rights commission has investigated complaints by three former employees of the aroostook band of micmacs,and asserts that it has the authority to investigate any future complaints,pursuant to maine antidiscrimination law.the band filed this action for injunctive and declaratory relief against the commission investigations,arguing that such investigations impermissibly encroach upon the band inherent tribal sovereignty,right to without state interference,and sovereign immunity from judicial or proceedings.the district court concluded that the band complaint did not invoke a right to relief under federal law,but rather invoked affirmative federal defenses to state law actions,and therefore did not satisfy the complaint rule.consequently,the court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we reverse.
the aroostook band of micmacs is a federally recognized indian tribe.over a four month span in,the band fired three tribal employees chief financial officer lisa gardiner,compliance officer tammy condon,and housing director beverly ayoob.pursuant to internal tribal procedure,gardiner and condon appealed the band termination decisions to the band tribal council,claiming that they were terminated in retaliation for protected activities the tribal council affirmed their terminations.ayoob,who had filed a sexual harassment charge with the tribal council before being terminated,did not challenge her termination

in the fall of,gardiner and condon filed complaints with the commission alleging employment discrimination on the basis of race,color,and national origin,as well as retaliation,under the maine human rights act mhra.ann.tit,and the maine whistleblowers protection act mwpa.ann.tit.in the summer and fall of,ayoob filed two complaints alleging employment discrimination and retaliation under the mhra and mwpa.in each case,shortly after receiving the individual complaint,the commission filed charges on the complainant behalf with the united states equal employment opportunity commission eeoc under title vii of the civil rights act of.
the band asked the commission to dismiss all four complaints on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction over the band.the commission refused,concluding that it had jurisdiction because the band is subject to the mhra,the mwpa,and,for gardiner and condon complaints,title vii.it investigated the complaints,and on at least two occasions issued document requests to the band seeking a variety of tribal personnel documents.the band complied with those requests.
in january,the commission investigator issued a report suggesting that there were no reasonable grounds to believe that the band had discriminated or retaliated against gardiner or condon.before the full commission could rule on the report,the band filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of maine against the executive director and members of the commission collectively,maine,and the three individual complainants,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief directing the commission to dismiss the complaints on the ground that the band is not subject to the mhra or mwpa,and stop filing complaints against the band with the eeoc.the complaint,as amended,pled five claims that the enforcement of the mhra and mwpa against the band violates its inherent tribal sovereignty and statutorily codified right to count i that the enforcement of these state laws against the band violates its tribal sovereign immunity count ii that the band is exempt from title vii count iii that the band exemption from title vii preempts state antidiscrimination law,and so,regardless of what the mhra and mwpa say,the band is not subject to them count iv and that,even under the mhra and mwpa own terms,the band is not an employer count v.
shortly after the complaint was filed,the commission determined that,contrary to its investigator initial report,there were reasonable grounds to believe that gardiner and condon had been retaliated against based on protected conduct.meanwhile,gardiner and condon filed suit against the band in aroostook county superior court that court stayed the action pending the outcome of the federal litigation 
in federal court,the parties consented to adjudication by a united states magistrate judge,and for summary judgment.although both parties addressed the merits of the band claims,maine also argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in february,the district court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint.see aroostook band of micmacs exec.dir.me.human rights comm n,d,micmacs.specifically,the district court concluded that counts i and ii did not raise questions arising under federal law as required by the applicable jurisdictional statutes,and that counts iii and iv did not allege a justiciable case or controversy consequently,the court dismissed the entire action.see.h court must dismiss action upon determining,at any point,that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction.the band timely appealed.
the relationship between maine and the indian tribes located within its borders is complex.the band relationship with the state is particularly complex.we provide a brief summary of the recent history of that relationship,and include some background concerning three other maine tribes,to set the stage for the legal analysis that follows.
a.the legislation 
in the,two penobscot nation and the passamaquoddy suit claiming much of maine as their ancestral homelands.see generally penobscot nation fellencer,cir recounting history.neither tribe was federally recognized at that point.the aroostook band of micmacs was not represented by counsel at the time and was not a party to the litigation 
in,with the aid of the united states,the penobscots and the passamaquoddy reached a compromise with maine.a third tribe,the houlton band of maliseet indians,which had not filed suit but was represented by counsel and had a potential claim,was later included in the compromise.see.the resulting settlement was embodied in the maine implementing act.ann.tit,see also a the state of maine,with the agreement of the passamaquoddy tribe and the penobscot nation,has enacted legislation defining the relationship between the passamaquoddy tribe,the penobscot nation,and their members,and the state of maine.houlton band of maliseet indians me.human rights comm n.
under the affected all indians,indian nations,and tribes and bands of indians in the state.ann.tit,not just the named penobscots and the passamaquoddy received somewhat more advantageous terms than the maliseets.the penobscots and the passamaquoddy obtained territory and all the governmental rights and powers of municipalities within maine.see id.by contrast,the maliseets received only land held in trust for them by the united states,and no municipal powers.see id.
in exchange for what the tribes received,and partly as a result of the tribes disputed status,the state of maine,as part of the settlement,obtained legal authority over the tribes exceeding the usual state authority over native american tribes.penobscot nation,cir penobscot nation ii,aff g d,penobscot nation i.here,too,the tribes did not receive equally favorable treatment.for reasons that will become apparent later,we highlight the special status of the maliseets.
before the passage of the maine implementing act,neither maine nor the united states had officially recognized the maliseets,and maine was reluctant to accord them special status.instead,the act subjected the maliseets to maine law to a greater degree than the penobscots or the passamaquoddy.the maliseets were subject to a default clause applicable to all indian tribes 
except as otherwise provided in this act,all indians,indian nations,and tribes and bands of indians in the state shall be subject to the laws of the state and to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the state to the same extent as any other person or lands or other natural resources therein.
ann.tit.however,the penobscots and passamaquoddy benefitted from an important exception for those two tribes,internal tribal matters,including tribal organization,and tribal government shall not be subject to regulation by the state.id.by contrast,the maliseets received no such privilege.rather,the act emphasized that t he houlton band of maliseet indians and its lands will be wholly subject to the laws of the state.id.
congress ratified the settlement through the maine indian claims settlement act micsa.among micsa purposes were to ratify the maine implementing act and to confirm that all other indians,indian nations and tribes and bands of indians now or hereafter existing or recognized in the state of maine are and shall be subject to all laws of the state of maine.id.b.micsa reiterated the distinction between the maliseets and the other two tribes as to applicability of maine law 
except as provided in two provisions not relevant here,all indians,indian nations,or tribes or bands of indians in the state of maine,other than the passamaquoddy tribe,the penobscot nation,and their members shall be subject to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the state,the laws of the state,and the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the state,to the same extent as any other person or land therein.
b.the micmac legislation 
in the years following the passage of micsa,the band,through counsel,raised its own claims with the state of maine.in,maine and the band reached a settlement that was memorialized in the micmac settlement act.ann.tit.the act generally accorded the band the same status as the maliseets,not the greater powers and autonomy enjoyed by the penobscots and the passamaquoddy.see id.subjecting band to state laws and court jurisdiction without exception,land to be held in trust by united states,no municipal powers for band.
in,at the behest of both maine and the band,congress enacted the aroostook band of micmacs settlement act federal micmac settlement act,stat.codified at note.the federal micmac settlement act explained that t he band was not referred to in micsa because historical documentation of the micmac presence in maine was not available at that time.id.a,stat.at.now that such documentation was available,congress found that t he aroostook band of micmacs,in both its history and its presence in maine,is similar to the houlton band of maliseet indians and would have received similar treatment under micsa if the information available today had been available to congress and the parties at that time.id.a.consequently,the federal micmac settlement act aimed to afford the aroostook band of micmacs the same settlement provided to the houlton band of maliseet indians for the settlement of that band claims,to the extent the micmacs would have benefited from inclusion in micsa.id.a.on this basis,congress ratif ied the state micmac settlement act,which defines the relationship between the state of maine and the aroostook band of micmacs.id.b,stat.at.
three provisions of the federal micmac settlement act are relevant here.first,the act provides for the band may organize for its common welfare and adopt an appropriate instrument in writing to govern the affairs of the band when acting in its governmental capacity.id.a,stat.at.
second,despite congress stated desire to provide the band with the same settlement provided to the houlton band of maliseet indians for the settlement of that band claims,id.a,stat.at,the federal micmac settlement act does not explicitly subject the band to maine law.section b of the federal act,entitled laws applicable,subjects the band to federal law on the same terms as the other maine tribes.stat.at.nothing in the federal act explicitly subjects the band to maine law.by contrast,the earlier micsa explicitly stated that all indian tribes other than the passamaquoddy and penobscots shall be subject to the civil jurisdiction of the state,the laws of the state,and the civil jurisdiction of the courts of the state,to the same extent as any other person or land therein.a id.b.
finally,the federal act provided that i n the event of a conflict of interpretation between the provisions of the state maine implementing act affecting the penobscots,passamaquoddy,and maliseets,the state micmac settlement act,or the federal maine indian claims settlement act of and this act,the provisions of this federal micmac settlement act shall govern.federal micmac settlement act,stat.at.
although the issues raised in the band complaint go to the heart of its relationship with maine,this appeal is narrow.as noted,the district court did not reach the merits rather,it dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.consequently,we do not decide whether the band claims have merit,but only whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over those claims.in so doing,we review de novo the district court dismissal.wang bd.of registration in,cir.in reviewing the dismissal,we construe the complaint liberally and treat all facts as true,according the plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences.murphy united states,cir.
counts i and ii against the commission defendants were dismissed under the complaint rule.counts iii and iv were dismissed for lack of a justiciable case or controversy.we divide our analysis accordingly.
the band action seeks to enjoin state officials from enforcing the mhra and mwpa on the grounds that enforcing those acts against the band conflicts with federal law and thus violates the supremacy clause of the united states constitution see generally ex parte young.authorizing such actions.we must decide whether the complaint pleads an ex parte young claim in a manner that establishes federal jurisdiction 
the band bases its claim of federal jurisdiction on and.section grants the district courts jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.section grants the district courts jurisdiction over all civil actions,brought by any indian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the secretary of the interior,wherein the matter in controversy arises under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.the district court dismissed counts i and ii on the grounds that they did not satisfy either or under the complaint rule.
a.the complaint rule and ex parte young 
the supreme court has long construed to require that it be apparent from the face of the plaintiff complaint either that a cause of action arise under federal law,or at least in some cases that a traditional cause of action present an important federal issue.penobscot nation ii,at citation omitted.under this rule,the federal claim or issue must appear on the face of a well,properly pleaded complaint,so that federal jurisdiction is absent where the federal issue would arise only as a defense to a state cause of action.id.quoting louisville nashville mottley.second alteration in original.the same rule applies to claims filed in state court and then removed to federal court under,cir i n deciding for removal purposes whether a case presents a federal claim or right,a court is to ask whether the plaintiff claim to relief rests upon a federal right,and the court is to look only to plaintiff complaint to find the answer.quotation marks and citation omitted.
as noted,the supreme court has long recognized a federal cause of action for allegations that a state officer enforcement of state law would violate federal rights.see ex parte young,at.while the court did not identify a specific federal cause of action in ex parte young itself,t he best explanation of ex parte young and its progeny is that the supremacy clause creates an implied right of action for injunctive relief against state officers who are threatening to violate the federal constitution or laws.burgio campofelice,state dep t of labor,cir quoting charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure jurisdiction see also local union massachusetts,cir no explicit statutory cause of action is needed for an ex parte young action because the rule that there is an implied right of action to enjoin state or local regulation that is preempted by a federal statutory or constitutional that such an action falls within the federal question.quoting richard fallon et,hart wechsler the federal courts the federal system ed.
it is simply beyond dispute that a complaint which properly pleads a claim for relief against state officers under the ex parte young implied right of action will satisfy the complaint rule.see verizon,pub.serv.comm n,d there is no doubt that federal courts have jurisdiction under over an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against state officials on the grounds that a state regulation was preempted by federal law shaw delta air lines,d in unanimous decision,stating that it is beyond dispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal rights local union,at verizon maryland eliminates any doubt that declaratory or injunctive actions against state officials to prevent interference with federal rights qualify for jurisdiction playboy enters.pub.serv.comm n,cir reiterating,despite some uncertainty as to why supreme court jurisprudence developed as it did,that federal courts have jurisdiction over an action by a plaintiff seeking injunctive relief from a state enforcement action,on the ground that state law is preempted by a federal statute.
the above propositions are and our discussion of jurisdictional principles could end here.after all,we have identified a federal cause of action that will qualify for jurisdiction the only remaining question is whether the band complaint properly pleads such an action.however,maine argues that the principles established in a different line of cases require dismissal.we explain below why maine arguments fail.in doing so,we emphasize two fundamental principles.first,under the complaint rule,the plaintiff complaint is the document in which the federal claim must appear,regardless of whether that complaint was filed in federal court pursuant to,or filed in state court and then removed to federal court pursuant to.second,by definition,an ex parte young action can only be brought against state officer defendants the supremacy clause implies no right of action against private parties,or by state officers.
by focusing on these points,we can make some sense out of the array of cases invoked by maine in support of its argument that the band complaint runs afoul of the complaint rule.the cases upon which maine federal jurisdiction was,quite simply,not ex parte young cases.these cases fall into three groups cases where state officers were not parties at all cases where state officers were plaintiffs,not defendants and cases where state officers were defendants,but there was some other serious flaw in the complaint such that ex parte young was not properly pled.
state officers not parties 
several of the cases on which maine relies did not even involve state were between private parties,or between a tribe and a private party.see skelly oil phillips petroleum.private party private party ttea ysleta del sur pueblo,cir private party tribe colonial penn group,colonial deposit,cir private party private party.in such cases,the ex parte young cause of action is not available.therefore,the private plaintiffs only federal cause of action in those cases was the declaratory judgment act itself.in such cases,w hatever federal claim plaintiff may be able to urge would in any event be injected into the case only in anticipation of a defense to be asserted by defendants,and the declaratory judgment act does not provide an independent basis for jurisdiction.skelly oil,at.
state officers were also absent from penobscot nation,the primary case upon which the district court relied in finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.see micmacs,d at.that was a suit by a tribe against a private party indeed,the district court recognized in that case that i f the tribes were seeking to enjoin state officials,federal jurisdiction would exist,but where,as here,private parties are defendants,ex parte young analysis does not apply.penobscot nation i,d at.
simply put,where state officers are not even alone ex parte young cause of action is unavailable.that is the context in which we stated that the complaint rule can not be avoided by having the beneficiary of the federal defense assert the defense preemptively in a claim for declaratory or injunctive relief.penobscot nation ii,at.consequently,penobscot nation maine describes as much like this case is in fact completely unlike this case for jurisdictional purposes.
state officers as plaintiffs 
in the second class of cases,state officers sue a private party in state court and the defendant removes to federal court.see.tax comm graham,d per curiam state agency tribe in state court franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d state agency private party in state court for jurisdictional purposes,two problems confront such defendants first,by definition,the action is not an ex parte young action,since it has been brought by state officers,not against them second,it is the state plaintiff complaint,not the defendant answer or motion to dismiss,that is analyzed under the complaint rule.in graham and franchise tax board,the state complaint pled only state claims,and hence there was no jurisdiction under.such removal cases have no bearing on an ex parte young action 
indeed,for ex parte young purposes,this class of cases is formally identical to the previous class the defendant is not a state officer.we have described it separately,however,because of a curious asymmetry.if a private party files an action against state officers alleging that their enforcement of state law violates the private party federal rights,that is an ex parte young action and jurisdiction is available.but if the state officers file an action in state court to enforce that very state law,and the private party seeks to remove to federal court on the basis of the same preemption argument,that is not an ex parte young action,and there is usually no federal jurisdiction unless there is some other basis for jurisdiction.
this asymmetry is,however,a virtually inevitable consequence of the fact that,even though an ex parte young action is in some ways the mirror image of state prosecution,jurisdiction is determined from the complaint alone in the first the private party files an ex parte young action in federal federal court looks at the plaintiff complaint and sees a federal cause of action.in the second the state files a state law action in state court and the private party federal court looks at the plaintiff complaint and sees only state law issues.while this asymmetry may yield odd results or incentives to race to the courthouse,it is a logical consequence of the complaint rule itself.
some other defect precludes ex parte young jurisdiction 
in the third class of cases,the parties are properly aligned for an ex parte young defendants are state some other defect precludes ex parte young jurisdiction.the leading example of this class is public service commission wycoff.a dictum in that case stated that federal jurisdiction does not extend to declaratory judgment actions that assert federal defenses to state claims.see id.at.see also franchise tax,at.quoting wycoff.but,as the court made clear,the flaw in wycoff was that,while the complaint sought to resolve a disputed question of federal law,it did not actually assert any federal rights or violations 
the complainant in this case does not request an adjudication that it has a right to do,or to have,anything in particular.it does not ask a judgment that the commission is without power to enter any specific order or take any concrete regulatory step.it seeks simply to establish that,as presently conducted,plaintiff carriage of goods between points within as well as without utah is all interstate commerce.one naturally asks,so what to that ultimate question no answer is sought.
id.at.the court held that the complaint did not state a claim for relief under the declaratory judgment act,and was unripe in any event.id.at.consequently,it was not necessary to determine whether the alleged controversy over an action that may be begun in state court would be maintainable under the head of jurisdiction.id.at.
the oddly deficient complaint in wycoff might be sui generis among published appellate cases.indeed,we have found no case in which we applied the wycoff dictum to a case in the posture of wycoff,no case in which we applied wycoff to an ex parte young action and found jurisdiction lacking.at any rate,the flaw in wycoff is not present here.
conclusion 
maine reliance on the complaint rule,when reduced to its essentials,is misguided.the band seeks injunctive and declaratory relief against the commission and its officers for purportedly violating its federal rights.assuming that other requirements of ex parte young are,that there is a colorable claim of a federal claims qualify for arising under jurisdiction under the complaint rule.
it is true that the band arguments could arise as defenses in a state court action.but a properly framed federal cause of action does not fall outside simply because it could also arise as an affirmative federal defense in state court.f ederal jurisdiction is absent where the federal issue would arise only as a defense to a state cause of action.penobscot nation ii,at emphasis added.just because a federal issue could arise as a defense to a state law action does not mean that the federal issue can only arise as a defense to a state law action.in fact,the federal claims in most ex parte young actions could be raised as affirmative defenses to state court actions.but an ex parte young action though ultimately defensive in the sense that it seeks to prevent harms threatened by state constitute a federal question under.local union,at.
relying on penobscot nation,the district court in this did not have the benefit of our local union that it must look at the individual defendants mhra and mwpa complaints as they are tendered in the state court hypothesized how those complaints might play out and imagined how,in potential state court proceedings,the band might answer and assert as affirmative defenses the contents of their three vii counts in this declaratory action.micmacs,d at.it then concluded that the band claims could be raised as affirmative defenses,and hence were not part of a federal complaint.
as verizon maryland and local union make clear,that is not the correct analysis.the question is not whether the allegedly federal claims could be raised as affirmative defenses to a state action,but rather whether they could only be so raised.with an ex parte young action,that is clearly not the case.such an action rests,at bottom,on the implied federal right of action created by the supremacy clause.that implied right of action,when properly pled,supplies the basis for arising under jurisdiction under.the question here is whether the complaint properly pleads such a claim.
count i application of mhra and mwpa to the band 
to analyze count i basis for jurisdiction,we first sketch its outline next,we determine whether the rights that the band alleges are colorable,federal,and potentially preemptive of contrary state laws and,finally,we examine the state argument that there is no actual or threatened state enforcement action 
count i argues that the commission investigation of tribal personnel affairs violates two closely related but conceptually distinct federal rights tribal sovereignty,as inherent to the band and reaffirmed by congress when it extended federal recognition to the band and a statutory right to tribal,derived from section a of the federal micmac settlement act it contends that the latter act,which finally resolves the band legal status and controls any prior law,does not grant the state any jurisdiction over the personnel practices of the band governing body.
count i fundamentally asserts two rights inherent tribal sovereignty and tribal under section of the federal micmac settlement act.we examine each.
tribal sovereignty 
tribal retained sovereignty predates federal,it predates the birth of the republic.rhode island narragansett indian tribe,cir.because of their sovereign status,tribes are insulated in some respects by a historic immunity from state and local control,and tribes retain any aspect of their historical sovereignty not inconsistent with the overriding interests of the national government.new mexico mescalero apache tribe,d citations omitted.
when we speak of a tribe sovereignty,we mean its powers as a government.at its apex,tribal sovereignty can include broad powers to determine the form of tribal government to determine membership to enact substantive criminal and civil laws that apply to tribal members within tribal territory to regulate domestic relations,such as marriages and divorces,and the descent and distribution of the property of tribal members to impose taxes to operate court systems and administer justice and to exclude persons from tribal territory.see felix cohen,handbook of federal indian law ed.of course,not all tribes retain the full panoply of these powers today.a tribe retains those aspects of sovereignty that have not been withdrawn by treaty or statute,or by implication as a necessary result of the tribe dependent status.united states wheeler,d.congress broad powers over tribes are both plenary and exclusive,united states lara,d quotation marks and citation omitted,and only congress can abrogate or limit an indian tribe sovereignty,fellencer,at.
one important aspect of tribal sovereignty is the power of regulating its internal and social relations,which includes the right of internal.wheeler,at.citation omitted.a tribe power to maintain or establish its own form of government is the first element of sovereignty.handbook of federal indian law,supra,at.the form of tribal government may reflect the tribe determination as to what form best fits its needs based on practical,cultural,historical,or religious considerations.id 
this right to may preempt contrary state law.conceptually,inherent tribal sovereignty is a doctrine of federal common law.see lara.at the supremacy clause applies to federal common law no less than federal statutes.see wilburn boat fireman fund ins.where the federal courts have the authority to fashion federal common law,s tates can no more override such judicial rules validly fashioned than they can override acts of congress sampson,cir unlike earlier general common law,the federal common law of today fall s under the supremacy clause.consequently,tribal sovereignty may preempt contrary state law under the supremacy clause.state jurisdiction is by the operation of federal law if it interferes or is incompatible with federal and tribal interests reflected in federal law,unless the state interests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertion of state authority.mescalero apache tribe,at.
in short,inherent tribal sovereignty is a federal common law right that preempts contrary state law,and is therefore a proper basis for an ex parte young action.
statutory right to 
in addition to inherent sovereignty,the band also asserts a statutory right to codified in section a of the federal micmac settlement act the band further notes that,while micsa required the governing instruments of the penobscots,passamaquoddy,and maliseets to be consistent with the terms of micsa and the maine implementing act,the federal micmac settlement act requires only that the band governing instrument be consistent with the terms of the federal micmac settlement act itself.compare id.with a.and the federal micmac settlement unlike not explicitly subject the band to maine law.see supra part.finally,the band argues,while micsa admittedly makes all indians,indian nations,or tribes or bands of indians in the state of maine,other than the passamaquoddy tribe and the penobscot nation subject to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the state,the laws of the state,and the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the state,to the same extent as any other person therein,a,the federal micmac settlement act explicitly states that it controls in case of a conflict with the maine implementing act,micsa,or the state micmac settlement act.see federal micmac settlement act,stat.at 
the complaint anticipates the state the federal micmac settlement act ratified the state micmac settlement act,which did make the band subject to the laws of the state and to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the state to the same extent as any other person therein.ann.tit,attempts to neutralize it in two ways.
first,the band contends that only congress can make a tribe subject to state law.congress did not do so in the federal micmac settlement act,and in fact it specified that the federal act controls in the event of a conflict with the state act.see federal micmac settlement act,stat.at.
second,the band contends that the entire state micmac settlement act never took effect.a provision of that act provided that t his act shall be effective only if w ithin days of adjournment of the legislature,the secretary of state receives written certification by the council of the aroostook band of micmacs that the band has agreed to this act.me.laws.that did not band never formally certified that it agreed to the state micmac settlement act as required by the act terms thus,the band argues,the state micmac settlement made the band subject to the laws of took effect,and is null and void.consequently,the federal act,which purported to ratify the state act,could not do so,because congress simply can not ratify a state law.
however,the band continues,the federal micmac settlement act did implicitly repeal the earlier state and federal maine implementing act and the extent that they applied to the band thus,in the band view,federal common law and the federal micmac settlement act are the only applicable law determining the scope of the band right to,and neither subjects the band to state law.
despite the complex argument concerning the validity of the state micmac settlement act,w hether a case is one arising under federal law,in the sense of the jurisdictional statute,must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff statement of his own claim,unaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.graham,at.quoting taylor anderson.second and third alterations in original.the band alleges that it holds a federal right,deriving from section a of the federal micmac settlement act,to without state interference,and that this right preempts contrary state law.this is a proper basis for an ex parte young action.
maine principal response is that,even if a violation of a federal right is alleged,ex parte young jurisdiction is not satisfied because here there is no actual or threatened enforcement action by state officials.see morales twa,d in ex parte young suits such as this one,which the plaintiff intends as a first strike to prevent a state from initiating a suit of its own,the prospect of state suit must be imminent,for it is the prospect of that suit which supplies the necessary irreparable injury.emphasis added ex parte young,at.i ndividuals who,as officers of the state,are clothed with some duty in regard to the enforcement of the laws of the state,and who threaten and are about to commence proceedings to enforce,against parties affected,an unconstitutional act,violating the federal constitution,may be enjoined by a federal court of equity from such action.
we have recognized an imminence requirement in ex parte young actions,though the extent to which it is jurisdictional rather than just a substantive element of the action or a limit on equitable discretion may be subject to debate.see hemp council,marshall,cir in an action to enjoin criminal prosecution,describing the imminence requirement as often referred to as a standing requirement but probably more complex in character,involving as well concerns about ripeness and the exercise of equitable discretion accord audubon soc y,davis,cir we decline to read additional ripeness or imminence requirements into the ex parte young exception beyond those already imposed by a general article iii and prudential ripeness analysis,opinion amended on other grounds on denial of reh g,cir.indeed,in morales the lack of imminence did not divest the district court of jurisdiction it simply meant that the court should have issued a narrower injunction.at.but we need not resolve here the question of whether imminence is purely a merits question or also required for jurisdiction,because the band has adequately alleged a threat of enforcement which would satisfy any jurisdictional requirement 
the flaw in maine analysis is its assumption that only court proceedings constitute enforcement,ignoring the threats to tribal sovereignty,and sovereign immunity posed by the investigations themselves.twice in recent years we have found jurisdiction over actions to enjoin state discrimination investigations.see local union,at,court had jurisdiction over ex parte young action to enjoin proceedings of massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad on the grounds that state law was preempted by national labor relations act chaulk.comm against discrimination,cir same,where mcad only activity so far had been issuing interrogatories.similar logic applies here 
finally,the fact that the target of an investigation yields to the agency demands and cooperates to some degree does not rob the investigation of its coercive power.see,major league baseball butterworth,d,enjoining civil investigative demand cid for answers to interrogatories and document production,and noting that f ar from part of a legal proceeding,a cid may be issued only before a legal proceeding is filed moreover,it seems likely that the vast majority of cids result merely in compliance,with no court proceeding ever filed by anyone,unless the investigation leads to the filing of an enforcement action,which may or may not occur,aff on other grounds sub nom.major league baseball crist,cir.the target has a right to challenge the investigation itself in federal court,and this right is not forfeited by compliance with the investigative demands 
the recipients of the cids had several options available,but only one option could yield the desired result.the most obvious option would have been to comply with the terms of the cids.but this option was unattractive because the cids were burdensome,and the recipients believed that the federal exemption gave them a federal right to be free not only from antitrust prosecution,but also from this investigation.second,the recipients of the cids could have filed suit in state court this option was similarly unattractive because of unfavorable and probably incorrect state law.this left option three an action in federal court,the present lawsuit.
here,the band had essentially the same choices.by statute,the maine commission has the right of access at all reasonable times to premises,records,documents,individuals and other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine,record and copy those materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as are reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation.ann.tit,b.in light of this broad authority,the fact that the commission did not need to exercise its subpoena power to compel access to or production of those materials or the appearance of those persons,may simply mean that the band decided to first comply with state law,and then challenge its applicability.
an indian tribe that is unlawfully called to answer before a state agency may suffer both practical harms and intrusions upon its sovereignty.as a practical matter,the band asserts,i nvestigations,interrogatories,and discovery divert the micmac government from other pressing official matters and consume scarce resources includ ing the expense of legal consultation during the commission investigations and discovery.petroleum exploration pub.serv.comm n.jurisdictional minimum was met by the necessary expense of producing the information demanded by the order,which was not collateral or incidental to the purpose of the injunction,but a threatened expense from which relief is sought.as a more symbolic matter,simply being called to appear and defend its internal employment practices before a state agency may be an insult to a tribe sovereignty and right to.bishop paiute tribe county of inyo,cir holding that execution of warrant against tribe to obtain employee records violated tribal immunity because at issue is not just the tribe right to protect the confidentiality of its employee records,but the more fundamental right of the tribe not to have its policies undermined by the states and their political subdivisions,vacated on other grounds sub nom.inyo county indians,d fed.comm state ports,d forcing a state to submit to adjudication before a federal administrative agency is an affront to a state dignity because the state is required to defend itself in an adversarial proceeding sometimes,congress requires a tribe to submit to such invasions.we do not comment on whether congress has done so that the band may argue its case in a federal forum.
conclusion 
for purposes,count i adequately alleges that,pursuant to federal common law and the federal micmac settlement act,the band possesses both inherent tribal sovereignty and a statutory right to,and that the enforcement of state law against the band violates these rights.consequently,the district court erred in dismissing count i for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
count ii tribal sovereign immunity 
count ii alleges that,as a matter of federal law,the band tribal sovereign immunity bars the enforcement of state law against it.the difference between the rights asserted in count i and the tribal sovereign immunity asserted in count ii is subtle but important.the band alleged rights to and tribal sovereignty mean,in essence,that it is not subject to state laws at least those that purport to regulate the internal governance affairs of the band itself at all.by contrast,tribal sovereign immunity means that the band is not amenable to state judicial or proceedings to enforce those laws.see kaighn smith,federal courts,state power,and indian tribes confronting the complaint rule,contrasting doctrines of infringement of tribal sovereignty versus tribal sovereign immunity.in short,we read count i to allege that the band is not subject to the mhra and mwpa,and count ii to allege that,even if the band is subject to those acts,it is not subject to the power of any maine tribunal to investigate and enforce those laws 
as a matter of federal law,an indian tribe is subject to suit only where congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity.kiowa tribe,d santa clara pueblo martinez,d.this immunity applies in state proceedings as well as federal proceedings.kiowa tribe,at.the band has filed a suit to enjoin state officials from interfering with its alleged federal right of tribal sovereign immunity.such an action would appear to satisfy the requirements of verizon maryland and local union.see kiowa indian tribe hoover,cir reversing district court denial of tribe motion for preliminary injunction against enforcement of state court judgments on the grounds of tribal sovereign immunity.
maine argues,however,that tribal sovereign immunity can not be asserted in an ex parte young action.its principal authority for this argument is graham,in which the supreme court held that a tribe,sued in state court by the state,may not remove to federal court on the basis of tribal sovereign immunity because a federal immunity to the claims asserted does not convert a suit otherwise arising under state law into one which,in the statutory sense,arises under federal law.at.in maine view,graham stands for the proposition that a tribal sovereign immunity defense can not form the basis of arising under jurisdiction.but maine fails to recognize that count ii pleads a tribal sovereignty offense.as described above,there is a crucial difference between removal of a state claim and an ex parte young action.see supra part.the complaint rule applies to the plaintiff complaint,regardless of whether it was filed in state court or federal court.see,at applying rule to complaint filed in state court.the complaint in graham contained an oklahoma law tax claim the complaint here contains a claim under a federal cause of action asserting a federal common law right.graham addressed whether a defendant may remove on the basis of a tribal sovereign immunity defense it simply does not apply where a plaintiff pleads an ex parte young action on the basis of the federal right of tribal sovereign immunity.
again,a key flaw in maine analysis is its assumption that tribal sovereign immunity is only a defense to a lawsuit,and since the commission has not filed or threatened to file suit against the band,considerations of tribal sovereign immunity are premature.but tribal sovereign immunity might apply to the commission investigations themselves we do not hold that tribal sovereign immunity applies to such proceedings,nor even that the band actually retains tribal sovereign immunity in light of micsa and the federal micmac settlement act.see supra note.we simply conclude that the band claim of tribal sovereign immunity presents a colorable claim of a federal cause of action under ex parte young.consequently,the district court erred in dismissing count ii for lack of jurisdiction 
counts iii and iv relate to a provision in the civil rights act of stating that indian tribes are not employers under title vii.see b.count iii seeks a declaration that the band is not subject to title vii,and an injunction against the commission from applying title vii to the band and filing charges against the band with the federal eeoc.count iv alleges that the title vii exemption preempts contrary state law,and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief that the commission may not apply the mhra and mwpa against the band.in other words,count iii claims that the band is exempt from title vii,while count iv says that because the band is exempt from title vii,it must be exempt,as a matter of federal law,from the mhra and mwpa too.the district court dismissed both counts on the grounds that they did not pose justiciable cases or controversies.see micmacs,d at.we disagree.
count iii title vii exemption 
until recently,commission staff would apparently,as a matter of course under the agencies dual filing procedure automatically file eeoc complaints against the band on behalf of commission complainants and let the eeoc decide whether title vii applied.this practice has apparently stopped,and the commission admitted in its answer that title vii does not apply to the band.fellencer,at title vii exemption applies to penobscot nation boudman aroostook band of micmac indians,d,same for the band.the commission current position is that it does not file discrimination charges against tribes with the eeoc unless the commission has some reason for believing that title vii might somehow apply.
maine argues that there is no justiciable case or controversy because there is no dispute all parties agree that the band is exempt from title vii,and hence there is nothing for a court to resolve.the district court apparently agreed.see micmacs,d at.while the district court did not identify which branch of case or controversy doctrine supported its ruling,we understand it to have meant the dispute was moot.
the dispute is not moot because nothing prevents the commission from resuming its former practice.v oluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not make the case moot.united states grant.the reason is simple the defendant is free to return to his old ways.id.voluntary cessation will only moot a dispute when it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur,and interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.los angeles county davis,d citations omitted alteration in original.the defendant burden of establishing mootness is a heavy one,grant,at,and it must be absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.united states concentrated phosphate export ass n,d.
the commission has not met that burden.first,the record indicates that the commission referred four different complaints to the eeoc after the united states district court for the district of maine held in boudman that the band is exempt from title vii second,even the commission concession is qualified.it reserves the right to file eeoc charges against the band if it has some reason for believing that title vii might somehow apply.for these reasons,the commission has not adequately demonstrated that its voluntary cessation is permanent.
the district court advanced a second reason why count iii does not present a case or controversy even if the commission were still referring charges against the band to the eeoc,such act would have no possible operative effect under the law because the band is,in fact,exempt under boudman.micmacs,d at.we read this as finding that the complaint does not allege an for standing purposes.in other words,even if the commission erroneously files an eeoc charge against the band,such referral causes no cognizable injury.see generally steir girl scouts of the usa,cir summarizing article iii requirement.
we disagree.as a general rule,w hen the suit is one challenging the legality of government action and the plaintiff is himself an object of the action there is ordinarily little question that the action has caused him injury,and that a judgment preventing the action will redress it.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the band alleges two specific injuries from the commission filing of charges with the eeoc.first,the band asserts dignitary harm it is forced to defend itself to the eeoc when,it claims,congress has shielded the band from such investigations entirely.as the band notes,if the desire to use or observe an animal species,even for purely esthetic purposes,is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of standing,id.at,then repeated filing of arguably frivolous federal charges against an indian tribe that congress has expressly exempted from the law reach also causes a cognizable injury.similarly,if the loss of the right to litigate in the forum of one choice is cognizable,see int l primate prot.league adm rs of tulane educ.fund,d,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in parker della rocco,cir,then so too is being forced to litigate in a forum where one is not required to appear at all.
second,the band asserts economic harm it must respond to the charge and pay attorneys to argue that it is exempt.even assuming that the eeoc immediately agrees with the band and dismisses each case,repeatedly forcing the band to defend obviously futile title vii complaints makes it incur financial costs that qualify as a cognizable injury.aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d holding that denial of motion to dismiss on eleventh amendment grounds is immediately appealable under collateral order rule,and explaining that the value to the states of their eleventh amendment immunity is for the most part lost as litigation proceeds past motion practice.
because the band had standing to raise count iii and that claim was not rendered moot by the commission voluntary cessation of its conduct,the district court erred in dismissing count iii for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
count iv title vii preemption 
count iv alleges that title vii preempts the mhra and mwpa to the extent that those laws include the band within their respective definitions of employer.the district court stated that it consider ed the question settled as to the maine tribes and cited shannon houlton band of maliseet indians,d,for the proposition that the title vii exemption does not preempt state law as to the maliseets.micmacs,d at see also fellencer,at the idea that the title vii exemption operated to preempt state law with respect to the maliseet indians was clearly not intended by the micsa 
however,after a brief discussion of the merits and why the rule of shannon applies to the band,the district court ultimately concluded that count iv does not raise a case or controversy.micmacs,d at.that analysis is incorrect.the fact that the band position might be difficult to maintain because another district court has already answered the legal question in the state favor does not mean that there is no case or controversy.plaintiffs are free to bring cases that fly in the face of precedent.when they do so,however,those cases should be resolved on the legal or factual merits,not dismissed for lack of a case or controversy.courts should not conflate the constitutional standing inquiry with the merits determination that comes later.united states share,cir 
one might argue though maine did not that,even if the district court has jurisdiction over counts,it should nevertheless abstain from exercising that jurisdiction.under the doctrine of railroad commission of texas pullman,a federal court may abstain when a federal constitutional challenge turns on a state statute,the meaning of which is unclear under state law.harris county comm rs court moore,d.in such circumstances,a federal court should stay its hand in order to provide the state courts an opportunity to settle the underlying question and thus avoid the possibility of unnecessarily deciding a constitutional question.id.at.here,litigation in state court might lead to a holding that the band is not an employer under the mhra and mwpa,and thus eliminate the need to resolve the federal claims in this case.
even assuming arguendo that abstention is proper when the only constitutional issue in the case is preemption abstention is inappropriate here.since the principal federal issue is whether the band is subject to state law and required to submit to the jurisdiction of state tribunals whether administrative or judicial at all,requiring the band to first try its hand in state proceedings would be perverse.state toll highway,cir district court erred in abstaining from deciding state agency eleventh amendment defense so that state court could decide whether agency had waived immunity as a matter of state law.for the band to argue that it is not an employer under the mhra and mwpa,it must first submit to the jurisdiction of the state court.that is precisely what it does not wish to do,and it has come to federal court explicitly seeking a ruling that it need not defend itself in state court.since the band has asserted a dignitary harm in being forced to defend itself before the commission,let alone maine courts,abstention would be tantamount to a decision on the merits against the band.
one final matter remains.besides the commission defendants,the band also sued gardiner,condon,and ayoob,the former employees who charged the band with discrimination.the complaint does not allege any unlawful activity by the individual defendants,nor pray for relief against them on appeal,the band concedes that it seeks no injunctive relief against the individual defendants,and confines its argument to the commission defendants.we assume that the individual defendants were joined as persons needed for just adjudication pursuant to.a,because they have an interest in the action and,arguably,their ability to protect that interest would be impaired without their participation.we express no view on this subject,but,given our disposition of the rest of the case,vacate the dismissal of the complaint as against the individual defendants for reconsideration on remand 
with the exception of count v,which the band apparently concedes is purely a state law claim,the band is entitled to make its case,and receive a determination on the merits,in federal court.because it dismissed the entire action,the district court did not consider whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over count v under.we express no view regarding whether,on remand,it should do so,nor whether,in making that decision,the court should consider the possibility of certifying the state law question to the maine supreme judicial court.see me.
as to the individual defendants,we vacate the dismissal of all claims.as to the commission defendants,we reverse the dismissal of counts i,ii,iii,and iv for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,vacate the dismissal of count v,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
because of the narrow jurisdictional nature of this appeal,the substance of the discrimination charges is not relevant.
while the complainant can skip the commission altogether and proceed straight to court,maine law provides a significant incentive not to do so.successful court plaintiffs can recover attorney fees,civil penal damages,compensatory damages,or punitive damages only if they had exhausted their commission remedies before filing suit.id.
the complaint relies on three but distinct doctrines tribal sovereignty,tribal sovereign immunity,and a statutory right to.although we explain the differences between these below in detail,see infra parts,we provide thumbnail definitions here.tribal sovereignty is a common law doctrine recognizing tribes inherent powers to,including the power to determine the structure and internal operations of the governing body itself,and exempting tribes from state law that would otherwise infringe upon this sovereignty.tribal sovereign immunity is a common law doctrine providing that tribes are immune from lawsuits or proceedings without their consent or congressional waiver.finally,the band claims a statutory right to deriving from section a of the federal micmac settlement act,which provides that the band may organize for its common welfare and act in its governmental capacity.stat.at.according to the band,this provision reaffirms and codifies the common law doctrine of tribal sovereignty as it applies to the band.
again,the merits are not relevant here.
at that point,the commission had not yet made a determination regarding ayoob complaint.
the record does not reveal why maine did not argue lack of subject matter jurisdiction earlier,by filing a motion to dismiss under.b.at any rate,it was proper to raise the issue at summary judgment.subject matter jurisdiction may be challenged at any stage.h.
the band apparently concedes that count v does not present a federal claim.we address later the possibility not argued by the state that the federal courts should abstain pending resolution of the state law claim,which might render resolution of the federal issues unnecessary.see infra part vi.
apparently there was some confusion as to whether the aroostook band of micmacs was distinct from the larger canadian band of micmacs.see generally.
we have also assumed that micsa implicitly incorporates into federal law the internal tribal matters exception of the maine implementing act as it applies to the penobscots and the passamaquoddy.see penobscot nation ii,at.
this constitution,and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,art.vi,cl.
the complaint pleads a violation of,but the band appears to have abandoned that argument as the litigation progressed.in light of the supreme court recent statement that a tribe may not sue under to vindicate the sovereign right of tribal sovereign immunity,inyo county indians,d,the band probably would not have a colorable argument here.at any rate,in its appellate brief,the band barely mentions,and we deem any potential argument to be forfeited.see united states,cir.
in local union,a supervisor filed a complaint against a labor union with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad based on alleged sexual harassment during the course of a labor dispute.at.mcad rejected the union argument that the complaint was preempted by federal labor law.id.at.the union then filed a federal action against mcad,three commissioners,and the complainant,seeking an injunction and a declaratory judgment that mcad proceedings were preempted by federal law.id.at.we held that the union claims against a state administrative agency for declaratory and injunctive relief,alleging that the agency has acted in a manner inconsistent with federal law,asserted an ex parte young claim and thus satisfied the complaint rule.id.at.
in penobscot nation,paper companies threatened to sue two tribes in maine court to compel them to turn over certain documents pursuant to state law.the tribes sued first in federal court,seeking an injunction against any state court lawsuit and a declaratory judgment that the maine freedom of access act violates their federal right to be free of such state regulation.penobscot nation i,d at citation omitted.
in graham,the state cause of action derived from oklahoma tax law.the tribe removed to federal court and raised tribal sovereign immunity as a defense.see at.
in franchise tax board,a state tax agency,seeking to collect unpaid taxes from union members,attempted to levy the sums from the members accounts in the union vacation trust.the trust resisted,claiming that the accounts were protected from state levies by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,a.the agency sued the trust in state court for the unpaid sums and a declaratory judgment that erisa did not preempt the state authority to levy against the trust the trust removed to federal court.see at.the supreme court ruled that the state claim for damages arose under state law,and federal law arose only as a defense.see id.at.regarding the state declaratory judgment claim,the court held that a state law claim with a federal law defense can not be converted to a federal claim by seeking a declaratory judgment that the federal defense does not apply.see id.at.
franchise tax board itself recognized that had the trust defendant in the state court action brought an ex parte young action instead of removing to federal court,the outcome might well have been different defendant clvt might have been able to obtain federal jurisdiction under the doctrine applied in some cases that a person subject to a scheme of federal regulation may sue in federal court to enjoin application to him of conflicting state regulations,and a declaratory judgment action by the same person does not necessarily run afoul of the skelly oil doctrine at.
as one commentator on federal jurisdiction in the indian law context has noted graham simply exemplifies the paradox for the complaint rule presented by ex parte young actions.had the tribe proceeded in federal court to seek injunctive relief against the state officers imposing the disputed tax,the tribe would have invoked federal question jurisdiction,for its affirmative claim for relief would have been a cognizable federal cause of action under ex parte young,there
