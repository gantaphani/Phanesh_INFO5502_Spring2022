this appeal addresses whether a district court has subject matter jurisdiction over a suit brought for enforcement of an arbitration award by a corporation against the navajo nation or the nation,a federally recognized indian tribe located primarily in arizona.the complaint filed by plaintiffs peabody coal company,peabody western coal company,and peabody holding group,collectively peabody seeks enforcement of an arbitration settlement agreement made between the parties in setting royalty rates for coal mined pursuant to a commercial lease.the lease itself had been previously approved by the department of the interior.peabody contends that the federal question in this case is the enforceability of commercial indian mineral leases approved by the secretary of the department of the interior secretary under federal law.we hold that peabody claim does not meet the requirements of federal question jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court dismissal of the case.
in,peabody predecessor in interest the sentry royalty company leased the right to mine substantial coal deposits located on navajo lands lease.in exchange for the right to mine this coal,peabody agreed to pay the navajo nation a royalty fee a percentage of the monthly gross revenue obtained from sale of the coal.under this original lease agreement,the secretary was authorized to make reasonable adjustments to these royalty rates after twenty years,and every decade thereafter.in,the parties entered a second lease for a different parcel of land lease,which did not permit the secretary to make royalty rate adjustments.
under the indian mineral leasing act of imla,stat,the secretary must approve mineral leases between native tribes and commercial companies to ensure that a tribe profits are maximized and that the lease terms are in the tribe best interest.leases and were accordingly approved by the secretary.
in,after the leases had been in effect for some twenty years,the chairman of the navajo nation asked the secretary to readjust the royalty rates.an interior department area director for the bureau of indian affairs bia,donald dodge,issued an initial decision raising the royalty rate for lease to,a substantial increase over the prior level of.peabody challenged dodge decision in an administrative appeal lodged with the department of the interior.the navajo nation has alleged that,during the pendency of peabody appeal,a lobbyist hired by peabody made improper ex parte contacts with donald hodel to encourage him to reduce the royalty rate.secretary hodel allegedly asked the bia to delay issuing its decision,which allowed peabody more time to negotiate with the navajo nation to obtain a lower rate.
negotiations continued and eventually,in,the parties agreed to amend the original leases in several ways.first,the amendments specified a royalty rate for lease of and for lease of.the parties agreed to petition the secretary to vacate area director dodge previous decision setting the rate at.
next,the amendments created new procedures to adjust royalty rates in the future.removing the provision in lease that permitted the secretary to set a reasonable royalty rate,the parties substituted arbitration clauses in both leases as the sole and exclusive method for the determination or readjustment of royalty rates for periods beginning on and after february.if the parties could not agree upon new rates,they agreed in advance to submit to binding arbitration.the navajo nation also agreed to waive its sovereign immunity from actions to enforce or appeal any resulting arbitration decision 
lessor and its officers acting in their official capacity consent to suit in the united states district court for the district of arizona for the limited purpose of the enforcement or appeal of any arbitration decision pursuant to this article,and agree not to raise sovereign immunity or exhaustion of tribal remedies as a defense to such suit.
amendments to lease.the lease amendments were approved by secretary hodel as being in the navajo nation best interest.
in the late,the parties attempted to renegotiate the royalty rates.when negotiations failed,the navajo nation requested arbitration in under the procedures created by the lease amendments.although an arbitration panel was convened,the parties were able to reach a negotiated settlement.the settlement was memorialized in an arbitration award.the award retained the royalty rates on lease,on lease.unlike the underlying mineral leases and their amendments,the arbitration award did not require approval by the secretary.the parties agreed that no action of the secretary is necessary to give full and final effect to the arbitration award.
in addition,the parties executed a brief amendment to the leases.under this amendment,peabody agreed to pay the navajo nation a lump sum bonus payment of in exchange for the covenants,promises,terms and conditions contained herein and in the separate settlement agreement between the parties.bruce babbitt,the new secretary of the interior,approved this lease amendment on march.
these events nonetheless spawned several lawsuits in different jurisdictions in,the navajo nation sued peabody and several other defendants in the united states district court for the district of columbia.the nation alleges violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico and other related claims stemming from peabody alleged ex parte contacts with former secretary hodel.the relief sought by the tribe includes reformation of lease to incorporate the royalty rate proposed by area director dodge in.at issue in this appeal is the complaint peabody filed on february,in the united states district court for the district of arizona arizona action,seeking to enforce the final arbitration award between the parties.peabody complaint contends that because the arbitration settlement agreement was entered by the arbitration panel as a final award,and because the navajo nation did not appeal the award,it is enforceable in the district of arizona under the navajo nation waiver of sovereign immunity in the lease amendments 
on march,the navajo nation filed a motion to dismiss peabody arizona action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to peabody failure to present a federal question.arizona district judge robert broomfield held a brief hearing on the motion,during which counsel for the navajo nation was asked where peabody could bring suit to enforce the arbitration award if not in the district of arizona.the navajo nation suggested that the only court with jurisdiction would be a navajo tribal court.judge broomfield granted the navajo nation motion to dismiss,finding no federal question jurisdiction under because enforcement of the arbitration award did not raise any question about the leases or the secretarial approval process under federal law.

federal courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.for a case to arise under federal law,a plaintiff complaint must establish either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff asserted right to relief depends on the resolution of a substantial question of federal law.franchise tax bd.of cal.constr.laborers vacation trust for,d.the fact that the defendant is a native sovereign is not,by itself,sufficient to raise a federal question.gila river indian cmty.henningson,durham richardson,cir.
