background 
in,federal representatives in the territory of washington induced a number of indian tribes to relinquish much of their land in return for payments and the right to keep small parcels of land.see generally washington washington state commercial passenger fishing vessel ass n,d.the resulting treaties also preserved the tribes right to fish at usual and accustomed grounds.see,treaty of point elliott,stat.
a century later,however,runs of fish had become scarce and native americans took only a small fraction of the fish harvest.in,the united states brought an action against the state of washington to force it to protect the tribes shares of anadromous fish runs.the united states brought the action on its own behalf and as trustee for seven indian tribes.another seven tribes successfully intervened in the action.united states washington,nn,aff,cir washington i.the district court ruled that all tribes had fishing rights under various treaties,including the treaty of point elliott,id.at,and that treaty tribes had a right to percent of the harvestable fish passing through their traditional fishing grounds.id.at.
after the issuance of the decision in washington i,the samish intervened to assert fishing rights under the treaty of point elliott.the district judge referred the matter to a magistrate judge,sitting as a special master.after a hearing,the special master found that the samish were not recognized as an indian tribe by the united states government and have not lived as a continuous separate,distinct and cohesive indian cultural or political community.the special master therefore concluded that the samish at this time were neither a treaty tribe nor a political successor to a treaty tribe and presently did not hold treaty fishing rights.the samish appealed the special master ruling to the district court,which held a de novo evidentiary hearing.the district court concluded that the samish were not entitled to treaty fishing rights.washington ii.at.
in arriving at this conclusion,the district court adopted and relied on findings of fact proposed by the united states.those findings concerned the samish lack of an organized tribal structure,and included the following 
the samish tribe exercises no attributes of sovereignty over its members or any territory.
it is not recognized by the united states as a tribe.
neither its organization nor its membership has been recognized by the congress or the department of the interior for indian affairs purposes.
the secretary of the interior has not prepared an official membership roll for the tribe.
there is no requirement of specific minimum blood quantum either as to samish blood in particular or indian blood in general.
many tribe members are of only degree indian blood and t wo have only samish blood.
the tribe does not prohibit dual membership and at least one member is an officer of the lummi tribe.
the samish members do not and have not lived as a continuous separate,distinct and cohesive indian cultural or political community.
id.after making these findings about the samish,the district court stated as a conclusion of law that o nly tribes recognized as indian political bodies by the united states may possess and exercise the tribal fishing rights secured and protected by the treaties of the united states.id.at the district court therefore concluded that at this time the samish was not a treaty tribe and presently did not hold treaty fishing rights.id.
we affirmed the district court in a divided decision,noting that w e have defined a single necessary and sufficient condition for the exercise of treaty rights by a group of indians descended from a treaty signatory the group must have maintained an organized tribal structure.united states washington,cir washington iii.in determining whether this condition exists,we examine the organizational structure of the tribe at the time of the treaty signing with allowances for inevitable adaptation and assimilation tribal status is preserved if some defining characteristic of the original tribe persists in an evolving tribal community.id.at.although the district court had erred in concluding that a tribe must be federally recognized in order to exercise treaty fishing rights,we held that the district court findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and they provided some support for the conclusion that the samish had not maintained an organized tribal structure id.at.
because the samish inability to exercise their treaty fishing rights hinged on their status as an unrecognized tribe,and because the united states,tribes that opposed the samish exercise of treaty fishing rights,and the district court all suggested that future federal recognition might warrant reexamination of the samish treaty fishing rights the samish continued their pursuit of federal recognition.the samish had first sought federal recognition in,three years after a bureau of indian affairs bia employee removed the samish from a list used to determine whether a tribe was federally recognized.see greene babbitt,the department of the interior took no action on the samish application until,and in the bia issued a final decision denying tribal recognition of the samish.see final determination that the samish indian tribe does not exist as an indian tribe.
the samish then filed an action challenging the bia denial of federal recognition.the tulalip tribe sought to intervene in that proceeding,arguing that federal recognition of the samish would lead to a dilution of the tulalip fishing rights.the district court denied the tulalip intervention motion and,in an interlocutory appeal,we affirmed the denial.greene united states,cir.we held that although the federal recognition and treaty fishing rights inquiries were similar,each determination serves a different legal purpose and has an independent legal effect.id.at.we noted that even if the samish achieved federal recognition,the tribe would need to challenge the decision in washington ii before it could exercise fishing rights.id.at 
on the merits of the samish challenge to the denial of federal recognition,the district court vacated the bia decision and remanded the case for a formal adjudication under the administrative procedures act.greene lujan,no,wl,at,aff,greene babbitt,cir.after an hearing,an administrative law judge alj found that the samish met all of the criteria necessary for federal recognition.the bia rejected some of the alj findings and conclusions,but ruled in favor of samish recognition.see final determination for federal acknowledgment of the samish tribal organization as an indian tribe.the district court reinstated the deleted findings and conclusions,however,and affirmed the recognition decision.greene babbitt.at.the district court also noted that the samish long journey for recognition has been made more difficult by excessive delays and governmental misconduct.id.at.
on august,the samish filed with the district court a rule b motion to be relieved of the judgment in washington ii.the united states and nine tribes whose treaty fishing rights were confirmed in united states washington the opposition tribes opposed the samish motion.the district court held that federal recognition was not an extraordinary circumstance,reasoning that a tribe recognition,or nonrecognition,has no impact on whether it may exercise treaty rights.united states washington,no.cv,subproceeding,slip op.at.the district court also noted that the samish had not alleged that the washington ii proceeding was fundamentally unfair or that the samish had been prevented from adducing evidence in support of its claim.the interest in finality was an equally compelling factor that weighed against reopening,given the unmistakable conclusion that,at this stage,their addition would wreak havoc on management agreements and plans.id.at.
the samish filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court ruling.in the motion,the samish included a proposal that addressed the possible disruptions that its intervention in washington i might cause.the district court denied the motion,reaffirming its conclusion that federal recognition is not an extraordinary circumstance and that the interest in finality remained an overriding concern.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.
standard of review 
we review the denial of a rule b motion for an abuse of discretion,wilson,cir.under the abuse of discretion standard,we must affirm the judgment below unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon weighing the relevant factors,the district court applied the wrong law,or the district court rested its decision on clearly erroneous findings of material fact.sec coldicutt,cir.
i.did the district court abuse its discretion by ruling that federal recognition of the samish was not an extraordinary circumstance 
the samish contend that the district court abused its discretion by ruling that federal recognition was not an extraordinary circumstance that warranted reopening the judgment in washington ii.the samish argue that this abuse of discretion resulted from errors of law.
federal rule of civil procedure b provides that o n motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.the rule b catchall provision applies only when the reason for granting relief is not covered by any of the other reasons set forth in rule.cmty.dental servs.tani,cir.it has been used sparingly as an equitable remedy to prevent manifest injustice and is to be utilized only where extraordinary circumstances prevented a party from taking timely action to prevent or correct an erroneous judgment.united states alpine land reservoir,cir.thus,a party seeking to reopen a case under rule b must demonstrate both injury and circumstances beyond his control that prevented him from proceeding with the prosecution or defense of the action in a proper fashion.cmty.dental,at.
the samish argue that the district court misinterpreted our precedents in ruling that a tribe recognition,or nonrecognition,has no impact on whether it may exercise treaty rights.it is that federal nonrecognition can not divest a tribe of treaty rights.in washington i,we held that n onrecognition of the tribe by the federal government and the failure of the secretary of the interior to approve a tribe enrollment may result in loss of statutory benefits,but can have no impact on vested treaty rights.at.in washington iii,we held that the district court view that federal recognition is required is clearly contrary to our prior holding and is foreclosed by precedent.at see also greene united states,at noting that f ederal recognition is not a threshold condition a tribe must establish to fish under the treaty of point elliott.
although we have previously held that federal recognition is not necessary for the exercise of treaty fishing rights by a signatory tribe,we have never held that federal recognition is not a sufficient condition for the exercise of those rights.indeed,our precedent leads us to the inevitable conclusion that federal recognition is a sufficient condition for the exercise of treaty rights.we have defined a single necessary and sufficient condition for the exercise of treaty rights by a group of indians descended from a treaty signatory the group must have maintained an organized tribal structure.washington iii,at.for this purpose,tribal status is preserved if some defining characteristic of the original tribe persists in an evolving tribal community.id.at.
the mandatory criteria for federal recognition include the following 
b a predominant portion of the petitioning group comprises a distinct community and has existed as a community from historical times until the present.
c the petitioner has maintained political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity from historical times until the present.
the samish argue persuasively that because they met the mandatory criteria for federal recognition,they necessarily met the condition for the exercise of treaty rights.see greene united states,at reinhardt,dissenting arguing that i f the single necessary and sufficient criterion for treaty rights is also a necessary condition for federal recognition,then achieving the latter necessarily satisfies the single qualification for the former.
indeed,we have never held that recognition of a opposed to irrelevant to its exercise of treaty rights,despite some dicta to the contrary.see greene babbitt,at incorrectly asserting that in washington i we held that a tribe recognition or lack of recognition by the secretary of the interior does not determine whether the tribe has vested treaty rights.this is not surprising,given the traditional deference that the federal courts pay to the political branches in determining whether a group of indians constitutes a tribe.see united states holliday,wall.holding that i f by the executive and other political departments of the government those indians are recognized as a tribe,this court must do the same washington i.at concluding that t he recognition of a tribe as a treaty party or the political successor in interest to a treaty party is a federal political question on which state authorities and federal courts must follow the determination by the legislative or executive branch of the federal government william canby,american indian law in a nutshell ed.once granted,the recognition will bind the courts until it is removed by the executive or congress.
it would be a rare case indeed where a court would deny treaty rights to a signatory tribe on the ground that it lacks an organized tribal structure,where the department of the interior has recognized that same tribe as a distinct community that has existed as a community from historical times until the present and that it has maintained political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity from historical times until the present.see also felix cohen,handbook of indian law ed.no congressional or executive determination of tribal status has been overturned by the courts.
the district court erred in concluding that,because nonrecognition can not impact vested treaty rights,recognition is irrelevant.the samish would almost certainly have won the right to exercise its treaty fishing rights had the tribe been federally recognized at the time of washington ii.and although we have never explicitly held that federal recognition necessarily entitles a signatory tribe to exercise treaty rights this is an inevitable conclusion.
although federal recognition is for all practical purposes determinative of whether the tribe has maintained an organized tribal structure,the opposition tribes argue that the samish federal recognition is still not an extraordinary circumstance.that is,the relevance of the samish federal recognition is not the fact of the recognition itself,but rather the factual findings underlying that recognition,and whether the samish had a full opportunity to present the facts supporting its treaty status to the district court in washington ii.that an alj arrived at different factual findings on better evidence is not a reason for granting a rule b motion.see alpine land reservoir,at holding that rule b is to be utilized only where extraordinary circumstances prevented a party from taking timely action to prevent or correct an erroneous judgment.
the crucial issue here is whether the fact that the samish had the opportunity to litigate the factual basis underlying the tribe treaty status in washington ii means that the samish were not prevented from proceeding with the prosecution or defense of the action in a proper fashion.cmty.dental,at.in light of the government excessive delays and misconduct in withholding of recognition from the samish,a circumstance beyond their control the government position in washington ii that federal recognition was necessary and that future federal recognition might justify revisiting the treaty rights issue and the district court erroneous conclusion that nonrecognition was decisive and wholesale adoption of the united states findings of fact in washington ii,we conclude that the samish were effectively prevented from proving their tribal status in a proper fashion.
for its part,the government argues that washington ii should not be reopened,because the judgment is not inconsistent with the federal recognition of the samish.that is,the federally recognized samish may have existed since historical times as a distinct group,enjoy a relationship with the united states,and yet still not be the successor to the samish tribe that was a signatory to the treaty of point elliott,because the swinomish indian tribal community and the lummi nation are the political successors to the samish.
the government position is inconsistent with our precedent.in washington iii,we defined a single necessary and sufficient condition for the exercise of treaty rights by a group of indians descended from a treaty signatory the group must have maintained an organized tribal structure.at.yet the government in essence argues that this single necessary and sufficient condition is necessary but not sufficient.it is undisputed that the samish were a party to the treaty of point elliott.see,washington ii.at.it is also clear that the samish has been continuously identified throughout history as indian or aboriginal,has existed as a distinct community since first sustained european contact,has maintained political influence within itself as an autonomous entity and that percent of its members are descendants of the historical samish tribe,as the samish are a signatory tribe and have proved the single necessary and sufficient condition for the exercise of treaty rights,the res judicata effect of washington ii is all that is keeping the samish from pursuing its treaty rights 
moreover,no tribe can be the political successor to the samish unless that tribe merged or consolidated with the samish.see united states suquamish indian tribe,cir holding that for a signatory tribe to obtain treaty tribe status from another signatory tribe,it must first show that the two tribes or cohesive bands thereof consolidated or merged and demonstrate also that together they maintain an organized tribal structure.the district court in greene babbitt specifically reinstated a finding by the alj that the samish and the swinomish had not merged.at,and the fact that some members of the swinomish and lummi tribes have samish ancestry does not make them political successors to the samish.see oregon,at.to the extent that the district court in washington i found that the samish had merged or combined with the lummi and the swinomish this is clearly inconsistent with the federal recognition of the samish.see c identifying one of the mandatory criteria for recognition as the petitioner maintenance of political influence or authority over its members as an autonomous entity from historical times until the present.
we conclude that the district court misinterpreted our precedents,and thereby abused its discretion,in ruling that the fact of federal recognition had no impact on whether the samish may exercise treaty fishing rights.federal recognition is determinative of the issue of tribal organization,the issue upon which the samish were denied treaty fishing rights in washington ii.as the samish lack of recognition was a circumstance beyond the tribe control,their subsequent recognition is an extraordinary circumstance that warrants setting aside the judgment in washington ii.
ii.do the district court finality concerns independently support its denial of the samish rule b motion 
although we conclude that federal recognition of the samish constitutes an extraordinary circumstance for purposes of rule b,we still must decide whether the district court finality concerns independently justify its denial of the samish motion.
the samish argue that the district court abused its discretion by failing to balance finality concerns against the interest in achieving justice.the district court stated that the motion raised two principal issues whether extraordinary circumstances justified reopening the judgment,and whether the interests in finality are paramount to other interests.having concluded that the lack of extraordinary circumstances was an independent basis for denying relief,the district court did not balance finality concerns but rather stated that they were a n equally compelling factor.
in discussing the interest in finality,the district court stated 
the united states and the opposition tribes point out that,in reliance on washington ii,this court has approved many fish management plans,mediated and decided intertribal disputes on treaty fishing issues,determined treaty tribes usual and accustomed fishing places,and decided allocation issues.the united states and opposition tribes rightly observe that management of fish harvest involves a delicate balancing of interests within the overall framework and that these management after considerable time and be upset by the addition of another tribe at this late stage.
the samish have not convincingly rebutted,nor could they,the unmistakable conclusion that,at this stage,their addition would wreak havoc on management agreements and plans.
citation omitted.the district court also noted that the interest in finality is at its zenith in natural resource allocation cases.
in its motion for reconsideration,the samish included a proposal to minimize possible disruptions that its participation in washington i would entail.the samish noted that three of the tribes participating in washington i had established themselves as successors in interest to samish treaty rights,and the samish would agree to exercise treaty fishing rights under the orders in the case that apply to these three tribes,and under the regulatory authority and framework of the three tribes.under this proposal,the samish argued,their inclusion would not disrupt existing orders.
despite the samish efforts to craft a workable,minimally disruptive framework for the tribe intervention,the district court remained unconvinced under any scenario,the samish,in addition to the other newly recognized tribes likely to seek intervention,would necessarily inject themselves into sensitive agreements and upset current treaty tribes allocations.the district court then hedged its conclusion somewhat by pointing out that finality concerns were not the sole or even the chief basis for denying the tribe motion to reopen,and that t o focus on mitigating the effects of reopening a judgment,rather than on whether reopening a judgment is procedurally allowable,is to put the cart before the horse.it also noted that even putting aside the finality concerns,there are ample reasons to deny the tribe another chance at litigating its treaty status.
because it is unclear to what extent the district court relied on finality concerns in denying the samish motions,especially after the samish submitted a proposal for minimizing the disruptive effects of its participation in washington i,we conclude that finality concerns do not independently support the district court denial of the samish rule b motion.that is,had the district court properly concluded that federal recognition was an extraordinary circumstance the somewhat speculative concerns about finality are insufficient to have carried the day.
the opposition tribes point is well taken that h aving supervised the litigation since,the district court is in the best position to judge the impact adding new parties might have.nevertheless,the fact that the district court has ongoing judicial supervision of washington i undercuts these finality concerns.unlike a judgment between private parties,the allocation of natural resources between treaty tribes and others can not help but be an ongoing venture.indeed,the docket entries and more than in washington i are testament to the inherent lack of finality of the judgment.finally,the fact that the government and the opposition tribes in washington ii argued that samish recognition could well justify reopening further weakens finality concerns.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons we reverse the order of the district court denying the samish rule b motion and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded.
appellant samish indian tribe samish tribe appeals the district court order denying the samish tribe motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for relief from the district court prior judgment in united states washington,aff,cir washington ii.the majority opinion holds that the district court abused its discretion in denying the samish tribe rule b motion because f ederal recognition of the samish tribe is determinative of the issue of tribal organization,the issue upon which the samish were denied treaty fishing rights in washington ii,and a s the samish lack of recognition was a circumstance beyond the tribe control,their subsequent recognition is an extraordinary circumstance that warrants setting aside the judgment in washington ii.op.at.
with respect,i believe the majority opinion errs in two regards.first,federal recognition as a tribe has never been required to establish fishing rights pursuant to the treaty of point elliott,and the samish tribe was not precluded in washington ii from presenting evidence of having maintained an organized tribal structure,which evidence could have supported a finding that it was entitled to such treaty fishing rights.second,neither the federal recognition of the samish tribe by the bureau of indian affairs bia nor the bia underlying factual findings constitute evidence that the samish tribe maintained an organized tribal structure to which a district court determining treaty status must accord any deference.because i believe the majority opinion departs from our jurisprudence in holding otherwise i respectfully dissent.
the issue before this court is not whether the samish tribe might qualify for fishing rights pursuant to the treaty of point elliott were it to commence an action today.rather,as the majority opinion states the crucial issue here is whether the fact that the samish had the opportunity to litigate this issue in washington ii means that the samish were not prevented from proceeding with the prosecution or defense of the action in a proper fashion.op.at internal citation omitted.the majority opinion answers in the negative i believe our precedent requires an affirmative answer.
our precedent in this area of the law and with regard to the very parties at issue here makes clear,if nothing else,that whether a group of native americans are recognized as a tribe by the federal government is a distinct legal inquiry from whether that same group of native americans qualify for fishing rights pursuant to the point elliott and related treaties.further,recognition as a tribe is not a necessary precondition to qualify for such treaty fishing rights 
thus,in united states washington,cir washington i emphasis added,we held nonrecognition of the tribe by the federal government and the failure of the secretary of the interior to approve a tribe enrollment may result in loss of statutory benefits,but can have no impact on vested treaty rights.likewise,when the district court in washington ii held that o nly tribes recognized as indian political bodies by the united states may possess and exercise the tribal fishing rights secured and protected by the treaties of the united states.at,we held on appeal 
this conclusion is clearly contrary to our prior holding and is foreclosed by precedent.
we have defined a single necessary and sufficient condition for the exercise of treaty rights by a group of indians descended from a treaty signatory the group must have maintained an organized tribal structure.
washington ii,at,accord id.at canby,dissenting the majority opinion quite correctly rejects the conclusion of law that federal recognition is essential to the exercise of treaty rights.in united states suquamish indian tribe,cir emphasis added,we noted that f ederal recognition by the department of interior is not required for a tribe to obtain treaty tribe status.again,in greene i,w e recognize d that the two inquiries are similar,but reiterated that each determination serves a different legal purpose and has an independent legal effect and that f ederal recognition is not a threshold condition a tribe must establish to fish under the treaty of point elliott.at emphasis added accord id.at reinhardt,dissenting arguing that federal recognition necessarily qualifies for treaty rights a tribe that claims them,but acknowledging that federal recognition is not a precondition to receiving treaty rights emphasis in original.finally,in greene babbitt,cir greene ii,we reviewed our precedent and held once more t he recognition of the tribe for purposes of statutory benefits is a question wholly independent of treaty fishing rights our decision in greene i can leave no serious doubt that our court regards the issues of tribal treaty status and federal acknowledgment as fundamentally different.
our precedent is equally clear that although recognition as a tribe may be a decision generally left to the discretion of the executive branch,w hether a group of citizens of indian ancestry is descended from a treaty signatory and has maintained an organized tribal structure so as to qualify for fishing rights pursuant to the point elliott and related treaties is a factual question which a district court is competent to determine.washington i,at accord washington ii,at.
thus,the fact alone that the samish tribe was not recognized by the federal government at the time of washington ii in no way prevented it from proffering the type of evidence that could have resulted in a finding by the district court in washington ii that the samish tribe had maintained an organized tribal structure and,therefore,was entitled to fishing rights pursuant to the treaty of point elliott.indeed,two other tribes did precisely this.specifically,in washington i,the district court held that the stillaguamish tribe and upper skagit tribe were both entitled to fishing rights pursuant to the treaty of point elliott despite the fact that they were not at the time recognized as tribes by the federal government.united states washington,aff,cir washington i.we affirmed 
the stillaguamish and upper skagit tribes are not recognized as organized tribes by the federal government evidence supported the court findings that the members of the two tribes are descendants of treaty signatories and have maintained tribal organizations.we therefore affirm the district court conclusion that the stillaguamish and upper skagit tribes are entities possessing rights under the treaty of point elliott.
washington i,at.nor,finally,has the samish tribe alleged,much less proved,that the evidence demonstrating that it was entitled to fishing rights pursuant to the treaty of point elliott was unavailable at the time of the trial held in washington ii to adjudicate this issue.
because the samish tribe has presented no evidence that it was precluded from doing precisely what the stillaguamish and upper skagit tribes did,it has not shown that it was prevented from proceeding with the prosecution or defense of the action in a proper fashion,op.at,such that its recognition as a tribe now should permit it to set aside the judgment in washington ii 
despite this clear,consistent and controlling authority,the majority opinion conclude s that the samish were effectively prevented from proving their tribal status in a proper fashion for three reasons 
the government excessive delays and misconduct in withholding of recognition from the samish,a circumstance beyond their control the government position in washington ii that federal recognition was necessary and that future federal recognition might justify revisiting the treaty rights issue and the district court erroneous conclusion that nonrecognition was decisive and wholesale adoption of the united states boilerplate findings of fact in washington ii.
op.at.but none of these factors supports granting the samish tribe rule b motion.
first,although the samish tribe initially applied for federal recognition in and were not finally recognized until,whether the samish tribe was entitled to fishing rights pursuant to the treaty of point elliott was an issue tried and submitted before the district court in washington ii in.greene babbitt,greene iii date of initial application for federal recognition.date of federal recognition washington ii,at date of submission before district court.thus,the majority if not all of the excessive delays and misconduct,op.at,on which the majority opinion relies occurred after the issue was tried and submitted in washington ii.
further,as noted above,there is no showing that the delay immediately following the samish tribe application for federal recognition to the bia precluded the samish tribe from submitting to the district court in washington ii the same evidence of having maintained an organized tribal structure that it had submitted or thereafter would submit to the bia.nor is there evidence that the samish tribe applied for a postponement of their trial and submission to allow the bia to determine its recognition claim.
second,the government position in washington ii that federal recognition was necessary and that future federal recognition might justify revisiting the treaty rights issue,slip op.at,is irrelevant to whether a case is made out for rule b relief.the government position in no way hindered,much less precluded,the samish tribe from offering evidence in the washington ii district court trial of having maintained an organized tribal structure that could have resulted in a finding by that district court that the samish were entitled to fishing rights pursuant to the treaty of point elliott,as did the unrecognized stillaguamish and upper skagit tribes.nor can the samish tribe claim the government is estopped to require evidence of having maintained an organized tribal structure by its statement that the issue of treaty rights might be subject to review were the samish tribe federally recognized.any reliance on these statements was unreasonable in view of our holdings.as noted above,even prior to washington ii,we had held in washington i that federal recognition as a tribe is not a necessary precondition for fishing rights pursuant to the treaty of point elliott and that district courts are competent to make the necessary determinations 
the stillaguamish and upper skagit tribes are not recognized as organized tribes by the federal government nonrecognition of the tribe by the federal government and the failure of the secretary of the interior to approve a tribe enrollment may result in loss of statutory benefits,but can have no impact on vested treaty rights.whether a group of citizens of indian ancestry is descended from a treaty signatory and has maintained an organized tribal structure is a factual question which a district court is competent to determine evidence supported the court findings that the members of the two tribes are descendants of treaty signatories and have maintained tribal organizations.we therefore affirm the district court conclusion that the stillaguamish and upper skagit tribes are entities possessing rights under the treaty of point elliott.
washington i,at internal citations omitted.accordingly,in washington ii,we characterized arguments otherwise as clearly contrary to and foreclosed by precedent.at emphasis added.
third,nor is the district court erroneous conclusion that nonrecognition was decisive and wholesale adoption of the united states boilerplate findings of fact in washington ii,op.at,relevant.on appeal,as noted above,we expressly corrected the district court erroneous conclusion.washington ii,at the district court conclusion is clearly contrary to our prior holding and is by precedent.noting that t he district court statement that federal nonrecognition is decisive,together with its listing of other purported considerations,makes it difficult for us to determine the precise basis for the court holding that the tribes may not exercise treaty rights,we then examine d the record ourselves to determine whether the district court reached the correct result.id.at.
t he district court specifically found that the appellants had not functioned since treaty times as continuous separate,distinct and cohesive indian cultural or political communit ies.
after close scrutiny,we conclude that the evidence supports this finding of fact.although the appellants now have constitutions and formal governments,the governments have not controlled the lives of the members.nor have the appellants clearly established the continuous informal cultural influence they concede is required.
the appellants members are descended from treaty tribes,but they have intermarried with and many are of mixed blood.that may be true of some members of tribes whose treaty status has been established.but unlike those persons,those who comprise the groups of appellants have not settled in distinctively indian residential areas.
we can not say,then,that the finding of insufficient political and cultural cohesion is clearly erroneous.
washington ii,at emphasis added internal citations omitted.
indeed,the argument that the district court erroneous conclusion of law in washington ii so permeated the entire factual history,id.at canby,dissenting,that the findings of fact could not be relied upon even by this court when it applied the correct standard is one that was heralded by the dissent in washington ii and,as demonstrated above,rejected by the majority 
my difference with the majority is that i am unable to say that the findings of the district court resolve the determinative question of tribal continuity or provide us with the means to do so upon review.
t he conclusions of law help to illustrate the deficiencies of the findings of fact upon which the decision of the district court is based.the findings that appellants had not maintained a continuous separate,distinct and cohesive indian cultural or political communit ies or organized tribal structure s in a political sense amounted in context to findings that appellants lacked federal recognition or attributes necessarily dependent upon federal recognition.these findings consequently do not resolve the crucial factual issue and can not support the judgment.
application of the proper legal standards to this case requires new determination of fact,and possibly additional evidence relating to the political organization of the relevant tribes at treaty times.i would therefore remand the matter to the district court for determinations whether appellants have maintained tribal structures reflecting the degree of organization that existed at the time of the treaties,with reasonable allowances for adaptation to changing conditions,and whether some defining characteristic of the original tribes persists in appellants as evolving tribal communities.
id.at,canby,dissenting.the majority opinion recognizes that this is an argument already made and rejected,op.at,but pays no heed to the crucial finding of not having maintained an organized tribal structure,approved by our decision.such insouciance to our precedent is inadvisable.
although acknowledging that we have never explicitly held that federal recognition necessarily entitles a signatory tribe to exercise treaty rights,the majority opinion asserts that this is an inevitable conclusion.op.at.again,this is contrary to our precedent.
in greene i,what was thereafter recognized as the samish tribe appealed to the district court from the bia denial of the samish tribe petitions for recognition.at.the tulalip tribe moved to intervene,asserting two related interests that their treaty fishing allocations are threate
