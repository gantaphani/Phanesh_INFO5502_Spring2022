this appeal concerns the limits of the muckleshoot tribe saltwater usual and accustomed fishing area under the boldt decision.because we agree with the district court that the muckleshoot saltwater usual and accustomed fishing area,as found by judge boldt,was limited to elliott bay,we affirm the grant of summary judgment for the puyallup,suquamish,and swinomish tribes.
background and procedural history 
this case centers on the interpretation of a lengthy and detailed district court opinion published in after an extensive trial involving a voluminous record.in united states washington.the boldt decision,aff,cir,judge boldt adjudicated the fishing rights of several tribes in washington state,including the parties to this dispute.central to this case is finding of fact finding of the opinion,which states 
prior to and during treaty times,the indian ancestors of the present day muckleshoot indians had the usual and accustomed fishing places primarily at locations on the upper puyallup,the carbon,stuck,white,green,cedar,and black rivers,the tributaries to these rivers including soos creek,burns creek and newaukum creek and lake washington,and secondarily in the saltwater of puget sound.villages and their weir sites were often located together.fpto ex,ex,ex,

judge boldt decision did not explicitly address shellfish entitlements rather,it concerned the rights to fin fish.the individual tribes entitlements to shellfish,which are not at issue here,were addressed in a subsequent case,united states washington.washington ii,aff in part and rev in part,cir.
after washington ii,the muckleshoot sought to open fisheries in area of puget sound.area is a region of puget sound located to the west of the city of seattle.area,as a fishing zone,was not defined at the time of boldt decision it was subsequently established by state regulation.in response to this action by the muckleshoot,the puyallup indian tribe the puyallup filed a request for determination in district court.the request sought a determination that the muckleshoot usual and accustomed saltwater fishing area,as determined by finding of the boldt decision,does not include any areas outside elliott bay now known as area,like area a fishing region created by state regulation.with the court permission,the suquamish indian tribe the suquamish and the swinomish indian tribal community the swinomish filed a for determination seeking a similar ruling.
in january,the muckleshoot filed a motion to dismiss the request and the tribes the puyallup,suquamish,swinomish filed a motion for summary judgment on their requests for determination.on august,the district court granted the muckleshoot motion to dismiss with respect to the tribes claims that the muckleshoot had no saltwater fishing rights outside areas,and.the court reasoned that it did not have jurisdiction over areas other than areas,and because the muckleshoot had not manifested an intent to conduct saltwater fishing in areas other than,and.the court then denied the tribes motion for summary judgment and ordered an evidentiary hearing on whether areas,and were part of the muckleshoot under finding of the boldt decision.
both parties filed for summary judgment.on september,the district court held that the muckleshoot u a under finding was limited to elliott bay area and enjoining the muckleshoot from fishing in areas,and.the muckleshoot appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and a

ambiguity in finding 
this case turns on the interpretation of the phrase secondarily in the waters of puget sound as used by judge boldt in finding.the case,therefore,resembles one of statutory construction,with the boldt decision serving as the instrument to be interpreted.the muckleshoot argument is essentially one of plain meaning.according to the muckleshoot,the text of finding is unambiguous because puget sound has a,common geographical meaning.if judge boldt,who was intimately familiar with the geography of the region and its relevance to the case,meant to confine the muckleshoot saltwater to inner elliott bay,the muckleshoot contend judge boldt could have expressly done so in finding.
the tribes counter that the phrase is ambiguous when examined in the context of the evidence before judge boldt.given the evidence that judge boldt relied upon and other findings of fact and law in the opinion,the tribes argue that judge boldt could not have intended to include the expansive area claimed by the muckleshoot as part of their saltwater.children hosp.health ctr.belshe,cir to determine the plain meaning of a statutory provision,we examine not only the specific provision at issue,but also the structure of the statute as a whole,including its object and policy.
the parallels between this case and one of statutory construction should not be overemphasized.there are important distinctions between interpreting a judicial opinion and a statute.first,the documents and the evidence the court relied upon,which are the rough equivalent of legislative history,play a much larger and more definitive role in interpreting the judicial text than do the traditional components of legislative history in statutory interpretation.finding specifically cites the supporting documents used as the bases for its conclusions.there is no question,then,that the court relied upon this information in reaching its decision.moreover,in referencing the documents cited in finding,judge boldt said,the court finds that in specific facts,the reports of barbara lane,exhibits to and,have been exceptionally well researched and reported and are established by a preponderance of the evidence.they are found to be authoritative and reliable summaries of relevant aspects of indian life in the case area at and prior to the time of the treaties washington.at.
more importantly,judicial opinions are simply not statutes and the rules governing the interpretation of the two reflect this.in general,there are no canons of construction for the interpretation of opinions,reflecting the fact that textual precision,while a highly valued judicial quality,is at the very center of statutory interpretation.see,united states partlow,cir where the terms of a statute are unambiguous,its plain meaning must control.
opinions,unlike statutes,are not usually written with the knowledge or expectation that each and every word may be the subject of searching analysis.acknowledging this fact,this court held long ago that the language of the court must be read in the light of the facts before it.julian petroleum courtney petroleum,cir see also marshall andrew mahony,cir t he language of all cases must be taken and understood in light of the facts of the case in which the language was employed.
with these concepts in mind,the parties debate over whether the language of finding is unambiguous is largely misdirected,inasmuch as an analysis of the decision is necessary,whether the text is unambiguous or not,in order to understand finding in light of the facts of the case.an unambiguous text is certainly a factor to be considered in this analysis,but it does not necessarily terminate the inquiry.
our decision in muckleshoot tribe lummi indian tribe,cir,supports this proposition.there,this court did not merely rely on what appeared to be unambiguous language,the meaning of whidbey island,in a previous judicial finding also authored by judge boldt.rather,the court went beyond the plain language and examined the evidence,concluding that the swinomish tribe offered no evidence that suggests that the finding of fact is ambiguous or that the court intended something other than its apparent meaning.id.at emphasis added.
as the district court recognized in this case,the tribes have brought forth precisely such evidence.we agree with the district court conclusion 
t he evidence before judge boldt establishes,at a minimum,that the muckleshoot predecessors may have occasionally fished in the open waters of elliott bay near the mouth of the duwamish and gathered shellfish on the shores of elliott bay.based on this evidence,the court concludes that judge boldt intended to include those areas department of fisheries area in the muckleshoot the court finds,however,that there is sic no evidence in the record before judge boldt,nor is it persuaded by evidence,that judge boldt intended to describe a saltwater any larger than the open water and shores of elliott bay.the court agrees with the muckleshoot that judge boldt use of a broad term like puget sound is perplexing in light of the geographic precision he generally used in describing and it agrees that,as a resident of the puget sound area,it is fair to assume that he would not have used the terms elliott bay and puget sound interchangeably.however,there is no evidence in the record before judge boldt that supports a saltwater beyond elliott bay.
this conclusion is based on our analysis of the information before judge boldt.the muckleshoot arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.
ii.the evidence before judge boldt 
evidence referenced by judge boldt 
as the district court recognized,the most relevant evidence in determining what judge boldt intended by the phrase secondarily in the saltwater of puget sound consists of the four documents referenced in finding.the first document,the final pretrial order,uses language nearly identical to that in finding and is,therefore,not very helpful.
the second document,exhibit,is a portion of lane conclusions based on available documents and ethnographic data.this report,which describes the fishing practices of the muckleshoot ancestors,who signed the treaty judge boldt was interpreting,concludes that t he principle fisheries of the ancestors of the muckleshoot both prior to and during treaty times included green river,white river,stuck river,cedar river,and tributary creeks.
the third document,exhibit,provides an extensive discussion of the fishing practices of the muckleshoot ancestors.the relevant portion of the discussion states 
the traditional fisheries of the ancestors of the muckleshoot included but were not limited to puyallup and carbon rivers and tributary creeks the stuck,white,green and cedar rivers and tributary creeks and lake washington.in addition there was some trolling for salmon in salt waters when families descended the rivers to get shell fish supplies on the beaches of the sound.
the last document listed in finding is exhibit,a portion of a report of carroll riley.the report describes the area where the muckleshoot ancestors lived and,like the other documents,concludes that the ancestor tribes relied primarily on freshwater fishing t he indians in this area obtained the greatest part of their subsistence from fish caught in the white and green rivers they occasionally made the trip down river to elliott bay on fishing and clamming expeditions.
these documents indicate that the muckleshoot ancestors were almost entirely an upriver people who primarily relied on freshwater fishing for their livelihoods.insofar as they conducted saltwater fishing,the referenced documents contain no evidence indicating that such fishing occurred with regularity anywhere beyond elliott bay.
this conclusion is buttressed by other evidence before judge boldt.the reports that judge boldt relied upon make a general distinction between downriver predecessor tribes,also referred to as saltwater tribes,and upriver tribes.the predecessor tribes to the muckleshoot were considered to be upriver tribes.in an excerpt from the anthropological report of lane,the muckleshoot ancestors are described as having lived in treaty times in about twenty villages on the duwamish and upper puyallup drainage systems.these ancestors,according to lane,were upriver people in contrast to those people living directly on the bays and lower reaches of the river.
the muckleshoot ancestors may have occasionally conducted saltwater fishing beyond elliott bay.but it is important to remember that judge boldt was deciding the usual and accustomed fishing grounds under the provisions of the treaties.isolated or infrequent excursions beyond elliott bay do not meet the usual and accustomed standard the documents listed in finding do not indicate the existence of saltwater fishing beyond elliott bay that was more than incidental or occasional.
b.the muckleshoot arguments 
the muckleshoot argument that their ancestors conducted saltwater fishing beyond elliott bay rests on four pieces of evidence lane reports carroll riley report excerpts from a book by the anthropologist marian smith and testimony of puyallup tribal members given before the indian claims commission icc in the.none of these establishes that the muckleshoot ancestors had fishing grounds beyond elliott bay.
lane reports 
the muckleshoot contend that exhibit is the key document for the purpose of ascertaining the intended scope of the phrase secondarily in the saltwater of puget sound.the muckleshoot first argue that the report statement that there was some trolling for salmon in salt water when families descended the rivers to get the shell fish supplies on the beaches of the sound is regional in scope and broader than elliott bay.judge boldt adapted the phrase on the beaches of puget sound,the muckleshoot contend,to mean in the saltwater of puget sound to conform with the description of the trolling in lane report and to emphasize the inclusion of waters in puget sound and not merely the beaches.the muckleshoot also argue that the phrase the beaches of puget sound has a plain meaning which is broader than elliott bay and that lane did not mention elliott bay at all in her description of the muckleshoot saltwater.
addressing the last point first,the lack of a discussion of elliott bay in lane report works against the muckleshoot argument,not for it.lane report lists the saltwater s for those tribes that she believed engaged in significant saltwater fishing.the only tribes for which there is no mention of specific saltwater fisheries are three upriver tribes,including the muckleshoot.this feature of the report suggests two conclusions the phrase on the beaches of puget sound was used because there was no established saltwater fishing location anywhere and the omission of puget sound from lane findings in exhibit,which lists the principal fisheries of the muckleshoot ancestors,was not inadvertent or inconsequential.rather,it suggests that puget sound was not a principal saltwater fishing ground.
more importantly,all references in lane report on muckleshoot saltwater fishing only pertain to saltwater fisheries in the duwamish drainage system.the duwamish empties only into elliott bay.nowhere in lane report is there a reference to the muckleshoot ancestors fishing on a drainage system that empties anywhere outside elliott bay.
the only other reference to saltwater in lane report is the statement,in exhibit and listed in finding,in addition,there was some trolling for salmon in salt water when families descended upon the rivers to get shell fish supplies on the beaches of the sound.this statement does not establish that the muckleshoot ancestors had any saltwater outside elliott bay.the rivers that the families descended upon are those referenced in the preceding puyallup,carbon,stuck,white,green,and cedar.at the time of the treaty,the white,green,and cedar rivers flowed into the black river which became the duwamish river and emptied into elliott bay.this is consistent with lane use of the term duwamish drainage system throughout her report.the beaches of puget sound that the muckleshoot ancestors would reach after descending the white,green,and cedar rivers wer
