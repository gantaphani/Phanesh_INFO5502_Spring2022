dcfs followed up with a visit to the home about one month later.a neighbor informed the social worker that mother had not been home for a few days due to an alleged gang altercation involving carnell and however,mother was home and explained that she had left previously due to the altercation,fleeing with her children,carnell,and.she stated that carnell is african american and when he and went to the store to purchase milk and a pack of cigarettes,some cholos across the street began to call carnell derogatory names.when they left the store,the alleged gang members followed them home and attempted to punch carnell.carnell defended himself and he and ran into the house.when the neighbor attempted to intervene,the alleged gang members punched him in the face.mother stated she was frightened that they would return so she left.she believes the incident was not a gang problem but was a race problem.she later contacted christian father,eloy,and asked him to take care of christian for a little while and she sent antonio to stay with friends in san bernardino.the children were out of school for a week due to this incident.mother was not willing to stop seeing carnell as a safety precaution.
dcfs interviewed christian again when his father brought him into the dcfs office on april.he informed the social worker that,before he went to live with his father,he,antonio,mother,carnell,and traci had been living in various motels.he stated he was unhappy because they avoided going outside due to being afraid of the alleged gang members.he did not want to return to mother because he did not feel safe there and because he and antonio did not get enough food.he stated that he and antonio would save food from their lunches in order to have something to eat for dinner.mother would go out in the evenings and leave them with carnell for extended periods of time.carnell would call someone named johnny who would bring money so they could buy some food.
dcfs filed a petition on may,which alleged,as amended,count b the children mother created a detrimental endangering home environment for the children in that the mother allowed individuals,including mother male companion carnell and unrelated adult male,with criminal records,propensities toward violence and drug use,to be around her children and has,at times,left the children in the care of these individuals.such a detrimental and endangering situation established for the children by the mother endangers the children physical health and safety and places the children at risk of physical harm,damage and danger.the petition also included count b,which stated,the children mother has a history of illicit drug use and is a current user of methamphetamine,which renders the mother incapable of providing regular care of the children.the mother illicit drug use endangers the children physical health and safety and places the children at risk of physical harm,damage and failure to protect.the trial court found that dcfs had made a prima facie case for detention,released christian to his father and placed antonio in foster case.
dcfs filed a report on may,the report.it is this report that contains the hearsay statements mother contends triggered section.the report incorporated statements made by traci and amirah while they were being interviewed by the dcfs social worker in the concurrently filed case,case number,with respect to,and amirah.traci stated that and mother smoked methamphetamine in one of the bedrooms while the children were home in the living room.traci stated that smoked methamphetamines daily.amirah stated that she had seen traci and mother smoke the tree,which she also referred to as blunts,in the front and back yards of the home.

mother objected to the statements made by traci and amirah,which were incorporated in the report from case number,stating that dcfs must first comply with section.after changing its ruling several times,the trial court ultimately concluded that section did not and the evidence was admissible as part of the social study report.
the trial court ordered dcfs to provide family preservation services for mother and to release antonio to her after she had three consecutive clean drug tests.according to dcfs september,report,dcfs was unable to confirm that mother no longer lived with carnell or dcfs was unable to verify the conditions of mother apartment as well.mother failed to provide three clean consecutive drug tests.although she tested negative on april,and may,she failed to appear for testing on july,and august,and tested positive for methamphetamine and amphetamine on august.christian father expressed concerns stating that mother appeared anxious during visits with christian,had lost a substantial amount of weight and had large sores on her face.dcfs determined that antonio could not yet be returned to mother.

issues on appeal 
mother contends that the trial court erred in ruling that dcfs need not comply with section before using and disseminating evidence from an unrelated dependency case and in admitting such evidence that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court jurisdictional finding that the children suffered,or were at a substantial risk of suffering,serious physical harm or illness and that the trial court erred in finding that dcfs complied with icwa inquiry and notice provisions.she seeks to reverse the ruling that section does not apply and reverse the judgment based on the finding that her children were subject to dependency jurisdiction pursuant to section,subdivision b.in the alternative,if we hold that the jurisdictional findings are supported by substantial evidence,she seeks to remand the case with instructions that the trial court order dcfs to comply with icwa notice and inquiry provisions.
discussion 
dcfs was not required to file a petition seeking access to the juvenile case file in case number under section 
mother contends that before using and disseminating evidence from the unrelated dependency case,case number,in the petition filed in this case,dcfs was required to comply with section she asserts that the trial court erred in ruling that section did not apply to the evidence at issue and in admitting the evidence as a result.
it is the express intent of the legislature that juvenile court records,in general,should be confidential.citation.the strong public policy of confidentiality of juvenile proceedings and records has long been recognized.citations.courts have recognized,however,that this policy of confidentiality is not absolute.in re keisha th.that juvenile court records are confidential,but not absolutely so,is reflected in section.ibid.
section provides that certain persons may inspect juvenile court records without a court order.these persons include e t he attorneys for the parties who are actively participating in criminal or juvenile proceedings involving the minor and f t he county counsel,city attorney,or any other attorney representing the petitioning agency in a dependency action,subd.a e f see also,cal.rules of court,rule b f h.with respect to individuals not included in the list of specified persons who may access a case file without a court order,section includes procedures through which such individuals may petition a court to request such access.in re elijah th.
mother contends that section,subdivision a f,which allows a county counsel,city attorney or other attorney representing dcfs to access juvenile court files,limits such attorney access to the specific case to which the attorney has been appointed.thus,dcfs was required to petition the court for an order permitting the attorney acting on its behalf in her case to access and utilize the statements from case number,a case for which such attorney was not appointed.mother cites no authority supporting her contention,however,and we disagree.as mother contention involves the interpretation and application of section,our review is de novo.prentice board of administration th.
adopting mother interpretation of section goes against common sense.the language found in the current subdivision a f was added to section in.bill reg.sess.were we to adopt mother interpretation,it would mean that prior to,dcfs attorneys were not permitted to access the files for cases to which they had been appointed.however,dcfs attorneys were and still are permitted to access juvenile case files for cases to which they have been appointed pursuant to subdivision a e,which limits such access to those attorneys who are actively participating in criminal or juvenile proceedings involving the minor.
senate bill amended section and was drafted to increase access to the records of children in the state that sic have been killed as a result of abuse or neglect.assem.com.on appropriations,on bill reg.sess.as amended june,italics added.the language in current subdivision a f was added to senate bill by an amendment on june,and was described as add ing county counsel,city attorney or other attorneys representing the petitioning agency in dependency actions to the list of individuals who may inspect juvenile court files.assem.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended june.we do not read this addition to section as being redundant.rather,it was an expansion of the list of individuals who have access to inspect juvenile court files.see,rules,off.of senate floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.as a result,we conclude that pursuant to section,subdivision a f,dcfs attorneys are permitted to access juvenile court files generally,and therefore the attorney in this case was not required to petition the trial court to request access to the file for case number.
substantial evidence supports the trial court jurisdictional findings 
mother contends next that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court jurisdictional finding that her children suffered,or were at a substantial risk of suffering,serious physical harm or illness.in support of her contention,mother argues that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay statements from case number,which were included in dcfs social study reports,into evidence and relying on such evidence to make its jurisdictional findings.
a social study prepared by the petitioning agency,and hearsay evidence contained in it,is admissible and constitutes competent evidence upon which a finding of jurisdiction pursuant to section may be based,to the extent allowed by subdivisions c and d.citation.our supreme court instructs that such a study fits within the class of legally admissible evidence on which a court can rely in a jurisdictional hearing,despite the fact that a social study is itself hearsay and may contain multiple levels of hearsay.citation.only i f any party to the jurisdictional hearing raises a timely objection to the admission of specific hearsay evidence contained in a social study may the specific hearsay evidence be in sufficient by itself to support a jurisdictional finding or any ultimate fact upon which a jurisdictional finding is based citation.in re th,subds.c and d 
mother asserts that the hearsay declarants were not made available for and dcfs neither denies her assertion nor argues that any one of the other exceptions was met.mother objected to the hearsay evidence at trial.as a result,the hearsay statements were not render ed inadmissible.rather,the objection meant that uncorroborated,the hearsay statements did not constitute substantial evidence and could not be used as the exclusive basis for finding jurisdiction under section.citation.in re th.
the question before us,then,is whether there was corroborating evidence in this record which could support the witnesses hearsay statements sufficiently to sustain a jurisdictional finding.corroborating evidence is e vidence supplementary to that already given and tending to strengthen or confirm it.additional evidence of a different character to the same point.citation.in this context,corroborating evidence is that which supports a logical and reasonable inference that the act described in the hearsay statement occurred.citation.in re,supra,th at.
this standard is analogous to the rule in criminal law requiring independent corroborative proof of accomplice testimony.in re b,supra,th at.thus with respect to dependency jurisdictional findings,corroborative evidence,whether direct or circumstantial,is sufficient if it tends to connect the allegedly offending parent with the alleged negligent act even though it is slight and entitled,when standing by itself,to but little consideration citations,nor does it need to establish the precise facts in the hearsay statements is sufficient if it tends to connect the all
