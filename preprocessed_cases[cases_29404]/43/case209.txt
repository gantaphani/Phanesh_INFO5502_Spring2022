sixteen years ago more than sixty native american tribes entered into tribal state gaming compacts with the state of california.sadly,the long and tortured history leading to the culmination of these compacts did not cease there.rather,litigation based on ambiguous provisions as to the number of authorized gaming devices has ensued for most of the duration of these compacts.see in re indian gaming related cases,cir detailing the entire history before and after the compacts were enacted.before us is yet another installment in this ongoing saga,this time between the pauma band of luiseno mission indians pauma or the tribe and the state of california,the california gambling control commission,and governor edmund brown,collectively the state.
pauma sued the state based on our prior decision in cachil dehe band of wintun indians of the colusa indian community california colusa ii,cir.we have been asked to determine whether colusa ii interpretation of the compacts license pool provision applies retroactively,such that the state would be deemed to have misrepresented a material fact as to how many gaming licenses were available when negotiating with pauma to amend its compact whether the district court awarded the proper remedy to pauma by refunding million in overpayments and whether the state has waived its sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.we answer each question in the affirmative,although on alternative grounds supporting the relief awarded by the district court with respect to the remedy.on,pauma also asks us to determine whether the state acted in bad faith under the indian gaming regulatory act igra.we agree with the district court finding that igra is inapplicable here,and thus pauma argument that the state acted in bad faith is irrelevant.
we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
we begin our journey with a quick overview of the weathered past between native american tribes and the state of california,and then discuss the complicated procedural history that leads us here.
in,congress attempted to strike a delicate balance between the sovereignty of states and federally recognized native american tribes by passing igra.the purpose of igra is well established 
igra was congress compromise solution to the difficult questions involving indian gaming.the act was passed in order to provide a statutory basis for the operation of gaming by indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic development,and strong tribal governments and to shield tribal gaming from organized crime and other corrupting influences to ensure that the indian tribe is the primary beneficiary of the gaming operation.igra is an example of cooperative federalism in that it seeks to balance the competing sovereign interests of the federal government,state governments,and indian tribes,by giving each a role in the regulatory scheme.
artichoke joe cal.grand casino norton,d,aff,cir.igra creates three classes of gaming,with class iii gaming consisting of the types of games usually associated with gambling.in re indian gaming,at.as a result,class iii gaming is subjected to the greatest degree of control under igra regulations.class iii gaming is lawful on native american lands only if such activities are conducted pursuant to a tribal state compact entered into by the tribe and a state that permits such gaming,and the compact is approved by the secretary of the interior.id.citing d,b.
california did not immediately allow indian gaming within its boundaries after the passage of igra.some gubernatorial administrations were hostile to tribes conducting class iii gaming because it was then prohibited by california constitution,and so the state refused to negotiate with the tribes to permit it.see id.at.in,the people of california spoke by passing the tribes ballot initiative proposition codified at cal.gov t code.see hotel emps.rest.emps.int l union davis,cal th.proposition contained a model compact purporting to effectuate igra provisions within california.id.at.but the victory was.the california supreme court found all but one sentence of proposition unconstitutional id.at.undeterred,the voters of california responded by amending the california constitution on march,to create an exception for certain types of class iii indian gaming notwithstanding the general prohibition on gambling in the state.in re indian gaming,at.
in september,several tribes began negotiating with the state to enter nearly identical compacts to operate class iii,or,gambling the compact.in april,pauma joined more than sixty other tribes who ultimately signed the compact.the compact contains a provision limiting the number of available statewide for tribes based on a formula as we have previously observed,t he license pool provisions that california and the tribes included in their compact as a foundation for establishing class iii gaming in california are murky at best.colusa ii,at.due to the limited time the tribes had to negotiate with the state,the parties agreed to the compact without ever discussing their radically different interpretations of how many licenses the statewide license pool formula actually produced.see id.at in re indian gaming,at.it required protracted litigation before we settled the number in colusa ii,at.
by december,the state informed the tribes that the collective license pool had been exhausted without stating the total number of licenses actually authorized and pauma received only licenses in that draw instead of its requested.thus several tribes,including pauma,began negotiating with the state to amend their compacts in order to abolish the license pool provision and gain access to an unlimited number of licenses.since the state demanded substantially more money per operable license during negotiations,only five tribes including pauma ultimately concluded such amendments amendment.see id.at.at the time,pauma was set to enter into a contract with caesars to build a las casino in place of pauma tent facility near san diego,but needed more gaming licenses to do so 
several lawsuits ensued.by,these suits had percolated in the district courts for several years,and culminated in dispositive opinions rendered by our court.see colusa ii,at rincon band of luiseno mission indians schwarzenegger,cir holding that the state negotiated in bad faith by refusing to remove a provision from the proposed amendment for of rincon net wins,which we declared an impermissible tax under igra.in colusa ii,we held that the state miscalculated the number of licenses in the common pool under the compact.at.we found that the formula in the compact allows for a statewide total of licenses,not the that the state had originally calculated.id.at.
shortly after the district court in colusa rendered its decision holding that more licenses existed than the state had allowed,pauma filed a complaint asserting eighteen claims attacking the formation of the amendment under various theories,including mistake and misrepresentation.pauma notes that it has remained at roughly licenses since december when the state first asserted that the license pool had been depleted,while two neighboring tribes operate at least gaming devices apiece.pauma executed the amendment because it needed to have at least licenses in order to secure a viable deal with a las operator.but after the putative deals fell through,pauma continued paying california the exorbitantly expensive amendment prices for the same machines it acquired under the compact provisions.under the original compact,pauma paid annually for the machines.under the amendment,pauma paid million annually.pauma sought reformation,injunctive relief,rescission,and restitution.
in april,the united states district court for the southern district of california granted pauma request for injunctive relief from the annual million payments,permitting pauma to revert to the compact rate.the state appealed.on the prior appeal,we left the injunction in place but remanded to the district court for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction factors in light of recent cases,including colusa ii.on remand,the case was reassigned to three different district judges before the court finally ruled on the summary judgment motions,leaving the injunction in place.
presently before us is the district court summary judgment ruling in favor of pauma on its misrepresentation claim.in light of our ruling in colusa ii,the district court found the state had misrepresented the number of licenses available in december when it told pauma the pool was exhausted in fact,there were remaining.as a result,the district court rescinded the amendment,allowed pauma to return to the compact lower rate,and ordered as specific performance a refund of the difference in payment that pauma had made as between the higher and lower rates for the machines totaling.the district court also held that the state had waived its eleventh amendment sovereign immunity in a provision in the compact,which the parties had left undisturbed in the amendment.the court further held that the state was not entitled to a setoff for the profits pauma made between and because pauma should have been able to obtain the machines under the correctly calculated license formula in the compact.
the district court entered final judgment in december,but was immediately asked by pauma to vacate the order so it could request further relief.pauma sought a ruling on two additional claims labeled bad of igra so that the tribe would be entitled to reformation rather than rescission.the district court denied the request as moot since it would not result in a remedy different from the one already provided to pauma,and held it would fail on the merits in any event.this ruling triggered pauma mandamus petition,which we denied as premature earlier this year the state appeal and pauma are now ripe for review.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.big lagoon rancheria california,cir en banc.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and,even making all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.rincon,at.we also review the following legal determinations de novo interpretation of contracts based on the plain meaning,colusa ii,at whether negotiations were conducted in good faith under igra,rincon,at and the applicability of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity,idaho coeur tribe,cir.general principles of federal contract law govern the compacts,which were entered pursuant to igra.colusa ii,at citation omitted.we often look to the restatement when deciding questions of federal common law.curtin united airlines.we may also rely on california contract law since there is no practical difference between state and federal law in this area.id.

the heart of the state argument before us focuses on whether there was a fact in existence that it misrepresented to pauma during the negotiations.thus,we review whether colusa ii holding that licenses were available meaning remained in december when the state told pauma that the license pool had been depleted constitutes a fact in existence giving rise to liability under pauma misrepresentation claim.we hold that,unlike a change in judicial interpretation of a statute or law,the doctrine of retroactivity does not apply to contracts.once there has been a final judicial interpretation of an ambiguous contract provision,that is and has always been the correct interpretation from the document inception.
in order to establish its misrepresentation claim,pauma must demonstrate the state made a misrepresentation about a fact in existence,that was either fraudulent or material,which induced pauma to enter into the amendment,and pauma was justified in relying on the state misrepresentation.see restatement second of contracts see also addisu fred meyer,cir adopting the restatement definition for misrepresentation.the outcome of this case hinges on the first prong.a misrepresentation is an assertion that is not in accord with the facts as they exist at the time the assertion is made.restatement second of contracts cmt.such facts include past events as well as present circumstances but do not include future events.an assertion limited to future events may be a basis of liability for breach of contract,but not of relief for misrepresentation.id.
furthermore,an assertion need not be fraudulent to be a misrepresentation so long as it is material.id.cmt.a reliance fin.miller,cir referring to this version as innocent misrepresentation a misstated fact is material if it would be likely to induce a reasonable person to manifest his or her assent to enter a contract.restatement second of contracts.a misrepresentation induces a party manifestation of assent if it substantially contributes to his or her decision to enter the contract.id.although a party must have justifiably relied upon the misrepresentation,the requirement of justification is usually met unless,for example,the fact to which the misrepresentation relates is of only peripheral importance to the transaction id.
while both parties dispute whether the doctrine of retroactivity applies,that doctrine is a red herring because we are dealing with a contract provision.the state argues that our holding in colusa ii does not apply retroactively.in essence,the state asserts that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for pauma because the license pool did not expand until mid when a district court first handed down its ruling in cachil dehe band of wintun indians of the colusa indian community california colusa i,d.in the state view,the number of available licenses changed when we handed down colusa ii in.thus,the state contends it could not have misrepresented an existing fact when it denied licenses to tribes beyond a total of.we reject this argument.
we find that the term retroactive is a misnomer in the realm of contract interpretation.once a court has interpreted an ambiguous contract provision that is and has always been the correct interpretation from its formation.although the cases discussing the retroactivity of judicial decisions interpreting statutes may be instructive,a contract is fundamentally different from a statute or a body of law.a contract is a private agreement formed between two parties to represent their mutual intent.see restatement second of contracts.thus,a contract provision has only one true meaning what it meant when written even though the parties may later dispute the correct interpretation.by contrast,a statute is enacted by congress and the understanding of its provisions may evolve over time,often through judicial interpretations or legislative amendments 
t he fundamental goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting.cellular inv.gte mobilnet,cir emphasis added.this fundamental axiom is widely accepted and uncontested.see,colusa ii,at holding the court gives effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time the contract was executed emphasis added internal quotations omitted liberty bank trust bank of am.trust sav.ass n,cir t he basic rule of universal acceptation for the ascertainment of the parties intention is for the court,so far as possible,to put itself in the place of the parties when their minds met upon the terms of the agreement williston on contracts ed.
when dealing with interpretation of a contract there is no such thing as a change in the law once a final judicial decision determines what the contested language supports,that is it.the state argument that colusa ii changed the number of licenses available under the license pool provision defies logic.as is typical in contract interpretation cases,the dispute was between the parties competing calculations.once we decreed that licenses were available under the formula provision based on a reasonable interpretation of the contract language and the intention of the parties at the time it was formed,we resolved the dispute.colusa ii,at.thus,the number of licenses never changed as the state asserts.
in colusa ii,we found that the state did not adequately explain why it had chosen for the total available licenses since the foundation for this number is at odds with the plain language of the contract and with an interpretation of part of the formula that is now agreed upon by both parties.id.at see also id.at nn.we calculated the correct number of licenses that were authorized for distribution statewide through the license draw process,to be,id.at,and then we turned to the opinion prospective effect on other tribes.we recognized that the remedy deprived the state of its right to litigate the size of the license pool under different facts in other pending and future cases because we purposefully anticipated that california would be liable for a single number of licenses in the statewide pool,not separate numbers for separate litigants based on their respective situations.id.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.in sum,our interpretation in colusa ii of the compact license pool provision is the final word for all tribes,at all times.
the formula for calculating the license pool never changed it just took over a decade to reach a final judicial interpretation which settled a longstanding dispute over the number of licenses it authorized.innocent misrepresentation of a different number does not require a fraudulent or misleading intent.see restatement second of contracts.it simply requires a fact,which is material,to be false.id,c.the formula stated in the compact is a fact.the number of tribes with and without compacts as of the listed date september,was an ascertainable,existing fact.see colusa ii,at.the number of licenses each tribe with a compact had as of that date was also an existing fact.id.at.the state had all of the information it needed to calculate its own formula the state simply miscalculated.
understandably,the state expresses a sense of unfairness engendered by the retrospective application of a new judicial interpretation of an existing contract provision.but the essence of judicial decisionmaking necessarily involves some peril to individual expectations.morales izquierdo dep t of homeland,cir internal quotation and alterations omitted.the state could have sought a declaratory judgment much earlier,but it did not.the state also could have simply used fixed numerals in the formula,but it did not.the fact that there was ambiguity in the formula language or that the state interpreted the total number of licenses in good faith is irrelevant to the analysis.we interpreted the total number of licenses in the license pool to be based on a reasonable interpretation of the contract language.therefore,in december,the state misrepresented an existing fact to the tribes including pauma that no further licenses were available when,in fact,there were more licenses under the correct interpretation of the formula.
the state remaining arguments regarding the misrepresentation claim warrant only brief discussion.first,the state argument that the license pool provision was not material to the compacts borders on the incredible.see colusa ii,at central to the compacts is a formula to calculate the number of gaming devices california tribes are permitted to license.second,the state argument that the limited number of licenses did not induce pauma to enter the amendment is equally absurd,considering procurement of more licenses at least was essential to its putative contract with caesars,dependent on at least that many devices.finally,pauma justifiably relied on a fact that was entirely within the state control the total number of available licenses.pauma has,therefore,established that no genuine issue of material fact remains as to its misrepresentation claim,and the district court properly granted summary judgment 
after granting summary judgment in favor of pauma on its innocent misrepresentation claim,the district court turned to the appropriate remedy.since the compacts include a limited waiver of sovereign immunity that allows for suit seeking an equitable remedy,but not one seeking monetary damages,we must first decide what the correct remedy is.then we determine whether that remedy is barred by the eleventh amendment or if it falls within the state limited waiver.
the district court erred in awarding pauma million under the guise of specific performance.specific performance is a remedy associated with breach of contract.restatement second of contracts specific performance a cause for specific performance ordinarily can not lie until there has been a breach of the contract.a party who has avoided a contract on the ground of misrepresentation is entitled to restitution for any benefit that he has conferred on the other party by way of part performance or reliance.restatement second of contracts witkin,summary of california law,contracts ed.a person who pays money under the mistaken belief that he or she is under a duty to do so may recover it.furthermore,s pecific performance will not be granted unless the terms of the contract are sufficiently certain to provide a basis for an appropriate order.restatement second of contracts.
where,as here,no breach of a contract has been alleged,but rather a challenge to its formation,pauma would not have entered into the amendment had it known additional licenses were available at the cheaper compact rates the contract is voidable and the appropriate remedy is rescission and restitution.see witkin,summary of california law,contracts ed noting innocent misrepresentation is grounds for rescission see also reliance fin,at same restatement third of restitution,dan dobbs,law of remedies ed.when the contract itself is unenforceable,restitution is usually the only remedy available for benefits the plaintiff has conferred upon a defendant in part performance.emphasis in original id.a representation by the defendant,if believed by the plaintiff,would be the equivalent of a mutual mistake for which rescission would be granted.id.
moreover,one can not specifically perform something that is not a term in the contract.restatement second of contracts.the compact did not contain a clause for dealing with overpayments.the sole option for returning pauma to the status quo ante was equitable restitution.id.see ambassador hotel wei chuan,cir.thus,the district court misapplied the law in labeling the remedy specific performance.
however,in this case,the district court error in mislabeling the remedy does not require reversal.neither side disputes the calculation of as the difference between the higher amendment payments and the lower compact rates.rather,the state challenges only whether it is entitled to a setoff for the profits pauma gained from operating machines it would not have had absent the amendment,and pauma now alleges it is entitled to essentially reform the entire contract under the procedures outlined in igra.since we reject both arguments,we affirm the district court calculation of the remedy on the alternative grounds of equitable rescission and restitution.
under general contract principles,w hen calculating restitution,we must offset the plaintiffs award by the value of any benefits that plaintiffs received from the d efendant under the contract,so that only the actual,or net,loss is compensated.republic sav.bank,united states,internal quotation omitted see,cal.fed.bank matreyek,holding restitutionary recovery inequitable where the bank would be able to retain both a benefit and a profit restatement second of contracts dan dobbs,law of remedies ed.the state is not entitled to a setoff here because pauma would have made the same profits by acquiring the same number of machines under the compact that it now operates under the amendment if the state had not miscalculated the number of available licenses.
the state argues that,although this would return pauma to the status quo ante in theory,in reality it would unjustly enrich pauma the other tribes who were parties to the compact because the other tribes were unable to obtain unlimited machines as pauma could under the amendment and thus did not earn additional profits.essentially,the state argues that pauma will receive a windfall of roughly million by sitting on the sidelines during the colusa litigation.
however,the state argument depends on viewing the situation holistically,in contravention to general litigation principles.the district court correctly stated it must deal solely with the parties before it.see,boating indus.ass ns marshall,cir remedy for this injury would depend upon actions of third parties not before the court in this action.under this view,as between pauma and the state,pauma is not obtaining a windfall because it should never have had to pay the state the million in the first place,and it should have been able to obtain the same number of licenses a total of for less money.thus,the state argument to consider pauma position in comparison to the other tribes who were unable to obtain further licenses and the attendant profits must fail.the district court correctly held that the state is not entitled to a setoff.
pauma argument for reformation meets a similar fate.on,pauma requests reformation of the amendment rather than rescission so that pauma may keep the amended contract extended term limit expiring in instead of at the more favorable compact price rates.h owever,reformation is proper only in cases of fraud and mutual mistake.skinner northop grumman ret.plan b,cir see restatement second of contracts referencing only fraudulent misrepresentation as giving rise to reformation as a remedy dan dobbs,law of remedies ed.reformation is the appropriate remedy for fraud or mistake in the written expression of the agreement.this case involves innocent misrepresentation,not fraudulent misrepresentation.reformation is thus inappropriate here.
in sum,the district court erred in applying the law of contractual remedies by awarding pauma specific performance rather than ordering rescission and restitution.but because neither side challenges the calculation of the remedy,only whether a setoff should be applied or reformation ordered as a superior remedy both of which we reject we affirm the district court award to pauma of under the equitable remedies of rescission and restitution.
because the state must refund the million in overpayments,we next consider whether the district court correctly held that the state had waived its eleventh amendment sovereign immunity in this case to permit such relief.
t he rule has evolved that a suit by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury is barred by the eleventh amendment.edelman jordan.the supreme court has extended this bar to suits brought by native american tribes even though they are sovereigns in their own right.see blatchford native vill.of noatak.in edelman,the court made clear that a state sovereign immunity extends even to equitable judgments,particularly if the award resembles far more closely the monetary award against the state itself than it does the prospective injunctive relief at.the court specifically rejected an individual claims for equitable restitution based on the state wrongful withholding of benefits under a public aid program.id.at.thus,the court held only prospective,relief against state officials is exempt from the eleventh amendment bar.id.at.
however,there are exceptions to this general bar.med,cal.dep t health care,cir.the supreme court discussed one such exception at length in edelman waiver.at.edelman recognized that congress may abrogate a states sovereign immunity via a clear,express legislative statement,or a state may enter a compact by which the state expressly and unequivocally waives its own immunity.id.at.in deciding whether a state has waived its constitutional protection under the eleventh amendment,we will find waiver only where stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction.id.at internal quotation and alteration omitted.
here,the state waived its eleventh amendment sovereign immunity through an explicit contractual waiver.the compact contains a limited waiver of sovereign immunity on behalf of both the state and the tribe,which the amendment left undisturbed.it reads in relevant part 
limited waiver of sovereign immunity.
a in the event that a dispute is to be resolved in federal court,the state and the tribe expressly consent to be sued therein and waive any immunity therefrom that they may have provided that 
the dispute is limited solely to issues arising under this gaming compact 
neither side makes any claim for monetary damages that is,only injunctive,specific performance,including enforcement of a provision of this compact requiring payment of money to one or another of the parties,or declaratory relief is sought 
this is an express waiver that falls within the exception to the eleventh amendment delineated in edelman but the parties dispute the scope of the waiver.we must determine whether the exclusion for monetary damages in section a includes authorization to seek the remedy of rescission and restitution.
we hold that the proper remedy here does not trigger the exclusion provision,and thus the state waived its sovereign immunity for pauma misrepresentation claim.we begin by analyzing the language of the contract itself.see colusa ii,at.the contractual language establishes a clear dichotomy between claims for monetary damages which are excluded and thus barred by sovereign immunity and equitable relief.although restitution may be considered a legal or equitable remedy,see restatement third of restitution dan dobbs,law of remedies ed,interpreting the contract as a whole demonstrates that restitution was contemplated by the parties as a potential remedy for which sovereign immunity was waived.thus,we hold that restitution is included in the waiver by such overwhelming implications from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction.edelman,at internal quotation and alteration omitted 
a written contract must be read as a whole and every part interpreted with reference to the whole,with preference given to reasonable interpretations.wapato heritage,united states,cir internal quotation omitted see restatement second of contracts.here,reading the contract as a whole,the present restitutionary order falls well within the waiver.first,the waiver applies provided that n either side makes any claim for monetary damages that is,only injunctive,specific performance,including enforcement of a provision of this compact requiring payment of money to one or another of the parties which must mean either pauma or the state of california,or declaratory relief is sought.the parties choice of the phrase that is indicates a list allowing for equitable and declaratory forms of relief.
second,and more significantly,one of the listed examples of relief for which immunity is waived is enforcement of a provision of this compact requiring payment of money to one or another of the parties.this clause envisions payment of money to either party,and yet the compact does not contain any provisions requiring payment of money from the state to the tribe if this clause did not contemplate the restitutionary remedy ordered by the district court and affirmed herein,then the provision would be operative only as to one party,not both.excluding restitution as a remedy that the tribe could seek under this waiver would render this clause null and void.williston on contracts ed.an interpretation which gives effect to all provisions of the contract is preferred to one which renders part of the writing superfluous,useless or inexplicable.even if that is is construed to limit waiver only as to the remedies listed,as urged by the dissent,the restitution remedy ordered by the district court still falls within that restrictive interpretation.thus,the district court properly held that restitution by the state of overpayments by the tribe was included in the waiver.
in sum,the contractual waiver clearly envisions restitution as falling within its purview,and only actions for monetary damages or actions not arising from the compact itself to be excluded.the proper remedy for pauma due to the state misrepresentation of the number of licenses available under the compact formula is rescission of the amendment and restitution for the overpayments made.therefore,the state contractually waived to this extent its eleventh amendment sovereign immunity and pauma was not barred from bringing its misrepresentation claim seeking rescission and restitution 
on,pauma asserts the district court erred by denying summary judgment on the tribe fifth and sixth claims for relief styled as bad violation claims.pauma provides a lengthy and explanation why it thinks the state acted in bad faith with respect to the entirety of their course of dealings over the last fifteen years.the tribe relies heavily upon our recent decision in rincon,involving a different california tribe,that upheld a finding of bad faith under igra.however,in the process,pauma ignores the explicit statutory language of igra under which it seeks relief.the district court held pauma igra claims were moot because rescission of the amendment had already been granted judicially estopped as inconsistent with pauma earlier position and barred by the plain language of the igra statute.we affirm on the last ground.
the plain language of igra does not support pauma argument.igra states that a native american tribe shall request a state to enter into negotiations for the purposes of entering a tribal state gaming compact,and u pon receiving such a request,the state shall negotiate with the indian tribe in good faith to enter into such a compact.d a emphasis added.in order to give effect to this language,the statute vests federal district courts with jurisdiction over any cause of action initiated by an indian tribe arising from the failure of a state to enter into negotiations with the indian tribe for the purpose of entering into a tribal state compact under paragraph or to conduct such negotiations in good faith.id.d a i emphasis added.
the next subsection describes,in detail,the procedure a tribe must follow if a state does not adhere to these mandates.id.d b.specifically,the native american tribe must first introduce evidence that a tribal state compact has not been entered into under paragraph,and the state did not respond to the request of the indian tribe to negotiate such a compact or did not respond to such request in good faith.id.d b ii i,ii emphasis added.then,igra provides a remedy if such an event should occur if the court finds that the state has failed to negotiate in good faith with the indian tribe to conclude a tribal state compact governing the conduct of gaming activities,the court shall order the state and the indian tribe to conclude such a compact within a day period.id.d b iii emphasis added.this same section also lists factors a court may consider when determining whether a state has negotiated in good faith.id.
the detailed procedures set forth in igra allow for redress by native american tribes when a state refuses to negotiate or negotiates in bad faith for a gaming compact.these procedures,by their own language,simply do not apply when the state and the tribe have actually reached a compact.see id.d b ii i.rincon does not hold otherwise.at.the rincon tribe pauma nearby competitor in san diego also entered into negotiations with the state in and but rincon refused to sign an actual amended compact with the state and filed suit instead.id.at,see also big lagoon rancheria,at in re indian gaming,at holding the state did not negotiate in bad faith with respect to the compact revenue provisions,which the tribe refused to sign.pauma is thus in a very different position than the rincon tribe because it actually agreed to the amendment and did not challenge the negotiation process under igra.
therefore,the district court correctly concluded although igra may allow a court to reform or rescind an unlawful agreement which is what pauma wanted until now,it does not allow the court to turn back the clock and compel of an agreement actually reached ten years ago,let alone one that has been rescinded and never would have been negotiated in the first place in light of the relief the court has already granted in this case.the relief pauma seeks in its is not available under the plain statutory language of igra,and we affirm the district court denial of pauma summary judgment motion on this ground.
in conclusion,we hold that once a court judgment interpreting an ambiguous contract provision becomes final,that is and has always been the correct interpretation from its inception.as such,the state innocently misrepresented a material fact when it erroneously informed pauma the compact license pool had been depleted based on its miscalculation of the formula.since this misrepresentation induced pauma to enter into the much more expensive amendment,the tribe is entitled to rescission of the amendment and restitution for the million in overpayments made to the state.the eleventh amendment does not bar this suit because the state contractually waived its sovereign immunity for claims arising out of the compacts seeking such relief.finally,pauma is not entitled on to seek redress under igra because the plain language of the statute precludes relief when the tribe and the state actually enter into a compact 
affirmed.each party shall bear its own costs.
i agree with the majority conclusion that courts determine contracting parties intent as of the time the contract is executed.i disagree,however,that california committed the tort of misrepresentation by interpreting the compact differently than a later court decision.the provision regarding the number of available licenses in the compact was hopelessly ambiguous.california,the compacting tribes,the district court and this court all interpreted it differently.that this court opinion differed from that offered by california does not establish that california made an assertion that was not in accord with the facts as they existed at the time the assertion was made.restatement second of contracts cmt.
the decision in colusa ii was not the result of any judicial fact finding.in fact,this court rejected the parties extrinsic evidence for contract interpretation purposes and determined the number of available licenses as a matter of law.because extrinsic evidence was rejected and the number determined as a matter of law,all parties to the compact were on equal footing with respect to their ability to interpret this ambiguous provision.the majority is correct when it notes that any party could have sued to get more clarity.the tribes in colusa ii did,but the plaintiff here chose instead to negotiate for the possibility of receiving more licenses than have ever been available under the compact 
on the misrepresentation issue,curtin united airlines,is analogous and persuasive.curtin involved a provision of the warsaw convention a treaty that established the compensation to be paid by a carrier when passengers luggage was lost during international travel.the warsaw convention provided for a payment of per pound up to the maximum of a seventy pound bag,or.united airlines had a practice of paying the maximum amount for lost international luggage rather than weighing the bags and paying the price per pound for the lost luggage.that practice had been interpreted by some courts as permissible,and by others as impermissible.ultimately,the district of columbia circuit court of appeals rejected the practice,holding that the warsaw convention did not cap liability at where the carrier had failed to weigh the bags as required.
in curtin,passengers who had settled their lost luggage claims for sued claiming,among other things,that the settlement agreements were procured by united misrepresentation of its obligation under the warsaw convention,as later determined by the court of appeals.however,the district of columbia circuit held that united did not make a misrepresentation by reasonably interpreting the warsaw convention differently than the later district of colum
