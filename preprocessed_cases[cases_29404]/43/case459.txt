this matter is before us on david pettigrew motion for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc.in united states pettigrew,cir we affirmed pettigrew conviction and sentence,holding,in part,that a finding of purpose,knowledge,or recklessness supports a conviction for assault resulting in serious bodily injury,see id.at,and that an upward departure for the defendant excessive recklessness in committing such an assault is a permissible grounds for a departure under united states sentencing guidelines manual,see id.at.pettigrew seeks rehearing of this issue arguing that it conflicts with koon united states,d and united states wolfe,cir to the extent that a guidelines departure is only warranted when the case falls outside the heartland that each offense guideline carves out.we grant pettigrew petition for panel rehearing for the limited purpose of clarifying our discussion of this issue.the opinion filed on july,is vacated and the attached revised opinion is substituted in its place.
following a jury trial,david pettigrew was convicted of one count of involuntary manslaughter in violation of and,two counts of assault resulting in serious bodily injury in violation of and a,and one count of assault by wounding in violation of and a.he was sentenced to months imprisonment.he now appeals both his conviction and sentence.we take jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
in the morning hours of april,pettigrew drove his truck to a friend house and picked him up to go for a ride.as they drove around the area making various stops,the pair consumed beers.pettigrew then dropped his friend off at home at in the afternoon.although it is unclear what pettigrew did after he dropped off this friend,at approximately.pettigrew drove to odell yazzie trailer,where yazzie lived with his girlfriend and parents.pettigrew asked yazzie to go with him to buy more alcohol.yazzie agreed to go and testified that he got into the passenger side of the truck even after noticing that pettigrew was intoxicated.although pettigrew maintains that yazzie drove pettigrew truck,and that pettigrew was in the passenger seat,the jury concluded that the evidence supported the government position that pettigrew was in fact the driver.
the two men headed westbound on highway,a highway with a posted speed limit of sixty miles per hour.upon entering the highway,pettigrew began swerving and other drivers blared their horns to warn him to drive right.after traveling a few miles,pettigrew abruptly turned left across the dirt median and attempted to drive across the eastbound traffic toward a residence on the south side of the highway.as pettigrew crossed the eastbound lanes,yazzie noticed a van headed toward the passenger side of the truck.yazzie yelled at pettigrew to step on it but pettigrew continued to drive slowly across the lanes.the van swerved to the right in an effort to avoid striking the passenger side of the truck.consequently,the truck hit the back end of the driver side of the van,causing it to flip three to four times.the van was occupied by the four members of the beasley,jason,and the couple two young daughters.carrie died in the accident and the other three beasleys sustained moderate to serious injuries.
after the collision,pettigrew truck spun out and came to a stop for a few moments.shortly thereafter,pettigrew righted the vehicle and headed east along highway.yazzie tried to convince pettigrew to stop the truck,but pettigrew refused.yazzie then grabbed the steering wheel,shifted the car into neutral,pushed on the brakes,and jumped out the passenger side window because the door would not open.yazzie started walking back home and pettigrew took off again.
law enforcement officers were dispatched to the scene of the accident.they found pettigrew abandoned truck in a field next to the highway a mile and a half from the crash site.deputy anthony ashcroft,an officer with the san juan county sheriff department,noticed that the driver side door was open and saw a set of footprints leading away from that door.he followed the footprints and eventually found pettigrew crouching under a bush.
because they were in indian country,deputy ashcroft did not have jurisdiction to formally arrest pettigrew,so the deputy detained him by placing him in handcuffs.when he did so he asked whether pettigrew knew what he had done,to which pettigrew responded,yeah,i fucked up my ride,now i got to get a new one.deputy ashcroft then told pettigrew that he might have killed someone in the accident.pettigrew responded by saying,i still got to get a new ride hereinafter first statement.deputy ashcroft then escorted pettigrew,who had a difficult time walking,back to the field where pettigrew left his truck,and handed him over to navajo police officer ron williams.
officer williams transported pettigrew to the shiprock detention center,where pettigrew voluntarily submitted to a test.during this time,an unidentified officer asked pettigrew whether he had been drinking that night,to which pettigrew responded,yes,i was drinking hereinafter second statement.then,while taking the test,pettigrew asked officer williams why he was arrested and what the charges against him were.officer williams informed pettigrew that he had been arrested for driving while intoxicated and that he might have been involved in an accident in which people were hurt.pettigrew stated,i saw it at the last minute.i hit it and took off hereinafter third statement.pettigrew made all these statements prior to receiving miranda warnings 
the following day,navajo tribal criminal investigator sammy ahkeah attempted to interview pettigrew about his involvement in the accident.investigator ahkeah informed pettigrew of the charges he was facing and explained to him his miranda rights.thereafter,pettigrew refused to provide a statement and invoked his right to counsel.
pettigrew filed a pretrial motion to suppress all his statements made prior to receiving miranda warnings.he argued that the first two statements were custodial interrogations that must be suppressed under miranda arizona,d.he argued that the third statement was either a custodial interrogation or,in the alternative,was fruit of the poisonous poisonous tree being the first two statements obtained in violation of therefore must also be suppressed.the district court granted the motion as to the first statement since it was the product of a custodial interrogation.the court did not rule on the admissibility of the second statement based on the government assertion that it did not intend to use the admission at trial finally,the court held that the third statement was admissible because pettigrew failed to show either that the statement was made in response to express questioning or its functional equivalent,rhode island innis,d,or that it was tainted by the original unlawful interrogation.
at trial,the government sought to admit into evidence a photograph depicting all four members of the beasley family,including carrie beasley while she was living.pettigrew objected,arguing that it was not offered for any proper purpose and that it would be unduly prejudicial.the district court stated that it would allow the photo to be admitted for the purpose of identification of the victims.despite this ruling,the government did not actually move the photo into evidence.instead,the government merely displayed the photo during its opening statement,used it to establish beasley identity through the testimony of beasley,and displayed it again during its closing arguments.the jury convicted pettigrew on all counts.
subsequently,the probation office prepared a presentence report psr.it calculated the adjusted offense level for pettigrew involuntary manslaughter conviction as.see sentencing guidelines manual or guidelines a b.the psr also determined the adjusted offense level for each of the two assaults resulting in serious bodily injury as.see.the assault by wounding conviction,which is a class b misdemeanor,is not governed by the guidelines.see.under the grouping rules in,the total adjusted offense level for the three felonies was.the psr calculated pettigrew criminal history category as iii,based upon a prior conviction for murder and because he committed the instant offenses less than two years after his release from custody and while still on supervised release.see a,d,e.accordingly,the psr determined that the applicable guidelines range was months imprisonment the psr also noted possible bases existed for an upward departure pettigrew excessively reckless behavior,see,and pettigrew criminal history category substantially the seriousness of his criminal history and the likelihood that he will commit future crimes,see a.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court adopted the psr factual findings,including the adjusted offense level of and criminal history category iii.the court then departed upward two offense levels based on pettigrew excessive recklessness,and departed upward one criminal history category on the ground that pettigrew criminal history category substantially the seriousness of his criminal history.this resulted in a guidelines range of months imprisonment.the court imposed the statutory maximum sentence for each of the two assaults,months imprisonment,to run concurrently with his sentence for involuntary manslaughter,months imprisonment.the court also imposed six months imprisonment for the misdemeanor assault,to run consecutively with the other convictions.this resulted in a total sentence of months.
pettigrew raises four claims on appeal the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the third statement the district court abused its discretion in admitting the photographic evidence at trial there was insufficient evidence to support the assault convictions and his sentence is unlawful.we address each argument in turn.
ii.the convictions 
a.the confession 
when a party challenges a district court ruling on a motion to suppress a confession,we review its conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states,cir.we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the district court determination.united states lopez,cir.our de novo review includes the ultimate issue of whether a statement was voluntary,taking into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the confession.id.finally,it is the government burden to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that a confession was voluntary.id.at.
as an initial matter,pettigrew does not contest that his first two statements were voluntary,albeit made in violation of miranda.further,he no longer argues that his third statement was the product of a custodial interrogation.accordingly,it is undisputed that if pettigrew third statement was the only statement he made,it would be admissible because it was volunteered and not made in response to any question posed by officer williams.see miranda,at.explaining that t he fundamental import of the privilege against compelled while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel,but whether he can be interrogated see also united states abdulla,cir volunteered statements made while in custody but not in response to questions posed by the police are not subject to the miranda exclusionary rule medeiros shimoda,cir same.the essence of his argument is that his first two statements somehow rendered his third statement inadmissible either as fruit of the poisonous tree or,relatedly,because his first two statements rendered it involuntary.this is,whether a confession,not itself a violation of miranda,but obtained subsequent to two violations of miranda,must be one of first impression for this circuit.
fruit of the poisonous tree 
the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine is most often associated with violations of the fourth amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures.see wong sun united states,d.it prohibits at trial the use of evidence obtained directly or indirectly through an unlawful search or seizure.id.at.in that context,the exclusionary rule is necessary to make effective the fundamental constitutional guarantees of sanctity of the home and inviolability of the person.id.stated another way,t he rule is calculated to prevent,not to repair.its purpose is to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available removing the incentive to disregard it.brown illinois,d.accordingly,the exclusionary rule as it applies to the fourth amendment is broad and witnesses and evidence including confessions,no matter how probative,discovered only as a result of a fourth amendment violation,must be excluded from evidence.wong sun,at.oregon elstad,d 
on the other hand,miranda exclusionary rule serves the fifth amendment.elstad,at.the fifth amendment clause bars the prosecution from using compelled testimony in its and is therefore primarily concerned with conduct at trial.id.at.prior to miranda,the admissibility of a suspect statements was judged solely by whether they were voluntary within the meaning of the due process clause.id.at.citing haynes washington,d chambers florida.the rule in miranda arose out of a concern that the possibility of coercion inherent in custodial interrogations unacceptably raises the risk that a suspect privilege against might be violated.united states patane,d citing dickerson united states,d and miranda,at.as such,a police officer failure to administer miranda warnings prior to a custodial interrogation creates a presumption of compulsion,elstad,at,and the confession is inadmissible with no need for the and difficult enquiry into voluntariness,patane,at.souter,dissenting.
unlike evidence obtained through a fourth amendment violation,however,the miranda presumption does not require that the fruits of unlawfully obtained confessions be discarded as inherently tainted.elstad,at.indeed,the supreme court has rejected automatic application of the fruits doctrine to violations of the miranda rule on several occasions.see missouri seibert,d kennedy,concurring stating that the scope of the miranda suppression remedy depends on a consideration of whether the central concerns of miranda are implicated as well as the objectives of the criminal justice system.for example,the prosecution is still permitted to use statements taken in violation of miranda for impeachment purposes on,see harris new york,d the prosecution may still introduce testimony of a third party whose whereabouts were determined through statements obtained in violation of miranda,see michigan tucker,d and the prosecution may still introduce physical evidence seized as a result of a miranda violation,see patane,d.notably,the court has also declined to apply the fruits doctrine to analyze the admissibility of a subsequent warned confession that followed an earlier violation of miranda.see elstad,d.
all the aforementioned cases recognize that in determining how sweeping the judicially imposed consequences of a failure to administer miranda warnings should be,consideration must be given to the dual goals of miranda the general goal of deterring improper police conduct and the fifth amendment goal of assuring trustworthy evidence.id.at.internal citations and quotations omitted.the unwarned confession taken in violation of miranda must be suppressed,but it does not necessarily follow that every subsequent voluntary statement made by a suspect must be suppressed as well.miranda itself recognized that a ny statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is,of course,admissible in evidence.at.
indeed,elstad recognized that custodial statements made prior to the delivery of miranda warnings do not necessitate exclusion of any subsequent confession.there,the suspect made his first incriminating statement voluntarily,albeit without first being given miranda warnings.he was later advised of his rights,which he waived,and executed a written confession.the court held that a suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite miranda warnings.elstad,at.
we acknowledge that the facts upon which elstad is based differ from those at issue here because unlike the petitioner in elstad,pettigrew was not warned prior to making the challenged confession.nevertheless,we think that elstad underpinnnings control this case.indeed,two of our sister circuits have held that statements made without miranda warnings but not in response to police interrogation are admissible even though they followed an earlier voluntary statement made in violation of miranda.see abdulla,at medeiros,at.both courts relied on elstad conclusion that 
it is an unwarranted extension of miranda to hold that a simple failure to administer the warnings,unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect ability to exercise his free will,so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period t he admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.
at.today we join the seventh and ninth circuits in holding that the admissibility of an unsolicited inculpatory statement,following a voluntary statement made in violation of miranda,turns on whether the inculpatory statement was knowingly and voluntarily made.id.at.in the absence of coercion or improper tactics,a broader rule would undercut the twin rationales of miranda exclusionary rule trustworthiness and deterrence.id.at.
pettigrew suggests,however,that the supreme court recent decisions in patane and seibert,which discuss the fruits doctrine as it applies to miranda violations,require a contrary holding.to this end,pettigrew suggests that the four dissenters in patane who believed that the fruits doctrine may extend to physical evidence obtained from a confession made in violation of miranda,combined with justice kennedy concurrence in provided the crucial fifth vote needed to find that miranda warnings given,in an effort to deliberately undermine miranda itself,failed to render the subsequent confession to favor application of the fruits doctrine to this case.to the contrary,we are convinced that these decisions support,rather than undermine,our holding today.
importantly,the court in seibert recognized that the touchstone of a confession admissibility is whether it is voluntarily given.at.as in elstad,it explicitly declined to apply the fruits doctrine for confessions obtained after miranda warnings were given.id.further,in his concurrence,justice kennedy notes that not every miranda violation requires suppression of the evidence obtained thereafter.rather,e vidence is admissible when the central concerns of miranda are not likely to be implicated and when other objectives of the criminal justice system are best served by its introduction.id.at.kennedy,concurring.as noted above,admission of pettigrew third statement would not likely implicate miranda central into evidence of a criminal defendant compelled the mission of the criminal justice system is best served by its introduction.
voluntariness 
having concluded that the fruits doctrine does not warrant automatic exclusion of pettigrew third statement,we must still determine whether it was voluntarily made.
here,the only possible source of coercion that would have rendered pettigrew third statement involuntary is the psychological impact of having let the cat out of the bag with the prior statements.medeiros,at.this cat out of the bag theory was first recognized by the supreme court in united states bayer.there,the court explained 
a fter an accused has once let the cat out of the bag by confessing,no matter what the inducement,he is never thereafter free of the psychological and practical disadvantages of having confessed.he can never get the cat back in the bag.the secret is out for good.in such a sense,a later confession always may be looked upon as fruit of the first.but this court has never gone so far as to hold that making a confession under circumstances which preclude its use,perpetually disables the confessor from making a usable one after those conditions have been removed.
pettigrew appears to argue that statements made after a miranda violation and before miranda warnings must generally be excluded as inherently coerced.but endowing the psychological effects of voluntary unwarned admissions with constitutional implications would,practically speaking,immunize a suspect from the consequences of any subsequent spontaneous remarks even when the official coercion proscribed by the fifth amendment played no part in either confession.see elstad,at.such immunity would come at at a high cost to legitimate law enforcement activity,while adding little desirable protection to the individual interest in not being compelled to testify against himself.id.at.accordingly,a presumption of compulsion stemming from pettigrew prior admissions is not warranted.
instead,we consider whether pettigrew third admission was voluntary based on a totality of the circumstances.see lopez,at united states perdue,cir admissibility of a subsequent confession depends on whether the coercion surrounding the first statement had been sufficiently dissipated so as to make the second statement voluntary.the question we must resolve is whether the confession is the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker.lopez,at quotations and alterations omitted.if so,it may be used against him.id.if instead his will has been overborne and his capacity for critically impaired,the use of his confession offends due process.id.to answer this question,we examine the surrounding circumstances and the entire course of police conduct.elstad,at.
we conclude that pettigrew third statement was voluntary.he admits that his first two statements were voluntary.with regard to pettigrew first statement,deputy ashcroft merely asked him if he knew what he had done.when pettigrew responded that he wrecked his car,deputy ashcroft told him that he may have hurt someone in the process.pettigrew second statement,though also taken in violation of miranda,did not implicate him as the driver of the vehicle.he merely told an unidentified officer that he had been drinking that night,which was shortly confirmed by the test.he made his third statement a half an hour after his first statement,in a different location,and to a different officer.although he was in custody at the time,he was not handcuffed,and his statement was spontaneous and not in response to any questioning by officer williams.in fact,officer williams never interrogated pettigrew and there is nothing to indicate that the police were attempting to use pettigrew first two statements to obtain another incriminating statement.even considering some lingering psychological effect of his first two statements,based on the totality of the circumstances,we conclude that the third statement was an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker.lopez,at see also elstad,at.stating that the fifth amendment is not concerned with moral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official coercion abdulla,at reaching same conclusion on similar facts medeiros,at same.
as to pettigrew contention that the district court abused its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on his motion to suppress,see united states glass,cir,we conclude that there was no such abuse.an evidentiary hearing may be appropriate when there are material facts in dispute relevant to the motion to suppress,see,but here,the government conceded the facts as related by pettigrew.
photographic evidence 
pettigrew next challenges the display of the family photograph at trial.he argues that the district court admission of the photo was unfairly prejudicial and warrants a new trial.the admission of photographs into evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.united states,cir.t he district judge must balance the prejudicial effect of the photographs against their probative value,an exercise of discretion that is rarely disturbed.id.
a photograph of a victim while living is admissible to prove the identity of the victim.see united states joe,cir.the district court acknowledged that a photo of the victim could stir up sympathy an
