background 
we recount the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,as we are required to do.in the afternoon of october,wicahpe,bissonette,and several others were at wicahpe residence drinking and socializing.at some point,curtis milk,wicahpe father,arrived with petan milk,wicahpe brother.curtis,who was intoxicated,tried to start a fight with bissonette,but was unsuccessful.instead,many of the revelers moved the party away from curtis,reconvening at larry bettelyoun,house.shortly thereafter,curtis also arrived at the house.curtis became hostile again,causing a number of people,including bissonette,to leave and return to their prior venue.curtis and wicahpe remained at bettelyoun,house.
after some time passed,wicahpe returned to his residence.he was visibly upset,and complained that his father was treating him badly while he was at bettelyoun.according to larry bettelyoun,wicahpe face had red marks on it and looked as if he had been assaulted.wicahpe told bissonette that curtis still wanted to fight bissonette,and wicahpe encouraged bissonette to do so.
bissonette then left with jeff curry to confront curtis.bissonette entered bettelyoun,residence and attacked curtis.bissonette,a muscular young man many years curtis junior,beat curtis badly,leaving him bloody and barely conscious.the wounds sustained by curtis were consistent with blows from brass knuckles carried by bissonette.
bissonette then returned to wicahpe residence,and told wicahpe that he had handled that for him.trial tr.vol.i at.this prompted wicahpe and petan to go back to bettelyoun,house.they entered that home to see their father lying in a pool of blood on the floor,gurgling and laboring for breath.when wicahpe saw this,he told his brother petan that they should get those responsible,presumably referring to bissonette.id.at.the two then took bettelyoun,car back to wicahpe residence.
wicahpe then arrived at the house,driving so quickly and recklessly that he rammed the porch of the house and nearly hit a person who was standing outside.he went inside and saw bissonette still there.wicahpe,upset,began questioning bissonette about what had happened to his father.wicahpe picked up a long knife from the counter and broke the telephone.wicahpe and bissonette exchanged words for a short time before petan entered,holding what was described as some type of stick or shaft.at that point,wicahpe,petan,bissonette,and curry began to fight.in the struggle,both bissonette and curry were stabbed by wicahpe and struck by petan.bissonette injuries included two stab wounds,which punctured his lung and his kidney.bissonette also sustained significant head trauma from petan attack.he died later that night.an autopsy attributed the death to the stab wounds with the possibility that the head trauma was a contributing factor.
wicahpe and petan were jointly charged by indictment with committing murder in indian country and aiding and abetting each other to do the same,in violation of,and.both went to trial.at trial,wicahpe primary defense was that of.his theory was that bissonette was known to be very violent when he was drinking,and when it appeared that bissonette was becoming combative,wicahpe felt it necessary to stab him to protect himself.in support of this theory,wicahpe presented evidence that bissonette had attacked someone in a vehicle earlier in the day by opening the vehicle door and then punching and kicking the occupant.testimony also established that bissonette had chased another person,ben long wolf,while trying to fight him.wicahpe evidence also included the fact that bissonette had brutally attacked his father moments before the stabbing,leaving curtis with severe and serious injuries that appeared to be the result of a brass knuckle assault.
in further support of his theory,wicahpe sought to introduce evidence of another assault bissonette had perpetrated years earlier.according to wicahpe,he,bissonette,and mike ten fingers had been playing a card game in.when bissonette lost,he became upset and stabbed ten fingers several times with an instrument resembling an ice pick.the district court did not admit this evidence,however,ruling that its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.in reaching this conclusion,the court reasoned that this assault happened roughly five years before the stabbing,and that in the meantime,bissonette and wicahpe had remained close friends,which suggested wicahpe was not scared of bissonette.moreover,the court held that admitting this evidence might lead to a collateral,confusing the jury.
following a trial,wicahpe was convicted of murder.petan was acquitted of all charges.at sentencing,both parties agreed on the guidelines range of to months.wicahpe moved for a downward departure based on victim conduct.the government informally asked for consideration of an upward departure based on the use of a weapon,and because the guidelines had increased the murder penalty subsequent to this incident.after considering those motions,the presentence report,and statements made at the sentencing hearing,the district court determined that a guidelines sentence was appropriate,based on the factors enumerated in a.wicahpe was sentenced to months in prison,to be followed by three years of supervised release.this appeal followed.
on appeal,wicahpe contends that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on all charges because he acted in.in the alternative,he suggests that the evidence established only that he was guilty of some form of manslaughter,not murder.next,wicahpe argues that it was reversible error to exclude the evidence that bissonette had violently assaulted ten fingers five years earlier because that evidence was essential to wicahpe state of mind.wicahpe also argues that the prosecutor engaged in serious misconduct by knowingly presenting perjured testimony and by making improper remarks in his closing argument and rebuttal.lastly,wicahpe believes that the unique circumstances of his case make a guidelines sentence unreasonable.
sufficiency of the evidence 
in considering whether a motion for judgment of acquittal was properly denied,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the guilty verdict,granting all reasonable inferences that are supported by that evidence.united states cline,cir.although a federal defendant bears the burden of production on the issue of,once that burden is met,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in.united states scout,cir quoting united states alvarez,cir see also united states deon,cir noting that once the issue of is raised,the burden shifts to the government to disprove the theory.
wicahpe agrees that the district court correctly instructed the jury on the issue of.that instruction noted that it was the government burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that wicahpe was not acting in.the court further instructed the jury that was defined as follows 
if a person reasonably believes that force is necessary to protect himself or another person from what he reasonably believes to be unlawful physical harm about to be inflicted by another and uses such force,then he acted in self defense or defense of another person.
however,self defense which involves using force likely to cause death or great bodily harm is justified only if the person reasonably believes that such force is necessary to protect himself or another person from what he reasonably believes to be a substantial risk of death or great bodily harm.
final instruction.
wicahpe theory at trial was that bissonette was volatile and violent when drinking,and that he was forced to arm himself with a knife and stab bissonette to save himself.having reviewed the record,we find substantial evidence presented to the jury that tended to negate the idea that wicahpe acted in.for instance,before leaving his wounded father,wicahpe told his brother petan that they should get bissonette.trial tr.vol.i at.the two then commandeered another person car to return to wicahpe house,driving so erratically that they hit the porch of the house before stopping.wicahpe then entered the house,armed himself with a knife,and verbally confronted bissonette until petan entered with his weapon.thereafter,wicahpe attacked bissonette with the knife,stabbing him twice.from this evidence,the jury could reasonably infer that wicahpe intent was to hurt or kill bissonette to avenge the maltreatment his father suffered.
wicahpe further contends that even if he is not entitled to an outright judgment of acquittal,he is only guilty of some form of manslaughter,not murder.he rests this argument on two bases that he has an imperfect,and the evidence of provocation overwhelmingly rebuts any suggestion that he killed bissonette with malice aforethought.
an imperfect involves the defendant unreasonable use of deadly force to thwart an assault.rinehart brewer,cir.this may be proven by evidence that the defendant unreasonably but truly believed that deadly force was necessary to defend himself,or the defendant inadvertently caused the victim death while defending himself in a criminally negligent manner.see,united states anderson,cir explaining differing theories of imperfect claims united states manuel,cir same see also united states brown,cir recognizing that a defendant may commit involuntary manslaughter if he acts in but is criminally negligent in doing so.a defendant who proves an imperfect does not have the requisite mens rea to be guilty of murder.rinehart,at.the defense does not exonerate the defendant of culpability for a homicide,but justifies only a manslaughter conviction.id.
principally for the reasons stated above,wicahpe has failed to show that he is entitled to an acquittal of murder on his imperfect claim.an imperfect claim is premised on the view that some action was necessary for the defendant to protect himself.but in this case,the evidence,when viewed in the prosecution favor,showed that it was actually wicahpe who initiated the assault with the intention of fighting,hurting,or killing bissonette.this is inconsistent with a claim,be it a perfect or imperfect one.
wicahpe also maintains his innocence on the charge of murder based on provocation.it is well established that if the defendant had enough time between the provocation and the killing to reflect on his or her intended course of action,then the mere fact of passion would not reduce the crime below murder.united states bordeaux,cir quoting collins united states.in this case,the time between wicahpe emotional response to his father injuries and the stabbing mitigates against a viable provocation defense.after seeing his wounded father,wicahpe set out to find bissonette.once wicahpe arrived,he and bissonette spoke before engaging in a fight driving to a different location and then verbally confronting an intended victim for some time before assaulting him is inconsistent with the claim that wicahpe acted impulsively without any.moreover,wicahpe assault did not begin until petan entered the house,holding a weapon.taken together with the evidence that wicahpe was seeking revenge,this supports the inference that wicahpe maintained enough to plan an attack with petan,in which petan would make a delayed entrance while wicahpe stalled.
ii.evidence of bissonette prior bad acts 
wicahpe next contends that the district court committed reversible error by excluding evidence that bissonette had violently stabbed a mutual acquaintance five years earlier.wicahpe attempted to introduce this evidence under federal rule of evidence b,as relevant to wicahpe state of mind for.the government contends that the evidence is inadmissible as a specific instance of conduct.we review the district court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.united states waloke,cir.
rule a permits inquiry into a victim character,and rule b allows that proof to come by way of specific instances of prior conduct i n cases in which character or a trait of character is an essential element of a charge,claim,or defense.emphasis added.in waloke,this court recognized that in a case,evidence of the victim violent character,as proven through specific prior acts,may be admissible.waloke,at.we affirmed the exclusion of such evidence in waloke because the district court was within its discretion to prohibit the evidence under rule.id.thus,the government contention that evidence of a victim prior bad acts are never admissible is incorrect.
the question remains,however,whether the evidence was properly excluded pursuant to rule.the district court engaged in an explicit analysis of whether to admit this prior assault evidence.it first determined that there was a significant risk of a on the assault,since there was no prior conviction,and the only witnesses were wicahpe and the victim.the court also viewed the probative value of the evidence as weak,since the defendant wanted to use the assault by bissonette,someone with whom he had remained close friends,to show that he feared bissonette on the day of the stabbing.thus,the court refused to admit this evidence.
we find waloke to be instructive in this case.there,the defendant assaulted someone after a day of drinking.the defendant sought to introduce evidence that his victim had engaged in prior acts of violence.the district court refused the evidence because of concern that it would trigger collateral mini trials on the bad acts.id.at.instead,the court permitted the defendant to present evidence that the defendant had a reputation for violence,without reference to specific acts.noting that the district court has wide discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence,our court found no abuse of that discretion in excluding the prior act evidence.id.
similarly here,the district court refused to allow evidence of a specific violent act,but permitted evidence related to the victim reputation for aggression and violence.moreover,there were concerns about the temporal proximity of the prior assault,which occurred five years earlier.as the district court noted,its probative value on the issue of wicahpe fearful state of mind was minimal,considering that he and bissonette had remained friends during the time between the assault on ten fingers and the stabbing.further,the defense presented evidence that bissonette had engaged in two assaults on the very day of the stabbing,one of which was the brutal,violent attack on wicahpe father moments earlier.we question whether stale evidence of an adolescent assault would be anything more than cumulative considering the evidence that was actually admitted.thus,we find no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of the assault evidence.
iii.claims of prosecutorial misconduct 
presentation of false testimony 
wicahpe first asserts that the government knowingly presented perjured testimony.the prosecution may not solicit perjured testimony to secure a conviction or allow testimony that it knows is false to remain uncorrected.united states martin,cir.to establish a constitutional violation arising from the use of false testimony,the testimony must have been perjured,the government must have known it was,and there must have been a reasonable likelihood that the perjured testimony affected the jury determinations.united states boone,cir citing martin,at.
wicahpe directs us to three instances in which,according to him,the government presented diametrically opposed testimony on several material facts.def.br.at.first,he states that while some witnesses said that wicahpe looked and talked like he had been beat up by curtis,larry bettelyoun,testified that no had fight transpired between wicahpe and his father.next,wicahpe contends somebody must have lied about bissonette assault on curtis,because curry testified there was a fight,while bettel
