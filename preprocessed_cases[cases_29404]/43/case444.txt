dion lamy appeals his jury conviction on three counts of aggravated sexual abuse in indian country in violation of,and b.lamy contends that the district court improperly admitted a statement he gave to fbi agents that the court abused its discretion in denying a motion for new trial based on prejudicial comments by a government witness and that the united states failed to prove that lamy crime occurred in indian country,an element of his crimes of conviction.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm.
lamy,a member of the zuni tribe,was indicted for a sexual assault that occurred in june,after a high school graduation party in zuni,new mexico.lamy,years old at the time of the assault,left the party with four other men aaron cheama,donovan jones neha,marcus tsethlakai,and daryl dickson.accompanying the men were two young women,a acquaintance,and kathy,dickson girlfriend.was drunk and under the influence of both cocaine and marijuana.lamy,who had not been drinking,drove the group to the home of sherry shebola.when they arrived,some members of the group carried inside,and placed her on a couch where she passed out.at trial,denied any memory of events at the shebola house until she awoke the next morning.
cheama and tsethlakai were able to testify as to what occurred while was unconscious.we have carefully reviewed this testimony and see no useful purpose in exploring the sordid details.briefly,cheama testified that lamy penetrated the victim vagina with an object both witnesses testified that lamy beat the victim while neha engaged in sexual intercourse with her and tsethlakai testified that he saw lamy engage in sexual intercourse with her the following morning,while she remained unconscious.
when awoke the following day,each of the five men save neha were gone.shebola remained in the house and communicated certain events to that led to conclude that she had been raped.a brief conversation between and neha followed.after an altercation with shebola and yet another woman,ran from the house to a nearby hospital.a hospital aide transported to her home.immediately told her family of her suspicions,leading her mother to refer the matter to police and return her daughter to the hospital.at the hospital,a test for sexual trauma was administered.
on july,fbi agents marcus mccaskill and steve chambers interviewed lamy twice in connection with these events.mccaskill knew lamy,having spoken with him on two prior occasions in the process of investigating unrelated crimes.mccaskill and chambers began the first july interview shortly before in the living room of the house where lamy lived with his mother.before questioning lamy,the agents presented a form that contained a waiver of miranda rights.mccaskill testified that the agents also orally explained lamy rights to him,although the agents did not read the form verbatim.they told lamy that he was not in custody and that they did not intend to arrest him.lamy signed the form.during the ensuing interview,lamy admitted that he penetrated the victim with an object,but he denied engaging in sexual intercourse with her.he committed this statement to writing.
after interviewing neha,dickson,cheama,and tsethlakai,the agents returned to lamy home.lamy agreed to accompany the agents outdoors,and sat in the front passenger seat of the agents parked vehicle as they questioned him.the agents did not further advise lamy of his rights on this occasion.
based on what they had learned from the intervening interviews,the agents asked lamy specific questions about his role in the events.lamy admitted to beating the victim and having sexual intercourse with her.lamy then wrote and signed a second statement,stating 
i dion lamy is goind to tall you the truth about wunt happed to that girl at frist i did not tall all the truth becouse i was cared to tall but the thing i did was sbaeet her wath by baet and have six wath her brent her har and touch her parvant part that is obout all the thing i did to her i am so sorry 
on august,lamy,neha,and cheama were indicted for assault and sexual assault.tsethlakai and dickson were juveniles at the time of the crime and were indicted separately.in return for a lesser charge,cheama cooperated with the government,leaving lamy and neha as the sole defendants in a superceding indictment filed on february.
both were tried in a consolidated trial.four of seven counts in the indictment were dismissed,and the three remaining counts were sent to the jury counts one and two alleged that both lamy and neha committed a sexual act with an unconscious victim,and that each aided and abetted the other,in violation of,and b.count three alleged that lamy penetrated the victim vagina with an object and neha aided and abetted him in doing so,in violation of,and b.these incidents were alleged to have occurred in indian country,making them federal crimes under the indian major crimes act.see a.
before trial,lamy moved to suppress his oral and written statements on the ground that they were involuntary.during the ensuing suppression hearing,an expert witness who had examined lamy testified that lamy was easily confused and inclined to acquiesce to others conclusions.according to the expert,lamy read at a level,ranked in the lowest percentile of his age group in reading comprehension,and was functionally illiterate.the expert concluded that lamy,an f student who dropped out of school after the eighth grade,was not mentally retarded,but that his ability to integrate information was at the retarded level.
at the hearing,agent mccaskill testified that lamy appeared to understand him at all times,and that they had no communication problems.mccaskill was unaware that lamy was a poor student.lamy mother testified that she was present in the house during the first interview.she heard no inappropriate noise,such as raised voices.she also confirmed that lamy did not appear to have been crying after his return from the second interview.
on the testimony recounted above,the district court denied the suppression motion and a later motion for reconsideration.the case proceeded to trial,at which typewritten transcripts of both written statements,as well as testimony about lamy oral admissions,were admitted into evidence.
on close of trial,both lamy and neha were convicted of the three counts.lamy sought a new trial under federal rule of criminal procedure based on the admission of his oral and written statements and on several prejudicial statements volunteered by mccaskill during his trial testimony.lamy also moved for a judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure,alleging that the government failed to prove an element of the crime,namely,that it occurred in indian country.the court denied both motions.lamy appeals.
lamy contends that the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress the written and oral statements that he made during the two interviews.he contends that his limited cognitive capabilities prevented him from giving truly voluntary statements,and that the admission of these statements accordingly violated his due process rights.lamy also argues that he was unable to intelligently waive his legal rights,and thus the agents questioning violated miranda arizona,d.
in considering the denial of a suppression motion,we review factual findings for clear error,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.united states thompson,cir.because lamy has not provided a transcript of mccaskill or his mother testimony at the suppression hearing,we necessarily accept the district court factual findings and credibility determinations on point.see fed.b united states,cir.legal determinations,including whether a statement was voluntary and whether a defendant was in custody,are reviewed de novo united states nguyen,cir voluntariness united states erving,cir custody.
we begin by considering lamy due process argument.a statement is involuntary in violation of due process if a defendant will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding his confession.dickerson united states,d quotation omitted.though relevant,a defendant mere subjective lack of understanding or volition does not give rise to a constitutional violation.c oercive police activity is a necessary predicate to a constitutionally involuntary confession.colorado connelly,d.accordingly,our ultimate inquiry is whether the officers took unfair advantage of the defendant traits or the surrounding circumstances.united states guerro,cir.factors relevant to this determination include 
the age,intelligence,and education of the defendant the length of detention the length and nature of the questioning whether the defendant was advised of his constitutional rights and whether the defendant was subjected to physical punishment.
united states toles,cir citation omitted.
focusing on the first factor,lamy directs us to his lack of intelligence and education.expert testimony at his suppression hearing indicated that he was functionally illiterate,reading at a level,that he flunked out of school after the eighth grade,and that he was psychologically inclined to acquiesce to authority figures.on the other hand,mccaskill testified that he had no difficulty communicating with lamy throughout the two interviews and that lamy appeared to understand what was happening.moreover,the fact that lamy had been interviewed by mccaskill previously indicates that lamy had some experience with,and understanding of,police questioning.see id.in sum,although the record reveals that lamy intelligence is below average,it also shows that he was capable of understanding the agents questions and assessing the risks of answering or declining to answer those questions.
as for the remaining factors,lamy first interview with the agents was conducted in the kitchen of his home and lasted less than an hour.his mother was in the house throughout the entirety of the interview and occasionally entered the living area where the interview was taking place.the officers never raised their voices.lamy alleges no physical punishment,nor any coercive conduct by the agents during this interview.the short length of detention and questioning,nonthreatening nature of questioning,and lack of any physical punishment all indicate that lamy statements were not coerced.
considering the fourth factor,the agents advised lamy of his constitutional rights immediately before the first interview began.they did not merely hand lamy a written statement of his rights mccaskill explained lamy rights to him orally before lamy signed the waiver form.the officers also told lamy explicitly that he was not in custody and that they did not intend to arrest him.we perceive no aspect of this interview which indicates that the agents took unfair advantage of lamy traits or coerced his statements.guerro,at.we conclude that the district court correctly rejected lamy due process argument regarding the first interview.
similarly,the facts surrounding the second interview show no indication that the agents overwhelmed lamy will.lamy points to one feature of the questioning which he considers coercive he was questioned in the officers vehicle however,lamy was not taken to the vehicle by force he agreed to accompany the agents and answer additional questions.lamy mother noticed no untoward behavior on his part upon his return.although the agents did not read lamy his rights a second time before the brief afternoon interview,he had been adequately advised several hours earlier,and mccaskill informed lamy before the afternoon interview that the things that we told him before were the same.
considering the totality of the circumstances,we agree with the district court that lamy written and oral statements in this interview were not improperly adduced.accordingly,denial of lamy suppression motion on due process grounds stands.
in the alternative,lamy argues that the agents questioning violated miranda arizona,because he was incapable of waiving his fifth amendment rights due to his low intelligence.miranda protections,however,apply only when an individual is subjected to custodial interrogation.united states hudson,cir.given our conclusion that lamy was not in custody,the premise of the argument fails.
our decision that lamy was not in custody for miranda purposes flows from our seminal inquiry whether a reasonable person in lamy position would have understood his freedom of action to have been restricted to a degree consistent with formal arrest.united states revels,cir.the standard is an objective one unlike the due process inquiry,particular characteristics of the defendant are relevant only to the extent that they may have been known to the officer and influenced his conduct.united states little,cir en banc quotation omitted.in conducting this inquiry,relevant factors include whether the circumstances demonstrated a atmosphere whether the nature and length of the officers questioning was accusatory or coercive and whether the police made lamy aware that he was free to refrain from answering questions,or to otherwise end the interview.revels,at.
lamy initial interview was conducted by two officers in a common area of his home,during which his mother came and went from the room.under our precedents,this does not constitute a atmosphere.see erving,at holding that an adolescent suspect interviewed by plainclothes officers in his living room with his parents present was not in custody revels,at holding that questioning in a defendant home was custodial when seven officers entered forcibly,handcuffed the occupants,and questioned the defendant in a rear bedroom.as for the nature or length of questioning,the interview lasted for about an hour and,as noted,there was no indication that the questioning was unusually confrontational.the agents informed lamy that he did not have to answer questions and that he could terminate the interview at any time.in these circumstances,a reasonable person in lamy position would hardly have felt the requisite level of constraint.
the second interview took place in the agents car,which was parked outside lamy house,and lamy sat in the front passenger seat of the vehicle.although the vehicle belonged to the agents,location alone does not compel the conclusion that a defendant is in custody,so long as his freedom was not curtailed to a degree similar to arrest.see,california beheler,d miranda warnings are not required simply because the questioning takes place in the station house quotation omitted united states boucher,cir miranda warnings are not imposed because the questioning is conducted in a certain place,a patrol car.in this case,lamy was asked,not ordered,to accompany the agents to the vehicle.he did so of his own volition.this voluntary decision to accompany police argues against police domination.beheler,at.holding that a stationhouse interrogation was noncustodial where the suspect voluntarily agreed to accompany police to the stationhouse,although the police specifically told him that he was not under arrest.moreover,the record does not suggest that lamy was ever handcuffed,and his position in the passenger seat of the vehicle suggests a lack of arrest.see united states plumman,cir holding that a suspect was not in custody during questioning in an fbi agent vehicle where he was seated in the front seat and informed that he would not be arrested united states scheets,cir holding that a suspect was not in custody while he sat in the front seat of a police car.united states henley,cir it is fair to say that someone who is being questioned by an fbi agent while sitting handcuffed in the back of a police car is,indeed,not free to leave.emphasis added.
the second and third factors identified above also indicate that the afternoon questioning was noncustodial.nothing in the record indicates that the agents threatened or aggressively questioned lamy during the interview.at the beginning of the interview,the agents reiterated to lamy that he would not be arrested that day regardless of how he answered their questions,and told him that the warnings he had been given that morning remained in effect.thus,lamy remained aware that he was free to leave or refuse to answer questions.based on the totality of the circumstances,we conclude that lamy freedom of action was not curtailed to a degree similar to formal arrest,and thu
