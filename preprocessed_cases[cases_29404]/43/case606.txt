after a combined hearing in may welf,the juvenile court found that minors abbigail born in and justin born in were subject to its jurisdiction the bases for which are not pertinent to this appeal.it placed the minors in the custody of their maternal grandmother.at a prehearing status conference,it directed the sacramento county department of health and human services dhhs to take active efforts to enroll the minors in the tribe of their paternal and the cherokee nation of oklahoma,which had stated the minors were not members but were eligible for membership even though the minors biological and presumed father joseph was not yet enrolled as a tribe member.
the basis for this directive was the provision in both rule c and rule c of the california rules of court that includes this duty among the active efforts an agency must make on behalf of minors who are eligible for tribal membership but who are not indian children as defined in the federal indian child welfare act icwa and state law the definition of indian children in the icwa and state law requires that minors be either a members of a tribe themselves or b biological children of members of a tribe and eligible for tribal membership.welf,subd.a the icwa definition of indian child will apply under state law hereafter a.
dhhs appeals challenging the validity of the two rules on various grounds.it contends federal law preempts the extension of services in the two rules to minors who are not indian children under the icwa the rules are inconsistent with the definition of indian children entitled to icwa protections under section a and the rules are also inconsistent with the active efforts required under section.it is sufficient for us to agree with dhhs on its second point these two rules are inconsistent with the legislative definition of the class of protected indian children,and therefore the judicial council lacked authority to expand the definition.accordingly,we do not need to reach the other two claims of dhhs or the associated arguments.we will reverse the judgment with directions to enter a new judgment that does not provide the minors with any of the protections for an indian child under icwa or state law,until such time that joseph or the minors have in fact become enrolled members of the cherokee nation of oklahoma.
factual and procedural background 
in light of the issue on appeal,there is only a limited amount of background we need to add to the introduction.in march,mother jamie had agreed to informal supervision from dhhs.in august,she signed authorization for her mother to be the voluntary caretaker of the minors.dhhs filed the instant petitions in december.
at the initial hearing,jamie disclaimed any indian heritage and stated her belief that joseph did not have any indian heritage as well.however,the father appeared at a january status conference,where he informed the court that he believed he was the biological father of the minors and his maternal grandmother was an indian he provided the name and address of his maternal aunt,who was a registered member of the tribe and kept track of the family tree,as a person who was better informed on the issue.the juvenile court determined at this time that joseph was the biological and presumed father of the minors.
the cherokee nation of oklahoma sent a letter to dhhs in late january that confirmed the minors were descendants of tribal members joseph maternal grandmother his mother,unlike his aunt,had never enrolled and eligible for tribal membership,but neither the minors nor joseph were enrolled members the cherokee nation declined to intervene in the proceedings unless joseph or the minors completed the application forms that it had enclosed.the tribe also recommended the application of icwa protections to the minors from the outset of the proceedings in order to avoid any delays if joseph or the minors became enrolled members.
on the basis of this letter,dhhs argued at the february status conference that the juvenile court should not apply icwa protections because the minors were not indian children.counsel for joseph stated that he intended to apply for tribal membership.the juvenile court expressed its intent to treat the minors as if they were indian children in order to prevent relitigation in the event they or their father were to become tribal members,inviting dhhs to file a reconsideration brief as to whether the juvenile court was precluded as a matter of law from proceeding in this manner.shortly afterward,the cherokee nation of oklahoma sent a followup letter noting that it had not received any completed application forms and enclosing new ones.
at the march status conference,the juvenile court directed counsel to make reasonable efforts to enroll joseph and the minors in the tribe.dhhs noted that in an abundance of caution it was scheduling an indian tribal expert for the combined hearing in the event it was necessary.the juvenile court then continued the proceedings.
at the april status conference,the juvenile court concluded it was required to treat the eligible minors as indian children under rules c and c and denied dhhs motion for reconsideration.it therefore directed dhhs to take active efforts to enroll the minors,authorizing it to release their birth certificates to the tribe as part of the application process.joseph noted that he had sent the necessary documents to the tribe for his own enrollment and was awaiting his enrollment number.
at the may combined hearing,joseph noted at the outset that his tribal application was stalled because the tribe wanted a copy of his mother birth certificate rather than the one he had submitted,and because an update to the tribe registration system had prevented access for six weeks.the juvenile court then received testimony from an icwa expert who noted the tribe would not act on the membership applications of the minors until joseph was enrolled.the court sustained the allegations of the petitions it also made findings pursuant to the icwa by clear and convincing evidence incorporating the indian expert testimony that continued parental custody of the minors would likely result in serious emotional or physical damage,subd.c,that reasonable efforts had been made to prevent the breakup of an indian family,subd.d,subd.a,and that the placement of the minors met the preferences of icwa.the court set six and month review hearings,subds.e f for november and february

the interpretation of statutes and court rules is a question of law that we review de novo.mercury interactive klein th,california court reporters judicial council of california th,court reporters.
under our state charter,the judicial council is authorized to adopt rules of court that are not inconsistent with statute.cal,art vi,subd.d.a rule of court inconsistent with legislative intent is invalid even absent an express legislative prohibition on the promulgation of a rule on the subject,and a rule can also be inconsistent even though it can operate harmoniously with a statute.court reporters,supra,th at,rejecting judicial council claims to the contrary id.at judicial council rulemaking authority subordinate to legislature accord,in re robin cal d,sara superior court cal th,courts not bound by judicial council interpretation of statute.

icwa is very specific in limiting the definition of indian child to children who are tribal members or are children of tribal members,and this was not an inadvertent definitional choice.the legislative history of the icwa shows that congress considered,but ultimately rejected,an expansive definition of indian child a n earlier draft of the icwa did not define indian child,but rather defined indian as any pe
