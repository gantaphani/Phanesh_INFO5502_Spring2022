two appeals have been taken from a judgment that granted a petition brought pursuant to probate code section section,to declare two minors,emma and noreen,free from care,custody,and control of their biological mother and father,raymond and jamie,and granted the parents visitation rights the parents claim in their appeal that section is impermissibly vague and violates due process.they also argue that the minors were denied right to counsel in the case,an investigator report was not properly submitted,the evidence fails to support the termination of their parental rights,and the court failed to comply with the indian child welfare act of icwa et.the guardians of the minors,juliana and ronald,who filed the petition,have also appealed from the court visitation order,in which they claim that the visitation rights granted to the parents was beyond the authority of the trial court and an abuse of the court discretion.
we find that section does not have any constitutional infirmities,no denial of the right to counsel occurred,any deficiencies in the investigator report were not prejudicial to the parents,and the evidence amply supports the termination of parental rights.we conclude that we must make a limited remand of the case to the trial court to comply with the inquiry provisions of the icwa.we also conclude that the order granting visitation rights to the parents must be reversed as in excess of the trial court authority.
statement of facts and procedural history 
the minor emma was born in may of her sister noreen was born in may of.jamie is the biological mother of the minors.raymond and jamie were married in,and he is the presumed father of the minors,although his paternity of emma has not been established.at the request of jamie,in august of the minors began temporarily residing with petitioners ronald and juliana,their maternal uncle and aunt.jamie was seeking treatment for a chronic substance abuse problem,and her relationship with raymond was volatile,physically abusive,and intermittent raymond also has a history of drug and alcohol addiction.in september of,again with the approval of jamie,petitioners were appointed the legal guardians of the minors 
within a month,the guardianship became a contentious matter between jamie and petitioners,and has remained so.in october of,jamie filed a petition to terminate the guardianship based on accusations against petitioners that were not substantiated the petition was denied.subsequent petitions filed by jamie to terminate the guardianship were also denied.jamie continued to engage in visitation with the minors,but did not follow through with drug and alcohol rehabilitation efforts.
in april of,petitioners filed a motion to terminate visitation by the parents based upon an accusation made by emma that she was sexually molested by raymond during an overnight visit with jamie.the accusation was not prosecuted due to emma young age and lack of physical evidence of abuse,but raymond was arrested on unrelated outstanding warrants and taken to nevada,where he was subsequently incarcerated in state prison until september of.on april,unsupervised visitation with the minors was suspended pending an investigation.in may of,juliana obtained a restraining order that compelled raymond to stay away from her residence and prohibited him from any contact with emma or noreen raymond has neither had any contact with the minors nor sought visitation with them since april of.
by august of,jamie unsupervised visitation with the minors was increased.her drug tests were negative and she was attending domestic violence classes.in february and august of,at the request of counsel for the minors the court further expanded jamie visitation rights to include a portion of six days a week and three overnight stays per week,or a timeshare with the guardians of between and percent.jamie was directed to complete a parenting class prior to filing for termination of the guardianship.the minors counsel recommended termination of the guardianship in february of.
by march of,however,emma was diagnosed with an adjustment disorder caused by the visitation arrangement that resulted in frequent transitions between the homes of the guardians and jamie.the guardians also accused jamie of at least one instance of alcohol and drug on a report from the father of one of jamie older children not involved in these proceedings although jamie denied any relapse into illegal drug use,and a drug test was negative.
jennifer emerson,a registered therapist with the early childhood mental health program,was appointed by the court to evaluate the minors and provide family therapy.she observed that on several occasions jamie suffered injuries that included a black eye and serious abrasions or bruises on her arms.emerson suspected from jamie evasive answers to inquiries about the source of the injuries that jamie was being abused by her boyfriend scott armas.then in august of,emma reported to emerson that during overnight visitation the minors repeatedly witnessed acts of physical abuse committed upon jamie by her boyfriend.both emma and noreen stated that they periodically observed jamie and armas hitting each other,which frightened and upset them.when emerson confronted jamie with the issue of domestic violence in the home that had been witnessed by the minors,jamie became very angry and asked emerson to leave,although she did acknowledge to emerson that some incidents of violence in the home had occurred.
also in august of,emerson and juliana observed bruises on emma lower left side that were in the shape of a belt or waistband.emma claimed that after she hit her mother jamie struck her really hard.jamie at first denied that emma injury occurred as a result of infliction of physical abuse.she subsequently acknowledged that she hit emma back in anger after emma hit her,and expressed that she was justified in doing it.
a child protective services cps investigation was commenced,jamie petition for termination of the guardianship was denied,and unsupervised visitation was suspended pending completion of the investigation.emerson advised cps that unsupervised visits by jamie with the children were no longer appropriate,and cps agreed.joseph bongiovanni was assigned to conduct the cps guardianship investigation of the welfare of the minors.he described the minors as normal,well adjusted and happy in the home of the guardians.bongiovanni,concluded in his investigative narrative that jamie was not committing ongoing abuse,but he found a s ubstantial risk to the children in the mother home due to the domestic violence between her and armas.according to bongiovanni,no foundation existed for cps to file a dependency petition.he also thought the children were adequately protected by the existing guardianship and the ability of the probate court to intercede on behalf of the children.
on september,by stipulation the unsupervised visits with the minors by jamie as specified in prior visitation orders were suspended in favor of supervised visitation only,twice a week for two hours per visit.following the stipulated supervised visitation order,jamie visited with the minors only four times.jamie ended her relationship with armas in september of.
the present petition to terminate the objectors parental rights was filed by the guardians on january.after the petition was filed,jamie left a succession of harassing,threatening and somewhat irrational telephone messages to petitioners in april of,in which she implored juliana to abandon the proceedings.tape recordings of these messages were played during the hearing before the trial court.on april,jamie was observed by juliana pacing outside the guardians home.thereafter,juliana obtained a restraining order against jamie.
trial on the petition was held in june of.juliana testified that she and ronald decided to file the petition due to the dramatic improvement in emma symptoms of anxiety after unsupervised visitation with jamie was terminated,the lack of progress made by jamie,and the detriment to the children from the instability caused by the continued guardianship.juliana indicated that she and ronald brought the petition for termination of parental rights to relieve the minors anxiety and instability that has occurred with the long,protracted and bitterly contested guardianship.she testified that the prolonged guardianship and associated confusion is hurting the children.according to juliana,the objective of the petitioners is to adopt the children upon the termination of parental rights.juliana agreed that the minors have an attachment to their mother and want to visit her,but testified that their primary need is to reach an end to the litigation and obtain a stable,permanent home through adoption.
rose parson,a court investigator for the contra costa county superior court,testified that in february of she was assigned by the court to investigate the guardianship and submit a report.she reviewed the guardianship file,including the letters and reports from jennifer emerson,and visited the home of the guardians on march,where she interviewed them and the minors.parson found that the minors and the guardians have a loving relationship.emma disclosed to parson that she likes living with the petitioners,but also likes staying at her mother home.when asked by parson about staying at her mother home noreen responded,it dangerous.
in february of,parson also unsuccessfully attempted to contact and interview jamie,both by sending her letters by certified mail to two purported addresses for her,and repeatedly calling a telephone number provided by the guardians parson was not able to interview either jamie or raymond,and did not observe jamie interact with the minors.according to the investigative report filed by parson in march of and her testimony at trial,petitioners home is the only stable home environment the minors have known since august of.parson found that petitioners made a compelling argument why it is in the minors best interest to terminate parental rights at this time,but deferred offering a formal recommendation and suggested in her report that the court not rule on the petition until after a hearing.parson also testified that if she was aware of the recommendation of emerson to terminate parental rights,she would probably be inclined to make the same recommendation to the court.parson was by counsel for the parents.
emerson testified at trial that in march of she diagnosed emma with adjustment disorder with mixed aggression and anxiety.she thereafter began to provide counseling services to the minors and jamie.emerson found in her assessment of the minors that they particularly suffered during transitions between the homes of the guardians and jamie.emma demonstrated a pronounced increase in symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorder immediately following visits with jamie.emerson testified that although emma loves jamie and wants to continue to see her,she exhibited a tremendous amount of relief and an extensive improvement in her functioning when away from her mother.emerson concluded that emma would face significant risk to her social,emotional,behavioral,and intellectual development if she were returned to her mother.the risks associated with insecure or disorganized attachment such as characterized by the relationship of the minors with their mother range from mild social,emotional,and behavioral impairment to more serious problems such as substance abuse,mental illness,delinquency and domestic violence.according to emerson,the minors are confused and anxious about where they are going to be living.emerson offered the firm opinion that termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the minors to provide them with the necessary stable and secure home.
jamie testified that she has not used alcohol or illegal drugs since april of.she has been tested often for drugs or alcohol,and has not been advised of any positive test results.jamie admitted that for the last two years she has been addicted to vicodin,which she began taking for pain in her hands and arms.her doctor is attempting to wean her off vicodin by prescribing lower doses of the drug for her.jamie described her most recent visits with the minors as happy and loving.her goal is to terminate the guardianship and reunify with the minors.
following the trial,the court found in a commendably thorough and extensive statement of decision that clear and convincing evidence supports the presumption that parents are now unfit to properly care for the minors and that it would be detrimental to the minors not to terminate parental rights.the court further found by clear and convincing evidence that the minors will benefit from adoption by the guardians,and their best interests will be achieved by termination of parental rights.the court therefore ordered the termination of parental rights of both jamie and raymond pursuant to section,but granted supervised visitation to them.the parents have appealed from the judgment terminating their parental rights the guardians have separately appealed from the order granting the parents visitation.
discussion 
the appeals of the parentsi.the due process challenge to section.
ii.the vagueness challenge to section.
we turn our attention to jamie complaint that section is impermissibly vague she specifically challenges the physical custody prong of the statute,which she contends fails to give a parent adequate notice as to what actions he or she must take to avoid the termination of his or her parental rights.jamie maintains that the physical custody element of section is not further defined or detailed in the statute,and may be subject to various interpretations.she points out that the term physical custody may have a wide range of meanings,from sole custody to any custody by the guardians,which is not clarified in the legislative history of the statute or by reference to other sources.jamie argues that without any definitive knowledge of the scope of the statute,she could not have properly evaluated the consequences of agreeing to a general guardianship with petitioners.she therefore claims that section did not afford her with fair warning or adequate notice of the conduct which might subject her to deprivation of her fundamental parental rights,in violation of the tenets of substantive due process.
it is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions and requirements are not clearly defined.mason office of admin.hearings th,d.under the federal constitution,xiv and the california constitution cal,art.i,substantive due process of law in the context of vagueness requires two elements a statute must be definite enough to provide a standard of conduct for those whose activities are proscribed and a standard or guide against which conduct can be uniformly judged by courts.kolender lawson,d.walker superior court cal d,people truong th,d.
t he underpinning of a vagueness challenge is the due process concept of fair warning.in re sheena cal th,d.the doctrine reflects the principle that a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application,violates the first essential of due process of law.citation.the requirement that government articulate its aims with a reasonable degree of clarity ensures that state power will be exercised only on behalf of policies reflecting an authoritative choice among competing social values,reduces the danger of caprice and discrimination in the administration of the laws,enables individuals to conform their conduct to the requirements of law,and permits meaningful judicial review.citation.citation.people ex rel.brown imergent,th,d.a statute must be definite enough to provide a standard of conduct for those whose activities are proscribed as well as a standard for the ascertainment of guilt by the courts called upon to apply it.citations.citations.however,a statute is not vague if,as here,any reasonable and practical construction can be given to its language.reasonable certainty is all that is required.citations.citations.citation.american liberty bail bonds,garamendi th,d.
the supreme court has articulated two guiding principles for evaluating vagueness claims.the first principle is derived from the concrete necessity that abstract legal commands must be applied in a specific context.a contextual application of otherwise unqualified legal language may supply the clue to a law meaning,giving facially standardless language a constitutionally sufficient concreteness.indeed,in evaluating challenges based on claims of vagueness,the united states supreme court has said t he particular context is all important.citation.citation.such context,our high court has observed,properly includes the purpose or objectives that the challenged law was designed to serve.citations.the second guiding principle is the notion of reasonable specificity citation or r easonable certainty.citations.f ew words possess the precision of mathematical symbols,most statutes must deal with untold and unforeseen variations in factual situations,and the practical necessities of discharging the business of government inevitably limit the specificity with which legislators can spell out prohibitions.consequently,no more than a reasonable degree of certainty can be demanded.nor is it unfair to require that one who deliberately goes perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct shall take the risk that he may cross the line.citation.citation.amaral cintas.th,d,italics omitted d.finally,a ll presumptions and intendments favor the validity of a statute citation.ortiz lyon management group,th,d.
subdivision a of section provides that if,as in the present case,a guardianship is in place,a proceeding to terminate parental rights may be brought if three requirements are met o ne or both parents do not have the legal custody of the child,the child has been in the physical custody of the guardian for a period of not less than two years,and the child will benefit from being adopted by his or her guardian.italics added.while the physical custody requirement is not more specifically defined or elucidated in section,the statute does not for that reason fail to meet substantive due process standards.the concept of physical custody is not one that is incapable of understanding by persons of common intelligence or eludes meaningful judicial review.to the contrary,by referencing common meaning and preexisting law,the term physical custody is readily understood.when the words used in a statute are not precisely defined,the requisite standards of certainty can be fleshed out from otherwise vague statutory language by reference to any of the following sources long established or commonly accepted usage usage at common law judicial interpretations of the statutory language or of similar language and legislative history or purpose.citation.additionally,we presume that t he enacting body is deemed to be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is enacted.citation.in particular,when the legislature uses a word that has been construed judicially,we can presume the word was intended in the sense placed on it by the courts.zilog,superior court th,d.
we need neither resort to an examination of the legislative history of probate code section nor reform the statute to determine that the term physical custody is not vague while jamie suggests that physical custody may have a range of meanings from any,to significant,or even primary custody,those terms have no established legal meaning.see in re marriage of richardson th,d,fn.d in re marriage of lasich th,d in re marriage of biallas th,d brody kroll th,d.the was in effect when probate code section was two distinct forms of physical custody,both of which are clearly defined sole or joint physical custody.in re marriage of richardson,supra,at,fn,d.sole physical custody means that the child resides with and is supervised by one parent,subject to visitation by the other.ruisi thieriot th,d,fn.d.according to family code section,joint physical custody means that each of the parents shall have significant periods of physical custody.joint physical custody shall be shared by the parents in such a way so as to assure a child of frequent and continuing contact with both parents,subject to sections and.see also niko foreman th,d,fn.d.a court may be required to look at the existing de facto arrangement between the parties to decide whether physical custody is joint or one parent has sole physical custody with visitation rights accorded the other parent,but those,and only those,forms of physical custody are recognized.people mehaisin th,d in re marriage of biallas,supra,at,d.
a statute is not vague if it may be made reasonably certain by reference to other definable sources.state bd.of equalization wirick th,d.we conclude that the term physical custody in section grants adequate notice of its meaning and is rendered reasonably certain by reference to other statutory provisions and judicial decisions that define joint and sole physical custody.we further conclude that as so defined,petitioners proved the physical custody element of section by clear and convincing evidence that they had either joint or sole custody of the minors at all times during the past four years of the guardianship.the statute is not void for vagueness.
iii.the minors right to counsel.
raymond argues that the failure of the trial court to appoint counsel for the children until the commencement of trial was error.the record shows that after the guardianship was initiated attorney leigh johnson was appointed counsel for the children in june of.johnson thereafter continued to represent the minors intermittently during the guardianship proceedings.she sought increased visitation by jamie in,and on behalf of the minors recommended termination of the guardianship in february of.after the petition to terminate parental rights was filed,on march,jamie requested appointment of counsel for the minors.at a hearing six days later,the court appointed counsel for jamie and raymond,but withheld appointment of counsel for the minors.trial on the petition was continued while the parties engaged in mediation and discussed settlement,but when the case was called for trial on june,johnson appeared for the minors.she offered an opening statement at the commencement of trial and thereafter represented the minors throughout the proceedings.raymond argues that according to the statutory scheme the trial court was required to consider appointment of counsel for the minors,and under the facts of the case the failure to appoint independent counsel for the children until the very morning of a contested trial on whether the court should terminate parental rights,was error,and prejudicial.
petitioners maintain that raymond lacks standing to complain of the failure of the trial court to appoint counsel to represent the minors.they rely on the general principle that while an aggrieved party in an action may file a notice of appeal,the ability to appeal does not confer standing to assert issues when he is not aggrieved by the order from which the appeal is taken.citations.standing to challenge an adverse ruling is not established merely because a parent takes a position on an issue that affects the minor citation nor can a parent raise the minor best interest as a basis for standing citation.without a showing that a parent personal rights are affected by a ruling,the parent does not establish standing.citation.to be aggrieved or affected,a parent must have a legally cognizable interest that is affected injuriously by the juvenile court decision.citation.in sum,a appellant lacks standing to raise issues affecting another person interests.citation.in re th,d,fn.omitted.issues which do not affect the parent own rights may not be raised in the parent appeal.in re holly th,d.
raymond submits that the standing of a parent on appeal to raise the issue of failure to appoint counsel for the children in a proceeding to terminate parental rights is well settled,but the cases he cites do not in the least stand for that proposition.see in re laura cal d,in re richard cal d,adoption of jacob th,d.in those cases,the right of the minors to representation by counsel in termination proceedings was raised by other parties,but the issue of standing was neither presented on appeal nor mentioned in the opinions.cases not authority for propositions are not considered in the opinions.people barragan cal th,d,people accredited surety casualty,th,d.
however,other authority exists that directly supports raymond assertion of standing.cases have uniformly held that in a proceeding to terminate parental rights a father has standing to assert his child right to independent counsel,because independent representation of the children interests impacts upon the father interest in the relationship.in re elizabeth d.see also in re devin th,d in re patricia d.in re david d.we proceed to the merits of the issue of the minors right to counsel.
probate code section does not explicitly provide for appointment of counsel for the minors in an action to terminate parental rights,but specifies in subdivision c that,the rights of the parent,including the rights to notice and counsel provided in part commencing with section of division of the family code,shall apply to actions brought pursuant to this section.italics added.family code section,in turn,provides that in actions to terminate parental rights the court shall consider whether the interests of the child require the appointment of counsel.if the court finds that the interests of the child require representation by counsel,the court shall appoint counsel to represent the child,whether or not the child is able to afford counsel.the child shall not be present in court unless the child so requests or the court so orders.italics added.
although family code section does not require appointment of counsel for a minor,it demands that the court at least consider whether the minor should be represented by counsel,then exercise its discretion to appoint counsel for a minor in termination proceedings absent an immediate showing that counsel is not required to protect the child interests.adoption of jacob,supra,th,d.w hen the court finds a child has separate interests not protected in the contest between parents and a petitioner,the court must exercise its discretion by appointing separate counsel.citation.in re laura,supra,cal d.however,error in failing to appoint counsel is not reversible in the absence of a showing of prejudice.adoption of jacob,supra,at,d.accordingly,failure to appoint counsel for a minor in a freedom from parental custody and control proceeding does not require reversal of the judgment in the absence of miscarriage of justice.in re richard,supra,cal d.
even if we assume,without deciding,that the rights of the parent to counsel in a section action also extend to counsel for the minor,we find that no error occurred in the present case.as we read the record,the trial court did consider whether the minors needed representation by independent counsel.before trial commenced counsel was appointed for the minors for the entirety of the remaining proceedings.their attorney,leigh johnson,had represented them throughout the guardianship,so she was intimately familiar with all aspects of the case and its history.a review of the proceedings supports this conclusion.she acted vigorously in the case to represent the children.nothing in the record indicates to us that the failure of the court to appoint johnson as attorney for the children at an earlier stage of the proceedings was either necessary or adversely impacted their rights at trial.no prejudicial deprivation of the minors right to counsel occurred.
iv.the investigator report.
jamie and raymond join in contending that the trial court failed to comply with the requirements of probate code section,subdivision b,which provides the court shall appoint a court investigator or other qualified professional to investigate all factors enumerated in subdivision a.the findings of the investigator or professional regarding those issues shall be included in the written report required pursuant to section of the family code.family code section specifies in subdivision a that the investigator shall render to the court a written report of the investigation with a recommendation of the proper disposition to be made in the proceeding in the best interest of the child,and mandates in subdivision b that the report include all of the following a statement that the person making the report explained to the child the nature of the proceeding to end parental custody and control.a statement of the child feelings and thoughts concerning the pending proceeding.a statement of the child attitude towards the child parent or parents and particularly whether or not the child would prefer living with his or her parent or parents.a statement that the child was informed of the child right to attend the hearing on the petition and the child feelings concerning attending the hearing.subdivision d adds that,the court shall receive the report in evidence and shall read and consider its contents in rendering the court judgment.
the parents complain that the investigator evaluation and report were flawed for two reasons first and foremost,the failure of the investigator to interview either of them and second,for that reason the investigator deferred any formal recommendation on the petition until the hearing and a therapeutic evaluation of the minors was completed to determine the detriment to the children from termination of jamie parental rights,and the appropriateness of future visitation.they submit that an independent investigation by a court investigator is an essential requirement of a private termination of parental rights to provide the court with the information for it to be able to make a reasoned and informed decision.they claim that the deficient investigation and report therefore require reversal per se.
as a procedural matter we point out that the parents have forfeited their right to complain of inadequacies in the report by failing to object at trial.in re aaron th,d.nevertheless,we will review the sufficiency of the investigation and report to respond to the claim of incompetence of counsel made by jamie.people marshall cal th,d,people ashmus cal d,d,people yarbrough th,d.
while the report was submitted to the court and considered as demanded by probate code section,subdivision b,we agree with the parents that the investigation and report were incomplete due to the inability of the investigator to locate and interview the parents before trial and the resulting lack of any definitive recommendation for disposition of the matter.the fact that the investigator made reasonable efforts to contact and meet with the father and mother does not constitute compliance with family code section,subdivision a,which mandates a recommendation of the proper disposition to be made in the proceeding in the best interest of the child.italics added.the statutory purpose of the report is to inform the court of the best interests of the child,and the interests of the children are fundamental to the proceeding,so it is the trial court obligation to read and consider the report sua sponte.neumann melgar th,d.family code section does not explicitly require the investigation and report to include an interview with the statute focuses instead on obtaining the child feelings and thoughts on the proceeding as a means of evaluating the child best the failure of the report to provide a recommendation of the proper disposition constitutes procedural noncompliance with the statute.
we disagree with the parents contention that the error is reversible per se.per se reversal is required only in rare cases where the structural integrity of a trial is compromised.people flood cal th,d,people bell th,d.errors such as the one at issue here that may be quantitatively assessed in the context of the evidence to determine prejudice are not structural defects.see in re james cal th,d.to the contrary,the fundamental rule in california is that judgments can not be set aside unless,after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.cal,art.vi,see also people steele th,d.nor did the court act in excess of its jurisdiction in the present case,as jamie suggests.the court is not stripped of jurisdiction if an incomplete report is filed.see in re melinda d.this is not a case in which the parties due process rights were violated because they did not receive the report or no investigation was conducted.in re linda d.in re george d.the report was filed and submitted in accordance with statutory requirements the only flaw was the lack of a conclusive dispositional recommendation due to the inability of the investigator to contact the parents.deficiencies in an assessment report surely go to the weight of the evidence,and if sufficiently egregious may impair the basis of a court decision to terminate parental rights,but are not prejudicial per se.in re valerie th,d.
we view the error as one of procedural statutory dimension only it did not affect the parties due process rights.the parents received the report and were given the opportunity to the investigator about the failure to interview jamie.thus,the parents must affirmatively demonstrate prejudice to prevail on appeal.in re th,d in re melinda,supra,d.reversal is appropriate only if we conclude it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.citations in re marriage of jones th,d see also neumann melgar,supra,th,d.
upon review of the record,we find that the error was harmless beyond any reasonable doubt.the purpose of the investigation and report required by the statute is to provide the court with a full understanding of the factual setting of the petition for termination of parental rights.not only did parson testify about the contents of her report and the reasons for the lack of a recommendation,but the information that was omitted from the is,the results of interviews with the thoroughly presented and considered at trial.jamie testified at trial,and evidence of interviews with her was presented in the form of testimony,reports and letters from emerson and bongiovanni.parson also offered testimony that articulated her recommendation for resolution of the action.we find the court possessed complete and accurate information concerning the minors,the parents,the guardians,and the professional recommendations of the appointed experts in the case.any noncompliance with section,subdivision b,did not result in a miscarriage of justice or any prejudicial inadequate assistance of counsel.in re dakota th,d.
v.the evidence in support of the decision to terminate parental rights.
we proceed to the argument that the evidence does not support the trial court decision to terminate parental rights.raymond brief engages in a lengthy discourse to present the claim that the evidence fails to prove the essential element pursuant to section that the benefit to emma and noreen of being adopted by their guardians outweighs the detriment they would suffer from termination of parental rights.he proposes that the standard for termination of parental rights under section is not merely some benefit to the child from adoption,but rather whether,considering all factors relevant to the child best interests,including any detriment the child would suffer,it would be in the child best interests to terminate parental rights.from this premise he argues that it is not possible to conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court decision,particularly in light of the investigator failure to complete the investigation and provide the court with a recommendation.
the parents also contend that the trial court exceeded the bounds of appropriate judicial discretion by taking into consideration the order for continuing visitation as a factor that ameliorates the detriment to the children from the termination of parental rights.they point out that a posttermination visitation order is unenforceable,and the court must presume that termination of parental rights will result in cessation of all contact between parent and child.see in re.th,d.they claim that the court thus did not apply proper criteria or reasoning to reach the decision to terminate parental rights.
our review of the evidence is constrained.although a trial court must make such findings based on clear and convincing evidence,this standard of proof is for the guidance of the trial court only on review,our function is limited to a determination whether substantial evidence exists to support the conclusions reached by the trial court in utilizing the appropriate standard.citation.under the substantial evidence standard of review,a ll conflicts in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the respondents and all legitimate and reasonable inferences must be indulged in to uphold the judgment.citation.adoption of allison th,d,fn.omitted see also in re amy th,d.it was the trial court duty to determine whether the petitioners met their burden of proof it is our duty to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the trial court findings that it did.in re robert d.
also,the decision to terminate parental rights lies in the first instance within the discretion of the trial court,and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.citation.while the abuse of discretion standard gives the court substantial latitude,t he scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied,in the legal principles governing the subject of the action citation.action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an abuse of discretion.citation.in re baby girl th,d.
the prerequisites to termination of parental rights under section are straightforward.section authorizes the termination of parental rights after two years of probate guardianship,if adoption by the guardian is in the child best interest.ann,supra,cal th,d.the statute specifies in unambiguous terms that the court must find that the child would benefit from being adopted by his or her guardian,subd.a.evidence of parental unfitness or that terminating parental rights is the least detrimental alternative for the child is not required in a section proceeding.ann,supra,at,d.t he parental fitness standard,which protects parents interest in child custody,is not necessarily required at a section hearing.by that stage,the family unit has ceased to exist and the parent entitlement to custody is not at issue.it would be anomalous to require proof in every case,by clear and convincing evidence,that a mother or father who has had no custodial responsibilities for two or more years is currently an unfit parent.id.at,d.nothing more must be proved than that termination of parental rights and adoption by the guardian are in the best interests of the child.id.at,d.and in determining the best interests of the child,the trial court must consider all factors,which would include the circumstances leading to guardianship,the parent efforts to maintain contact with the child,any exigencies that might hamper those efforts,and other evidence of commitment to parental responsibilities,subd.a.id.at,d.under section,the detriment of terminating parental rights is not balanced directly against the benefits of adoption it is only a factor to be considered when evaluating the child best interest.
we have no difficulty in finding that the evidence supports the trial court decision that termination of parental rights and adoption by petitioners is in the best interests of the minors.during the guardianship of nearly four years,jamie failed to successfully remedy the problems,particularly of domestic abuse,that necessitated the guardianship in the first place.the guardianship was created due to jamie inability to provide a stable home for the children free from substance abuse,severe emotional discord,and violence.for the most part,that conduct and environment persisted throughout the course of the guardianship.even after the petition was filed,jamie continued to exhibit unstable behavior by harassing the guardians.the children also acquired a deep attachment to the guardians and a secure home with them.evidence was presented that the children were well adjusted and happy in the guardians home,but displayed increased symptoms of anxiety and depression when they visited jamie.the california supreme court has recognized after years of guardianship,the child has a fully developed interest in a stable,continuing,and permanent placement with a fully committed caregiver.citations.the guardian,after fulfilling a parental role for an extended period,has also developed substantial interests that the law recognizes.ann,supra,cal th,d,fn.omitted.
the evidence adduced from the various experts also uniformly established that the minors were at substantial risk in the mother home of social,emotional and behavioral detriment.the experts definitively asserted that the minors would benefit from the stability that would accompany permanent placement with the guardians and cessation of their continued transitional existence.we do not agree with the parents assertion that their parental rights were improperly terminated to prevent jamie from continuing to seek termination of the guardianship.the court instead found that continuation of the guardianship due to the ongoing failure of jamie to improve and control her behavior was detrimental to the children.although we acknowledge,as did the experts and juliana,that the minors demonstrated a loving bond with their mother,we discern substantial evidence in the record in support of the finding of benefit to the minors.in re brittany d.
finally,the finding that termination and adoption by the guardians is in the minors best interest is not flawed by any mistaken consideration by the trial court of the mitigating influence of the order for continuing visitation.first,our focus is upon the ultimate decision rather than the underlying analysis of the trial court.our task is to determine whether the judgment should be affirmed or reversed.thus,we review the judgment for reversible error,not merely to determine whether the trial court interpretation was correct,but whether the judgment is correct on any theory.citation.no rule of decision is better or more firmly established by authority,nor one resting upon a sounder basis of reason and propriety,than that a ruling or decision,itself correct in law,will not be disturbed on appeal merely because given for a wrong reason.if right upon any theory of the law applicable to the case,it must be sustained regardless of the considerations which may have moved the trial court to its conclusion.citation.citation.we review the trial court ruling,not its reasoning.citations.as you sow conbraco industries th,d.
further,we do not discern any indication in the record that the court based its assessment of the minors best interests on the expectation of continued visitation by the parents.as we view the evidence and the trial court statement of decision,the visitation and termination orders were neither dependent upon each other nor even considered in conjunction with each other.the court also did not in any fashion find that detriment from termination of parental rights would be mitigated by continued visitation.instead,the court made entirely separate findings on termination and visitation,with the latter being based on the perceived consent of the parties,not any determination that detriment to the children would be moderated by visitation.
the advantage of a stable,permanent adoptive home for the minors outweighs the benefit of a continued relationship with jamie,who despite her efforts and somewhat positive visitation record failed to successfully overcome the disruptive,offending behavior that led to the guardianship.in re jasmine th,d.the trial court did not err by terminating the parental rights of raymond and jamie.
vi.the indian child welfare act.
the parents final contention,presented by jamie and joined by raymond,is that the judgment must be reversed due to the failure of the trial court to comply with the requirements of the indian child welfare act of icwa.et jamie points out that subdivision d of probate code section explicitly provides this section does not apply to any child who is a dependent of the juvenile court or to any indian child.the parents therefore argue that the failure of the court,the court investigator or petitioners to comply with the notice and inquiry requirements of california implementation of the icwa compels conditional reversal of the judgment and a remand for the trial court to satisfy the necessary inquiry and notice provisions of the icwa.
we begin our examination of this issue by observing that no claim was made in the trial court that the minors have indian ancestry,and no evidence is found in the record that they may be indian children.hence,at least on the record before us,the termination of parental rights is not precluded by subdivision d of section.the remaining issue is whether the court,the petitioners,or the court investigator had a duty in the trial court proceedings to inquire into indian ancestry of the minors without either any challenge on that ground or hint in the evidence of its existence.
admittedly,it has been by this a parent does not necessarily waive an icwa notice issue by failing to raise it below.in re th,d see also in re th,d.these cases reason that t he notice requirements serve the interests of the indian tribes irrespective of the position of the parents and can not be waived by the parent.citation.citation.citations.in re,supra,at,d.we advance to the issue of compliance with the icwa.
first,the icwa itself does not require an inquiry,where,as here,no evidence of an indian child has been presented.the fundamental procedural safeguard in the icwa is a provision for notice,which states in part in any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.a.in re th,d,italics added see also in re mary th,d.in in re th,d,the court explained that neither the icwa nor controlling federal regulations expressly impose any duty to inquire as to american indian ancestry.citation.in re th,d.
however,the icwa provides that states may provide a higher standard of protection to the rights of the parent of an indian child than the rights provided under icwa citation,and federal guidelines provide the state court shall make inquiries to determine if the child involved is a member of an indian tribe or if a parent of the child is a member of an indian tribe and the child is eligible for membership in an indian tribe.citations.in re,supra,th,d.the california legislature has adopted statutes and rules of court to implement the icwa.see cal.rules of court,rule.id.at,d.section,subdivision d of the welfare and institutions code also expressly provides if a state or federal law provides a higher standard than more lenient icwa requirements,the higher standard shall prevail.in re damian th,d.
pursuant to california law found in welfare and institutions code s ection,subdivision a provides the court,county welfare department,and the probation department have an affirmative and continuing duty to inquire whether a dependent child is or may be an indian child in all dependency proceedings.citation.in re,supra,th,d,italics added.while the action before us is not a dependency proceeding as referred to in welfare and institutions code section,the california rules of court mandate a duty of inquiry which extends beyond dependency proceedings to other related actions rule a specifies the court,investigator,and party seeking a placement,guardianship,conservatorship,custody placement under family code section,declaration freeing a child from the custody or control of one or both parents,termination of parental rights,or adoption have an affirmative and continuing duty to inquire whether a child is or may be an indian child in all proceedings identified in rule.italics added.rule a,adds the party seeking a placement,guardianship,conservatorship,custody placement under family code section,declaration freeing a child from the custody or control of one or both parents,termination of parental rights,or adoption must ask the child,if the child is old enough,and the parents,indian custodian,or legal guardians whether the child is or may be an indian child and must complete the indian child inquiry attachment form a and attach it to the petition unless the party is filing a subsequent petition,and there is no new information.further,rule states in pertinent part this chapter addressing the indian child welfare act united states code section et as codified in various sections of the california family,probate,and welfare and institutions codes,applies to all proceedings involving indian children that may result in an involuntary foster care placement guardianship or conservatorship placement custody placement under family code section declaration freeing a child from the custody and control of one or both parents termination of parental rights or adoptive placement.italics added.
under the broad language of rule,the duty of inquiry attaches to any proceeding which may result in termination of parental rights or adoptive placement.thus,during the course of the guardianship proceeding no duty of inquiry was created,but when the petition to terminate parental rights was filed the court,investigator,and petitioners were vested with the affirmative and continuing duty pursuant to rule a to inquire whether the minors are or may be indian children.nothing in the court investigator report or the remainder of the evidence indicates that the requisite rule a inquiry was undertaken or even considered.in re th,d.
the breach of duty to inquire into the indian heritage of the minors was error that necessitates a limited reversal of an order or judgment and remand for proper inquiry and any required notice that may be necessary.citation.reversal is not warranted,however,when the court noncompliance with the inquiry requirement constitutes harmless error.in re,supra,th,d.where the record below fails to demonstrate and the parents have made no offer of proof or other affirmative assertion of indian heritage on appeal,a miscarriage of justice has not been established and reversal is not required.see in re,supra,th,d in re rebecca th,d.here,although evidence of indian heritage is entirely lacking in the record before us,jamie has made a claim on appeal that an father grandmother named ella listed on the dawes rolls as a seminole indian.she has also requested that we take additional documentary evidence on appeal that she asserts supports her claim of the minors indian ancestry.petitioners have also asked that we take additional evidence in rebuttal,in the form of ronald declaration and attachments that purport to show the person identified by his sister jamie as her ancestor ella morgan is not a seminole indian,and is a male rather than a female.petitioners argue that if we consider the mother additional evidence we should also consider the proffered additional evidence in opposition to her claim of indian heritage.
we decline to take any additional evidence in this matter.code of civil procedure section governs the taking of additional evidence on appeal it provides in pertinent part the reviewing court may for the purpose of making the factual determinations or for any other purpose in the interests of justice,take additional evidence of or concerning facts occurring at any time prior to the decision of the appeal,and may give or direct the entry of any judgment or order and may make any further or other order as the case may require.this section shall be liberally construed to the end among others that,where feasible,causes may be finally disposed of by a single appeal and without further proceedings in the trial court except where in the interests of justice a new trial is required on some or all of the issues.code of civil procedure section allows appellate courts to accept evidence in dependency cases to expedite just and final resolution for the benefit of the children involved.citation.in re,supra,th,d.
in practice,code of civil procedure section has quite limited application.although appellate courts are authorized to make findings of fact on appeal by code of civil procedure section and rule of the california rules of court,the authority should be exercised sparingly.citation.absent exceptional circumstances,no such findings should be made.citation.citations.citation.in re valerie,supra,th,d.the statute does not affect the respective provinces of the trial and reviewing courts,nor change the established rule against appellate weighing of evidence.the power to invoke the statute should be exercised sparingly,ordinarily only in order to affirm the lower court decision and terminate the litigation,and in very rare cases where the record or new evidence compels a reversal with directions to enter judgment for the appellant citation.the procedure under code of civil procedure section is not a substitute for a motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.citations.the reviewing courts are not equipped to undertake an appreciable amount of evidence taking on appeal.monsan homes,pogrebneak d.the and powers of the appellate courts do not convert them into triers of fact or abrogate the general rule that findings of the trial court based on substantial evidence are conclusive on appeal.citation.the purpose of the statute and the rule implementing it is to enable appellate courts,in appropriate cases,to terminate litigation by affirmance,or modification and affirmance,of the judgment,or by reversal with directions to enter judgment for appellant if it appears that on no reasonable theory could respondent make a further showing in the trial court.citations.citation.they do not warrant an appellate court general reversal of a judgment on the basis of newly discovered evidence presented in the appellate court.people pena d.
the parties before us are seeking to have us consider new,conflicting evidence to decide an issue that was not litigated in the trial court.mother motion would seek to effectuate a reversal of the judgment based on newly discovered evidence and a newly presented issue on appeal.petitioners motion seeks to present directly contradictory evidence on the same issue.this case does not offer any exceptional circumstances that warrant the taking of additional evidence from either party.in re valerie,supra,th,d.
we therefore deny the motions to take additional evidence to decide the issue of compliance with the icwa given the offer of proof and assertions by jamie of her indian heritage,however,without reversal of the judgment we must make a limited remand with directions to the trial court to effectuate proper inquiry and comply with the notice provisions of the icwa if indian heritage is indicated.in re damian,supra,th,d in re,supra,th,d in re cody th,d.if,after proper inquiry and notice,a tribe determines the minors are indian children,the parents may petition the court to invalidate the termination of parental rights upon a showing that such action violated the provisions of the icwa.in re damian,supra,at,d.
the appeal of the guardians 
i.the authority of the trial court to order visitation.
the appeal of the guardians contests only the visitation orders that accompanied the termination of parental rights the court granted jamie one supervised visit per month for up to eight hours raymond was granted two supervised visits per year.the guardians challenge to the visitation orders is first,that the court had no authority to make visitation orders after the termination of parental rights in the case second,the court did not make required findings that visitation would actually benefit the children and third,the evidence shows that continuing visitation with the mother and resuming visitation with the father would in fact be detrimental to these young and vulnerable children.their essential position is that the trial court exceeded its authority and abused its discretion by granting the mother and father supervised visitation with the children.
we first consider the trial court authority to grant visitation upon termination of parental rig
