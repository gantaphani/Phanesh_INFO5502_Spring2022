plaintiff indians of the bishop community of the bishop colony,california,an indian tribe formally recognized by the united states,filed this action against defendant city of los angeles for an order restoring plaintiff to possession of land that the city took long ago in a deal with the united states.the district court dismissed the action under federal rule of civil procedure b because it ruled that,under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,the united states was a required party that plaintiff could not join.the district court certified the appealability of its order under b.upon plaintiff timely request,we agreed to hear this interlocutory appeal,and we now affirm.
background 
for centuries,plaintiff members lived in the area now called the owens valley in inyo county,california.after settlers began to move into that area in the late nineteenth century,congress moved to protect plaintiff by acquiring land in the area and setting it aside for plaintiff benefit.by,the united states had acquired and set aside five tracts of land totaling approximately acres the bishop tribal land.pursuant to the usual custom,the united states held the title to the bishop tribal land in trust for plaintiff.
in the act of april,stat,congress authorized the secretary of the interior to exchange federal land and water rights in the owens valley for other land and water rights owned by the city.the act placed several conditions on any such exchange.among them,a majority of plaintiff adult members had to consent to an exchange an exchange had to include the water rights appurtenant to the exchanged lands and the value of the rights conveyed in an exchange had to equal the value of the rights received.
in,the united states set out to exchange acres of federal land,which included the bishop tribal land,for acres of land in the owens valley held by the city.plaintiff alleges that the united states engaged in several improprieties in conducting that exchange.agents of the federal bureau of indian affairs canvassed plaintiff members,going and gathering signatures.plaintiff alleges that,of the signatures gathered,were written on blank pieces of paper.plaintiff further alleges that the remaining signatures were written on term sheets bearing a grossly insufficient description of the particulars of the exchange.
on may,the united states effected the exchange with the city by a written agreement.the agreement reserved to each party all water rights appurtenant to the exchanged lands,and the appraisals on which both parties relied did not include the value of those water rights.plaintiff alleges that the agreement violated the act requirement that an exchange include the water rights appurtenant to the land exchanged.plaintiff further alleges that the parties had insufficient evidence from which to conclude that they were exchanging rights of equivalent value because the appraisals did not include the value of the water rights.
in july,the united states formally conveyed the bishop tribal land to the city by an executed deed.since that time,the city has excluded plaintiff members from occupying and using the bishop tribal land.
plaintiff filed this action against the city in,asking the district court mainly for an order ejecting the city from the bishop tribal land and restoring plaintiff to possession.plaintiff did not name the united states as a party.eventually,the city moved to dismiss the action under rule b,arguing that the united states was a required party under rule and that it could not be joined.the district court agreed and dismissed the suit with leave to amend.rather than amend its complaint,however,plaintiff decided to pursue an interlocutory appeal under b.finding this case exceedingly close,the district court granted a certificate of appealability.upon plaintiff timely request,we agreed to hear this appeal.
ii.discussion 
our review of a dismissal under rule b has three parts.eeoc peabody coal,cir.first,guided by the provisions of rule a,we must decide whether it is desirable in the interests of just adjudication to join the united states.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.if so,we must determine next whether a court feasibly could order that the united states be joined.id.finally,if a court can not so order,then,guided by the provisions of rule b,we must decide whether in equity and good conscience the case may proceed in the absence of the united states.id.at.
we review for abuse of discretion the district court decision to dismiss this action for failure to join the united states.dawavendewa salt river project agric.improvement power,cir.to the extent that the district court decision involves questions of law,we review de novo.id.
a.the united states is a required party under rule a.
we have interpreted rule a to provide for a analysis.yellowstone county pease,cir.we first examine whether the district court could award complete relief to the parties present without joining the.id.at.alternatively,we ask whether the has a legally protected interest in this action that would be impaired or impeded by adjudicating the case without it.id.at.if we answer either of those questions in the affirmative,then the united states is a required party under rule a.id.at.
we have no doubt that the united states is a required party.the district court could not award the relief that plaintiff seeks in the absence of the united states.plaintiff theory of this case involves three steps that it claims lead to its requested relief,which is to eject the city from the bishop tribal land and to restore plaintiff to possession of it.first,plaintiff alleges that the united states violated the conditions in the act when it exchanged the bishop tribal land without proper consent from a majority of plaintiff adult members,without transferring the water rights appurtenant to the exchanged land,and without obtaining sufficient appraisals of the exchanged land.second,because of those violations,plaintiff theorizes that the purported transfer of the bishop tribal land was null and void.finally,because the city has never lawfully held title to the bishop tribal land,plaintiff asks the district court to take the land from the city and give it to plaintiff.
but plaintiff theory skips a crucial fourth step.as plaintiff complaint acknowledges,the united states,not plaintiff,conveyed the bishop tribal land to the city.even if a finder of fact were to decide that the united states violated the act and that those violations render the land exchange null and void,the title to the bishop tribal land would revert to the united states,not to plaintiff.to achieve the relief that it seeks,plaintiff would require an additional order,apart from an order ejecting the city,requiring the united states either to cede title to plaintiff or to hold the land in trust for plaintiff benefit.without such an order,we see nothing stated in plaintiff complaint that would require the united states to give the bishop tribal land back to plaintiff.and,before a court could bind the united states by such an order,the united states must be a party.see provident tradesmens bank trust patterson,d recognizing that an outsider not before the court can not be bound by the judgment rendered.
because we conclude that the district court could not accord complete relief to plaintiff in the absence of the united states,the united states is a required party under rule a.we therefore need not answer the alternative question whether the united states has a legally protected interest in this action that would be impaired or impeded by adjudicating the case without it.
b.the united states can not be joined.
we turn to the second part of the analysis,whether the united states feasibly could be joined in this action.because the united states has sovereign immunity,no one,including indian tribes,may sue the united states without first obtaining permission from congress.sioux tribe united states,cir.we therefore examine whether congress has given plaintiff permission to join the united states here.
as it turns out,congress waived its sovereign immunity over plaintiff claim many years ago,but plaintiff failed to take advanta
