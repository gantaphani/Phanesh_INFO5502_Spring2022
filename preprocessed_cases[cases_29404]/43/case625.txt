sean hal osborn,who was recognized as an expert under icwa,testified on behalf of the dfcs in his declaration,which was also admitted into evidence,osborn made clear that icwa did not,at that time,apply because the children were not indian children as defined by icwa.neither father nor the children were then members of the cherokee nation of oklahoma.he stated that the active efforts requirement applies only when a child was an indian child as defined under icwa.in any event,he indicated that active efforts had been made and included but were not limited to family reunification services for mother,which included basic parenting,individual counseling,drug testing,meetings,and a domestic violence support group.

nevertheless,osborn recommended termination of parental rights based upon the circumstances from the standpoint of icwa.he did not,however,consider any other exception other than the indian child exception to terminating parental rights under section.
the older sister was called as a witness by mother.testified that she did not believe the children should be adopted.she did not want her relationship with her brother and sister to end.she had last lived with her brother and sister before october.
the older sister had visited with them for about five minutes that day during a break in the court proceedings and had seen them at the courthouse during their last court date.the last time that she had actually spent time with them was at the children shelter during a family visit.the children ran to them and hugged and kissed them.she stated,our family is always hugging and kissing and we are close.she recalled that had written a letter to their mother.when it was time to leave,her siblings seemed depressed when they said goodbye to their mother but also happy because they were going to visit with their mother again the next day.
the older sister indicated that she was not able to talk with and much by phone.she did not feel that comfortable talking to them on the phone because people were in the background talking to them and telling them what to say to her.

social worker eva ransom,whom the court recognized as an expert in permanency planning options for children,testified on behalf of the dfcs.she had been assigned to the cases in the latter part of july.she stated that the children appear to be very content and secure in the aunt and uncle home and t hey seem to be bonded to the aunt and uncle and their cousins.they have been with the aunt and uncle since january and they expressed to her that they felt part of that family.ransom had concluded that they were very bonded to the aunt family and were in a very nurturing environment.
ransom testified that the children also indicated to her that they would like to have continued contact with their own immediate family and grandmother.ransom had spoken to the aunt and uncle about the possibility of continuing contact and they recognized that the children would like to continue seeing their mother and grandmother and they had said continuing contact would be possible.the aunt had no objections to,and did not place any limitations,on such contact.ransom thought continuing phone contact and visitation was a possibility but it would be up to the discretion of the adoptive parents.
ransom had been once told by the aunt that the children appeared distant and somewhat sad after returning from visiting their mother and it was ransom understanding that,before she was involved in these dependency cases,there were times when the children appeared distant and did not listen to their caretaker after they returned from visiting their mother.ransom was aware that,before she was involved in the case,the aunt had asked for the visits to stop.she was also aware that on more than one occasion both and have stated that they enjoy their visits with their mother.
ransom had heard the testimony that and have a relationship with their mother and with their older sister.she also heard testimony about the importance of his relationship with his father.she still believed that adoption was in the children best interests.she understood that,if adopted,the children had no legal means of having a relationship or visitation with either parent and that contact with the parents would be entirely up to the adoptive parents.although the aunt and uncle had indicated they planned to continue contact between the children and their parents,ransom understood that could change in the future.
ransom stated that the children had been in protective custody for about two years.before being placed with their aunt and uncle in january,the children had been in foster care placement.in,prior to the dependency proceedings,they had lived with their aunt and uncle for about a year.according to ransom,the children view their aunt and uncle as close family and call them aunt and uncle.
ransom understood that the children wanted to have continued contact with their mother through telephone calls and visits and they would like visits and telephone calls with their mother to continue after adoption.the aunt and uncle had told ransom that they will continue fostering the children contact with mother.ransom did not have any concerns that the aunt and uncle would not facilitate visits between the children and parents.
ransom acknowledged that the previous social worker had reported that,after the june visit in san jose,the aunt had told that social worker that she believed that the children visits with their mother and grandmother were toxic to the children and she supported ending visitation and telephone calls.ransom also acknowledged that another staff person had reported after that visit that the aunt had said that she felt it would be best to stop the visits.ransom had not talked to the aunt about those comments.ransom acknowledged that the aunt had not always indicated that she would support visits.ransom agreed that she had worked diligently to help soothe the situation between the aunt and uncle and mother and the maternal grandmother.
when ransom took over the case,mother and the maternal grandmother were repeatedly calling for assistance in making telephone contact and ransom had explained to the aunt that they were entitled to unsupervised phone calls.the aunt indicated calls were coming in throughout the week and the children needed to do their homework and had other responsibilities.ransom had proposed twice a week calls on regularly scheduled days.
ransom stated that the aunt and uncle were aware that visitation with mother would be entirely voluntary and up to them after adoption.she thought i t would probably be upsetting to the children if contact with the mother ended but she did not know if it would be detrimental to them.she was not sure if it would be harmful to the children to lose all contact with older sister because there was not a lot of contact between them.
ransom believed that the children loved their mother.she believed that they could have a relationship with their parents after parental rights were terminated even if it was not a legal relationship.the aunt had stated that she realized that the children wanted to see and talk to their mother and she had no plans to end that.ransom did not believe that termination of parental rights would substantially interfere with communication between the children and their older sister.
in ransom opinion,a child statement that he or she loved a parent and would be sad or mad if he or she could never see the parent again was not a compelling reason to not terminate parental rights.it was her belief that parental rights should remain intact only if the parent would be able to safely regain custody of the child.she conceded that there might be situations in which a parent was unable to reunify but parental rights should be preserved.she was aware of the relationship exception.
father testified in his own behalf.he disagreed with the recommendation of termination of parental rights for and.he believed they were really a family and it was a destructive thing to break up a family like that he thought that termination of parental rights would be harmful to those children because they would think he fought for them.he thought it would be harmful to them if they could not see or talk to their mother and older sister.he was writing the children every week but had not received one letter from them.he was only able to make collect calls.
father had not signed a contact agreement.

according to mother,after the children moved to bakersfield in january,she saw the children one afternoon in february,on two days in,and for a number of hours on september,and september.ransom provided her with a train ticket for the september visit.she did not visit them in march,april,may,july or august.she testified that,if her parental rights were not terminated and the aunt and uncle became the children legal guardians,she would be willing to arrange her own transportation to bakersfield,to visit in public places outside the home of the adoptive parents,and she was willing to have other relatives present during the visits.
mother acknowledged that the children had previously moved into their aunt and uncle house on november,and lived there until february.the children had always lived with her before then.she explained that the children went to live with their aunt and uncle because father had beaten her and she was trying to get back on her feet.she took the children back when father was sentenced.she recalled being stopped by officials at different times in different counties and it was her understanding that the aunt was trying to prevent her from taking back custody of her children.
mother testified that she spoke with the children on mondays and fridays and sometimes they snuck in a call with their cousins.they talked about school and what they were doing.they always seemed happy to talk to her.
according to mother,when mother said hello to the aunt on october,the aunt did not respond.mother stated that the children were receiving father letters and they were writing to him and giving the letters to their aunt.mother testified that she wanted the children removed from the aunt custody if she could not contact her children.mother indicated that her cheating on father in april may have affected the way the aunt felt about her.
mother believed the aunt and uncle loved the children.the children appeared happy and healthy.
mother had not heard of a contact agreement until that day and had never signed such an agreement.
decision and order terminating parental rights 
the court indicated in its statement of decision that it had analyzed the section issues as if icwa applied and used the heightened icwa standards at trial.the court found by clear and convincing evidence that the children and were likely to be adopted.it found by clear and convincing evidence that the department made active efforts to provide services designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family and these efforts have failed.it further found beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody with a parent is likely to cause serious emotional or physical damage to the children.
the juvenile court did not find the relationship exception,sibling relationship exception,or the indian child exception to termination of parental rights was applicable.it found by clear and convincing evidence that termination of parental rights was in the children best interests.
the court terminated the mother and father parental rights with respect to and.it selected adoption as the permanent plan.
exceptions to termination of parental rights 
under section,the statutory preference is to terminate parental rights and order the child placed for adoption,subd.b.the circumstance that the court has terminated reunification services provides a sufficient basis for termination of parental rights unless the court finds a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child due to one or more of specified circumstances.citation.the legislature has thus determined that,where possible,adoption is the first choice.adoption is the legislature first choice because it gives the child the best chance at a full emotional commitment from a responsible caretaker.in re jasmine th,guardianship,while a more stable placement than foster care,is not irrevocable and thus falls short of the secure and permanent future the legislature had in mind for the dependent child.in re lorenzo th,in re celine cal th.
the burden falls to the parent to show that the termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child under one of the exceptions.in re zachary th,in re fernando th,see in re th.the statutory exceptions merely permit the court,in exceptional circumstances in re jasmine,supra,at,to choose an option other than the norm,which remains adoption.in re celine,supra,cal th at.
reviewing courts have applied various standards of review when considering trial court determinations of the applicability of these statutory exceptions to termination of parental rights.in re scott th.a finding that no exceptional circumstance exists is customarily challenged on the sufficiency of the evidence.see in re jesse th,in re brian th,in re autumn th.in re th.
in in re jasmine th,an appellate court concluded that the abuse of discretion standard,rather than the substantial evidence test,governed its review of a determination that an exception to termination of parental rights did not apply.id.at,relationship exception.it stated t he abuse of discretion standard is not only traditional for custody determinations,but it also seems a better fit in cases like this one,especially since the statute now requires the juvenile court to find a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child,subd.c.that is a quintessentially discretionary determination.id.at see in re th,applying abuse of discretion standard of review to determination regarding indian child exception.the appellate court in jasmine noted,however,that t he practical differences between the two standards of review are not significant.id.at.

relationship exception 
under section,subdivision c b i,parental rights can not be terminated where the juvenile court finds a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child because t he parents have maintained regular visitation and contact with the child and the child would benefit from continuing the relationship.the exception does not require proof the child has a primary attachment to a parent or the parent has maintained contact with the child.in re th,in re brandon th,in re casey th,in re skyler th.
the exception second prong requiring that the child would benefit from continuing the relationship means that the relationship promotes the of the child to such a degree as to outweigh the the child would gain in a permanent home with new,adoptive parents.in re autumn th.the juvenile court balances the strength and quality of the natural relationship in a tenuous placement against the security and the sense of belonging a new family would confer.ibid.if severing the natural relationship would deprive the child of a substantial,positive emotional attachment such that the child would be greatly harmed,the preference for adoption is overcome and the natural parent rights are not terminated.ibid.
the exception must be examined on a basis,taking into account the many variables which affect a bond.the age of the child,the portion of the child life spent in the parent custody,the positive or negative effect of interaction between parent and child,and the child particular needs are some of the variables which logically affect a bond.id.at.
in this appeal,mother contends that the juvenile court determination that the relationship exception did not apply suffers from many of the same errors committed by the juvenile court in in re,supra,th.she points out that the children had lived with her for many years,the children missed her and were excited to see her,and she had a substantial,positive relationship with them.
in in re,an appellate court reversed an order terminating the father parental rights over his daughter,after concluding that the juvenile court had erred in finding the relationship exception did not apply.id.at.in that case,the father had maintained regular,consistent and appropriate visitation with throughout the dependency proceedings and they had an emotionally significant relationship.id.at.the father had been primary caretaker for three years and,when she was removed from his custody,the father immediately recognized that his drug use was untenable and he started services,maintained his sobriety,sought medical and psychological services,and complied with every aspect of his case plan.ibid.the record showed that loved her father,wanted their relationship to continue,and derived some measure of benefit from his visits.id.at.a kelin,who had conducted a bonding study of father and daughter,testified that,due to their fairly strong bond,there was a potential for harm to were she to lose the relationship.id.at.the appellate court concluded that b ased on this record,the only reasonable inference is that would be greatly harmed by the loss of her significant positive relationship with the father.id.at in re amber th,judgment terminating parental rights reversed where experts opined that children had a primary beneficial relationship with parent that clearly outweighed benefit of adoption.
the same appellate court that decided in re subsequently stated in a different case the opinion must be viewed in light of its particular facts.it does not,of course,stand for the proposition that a termination order is subject to reversal whenever there is some measure of benefit in continued contact between parent and child.in re jason th.
in this case,there was no dispute that the children loved mother and their wish was to continue contact with her.but,unlike in re,there was no testimony from a psychological expert,no less one who had conducted a bonding study,that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the children.while the court had to consider each child wishes,it was required to act in each child best interest,subd.h and a child wishes are not necessarily determinative of the child best interest see in re michael th.
at the time of the section hearing in october,was nine years old and was years old.they had been in protective custody for about two years and had lived with the paternal aunt and uncle since january.the children had previously lived with them from november,until february,when mother had voluntarily placed them there because she was unable to care for them.the aunt and uncle were providing for the children daily needs and mother acknowledged that they appeared to love the children.social worker ransom found the children were content and secure in the aunt and uncle home,they were bonded to them and their cousins,and they felt part of their family.the children understood the meaning of adoption,had voiced no objection to adoption,and were thriving in the home of the paternal aunt and uncle.both had expressed to the social worker that they greatly enjoyed living with their aunt and uncle.mother had never progressed beyond supervised visitation.ransom did not testify that termination of parental rights would be harmful to the children.
the juvenile court determined that the parents no longer served a parental role for the children rather,the aunt and uncle met their everyday needs.appellants contend that the court incorrectly focused on the aunt and uncle provision of day to day care.this appellate court and others have stated that t o meet the burden of proving the section,subdivision c b i exception the parent must show more than frequent and loving contact,an emotional bond with the child,or pleasant parent must show that he or she occupies a parental role in the life of the child.in re derek th,in re th.the juvenile court was entitled to evaluate the strength and quality of the children relationship with their mother and could properly observe that the children daily needs were being met by the aunt and uncle.its comments do not demonstrate that it was improperly requiring mother to have day to day contact with the children or to be the primary attachment for application of the relationship exception.a strong and beneficial relationship might exist such that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child,particularly in the case of an older child,despite a lack of contact and interaction.in re casey th.
in this case,the juvenile court implicitly found that there was substantial,positive emotional attachment despite the lack of contact.the court observed that the children were of an age where they are intellectually and emotionally aware of whom their parents are.it stated the court had the opportunity to observe the children in the presence of their parents,and there is no doubt that the children love their parents and would choose to be with their parents if at all possible.it was clear to the court,by the eye contact and the smiles,that the children were happy to be sitting in the same room as the parents.the court heard the children testify that they would be mad and sad if they were not able to have contact with their mother,though they also testified that they would like to be adopted and do not want to move from their current home.the children testified that they have been assured by their aunt that even if they are adopted,they will be able to continue having phone calls and visits with their mother.the court also observed that t hese children know their parents as their parents and view them as their parents 
the court then moved on to the weighing process.the court recognized that,given the ages of the children,the court analysis of the benefits of adoption compared to the benefits of maintaining the relationship is slightly different than it would be if the children were infants or toddlers.it found that these parents have very little to offer these children except for the loving connection that currently exists between them.
the juvenile court ultimately concluded that t he overwhelming benefits to children that accompany the permanent plan of,security,not easily outweighed,and they are not outweighed in this case.it reached that conclusion based,at least in part,upon the expectation that the children aunt and uncle would permit the children to have continued contact with mother after they were adopted.
the court stated there is no evidence that that loving connection between mother and the children would be severed if the court were to terminate parental rights.the court can not see that terminating parental rights would greatly harm the children pursuant to in re brittany instead,the children will have the best of both worlds.they will have stability,predictability,nurturing,love and warmth in their adoptive home and because they are placed with relatives,they will maintain the connection to their parents.
appellants argue that evidence of past visitation and phone call problems demonstrates the aunt will likely stop the contact this argument is essentially a request that this court reweigh the evidence,which we can not do.in applying the substantial evidence test,w e do not evaluate the credibility of witnesses,reweigh the evidence,or resolve evidentiary conflicts.in re th.rather,we draw all reasonable inferences in support of the findings,consider the record most favorably to the juvenile court order,and affirm the order if supported by substantial evidence even if other evidence supports a contrary conclusion.i in re autumn,supra,th at.ibid.here,both children and social worker ransom indicated that the aunt would permit contact between children and mother to continue.
citing in re,supra,th,appellants next argue that,in evaluating the relationship exception,it is improper for the court to rely on a belief the relatives will maintain the children relationship with mother.in in re,the juvenile court recognized that would benefit from continuing her relationship with the father and based its decision to terminate parental rights in part on the grandparents willingness to allow the father to continue to visit id.at.the appellate court concluded that a parent should not be deprived of a legal relationship with his or her child on the basis of an unenforceable promise of future visitation by the child prospective adoptive parents.ibid.
we agree that in this case,like in in re,the juvenile court injected an improper factor into the weighing process,namely,the prospective adoptive parents willingness to allow the children to have continued contact with mother.it is important to remember that once the legal relationship is permanently severed by termination of parental rights,a substantial,positive emotional attachment between a child and a parent has no legal protection even if depriving the child of that attachment by disallowing contact would greatly harm the child in dependency proceedings,an order terminating parental rights is not only conclusive and binding upon the birth parents,but also effectuates a complete and final legal termination of the parental relationship.welf.subd.i in re angelia cal d,in re robert,supra,d,the relationship enjoys no legal recognition after termination of parental rights.in re,supra,th,in re noreen th.
we conclude that if a juvenile court determines that a parent has maintained regular visitation and contact,subd.c b i,that there is a substantial,positive emotional attachment between child and parent benefitting the child in re autumn,supra,th at,and that the benefit from continuing that relationship in a tenuous placement promotes the of the child to such a degree as to outweigh the benefit that child would gain from the stability and permanency of adoption ibid,then the relationship exception is established.in those circumstances,the court can not nevertheless terminate parental rights based upon an unenforceable expectation that the prospective adoptive parents will voluntarily permit future contact between the child and a biological parent,even if substantial evidence supports that expectation.the purpose of the relationship exception is to protect the relationship when its continuation is more beneficial to the dependent child than a permanent plan of adoption and,in such case,a court can not leave the protection of such a relationship dependent upon the hoped for of the prospective adoptive parents.
we will remand to allow the court to reconsider,under the proper legal standard,whether the evidence establishes that the relationship exception applies.
sibling relationship exception 
an exception to termination of parental rights exists where a court finds a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child because t here would be substantial interference with a child sibling relationship,taking into consideration the nature and extent of the relationship,including,but not limited to,whether the child was raised with a sibling in the same home,whether the child shared significant common experiences or has existing close and strong bonds with a sibling,and whether ongoing contact is in the child best interest,including the child emotional interest,as compared to the benefit of legal permanence through adoption,subd.c b v see in re,supra,th at.
reflecting the legislature preference for adoption when possible,the sibling relationship exception contains strong language creating a heavy burden for the party opposing adoption.it only applies when the juvenile court determines that there is a compelling reason for concluding that the termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child due to substantial interference with a sibling relationship.citation.indeed,even if adoption would interfere with a strong sibling relationship,the court must nevertheless weigh the benefit to the child of continuing the sibling relationship against the benefit the child would receive by gaining a permanent home through adoption.in re th,in re celine,supra,cal th at.
in this case,both children testified to the importance of their relationship with their older sister c.the court recognized that they had been raised together for much of their lives and had shared common experiences.the court observed that the three siblings each testified to a close bond but they had not lived together for some time.the court stated that current circumstances prevent her from being much of an emotional support to and.she has been on the run since june,has not been attending school,is reported to be pregnant,and has been unwilling to comply with any court orders to return to placement.though the children all clearly love one another,it is difficult for the court to conclude that ongoing contact with outweighs the benefits of adoption.the court concluded that the parents had not established the sibling relationship exception.
appellants assert that there is no indication in the record that the stability and permanence that the children had with their aunt and uncle would be adversely affected by implementing a permanent plan of guardianship rather than adoption.even if the aunt and uncle could provide the children with a stable and permanent environment through legal guardianship,once the court has found it is likely the children will be adopted,the court must order adoption and its necessary consequence,termination of parental rights,unless one of the specified circumstances provides a compelling reason for finding that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the child.in re celine,supra,cal th at see,subd.a the procedures specified herein are the exclusive procedures for conducting these hearings.
appellants further contend that the court lacked substantial evidence to support its finding that the benefits of adoption outweighed the benefit of continuing the children sibling relationship with their older sister c.the wic report indicated that had attended many of the visits with her mother and siblings between october and december but only irregularly due to conflicts with school and other activities.since the children placement with their aunt and uncle in january,there had not been regular contact between the children and and had not visited with them.it was also reported that had not maintained phone contact with her siblings.in fact,at the time the report was prepared,whereabouts were unknown.an addendum report,signed august,stated that continue d to be on runaway status.
when appeared at the section hearing in late october,her testimony confirmed that she did not talk with and much by phone.thus,despite the strength of their feelings for each other,had been largely absent from the children lives since they had been placed with their aunt and uncle in january.she had not lived with her siblings since they and she were taken into protective custody on october.before the dependency,the children had previously lived with their aunt and uncle for over a year but had never lived with her brother and sister at her aunt house.there was no evidence that,if the children were not adopted,but instead placed in legal guardianship,would be able to live with them or would be in closer contact with them.
appellants contend that the court erred in considering activities and with its orders.the juvenile court could properly consider the strength and quality of the children sibling relationship with and whether ongoing contact was in their best interest,subd.c b v.the fact that the court mentioned current circumstances did not mean it was improperly focusing on 
appellants point to psychological evaluations attached to an addendum report filed in july for the review,which were not before the court at the section hearing.although those earlier psychological evaluations indicated the children regular sibling visitation with was important and should be maintained,appellants did not present any expert evidence to that effect at the section hearing.in any event,the court recognized that the children sibling relationships with were significant relationships that were important to the children.but,at the time of the section hearing,when adoption of the children was under consideration,social worker ransom could not say that the children would be harmed if they lost all contact with older sister because there was not a lot of contact between them.
the juvenile court could reasonably conclude,based on the evidence,that,even if adoption would interfere with the children sibling relationships with,the benefit of continuing those relationships with was outweighed by the benefit of adoption and,therefore,the sibling relationship exception to termination of parental right did not apply 
indian child exception 
an exception to termination of parental rights exists where the juvenile court finds a compelling reason for determining that termination would be detrimental to the child because t he child is an indian child and there is a compelling reason for determining that termination of parental rights would not be in the best interest of the child,including,but not limited to i termination of parental rights would substantially interfere with the child connection to his or her tribal community or the child tribal membership rights.ii the child tribe has identified guardianship,foster care with a fit and willing relative,tribal customary adoption,or another planned permanent living arrangement for the child,subd.c b vi,italics added.
even though the children did not meet the statutory definition of an indian child,the court analyzed the section issues as if icwa applied o ut of an abundance of caution.it concluded,based upon information provided by icwa expert osborn that termination of parental rights will not interfere with the children membership rights or their connection to the tribe and the tribe would not oppose the planned adoption by paternal relatives in this case.
appellants assert that the juvenile court erred in finding that the indian child exception did not apply by focus ing only on the cherokee nation and by terminating parental rights before at least the children enrollment was completed.they point out that the children appear to have both choctaw and cherokee heritage and the court did not have any information whether termination of parental rights would interfere with their potential choctaw membership.they also complain that osborn conversation with a representative of the cherokee nation was hearsay and t he cherokee nation did not authorize him to determine the membership status in the tribe.they further claim that the evidence before the court did not show that the cherokee nation would prefer adoption over legal guardianship for these children.without citing any authority,they insist that tribal membership of the children should be resolved before parental rights are terminated.
appellants have not cited any authority permitting the court to postpone the section hearing for some unknown period to allow time for the children to become members in some indian tribe and,thereby,qualify as indian children under federal law.at the review hearing after expiration of the standard period for family reunification services,the juvenile court has limited options,subd.g see,subd.a.where there is no basis for continuing the case for up to six months for a permanency review hearing,subd.g see,subd.a and no basis for determining that there is a compelling reason for determining that a hearing held pursuant to section is not in the best interest of the child because the child is not a proper subject for adoption and has no one willing to accept legal guardianship,subd.g,the only statutory choice remaining to the court is to o rder that a hearing be held within days,pursuant to section,subd.g.
as far as any hearsay objections are concerned,they were waived by the failure to object below,see in re lorenzo th,fn.further,i t is settled law that incompetent testimony,such as hearsay or conclusion,if received without objection takes on the attributes of competent proof when considered upon the question of sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding.citations.people panah cal th.w hen inadmissible hearsay is admitted without objection,evidence code section definition of evidence makes it clear that it constitutes evidence that may be considered by the trier of fact.cal.law revision com,b,pt.west ann.ed.foll,mcdaniel brown,per curiam a reviewing court must consider all of the evidence admitted at trial when considering a jackson insufficiency of the evidence claim.
appellants also assert that osborn declaration did not show that termination of parental rights would not substantially interfere with the children ability to become members of the cherokee nation because the representative statement,which was quoted in his declaration,did not state that membership could be finalized after termination of parental rights.we observe that icwa expert osborn testified that,according to his conversations with the cherokee tribe,it was his understanding that termination of parental rights did not prevent the children from becoming members of the tribe.as stated,on review,w e do not evaluate the credibility of witnesses,reweigh the evidence,or resolve evidentiary conflicts.in re,supra,th at.
finally,a parent claiming an exception to termination of parental rights has the burden of proof.see.in re scott,supra,th at in re,supra,th at in re melvin th,in re jasmine th,see also in re,supra,th at,b urden of proof means the obligation of a party to establish by evidence a requisite degree of belief concerning a fact in the mind of the trier of fact or the court,proof is the establishment by evidence of a requisite degree of belief concerning a fact in the mind of the trier of fact or the court.the burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is initially on the party with the burden of proof as to that fact,subd.b.the b urden of producing evidence means the obligation of a party to introduce evidence sufficient to avoid a ruling against him on the issue,see mccormick,evidence.ed.burden of proof and presumptions,the burden of producing evidence on an issue means the liability to an adverse ruling if evidence on the issue has not been produced.here,appellants did not introduce evidence sufficient to make a prima facie showing that the indian child exception applied,subd.c b vi.the juvenile court properly concluded that the exception did not apply.
active efforts 
appellants argue that the juvenile court and dfcs failed to comply with icwa active efforts requirements.section,subdivision d,of icwa provides any party seeking to effect a foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child under state law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.italics added.in california,icwa active efforts requirement is implemented by section 
section expressly states that t the court shall not terminate parental rights i n the case of an indian child if a t the hearing terminating parental rights,the court has found that active efforts were not made as required in section,subd.c b.although the phrase active efforts is not defined by either federal or state statute,california courts have construed active efforts to be essentially equivalent to reasonable efforts to provide or offer reunification services in a case in re michael,supra,th at pp.in re adoption of hannah th,see letitia superior court th.there is no claim in this case that active efforts to provide or offer the mother remedial services and rehabilitative programs,aimed at preventing the family breakup,were not made.
rather,appellants argument is that the court lacked substantial evidence to support a finding that the department used active efforts to pursue the children enrollment in the cherokee nation this contention is based on rules c and c.rule c states in addition to any other required findings to place an indian child with someone other than a parent or indian custodian,or to terminate parental rights,the court must find that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family,and must find that these efforts were unsuccessful.the court must consider whether active efforts were made in a manner consistent with the prevailing social and cultural conditions and way of life of the indian child tribe.efforts to provide services must include pursuit of any steps necessary to secure tribal membership for a child if the child is eligible for membership in a given tribe,as well as attempts to use the available resources of extended family members,the tribe,tribal and other indian social service agencies,and individual indian caregivers.italics added.rule c further provides that i f after notice has been provided as required by federal and state law a tribe responds indicating that the child is eligible for membership if certain steps are followed,the court must proceed as if the child is an indian child and direct the appropriate individual or agency to provide active efforts under rule c to secure tribal membership for the child.italics added.
initially,it must be pointed out that the statutory active efforts requirements under federal and state statute apply only to an indian child as defined by icwa,subd,subd.d,subd.a.the children were not cherokee indian children under icwa,even though the cherokee nation response indicated they were eligible for membership,since they were neither members of the cherokee nation nor were they biological children of a member of the cherokee nation,subd.moreover,icwa active efforts mandate does not require a juvenile court to proceed as if a child is an indian child when a noticed tribe response indicates that the child is eligible for membership if certain steps are followed.see,subd.d see also.we question whether rule c and rule c are consistent with the controlling statute 
further,to the extent appellants may be attacking earlier dependency proceedings on the ground that the court failed to proceed as if the children were indian children and direct the department to provide active efforts to secure tribal membership for the children in the cherokee nation,those earlier orders are not reviewable on this appeal.see in re th.the juvenile court did proceed as if the children were indian children at the section hearing by making the necessary findings.
in any event,the record supports the conclusion that the department made reasonable efforts to pursue any steps necessary to secure tribal membership for a child if the child is eligible for membership in a given tribe.rule c.the department received a letter,dated june,from the cherokee nation advising that the children could be traced in the tribal records through an enrolled paternal ancestor a and that relationship made the children eligible for enrollment and affiliation with cherokee nation by having direct lineage to an enrolled member.it stated that the cherokee nation could not intervene unless the children or eligible parent applied and received membership.
the letter was attached to an addendum,filed july,to the status review report.in the addendum report,the social worker stated that she ha d completed the registration documents for the cherokee nation tribe and was awaiting their certificate of degree of indian blood.in another addendum report,also filed july,the social worker indicated that birth certificates for paternal relatives were needed and that,on july,she had notified the paternal grandmother,paternal aunts,and father of the needed documents and she was awaiting the family compliance in providing them.
the june,letter from the cherokee nation was also attached to the status review report.the status review report reiterated that the cherokee nation had confirmed that the children may be eligible for enrollment in the tribe.social worker avery reported that she had been working with the paternal relatives to obtain the needed documentation to prove the lineage from enrolled member to the children.she indicated in the report that the paternal grandmother was no longer cooperating with documentation efforts but another relative had obtained needed documents and the social worker had sent the application packet back to the cherokee nation on december.she had been informed by the cherokee nation that the enrollment process could take up to seven months.
a letter from the cherokee nation,dated december,was attached to the wic report,dated may.the letter advised that the children membership application was required to be accompanied by state certified birth death records for all individuals tracing back to an enrolled member and,consequently,the photographic copies were being returned along with the application.
in the wic report,avery gave this update as stated in the month status review report dated,the children may be eligible for enrollment in the cherokee nation.on,the cherokee nation notified this worker that the children application would be kept on file,however state certified certificates were needed for all individuals to establish lineage to the enrolled tribal member.this worker notified the paternal grandmother and requested original birth certificates death certificates for the family members to establish lineage to the register ed tribal members.this worker has not received any of the original documents needed to enroll the children in the tribe.has indicated to this worker in a letter dated that she will not be providing the documents as she does not believe the children should be enrolled in the tribe and has withdrawn her own enrollment from the tribe.
at a may,hearing,the deputy county counsel stated,with respect to application to the cherokee nation,that the social worker had been trying to get the birth and death certificates from the family but had not obtained them yet.the deputy county counsel remarked that if the family does want to enroll and wants to enroll the children,then i think they will need to work with the tribes directly to see if there anything that can be done about missing records.
the record of the hearing on june,indicates that the children paternal had obtained certified copies of birth death certificates from different states,including texas and oklahoma,to support the children cherokee nation application.after a discussion indicating some confusion regarding whether the tribe wanted originals or certified copies,the deputy county counsel stated that if the tribe comes back and says certified copies are appropriate,then at that time we are wondering if she would provides these because you can always get more certified copies.when the court stated that it assumed that the social worker would have to figure out where to get the certified copies,pay the money and take the time to do that,the deputy county counsel replied,no,it their application.it would have to come from them,the certified copies.the paternal unsuccessfully attempted to give the documentation that she had obtained to the court.the deputy county counsel indicated that the paternal great aunt should send the documents to the tribe and agreed that the department would provide the address.the court indicated that it saw no problem with the paternal great aunt sending the documents and that the deputy county counsel would provide needed information.the paternal left the courtroom.the deputy county counsel indicated that the social worker would prepare a cover letter for the signature specifying the case number and the children names and providing the great aunt address so that the tribe could contact her if it had further questions.
an addendum report,dated august,prepared by social worker ransom who had recently taken over the dependency cases,stated the following with regard to efforts to enroll the children as members of the cherokee nation.it stated on,the undersigned received a letter regarding the children from the cherokee nation stating that they can be traced in the tribal record of the cherokee nation this relationship makes the children,eligible for enrollment and affiliation with the cherokee nation by having direct lineage to an enrolled member.a letter and an application for citizenship in the cherokee nation were attached to the report.the application instructions explain that to obtain a certificate of degree of indian blood,the applicant must apply and provide documents that connect the applicant to an enrolled lineal ancestor the application instructed if no one in the family has received certification,attach original state certified documents certificates beginning with the applicant back to the enrollee.the social worker stated in her report that she would complete the membership application for the 
at a hearing on monday august,the deputy county counsel stated that one tribe,the cherokee nation of oklahoma,has said the children may be eligible for enrollment under certain circumstances,which include the rest of the paternal line enrolling in the tribe.paternal indicated to the court that social worker avery had prepared a cover letter for her and mailed it to her the previous friday but had not yet picked it up from the post office.consequently,she had not yet mailed the cover letter and the birth and death certificates to the cherokee nation.there was no indication that was not going to follow through with mailing the documents to the cherokee nation once she picked up the cover letter.
on october,at the contested section hearing,the court indicated that it had received countless letters from a paternal relative named around the indian child welfare act.it was the court understanding that she was attempting to get the family registered but had not yet gotten herself registered.the deputy county counsel indicated that she had no personal knowledge.
although appellants now complain that the juvenile court failed to direct the department to complete necessary enrollment documents so that their tribal membership could be realized,the record indicates that the department did immediately complete and submit membership applications on behalf of the children.after the cherokee nation indicated that membership applications must include state certified birth death records for all individuals tracing back the direct lineage to the enrolled ancestor,the department worked with the family to obtain the supporting documentation.the social worker first attempted to obtain the needed documentation through the paternal grandmother,who withdrew her cooperation.by the time of the june,hearing,however,paternal relative had obtained certificates.although there was some confusion at that hearing about who was responsible for sending that supporting documentation to the cherokee nation,the record indicates that,before the august,hearing,the department had sent a cover letter to enable her to send the birth and death certificates to the cherokee nation.at that august,hearing,it appeared that would be mailing them once she picked up the cover letter from the post office.
the department ongoing efforts to work with family members to obtain the supporting documentation and its provision of the cover letter to a cooperative and willing extended family member were consistent with taking the steps necessary to secure tribal membership for eligible children and attempting to use the available resources of extended family members as stated in rule c.the department was not required to do more under the circumstances.although appellants assert that a deputy county counsel erroneously informed the court that the children could only be enrolled in the cherokee nation if all of their paternal relatives were also enrolled,the apparent misstatement had no bearing on the adequacy of the efforts made by the agency.
appellants insist that the department should have tried to obtain the state certified copies of the birth and death certificates itself.they contend that the department failed to conduct even a minimal amount of investigation to ascertain that the records the tribe required were available to members.they assert that,because california and other states,such as oklahoma,make birth and death records available with a court order,the department might have been able to directly secure the supporting documentation.even if that were possible,we think it is unreasonable to interpret rule c as requiring the dfcs to use its limited resources to attempt to obtain numerous certified copies of birth and death certificates from various states to support a membership application of a dependent child.
further,we have no reason based on the record before us to conclude that the cherokee nation does not have the children applications or that did not promptly follow through by mailing the certificates after the august,hearing,using the cover letter prepared by a social worker.the record does not disclose that the department failed to take any reasonable steps necessary to secure tribal membership for the children and substantial evidence supports the court active efforts finding.
adequacy of icwa notices 
notice requirement 
icwa provides that,i n any involuntary proceeding in a state court,where the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking the foster care placement of,or termination of parental rights to,an indian child shall notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe,by registered mail with return receipt requested,of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention,italics added.california law implements icwa by requiring that notice be sent to the minor parents and the minor tribe whenever it is known or there is reason to know that an indian child is involved in a indian child custody proceeding,and for every hearing thereafter unless it is determined that the indian child welfare act et does not apply to the case in accordance with section,subds.a,b,italics added,see,subd.c,rules,b.notice must be sent to all tribes of which the child may be a member or eligible for membership,until the court makes a determination as to which tribe is the child tribe in accordance with subdivision d of section,after which notice need only be sent to the tribe determined to be the indian child tribe,subd.a.
under the implementing federal regulation,the required icwa notices must include a ll names known,and current and former addresses of the indian child biological mother,biological father,maternal and paternal grandparents and great grandparents or indian custodians,including maiden,married and former names or aliases birthdates places of birth and death tribal enrollment numbers,other identifying information,subds.a,d,italics added.california law requires that the notices contain substantially the same data,including any other identifying information,if known,subd.a c,italics added.the judicial council has proscribed a mandatory form,entitled notice of child custody proceeding for indian child indian child welfare act new january.see.
in this case,appellants contend that the order terminating parental rights of both mother and father must be reversed because the icwa notices contained incomplete and incorrect information with respect to the children potential membership in the choctaw and seneca tribes.
the wic report filed by the dfcs social worker indicated that she had been notified by the paternal grandmother that the children might be eligible for enrollment in the choctaw nation.the social worker had notified the choctaw nation in december and received a response in january.
the december icwa notice for named jennie wingate,billy jackson,phebe wingate as paternal grandparents.it stated billy jackson enrollment number was but gave no enrollment number for phebe wingate.the december icwa notice for named jennie wingate as her paternal grandmother and named billy jackson and phebe wingate as paternal grandparents.it gave the same enrollment number for billy jackson and,in addition,gave an enrollment number of for phebe wingate.the notices were sent to the choctaw nation of oklahoma.
a letter from the choctaw nation of oklahoma,dated january,regarding the indian status of the children and their older sister stated that it had researched its records with the information provided and had been unable to establish indian heritage.the letter explained that,under its constitution,all lineal descendants of choctaw indians whose names appear on the final rolls of the choctaw nation were members.it also stated,please note that all records are pulled by maiden names and date of birth,therefore,the lack of this information may hinder the process.
in the wic report,the dfcs social worker further reported that she had received a letter in january from the children paternal grandmother.the letter indicated that her father death certificate omitted his parents names and she was in the process of having the death certificate amended to show that his parents were lee andrew bynum and jennie jackson.the social worker received another letter in february indicating that the grandmother had an appointment to speak with a lawyer about her father death certificate but,at the time of the report,had not received any further information from her.
on june,at the hearing held to specifically deal with icwa notice issues,father counsel indicated that she had spoken with the paternal grandmother,who had said that her mother was married to a man,purvis sic bynum,whose mother was jenny jackson.in addition,the grandmother had said that jenny jackson was married to a levi bynum.she had also said that jenny jackson mother was phoebe jackson,whose choctaw enrollment number was or,and phoebe was married to henry jackson,whose choctaw enrollment number was or.
icwa notices of the pending section hearings were mailed in july to,among others,the sacramento area director of the bia,the secretary of the interior,choctaw nation of oklahoma,the jena band of choctaw in louisiana,and the mississippi band of choctaw indians.the notices named jennie wingate bynum in the relative information section but did not identify her relationship to the children.they also named the children paternal grandmother as phoebe wingate jackson with a choctaw enrollment number of or and their paternal grandfather as william henry jackson with an enrollment number of or.
appellants contend that the july notices failed to provide legally adequate notice to the choctaw tribes because they did not correctly identify the children as having the maiden name of jennie jackson and as being the daughter of phoebe wingate jackson and william henry jackson.they also argue that the notices,in addition to providing only the name jennie wingate bynum,failed to specify her relationship to the children and,consequently,failed to connect the children lineage to the choctaw ancestors.
by letter stamped july,the department of the interior,bureau of indian affairs informed the dfsc that its records showed that both billy jackson,roll number,and phoebe jackson,roll number,never had any children.the letter indicated that they did not find a jennie wingate bynum enrolled.by letter dated july,the jena band of choctaw indians informed the dfcs that its records did not indicate that the children or their relatives were members or eligible for membership in the jena band.letters from the mississippi band of choctaw indians similarly stated that the children and the parents were neither enrolled nor eligible for enrollment.
here,the notices provided the tribes with a meaningful opportunity to determine the children possible choctaw heritage based upon their purported choctaw.any asserted error in failing to provide a maiden name of jennie jackson and identify her as the children in the notices was necessarily harmless since any purported choctaw heritage was asserted to be through direct lineal descent from enrolled members billy jackson and phoebe jackson and the bia records established that those members had no children.in re cheyanne th,where notice has been received by the tribe,errors or omissions in the notice are reviewed under the harmless error standard.
appellants assert that the dfcs should have sent corrected notices to the seneca tribes before the section hearing because previous notices to which the tribes responded had incomplete and incorrect information.they claim the january notice,which listed the children maternal with a last name of senna,was prejudicially defective because it did not list her as having any tribal affiliation and stated for tribe,band and location,which they claim indicated she had no seneca heritage they further assert that the july notice similarly failed to demonstrate seneca heritage because it did not provide the name senna for children maternal and did not specify the maiden names for the children mother or grandmother.in any event,they point out the july notice was not sent to the seneca tribes.respondent counters that adequate notice was sent to the seneca tribes,which found the children were neither members nor eligible to enroll,and t here is no more information that the department could have provided that would have brought a different answer from the seneca tribes.
in a parental notification of indian status form,filed in october,mother indicated that she might have seneca indian ancestry in addition to the children possibly being a member or eligible for membership in a cherokee tribe but she did not identify any particular seneca tribe.the court ordered icwa notice to be given by the social worker.
an icwa notice sent in november identified the children mother as seneca and cherokee.it named the children maternal grandmother and listed the maternal as elsie margaret hamilton.as to that tribe or band and location,the notice stated.a maternal,pasquali sarpi,was identified as cherokee,sennca sic.the notice was sent to,among others,the bia in sacramento,the cayuga nation in new york,the tribe of oklahoma,the seneca nation of indians in new york,and the tonawanda band of senecas in new york.
by letter dated november,the tribe indicated that the children,their sister,and their parents were not members of the tribe or eligible for membership.
another notice was sent to the same recipients on january,and again identified the children mother as seneca and cherokee.it provided a more complete name for the maternal grandmother and listed the maternal great grandmother as elsie margaret hamilto sic senna.it again stated with regard to that band or tribe and location.a maternal,pasquali sarpi,was again identified as cherokee,sennca.
a letter dated january,from the seneca nation of indians quoted its enrollment ordinance,which made clear that membership was based upon matrilineal descent and eligibility to enroll was available only to those persons whose mother is a member of the seneca nation.it found the children and their older sister,mother and father,their grandmother,elsie margaret hamilton,and other named relatives were not enrolled members of the seneca nation of indians and were not eligible for enrollment.
in a letter dated february,the tonawanda seneca nation stated that the children,their sister,and their parents were not members and they were not eligible for membership.in a letter dated march,the cayuga nation stated the children parents did not have ancestry with the cayuga nation and the parents,the children,and sister were not eligible for enrollment.
on may,further icwa notices were sent to,among others,the sacramento area director of the bia,the secretary of the interior,the cayuga nation in new york,the tribe of oklahoma,the seneca nation of indians in new york,and the tonawanda band of senecas in new york.the maternal was listed as both elsie margaret senna and elsie m a rgaret hamilton.her birthdate and birthplace were also listed.her tribe or band was listed as unknown.a maternal,pasquali sarpi,was again listed but,this time,his tribe or band was listed as unknown.
by letter dated october,the seneca nation of indians again confirmed that the children,mother and father,and other named relatives were not enrolled members or eligible to enroll.
icwa notices regarding the review hearing set for december,were sent to the sacramento area director of the bia and the secretary of the interior but not to any seneca tribe.
at a hearing on may,the children maternal grandmother stated that her parents were not enrolled members of any seneca tribe but the grandmother stated that her aunt was a member and lived on a reservation in arizona.the court acknowledged that a corrected notice might have to be sent indicated that her mother maiden name was senna and her mother grandmother married name was chase.said that she could not remember her maiden name and would have to check her records,which were in storage.the deputy county counsel asked for a hearing at which parents and other relatives would bring all identifying information because so many different items had been sent at different times and she did not know what information was correct.the court accepted that suggestion and ordered parents to appear on june,for the purpose of ensuring proper icwa notice.
at the june,hearing,father counsel informed the court that,prior to the hearing,maternal grandmother had said that her paternal grandfather,george senna,at one point he may have had relations with woman that was n ative american and had children but had not known the name of the native american woman or the names of any children resulting from their relationship.grandmother then spoke up,stating that her grandfather was george senna the children and she had heard that his father the children married an indian woman after his first wife,who was not indian,passed away.she had been told by her older sister that when men married indians,they take on the wife name.the grandmother then stated,so i am not sure which way other than they have children.that could be where the name senna came in,those children.when the court asked whether she was descended from the first wife or second wife and indicated some confusion,stated she was very confused too.
in july,icwa notices regarding the section hearing were sent to the sacramento area director of the bia and the secretary of the interior but not to any seneca tribe.
as previously stated,under california law,notice must generally be sent to all tribes of which the child may be a member or eligible for membership,subd.a,italics added.the phrase all tribes in subdivision a of section has been construed as requiring notice to all federally recognized tribes within the general umbrella identified by the child parents or relatives.in re alice th,notice to all federally recognized apache tribes required in re th,notice to all of the federally recognized cherokee and sioux tribes required.
we are not persuaded by appellants claim that the january notice was defective because was entered in the space for the tribe or band of the children maternal elsie margaret hamilton senna.the record does not establish that the was affiliated with any particular seneca tribe or band.the abbreviation or or na can mean not available as well as not applicable.see webster ninth new collegiate dictionary prince bieber dictionary of legal abbreviations ed,september,see also,subd.e.the january notice provided the name and birth date.appellants have not affirmatively shown that the entry as to the grandmother tribe or band in the january notice rendered it defective and prevented meaningful notice to the seneca tribes.
furthermore,the seneca tribes were again noticed in may and the notices stated the children maternal married name and her maiden name of elsie margaret senna,her birthdate and place,and indicated that her tribe or band was unknown rather than.the noticed seneca tribes did not respond and revise their prior determinations.a determination by an indian tribe that a child is or is not a member of or eligible for membership in that tribe shall be conclusive,subd.e.there is no basis for supposing that the noticed seneca tribes determinations regarding the children ineligibility for membership might have been erroneous due to incorrect information regarding that tribe or band.
appellants also contend that the notices to the seneca tribes lacked some of the known information regarding maternal ancestors and,therefore,new notices should have been sent to them before the section hearing.at the june,hearing to collect all information necessary for proper icwa notice,maternal grandmother theorized that the father of her grandfather george senna the children might have taken the name senna from a second indian wife and the surname senna might have come into the family through their children.but the grandmother did not actually provide the name of her the children or his second wife to the court or did not seem to know whether she was related to the second wife.the grandmother admitted to being very confused and was unable to provide any concrete information regarding the supposed seneca ancestor.the grandmother conjecture did not require the department to send new notices that included the children grandmother whose name was uncertain.but information concerning the children george senna was not previously included in the notices sent to the seneca tribes.t o establish tribal identity,it is necessary to provide as much information as is known on the indian child direct lineal ancestors.b.in re karla th.this additional information should have been provided to those tribes before proceeding with the section hearing.see,subd.a c,subds.e,f b and d.
