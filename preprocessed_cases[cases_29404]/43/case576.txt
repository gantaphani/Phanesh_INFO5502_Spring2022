background 
the underlying dispute in this case derives from the cherokee,choctaw,and chickasaw nations claims settlement act,stat.codified at settlement act or act.this settlement act was enacted by congress to resolve a dispute brought in in the court of federal claims by the cno,choctaw,and chickasaw tribes the settling tribes in which the three tribes alleged that the federal government had mismanaged the arkansas riverbed lands of oklahoma riverbed lands held in trust by the federal government.see united states court of federal claims,case and.
the suit proceeded slowly and was stayed indefinitely pending quiet title actions that the federal government intended to bring against occupants who occupied certain portions of the riverbed lands.this court in cherokee nation of oklahoma united states,vacated the trial court stay.in march of,the ukb submitted an amicus brief urging dismissal of the case,claiming it was a necessary and an indispensable party to the litigation.in early,the cno,choctaw,and chickasaw began settlement discussions with the federal government to draft federal legislation settling the mismanagement claims brought in the suit and extinguishing all tribal claims to certain portions of the riverbed lands.
the settlement discussions between the government and the cno,choctaw,and chickasaw resulted in legislation enacted as the settlement act,which resolved the pending litigation.the act specifically refers to the three named settling cno,choctaw,and chickasaw who were parties to the as the indian nations.the settlement act identifies the riverbed lands to include the drybed lands,disclaimed drybed lands,and wetbed lands.id.one of the major reasons the federal government agreed to pursue the settlement was to avoid thousands of quiet title actions it would have had to bring against landowners in portions of the drybed lands that those landowners had occupied and economically developed.as the act explains 
much of the indian nations drybed lands have been occupied by a large number of adjacent landowners in oklahoma.without federal legislation,further litigation against thousands of such landowners would be likely and any final resolution of disputes would take many years and entail great expenses to the united states,the indian nations,and the individuals and entities occupying the drybed lands and would seriously impair economic planning and development for all parties.
the settlement act was enacted to resolve all possible claims involving the riverbed lands,including all the claims brought against the united states by the three settling tribes in the suit and all claims brought by any indian tribes.specifically,the settlement act resolves two distinct categories of claims.the first category of claims resolved by the act includes claims for mismanagement of the riverbed lands,which lands were held in trust by the united states.the second category of claims resolved by the act includes claims for the extinguishment by the united states of any right,title,or interest in the disclaimed drybed lands.the settlement act explains its purposes in regards to these two categories of claims as applied to the three settling tribes 
the purposes of this title are to resolve all claims that have been or could have been brought by the cherokee,choctaw,and chickasaw nations against the united states,and to confirm that the indian nations are forever disclaiming any right,title,or interest in the disclaimed drybed lands,which are contiguous to the channel of the arkansas river as of the date of the enactment of this title in certain townships in eastern oklahoma.
thus,with respect to the three settling tribes,the settlement act accomplishes two purposes first,it extinguishes any claims against the federal government for mismanagement of any of the riverbed lands and second,it extinguishes any right,title,or interest in the disclaimed drybed lands those drybed lands that had occupied and developed.
in exchange for settling the two categories of claims settlement of the claims of mismanagement of all the riverbed lands and extinguishment of all entitlements to the disclaimed drybed lands,the three settling tribes named in the settlement act received a combined compensation of million from the united states.id.of the million,fifty percent,or million,was authorized for and appropriated to the cno.id.c,d.under the settlement act,the million award was to be appropriated to three separate trust fund accounts corresponding to each of the three named indian tribes in million dollar allotments over four years,from fiscal year to fiscal year.id.
the settlement act,under,also establishes a procedure to resolve any claims brought by any other indian tribe not named in the act as one of the three settling tribes,if the claims are brought under the act and relate to the riverbed lands.id.entitled release of other tribal claims and filing of claims.the settlement act refers to all other indian tribes as claimant tribe s.id.a a.by its terms,does not apply to the cno,choctaw,and chickasaw tribes.id.
in keeping with the overall purpose of the settlement act to extinguish all claims against the united states with regard to the riverbed lands,attempts to annul all claims brought by all tribes if the claims fall within the same two categories of claims that the settlement act resolves with respect to the three settling tribes 
not later than days after the date of enactment of this title,any claimant tribe that claims that any title,interest,or entitlement held by the claimant tribe has been extinguished by operation of section a a or section a a may file a claim against the united states relating to the extinguishment in the united states court of federal claims.
id.b a emphasis added.incorporating by reference a into,the settlement act effectively extinguished indian tribe claims that fell within the first category of for mismanagement of the riverbed lands no claims may be asserted in the future against the united states for actions taken or failed to have been taken by the united states for events occurring prior to the date of the extinguishment of claims with respect to the riverbed.id.a.likewise,a extinguished indian tribe claims that fall within the second category of for the extinguishment of all right,title,or interest in the disclaimed drybed lands 
a ll right,title,and interest of any indian nation or tribe other than any indian nation defined in this act in or to the disclaimed drybed lands,and any such right,title,or interest held by the united states on behalf of such a claimant tribe,shall be considered extinguished.
significantly,all claims brought by indian tribes that fall within the two categories of claims described in the settlement act were extinguished by operation of law on the date the settlement act was enacted,december.id.a.the settlement act,however,includes a provision that permitted any tribe to file a claim against the united states for any claims extinguished by the settlement act,provided that such an action was filed within days after the date of enactment.id.b a.if a tribe failed to file a claim under the settlement act within the statute of limitations,the tribe is barred from filing any claim described in the settlement act.id.b b.
to provide compensation to the indian tribes for extinguishing all categories of claims covered by the settlement act,the statute creates an special holding account that is funded by ten percent of the funds that would otherwise be deposited in a tribal trust account.id.b b.thus,million of the cno million award deposited in the cno trust account established by the settlement agreement was statutorily set aside for this special holding account.id.distribution of the funds in the special holding account depends on whether a claim was filed by a indian tribe within the statute of limitations.if a claim was filed pursuant to b of the act,the funds are not dispersed until a final judgment is rendered following a final adjudication of that claim.id.b b.according to the settlement act,if a final judgment is less than the amount in the special holding account,the remaining funds revert back to the settling tribe trust fund.id.if a final judgment is more than the amount in the special holding account,the entire account is used to satisfy the judgment and the united states provides any additional funds through a separate congressional appropriation.id.
the ukb are descendents of the cherokee people who originally occupied the southeastern portion of the united states in lands presently forming georgia,alabama,tennessee,and the carolinas.through a series of treaties with the united states spanning the period from approximately to,the cherokee indians were granted and to lands now including the state of oklahoma.the ukb claims that as a tribe of the cherokee people,it can sue under of the settlement act as a claimant tribe or tribe to recover damages from the federal government mismanagement of the riverbed lands and extinguishment of any right,title,and interest in the disclaimed drybed lands,which lands were held in trust by the government for all the tribes of the cherokee.
the ukb filed the complaint in this action under b on june,within the period of the statute of limitations.all of the claims in the ukb complaint fall within the two categories of claims permitted by the settlement act to be brought against the united states by a tribe.count i of the ukb complaint seeks compensation for the extinguishment of all right,title,and interest to the disclaimed drybed lands,as permitted under a of the settlement act,which describes the second category of claims.counts ii through vi of the ukb complaint seek damages for breaches of the federal government fiduciary duties with respect to the riverbed lands and the minerals therein.
the ukb is the only tribe to file a complaint under the settlement act.in fact,of the settlement act was included on behalf of the ukb 
several months ago,united keetowah sic band of cherokee indians,ukb,filed a motion to intervene in the court of federal claims lawsuit.although this motion was denied,the department of justice expressed reluctance to endorse the settlement act unless it was drafted to preclude the ukb from either bringing quiet title actions or from petitioning the united states to bring such actions.in order to ensure the ukb was not left without a remedy for pursuing its claims,the justice department proposed that the bill be amended to allow the ukb to pursue such claims in an action in the court of federal claims.in addition,the justice department suggested that be amended to reserve some portion of the settlement proceeds until any claims that can be raised by the ukb are fully and finally litigated.
cong.rec.daily,remarks of senator inhofe.the legislative history indicates that due to the ukb attempt to intervene and dismiss the original lawsuit brought by the three settling tribes,which lawsuit triggered the negotiations that led to the settlement act,the federal government demanded that be included in the settlement act for the ukb benefit before it agreed to a final settlement.the federal government required as part of the settlement act in order to receive its part of the bargain in the settlement that it would not be sued by any indian tribes on claims similar to those resolved by the settlement act.there is no dispute that the cno,choctaw,and chickasaw nations consented and agreed to include in the settlement act and that the cno specifically agreed to the financial provisions including the million special holding account.
the settlement act was enacted on december,thereby simultaneously barring the ukb from bringing a mismanagement suit against the united states and extinguishing the ukb title to the disclaimed drybed lands.pursuant to b of the act,the ukb filed this action in the court of federal claims seeking compensation for the extinguishment of all right,title,and interest in the disclaimed drybed lands and for the federal government mismanagement of the riverbed lands.the ukb is the only tribe to file an action under of the settlement act.
on september,the cno filed a motion in this action for limited intervention as of right under rcfc a for the sole purpose of filing a motion to dismiss under rcfc.in its motion to intervene and motion to dismiss,the cno argues that it is the sole titleholder of all riverbed lands identified in the settlement act and that therefore it is a necessary and an indispensable party to the present action.the cno further argues that the ukb claims are essentially claims against the cno over which the court of federal claims has no jurisdiction because of the cno sovereignty.the court of federal claims granted the cno the right to intervene under rcfc a and found the cno a necessary and an indispensable party under rcfc.because the court found the cno an indispensable party that could not be joined because of its sovereignty,it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the action and dismissed the case.ukb.at.the court entered a final judgment on september.we have jurisdiction over this appeal under a.
the cno contends that it is both necessary and indispensable to the ukb action and that the ukb cause of action should be dismissed under rcfc because the cno can not be joined to the suit because of its sovereignty.the trial court granted both the cno motion to intervene as of right under rcfc a and the cno motion to dismiss under rcfc 
under rcfc,a court must perform a analysis in determining whether a claim should be dismissed for failure to join an indispensable party.first,under rcfc a,the court must determine whether the absent party is necessary.if an absent party is necessary but can not be joined,the court must then determine under rcfc b whether the case should be dismissed.
rcfc a provides in relevant part 
a person shall be joined as a party in the action if 
in the person absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties,or 
the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person absence may 
i as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest or 
ii leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest 
emphasis added.this circuit has not decided whether rcfc a determinations by the court of federal claims are reviewable de novo or for abuse of discretion.we see no need to decide the issue here because we can reverse the trial court decision under either standard.
the parties do not dispute that under rcfc a complete relief can be accorded without joining the cno as a party.accordingly,we do not address this provision.however,under rcfc a,we hold that the cno does not claim an interest relating to the subject of the ukb action,which action was filed under and can be resolved by the settlement act.
while this court has not directly defined the interest requirement of rcfc a,this court has defined the equivalent interest requirement for intervention of right under rcfc a in order to be joined as a party to a pending action under rcfc a,the absent party interest must be of such a direct and immediate character that the absent party will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment.am,united states,emphasis in original.we elaborated in american maritime that the interest may not be either indirect or contingent.
