ivor keelan keelan and david sullivan sullivan together,appellants appeal from the district court granting of summary judgment in favor of majesco software,majesco or the company in appellants title vii national origin employment discrimination case.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court order.
background 
majesco is a wholly owned subsidiary of mastek mastek.majesco has an office in irving,texas.mastek was founded in is headquartered in bombay,india and is publicly traded on the bombay stock exchange.mastek business is outsourcing solutions and technicians for its business customers.majesco is one of several wholly owned international subsidiaries of mastek.majesco sells mastek it products and services to its customers based locally in the united states.
keelan,a citizen of the united kingdom,began working as a regional sales director for majesco on or about august,in the irving office.he was hired as an,with a base salary of,plus a commission structure.he was terminated in late november for nonproduction.a female canadian national was offered his position but did not accept it.
sullivan,a citizen born in el paso,applied to work at majesco in early.majesco president and indian national atul vohra vohra former marketing director for mastek was one of sullivan interviewers.sullivan began working as a director of alliances for majesco,as an,on or about march,in the irving office with a base salary of,plus a commission structure.sullivan signed an employee confidentiality and inventions agreement and an irs withholding certificate with another company,appworx appworx,on june.sullivan took an extended leave from majesco the first week of july.he submitted his letter of resignation dated july.sullivan from indicate he earned more at appworx in the five months he worked there than in the five months he worked for majesco.
during his first four months on the job,keelan generated no sales.his gary hart hart,a national,counseled keelan concerning his sales performance.keelan made three sales between february and april.he made no sales after that.sullivan initial supervisor was also hart.sullivan produced no sales while at majesco.both keelan and sullivan allege that their sales performances were hindered and obstructed at majesco due to the fact they are.appellants also contend majesco inadequate marking materials and website hindered their sales performance.
keelan said he encountered staffing problems because when no technician employed by majesco was available for projects,majesco only brought in mastek indian technicians on work visas and would not staff projects with local hires.keelan stated one time he lost repeat business because the indian workers visas expired and they left in the middle of a project.
sullivan said he encountered similar staffing problems.sullivan stated he was told that the company would not staff one of his projects because it could not get the required people from india.sullivan stated a pattern developed where sales brought to the table by probably were not going to be successful.
another majesco salesperson,jennifer walsh walsh,based out of new jersey,also testified to similar staffing problems.when walsh asked management why the company would not use local people,she stated she was told that americans need too much handholding.walsh was terminated in november for nonproduction.
appellants provided other evidence alleging discrimination.keelan stated that vohra then marketing director for mastek announced at a sales meeting held in india in november that he could foresee a time when mastek would be a totally indian company.on april,vohra was appointed president of majesco.shortly after vohra became president,hart resigned and was replaced by lokesh bhagwat,an indian.keelan stated that in april,immediately prior to hart leaving,he asked hart if the company had a policy of forcing the americans out and that hart replied,is there a document out there somewhere that states that,no is it practice,of course it is.appellants also complained about their working environment,including the lack of windows,the small size of their cubicles,and majesco requirement that they work from the office instead of home.
yvette winfrey winfrey,a,was the assistant human resources director for majesco.winfrey testified that both keelan and sullivan complained to her about discrimination at majesco.keelan said winfrey directed him to the eeoc,but that he had not yet gone to the eeoc at the time of his termination in november.keelan and sullivan also complained to prasad prasad,an indian majesco executive,about what they perceived to be discrimination against.keelan said prasad also stated that americans have never worked out at the company.sullivan spoke to ketan mehta mehta,majesco ceo and an indian,about the apparent discrimination mehta response was,i can see how you would feel that way.
majesco alleges it fell upon hard financial times beginning in fiscal year.the loss of revenues in fiscal year was almost million,and the company suffered a net loss of over million.because of this,on july,majesco announced a new pay plan.this plan consisted of an pay cut all employees earning more than per year received a ten percent pay cut,with senior management receiving an even larger decrease.the plan also modified the commission structure across the board for salesmen.salaries were changed to require draws against commission.for example,if a commission employee had a salary and earned in commission,he would receive the difference of only in commission.the plan also specifically excluded commissions on projects over million.appellants claim the plan gave majesco discretion to divide commissions among salesmen as management saw fit and,in some instances,not even pay commissions,and thus would be a vehicle for favoritism and discrimination.
appellants filed charges of national origin discrimination with the eeoc.they then filed this action against majesco in district court on august,alleging discrimination in the terms and conditions of their employment and in keelan termination and sullivan constructive discharge.the court rejected appellants urging that it analyze their case under the theory.the court determined this was a pretext case under mcdonnell douglas green,d with regard to appellants terms and conditions claims,the court found that the evidence did not support a prima facie case that is,nothing showed appellants were denied any compensation due them or that majesco treated similarly situated indian employees better.as to keelan discharge claim,the court found he did not meet his prima facie case because nothing showed that similarly situated indian salesmen were treated more favorably than he that is,that they were not also counseled and then terminated for poor sales performance.the court stated that even if keelan had met his prima facie case,majesco rebutted with a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for his termination,and stray remark evidence did not raise an issue of pretext.as to sullivan constructive discharge claim,the court found he did not raise a genuine issue of fact on constructive discharge because he was not subjected to objectively intolerable working conditions and because he left majesco for what he perceived to be a better job.the district court granted summary judgment to majesco and dismissed appellants claims.appellants timely appealed keelan discharge claim and sullivan constructive discharge claim.
discussion 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.patrick ridge,cir.under federal rule of civil procedure c,summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c see celotex catrett,d anderson liberty lobby,d.when making its determination,the court must draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the nonmovant.bodenheimer ppg,cir.
whether the district court erred by requiring that appellants provide evidence of similarly situated indian employees receiving preferential treatment to prove up their prima facie case of discrimination.
on appeal,appellants argue that the district court applied an erroneous standard under mcdonnell douglas by deciding that only one method of proof would allow them to meet the essential discrimination element of their prima facie that majesco treated similarly situated indian employees differently than employees.appellants maintain the utilization of this exclusive approach to prove a prima facie case is contrary to supreme court and fifth circuit caselaw,which indicates there is no single route required to establish a prima facie case.see,mcdonnell douglas,at.thornbrough columbus greenville,cir,abrogated on other grounds,mary honor ctr.hicks,d.
appellants agree that the similarly situated type of proof the court required here can be helpful to prove up a prima facie case,but only where the company involved has several similarly situated employees.appellants maintain that each of their jobs was unique sullivan was the only director of alliances,and keelan was the only majesco salesman in charge of the central region.appellants argue that because realistic comparisons can not be made,they instead relied on other evidence.
majesco insists that appellants did not properly challenge the district court formulation of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case in the district court.majesco argues its summary judgment motion put appellants on notice that majesco was seeking summary judgment because appellants failed to establish that similarly situated persons had been treated differently in their terms and conditions of employment,keelan failed to identify a similarly situated person treated differently as to his discharge,and keelan failed to raise a genuine fact issue on pretext as to his discharge.majesco maintains even with two opportunities response to summary judgment and permissive brief,appellants never took issue with majesco statement of the applicable elements of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case.majesco insists appellants said nothing about the lack of similarly situated persons outside their class.instead,majesco argues,appellants only continued to argue that desert palace,costa,d,changed the landscape of title vii law by replacing mcdonnell douglas such that the granting of summary judgment in title vii cases would be severely limited.however,majesco contends this court recently affirmed the mcdonnell douglas formulation as to the fourth element of the prima facie case.see bryan mckinsey,cir affirming summary judgment against black plaintiff where record showed white associate principals also terminated.
the district court used the following formulation of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case plaintiffs must show they are members of a protected class they were qualified for their positions they suffered an adverse employment action and others outside the class who were similarly situated were treated more favorably than they were treated.see urbano cont l airlines,cir.
it is well settled in this circuit that the scope of appellate review on a summary judgment order is limited to matters presented to the district court.keenan tejeda,cir frank bailey,cargill,cir.if a party fails to assert a legal reason why summary judgment should not be granted,that ground is waived and can not be considered or raised on appeal.keenan,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.if a party wishes to preserve an argument for appeal,the party must press and not merely intimate the argument during the proceedings before the district court.new york life ins.brown,cir quoting fdic mijalis,cir.an argument must be raised to such a degree that the district court has an opportunity to rule on it.id.
we note p rior case law has not consistently applied title vii framework to the question of whether a employee outside the plaintiff protected class was treated more favorably.nieto packing,cir.however,based upon our careful review of the record,we agree with majesco that appellants did not properly raise in the district court the argument that showing similarly situated employees were more favorably treated to meet the fourth element of mcdonnell douglas is not required to prove up a prima facie case of discrimination.while appellants objected that their case should be treated under a theory per desert palace,they did not object to the similarly situated disparate treatment formulation of the fourth element of the prima facie case.because appellants did not sufficiently object below,the district court did not have any opportunity to rule on their argument appellants legal argument on formulation is thus waived.see keenan,at brown,at.we can not address this point of error.keenan,at.
ii.whether the district court erred by not analyzing appellants case under the theory.
appellants do not extensively brief the argument that the district court should have evaluated their evidence under desert palace.appellants merely insist that the supreme court did not say what impact desert palace would have on mcdonnell douglas because the result is so obvious it is likely the court felt no need to explain that result being summary judgment is almost never proper.majesco responds that under any interpretation of desert palace,appellants still must demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination,see rachid jack in the box,cir,and they failed to do so here.
under the paradigm,a plaintiff need only show that the protected characteristic was a motivating factor for any employment practice,even though other factors also motivated the practice.m.in desert palace,the supreme court explained in order to obtain an instruction under m,a plaintiff need only present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude,by a preponderance of the evidence,that race,color,religion,sex,or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice.at.desert palace thus answered a disputed question from price waterhouse hopkins,d,clarifying that direct evidence of the motivating factor is not needed to shift the burden of proof to the employer to affirmatively show that it would have treated the plaintiff the same in the absence of the unlawful motivating factor circumstantial evidence of the motivating factor can be enough.at.desert palace had no effect on pretext cases under mcdonnell douglas.see,raytheon hernandez,d noting,in a case palace,the consistent use of the familiar mcdonnell douglas approach for disparate treatment cases.
this circuit has adopted use of a modified mcdonnell douglas approach in cases where the analysis may apply.see rachid,at.after the plaintiff has met his prima facie case and the defendant has responded with a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action 
t he plaintiff must then offer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact either that the defendant reason is not true,but is instead a pretext for discrimination pretext alternative or that the defendant reason,while true,is only one of the reasons for its conduct,and another motivating factor is the plaintiff protected characteristic.s alternative.
id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the question of pretext versus treatment is only reached after a plaintiff has met his prima facie showing under the modified mcdonnell douglas standard and the defendant has responded with a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason.id.if the plaintiff demonstrates the protected characteristic was a motivating factor in the employment decision meets the showing,which pursuant to desert palace may be achieved through circumstantial evidence,rachid,at,it then falls to the defendant to prove that the same adverse employment decision would have been made regardless of discriminatory animus.if the employer fails to carry this burden,plaintiff prevails.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in rachid,this court determined that enough fact issues still remained at the summary judgment stage,after plaintiff had met his prima facie case and the employer had replied with a nondiscriminatory reason,such that rachid case could not be adequately determined to be either pretext or.id.at.
appellants desire that their case be analyzed under desert palace,which is a case,but they also erroneously argue that desert palace changed mcdonnell douglas,which governs disparate treatment cases premised on pretext.the district court acknowledged appellants request.however,the court denied such treatment primarily because it found no evidence that majesco had legitimate and illegitimate reasons for discharging keelan.
as discussed in sections iii and iv below,both keelan and sullivan failed to raise sufficient evidence to support their prima facie cases of discrimination.therefore,this case is distinguishable from rachid,see at,because here the district court did not need to reach the question of whether appellants created fact issues on either or both of pretext or.we thus find no error.
iii.whether the district court erred by finding sullivan had not shown constructive discharge to meet the adverse employment element of his prima facie case.
sullivan argues the district court incorrectly determined that he had not presented enough evidence to create a material fact issue on constructive discharge,which was the adverse employment action sullivan alleged majesco took against him.sullivan protests the court statement that he was not constructively discharged because he had not received a significant change in benefits.sullivan contends the detrimental impact of the new commission structure,coupled with majesco environment in which sales were discouraged,indicated the kind of intolerable working conditions that would force one to resign.in addition,sullivan argues the district court solely looked to the fact that he retained his job title,which is not part of the constructive discharge test,instead of considering how sullivan had less potential to earn commissions under majesco new plan.see pegram honeywell,cir recognizing the disparity in a reassigned employee potential incentive compensation as evidence of an adverse employment action.
majesco responds that sullivan failed to present any evidence of intolerable working conditions that compelled his resignation.majesco contends the evidence sullivan did new pay and compensation plan,being required to work from the office and from cubicles,inadequate marketing materials,and majesco business method of staffing projects with mastek not show discrimination or hostility because these policies and practices were neutrally applied.
this court has explained 
the general rule is that if the employer deliberately makes an employee working conditions so intolerable that the employee is forced into an involuntary resignation,then the employer has encompassed a constructive discharge and is as liable for any illegal conduct involved therein as if it had formally discharged the aggrieved employee.
jurgens eeoc,cir citation omitted.whether an employee would feel forced to resign is,but we consider the following factors relevant,singly or in combination 
d emotion reduction in salary reduction in job responsibilities reassignment to menial or degrading work reassignment to work under a younger or less supervisor badgering,harassment,or humiliation by the employer calculated to encourage the employee resignation or offers of early retirement or continued employment on terms less favorable than the employee former status.
haley alliance compressor llc,cir citing brown kinney shoe,cir alterations in original footnote omitted.the test that sullivan must meet is an objective,reasonable employee test whether a reasonable person in the plaintiff shoes would have felt compelled to resign.barrow new orleans ass n,cir.constructive discharge requires a greater degree of harassment than that required by a hostile environment claim.brown,at.aggravating factors used to support constructive discharge include hostile working conditions or the employer invidious intent to create or perpetuate the intolerable conditions compelling the resignation.jurgens,at.the resigning employee bears the burden to prove constructive discharge.haley,at.
we agree with the district court that sullivan did not meet his burden of showing constructive discharge.to begin,we do not accept that the requirement to work from the office,a policy majesco applied across the board,constitutes hostility or harassment.neither does having to work from a office space all the nonsupervisor majesco salespersons worked from the bullpen.the testimony in the record also reflects that all majesco and the same marketing materials and website.while appellants speculate that the pay cut and change in commission structure would not be neutrally applied,nothing supports that this practice ever took place.the evidence instead shows the blanket,neutral nature of the business decision made in light of majesco revenue decrease.see jurgens,at affirming summary judgment for employer where white plaintiffs were demoted as part of a blanket,racially neutral reorganization.unlike the plaintiff in pegram,who individually suffered a job transfer where less commission was possible,at,the majesco salespersons altogether faced the same potential commission loss under the new plan.we find none of these working conditions objectively constitutes a greater degree of harassment than that required by a hostile environment claim.brown,at.
sullivan also presents no,much less compelling,evidence that his job responsibilities were reduced or that he was assigned to menial work in spite of his job title remaining the same.see brown bunge,cir affirming summary judgment for employer where adea plaintiff suffered a demotion and fewer job responsibilities.there is also no evidence that anyone at majesco ever badgered sullivan by asking him when he was going to quit.see stephens,cir affirming a jury verdict on constructive discharge,where adea plaintiff had not only been demoted,but also faced significant reductions in salary and responsibilities,and was repeatedly questioned by his younger supervisor as to when he was going to quit.
moreover,sullivan accepted a job with another software company prior to the implementation of the new compensation and commission plan.if sullivan had,or perceived he would have,a grievance with the new compensation and commission plan,a reasonable employee would have waited to see just how his paycheck was practically affected before seeking out a potentially higher paying job and resigning.see haley,at noting reasonable employee attempts resolution of employment concerns before quitting mckethan texas farm bureau,cir same boze branstetter,cir same.the district court decided this issue correctly sullivan does not meet the adverse employment action prong of his prima facie case.
iv.whether the district court erred in finding that keelan had not met the discrimination element of his prima facie case under mcdonnell douglas.
we now address whether keelan has presented sufficient evidence to meet his prima facie case and show pretext as to his discharge.the parties here only dispute the discrimination element of mcdonnell douglas whether keelan produced sufficient summary judgment evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact that similarly situated indian salespersons were treated more favorably than pretext keelan attempts to meet this prima facie element with various evidence.keelan first argues that supreme court and this court caselaw indicate the importance of workforce statistical evidence in proving discrimination,which he contends the district court did not give proper weight to here see int l of teamsters united states,d parson kaiser aluminum chem,cir.moreover,keelan argues his and sullivan testimony as well as that of walsh brought the cold numbers of the majesco statistics to life.see teamsters,at.keelan insists that majesco plan to have an workforce had an adverse impact on his ability to sell and the court should not have made the finding that keelan,and not majesco,was the reason keelan did not meet his sales goals.keelan contends making this inference is not proper on summary judgment.see united states diebold,d.
keelan also argues that the district court improperly disregarded all of appella
