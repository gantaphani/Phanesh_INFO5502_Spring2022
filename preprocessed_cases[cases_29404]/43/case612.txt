anthony,a member of the torres martinez desert cahuilla indian tribe,and his mother,brooke,a,appeal an order placing anthony in foster care with an indian family.they contend the placement is not within reasonable proximity to the child home as required under title united states code section,subdivision b,and welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
anthony,born august,is the son of brooke and ronald ronald is a registered member of the torres martinez desert cahuilla indian tribe tribe.brooke has no known indian heritage.the parents,who are not in a relationship,have histories of substance abuse and child welfare interventions.none of brooke or ronald other children are in their custody.brooke two other children are in a guardianship with relatives.three of ronald children were adopted by tribal members through dependency proceedings two others are with an indian custodian.
on november,the san diego county health and human services agency agency filed a petition on anthony behalf after he was detained in protective custody by police,who were responding to reports of a fight at brooke home.brooke,who had left the scene and returned as the police were leaving with anthony,was arrested for public intoxication.police determined that both ronald and brooke were too intoxicated to care for anthony.both parents were charged with child endangerment.
the tribe promptly intervened in anthony dependency proceedings.
the agency placed anthony in a foster home in northern san diego county.the foster mother had some indian heritage but not through the tribe.
on december,the tribe passed a resolution tribal resolution designating the home of and the as the tribally approved and culturally appropriate concurrent adoptive or foster home for anthony.the lived in riverside county,approximately hours from brooke and anthony home in northern san diego county.the tribal resolution stated the tribe primary goal was family reunification.until the family was reunified,or in the event family reunification could not be safely achieved,placement with the was in anthony best interests as an indian child because it preserved,protected and encouraged his connection to the tribe,its culture and community,and his tribal relatives.
the court adjudicated anthony a dependent of the juvenile court on january,subd.b.at the tribe request,and over the agency and brooke objections,the court detained anthony with the.noting the placement created a geographic barrier to visitation,the court ordered the tribe to transport anthony to northern san diego county for supervised visits with brooke.the court said the temporary placement would allow the parties to assess the feasibility of the placement.if the distance created any problems with visitation,the court would reconsider its order at the dispositional hearing.
the dispositional hearing was held on january and.the court admitted in evidence the agency reports and the declaration of silvanna osuna,an indian expert,and took judicial notice of the tribal resolution.the court heard testimony from osuna social worker sara whitney and annette chihuahua,tribal delegate and icwa case assistant.
osuna said anthony should remain in his current placement with the.she believed an indian child should always be placed with a relative or tribal member,if that person was suitable.
social worker whitney did not object to anthony placement with the.nevertheless,she was concerned about the distance from the home to the agency office in escondido,where visitation would occur.in view of anthony age,visits should occur at least twice a week to promote the relationship.a trip was hours,which was a long time for a child to be in a car.
whitney testified the agency did not have the resources to facilitate visits between anthony in riverside county and brooke in san diego county.the tribe said it would help transport anthony to the agency escondido office or arrange for brooke to visit anthony in the home.
in november and december,the agency offered to schedule visitation between brooke and anthony three times a week.as far as whitney knew,brooke visited anthony twice after he was detained in protective custody,once at polinsky children center and once at the previous foster parents home.after the january hearing,the parties scheduled a visit but brooke cancelled it,saying she was ill.a second visit was not set up because brooke did not know her class schedule.whitney wanted to schedule a visit at the agency offices on january from to,but brooke did not have time to visit anthony before the hearing.whitney acknowledged that scheduling visitation had been difficult.
when whitney finished testifying,the court noted that anthony,who was outside the courtroom with,had been screaming and yelling and crying for the last few hours and was a little bit cranky after his nap.
tribal delegate chihuahua testified that after the last hearing,they discussed scheduling visits on january and,and visitation in general.chihuahua understood that visits would occur twice a week on the same day for both parents.tuesdays and thursdays would probably work for her,depending on her calendar.she was responsible for visitation in other cases.chihuahua acknowledged that during the previous week,she had only one day available for a visit between anthony and brooke.when asked whether arranging visitation was difficult,chihuahua replied,i just feel it is difficult because it is a long ride for anthony,too,and mom does have a car,right 
chihuahua said brooke cancelled the january visit,saying she was ill.brooke asked about visiting anthony on january,but chihuahua was not available on that date.they did not set up any other visits.brooke said she had a visit scheduled for january but chihuahua was not aware of it.chihuahua testified that brooke did not cancel today visit,but she asked to change the time from to brooke asked for saturday visits but chihuahua was not available due to an ongoing commitment to another case.chihuahua testified that she might be able to accommodate brooke request for saturday visits by the end of february.
chihuahua said if the court ordered twice weekly visitation,the tribe would abide by that order.she did not know whether the tribe would be able to facilitate visits three times a week because of their other cases.they might be able to find other tribal members who could assist with transportation.funding for transportation was not an issue with the tribe.the issue was scheduling.
the court removed anthony from parental custody.it found that the parties opposing anthony placement with the did not establish good cause not to follow icwa placement preferences,and placed anthony with the.noting that brooke had expressed little,if any,interest in visiting anthony while he was placed in northern san diego county,the court ordered liberal supervised visitation for the parents and authorized the agency to implement unsupervised visitation with notice to minor counsel,and weekend and overnight visits with the concurrence of minor counsel.
discussion 
the united states congress enacted icwa to respond to a crisis in which large numbers of indian children were being removed from their families for placement in homes.mississippi choctaw indian band holyfield,holyfield.icwa was designed to protect the best interests of indian children and promote the stability and security of indian tribes and families by establishing minimum federal standards for the removal of indian children from their families by state courts and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes.in re kahlen d.in re jack th.
to meet its goal to place children in foster or adoptive homes which reflect the unique values of indian culture,icwa establishes placement preferences for indian children who have been removed from their families,b.an indian child in foster care must be placed in the least restrictive setting that most approximates a family within reasonable proximity to his or her home,taking into account any special needs of the child.b,subd.b.in the absence of good cause to the contrary,the preferred placement order for an indian child is with a member of the child extended family a foster home approved by the indian child tribe an indian foster home or an institution for children approved by an indian tribe or operated by an indian organization,subd.b.
brooke and contend the evaluation of an appropriate placement for an indian child is a process.they argue that unless the court first determines that the placement is reasonably proximate to the child home,the placement preferences under title united states code section b,and section,subdivision b,do not apply.they further argue the evidence is insufficient to support a reasonable proximity finding because the distance between the two homes does not support frequent,liberal visitation.brooke and anthony contend anthony placement significantly burdens the implementation of the case plan,compromising family reunification and denying brooke equal protection of the law because her child is a member of an indian tribe.they also assert the court impermissibly delegated responsibility for visitation from the agency to the tribe.
the agency responds that icwa reasonable proximity requirement is one of many factors the court considers in determining a placement for an indian child,but it does not control the placement.it asserts the court properly considered the distance between the two homes when it detained anthony with the,and argues there is substantial evidence to support a finding the placement was within reasonable proximity to the child home.the agency contends the court did not improperly delegate responsibility for visitation to the tribe.instead,accepting the tribe offer to assist with transportation to facilitate visits was in full accord with section,subdivision g,which directs the court to use the services of the indian tribe to secure and supervise the indian child placement.
the tribe states the placement preference is icwa most important substantive requirement.it argues the court is not required to make separate,preliminary findings the placement is reasonably proximate and least restrictive.instead,the court must apply the placement preferences unless it finds good cause not to do so.the tribe asserts there is substantial evidence to support the court finding there was not good cause to deviate from the tribe preferred placement,and argues anthony removal from the tribe preferred home would infringe on its inherent sovereign authority over tribal members and domestic relations.
the parties contentions concerns issues of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.librers black th.
title united states code section b states 
any child accepted for foster care or preadoptive placement shall be placed in the least restrictive setting which most approximates a family and in which his special needs,if any,may be met.the child shall also be placed within reasonable proximity to his or her home,taking into account any special needs of the child.in any foster care or preadoptive placement,a preference shall be given,in the absence of good cause to the contrary,to a placement with i a member of the indian child extended family ii a foster home licensed,approved,or specified by the indian child tribe iii an indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized licensing authority or iv an institution for children approved by an indian tribe or operated by an indian organization which has a program suitable to meet the indian child needs.italics added.

because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent,we look first at the words themselves,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning and construing them in context.people johnson cal th.both title united states code section b and section,subdivision b,clearly state the child shall be placed within reasonable proximity to his or her home.those statutes further provide that absent good cause to the contrary,the court shall give preference to placement with a member of the child extended family,a foster home approved by the indian child tribe,an indian foster home,or a suitable institution,subd.b,subd.b.the word shall is used to express a command.webster new internat.dict,shall is mandatory.
according to the plain terms of the statutes,the court may not select a placement for an indian child unless that placement is within reasonable proximity to the child home.proximate is defined as very near.webster new internat.dict,supra,at.in other words,because reasonable proximity is mandatory,a finding that the placement is not within reasonable proximity to the child home will constitute good cause not to follow icwa placement preferences it is not,as the agency contends,merely one factor out of many the court may consider in determining an indian child foster care or preadoptive placement.
a statute is read with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part.state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi cal th,in re adrianna th,the language is construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme,and courts give significance to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuing the legislative purpose.icwa placement preferences are clearly mandated under federal and state law.b,subd.b.we keep in mind that indian lands may be at some distance from major metropolitan areas.however,in most cases in which a child has been removed from parental custody,the priority is on family reunification.see in re alanna th.family reunification is also mandated by federal and state law,subd.a.the court must also ensure that visitation between parent and child is as frequent as possible,consistent with the of the child,subd.a a.absence of visitation may virtually assure the erosion and termination of any meaningful relationship between parent and child.in re brittany th.when the primary goal of the dependency proceedings is family reunification,the location of an indian child placement must reasonably support that goal,including frequent visitation between parent and child,subd.a a,subd.a.
thus,when there is a controversy about whether a placement is within reasonable proximity to the child home,the issue will be determined on a basis considering the child needs and his family circumstances.it is not simply a matter of determining distance,mileage or travel time.the guiding principle is the child best interests.what may be a reasonable distance for an older child who has an established relationship with his or her parent and may augment visitation with other forms of contact may be an unreasonable placement for an infant whose only meaningful interactions with a parent arise from contact.in some cases,a parent may have the means and time to travel to the child.the court may also consider the tribal resources that are available to facilitate frequent visitation,consistent with the child best interests and the goal of family reunification.see,subd.g any person or court involved in the placement of an indian child shall use the services of the indian child tribe whenever available through the tribe,in seeking to secure placement within the order of preference and to supervise the placement
