factual and procedural background 
the rancheria 
the rancheria is a federally recognized indian tribe operating pursuant to a constitution adopted in and amended in.under the constitution,a tribal council consisting of seven elected members governs the rancheria.the council possesses the power to adopt an enrollment ordinance governing tribal membership.
under the constitution,members of the rancheria consist of a all of the seventeen original distributees listed on the plan of distribution of the redding rancheria,dated october.b all lineal descendents of the seventeen original distributees 
the council,in,adopted the redding rancheria enrollment procedures act act,which sets forth the requirements for enrollment in the rancheria.under the act,the council shall review each application for enrollment together with the recommendation of the enrollment committee and determine whether the applicant is eligible to be enrolled as a member of the rancheria.the person filing an application has the burden of proof of establishing to the satisfaction of the council that the applicant meets all of the requirements for tribal membership.the council shall consider all relevant evidence regarding an applicant eligibility,but the relevancy,weight,and sufficiency of such evidence shall be determined by the council.
the act requires the council to make a written decision that includes findings of fact.the act does not require a formal hearing.if the council determines an applicant is not eligible,the rejected applicant can appeal to the membership of the tribe at a regular meeting of the general council.
in the council amended the act,adding article v,governing reconsideration of enrollment.under article v,if the council or enrollment committee discovers,after an application for enrollment has been approved or denied,that a member may have misrepresented or omitted facts affecting eligibility,the application shall be reconsidered in accordance with the procedure for processing an original application.
reconsideration at issue 
in the summer of the enrollment committee received two letters from a rancheria elder casting doubts upon the eligibility of member lorena butler.the letters suggested butler was not the daughter of virginia timmons,an original distributee listed on the rancheria distribution plan.
lorena ackerman and her fellow plaintiffs are all members of the foreman family,who are the children and grandchildren of butler.the foreman family claims membership in the rancheria through timmons.
the enrollment committee reviewed butler application for membership.the application file contained neither a birth certificate nor baptismal records establishing timmons as butler mother.the enrollment committee notified the council about the deficiencies.
on the basis of the review of the application file,the enrollment committee found that butler might have omitted facts affecting her eligibility for enrollment in the rancheria.under the act,this determination required the council to reconsider butler enrollment.
because of the size of the foreman family and the potential impact on the rancheria,the council adopted resolution resolution.the resolution is titled resolution of the tribal council of the redding rancheria establishing procedures for conducting hearings on a recommendation by the enrollment committee to reconsider enrollment of a tribal member.
the resolution establishes a procedure requiring a hearing officer to preside over a formal hearing on the reconsideration of eligibility.the hearing officer must be an impartial and experienced attorney.the resolution specifies that the hearing officer preside over the hearing,questioning witnesses,ruling on issues of law,and preparing a written decision for council consideration.nothing in the resolution alters the standard governing the burden of proof as set forth in the act.
according to the council,the resolution provides rancheria members subject to disenrollment procedures greater procedural protections than those contained in the act.
the present action 
ackerman filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court against the council members,challenging the resolution.in response,the council filed a motion to quash service of summons,motion to dismiss,and demurrer to the petition.the council argued the trial court lacked both personal and subject matter jurisdiction over ackerman.
the trial court granted the council motion to quash service of summons based on a lack of jurisdiction.the court found the council made a sufficient showing of entitlement to sovereign immunity.
the court,in granting the motion,quoted from santa clara pueblo martinez,d santa clara pueblo that n othing on the face of title of the icra purports to subject tribes to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in civil actions for injunctive or declaratory relief.at.the trial court explained,while the petitioners argue that this case dealt only with the federal court jurisdiction,there is nothing in the reasoning of santa clara pueblo that would limit its application only to federal courts.in addition,to find an exception for state courts would be inconsistent with the rationale of the decision.further,the reasoning of the santa clara pueblo case makes clear that there is no private right of action created by the icra.the petitioners can not establish jurisdiction pursuant to this section whether the suit is considered against the tribe or individual members.
the court also found no jurisdiction by virtue of public law pub,concluding bryan itasca county,d bryan makes clear that the purpose of public law was not to resolve disputes that affect the tribe and its ability to govern itself.the court ruled this is consistent with the rule of law that a petitioner can not avoid the application of sovereign immunity of the tribe,by suing individual members where the real effect of the suit is on the tribe.
following entry of judgment of dismissal,ackerman filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
we begin with a brief review of indian tribal sovereignty.indian tribes are distinct,independent political communities that retain their original natural rights in matters of local.although no longer possessing the full attributes of sovereignty,they remain a separate people possessing the power of regulating their internal and social relations.indian tribes have the power to make their own substantive law in internal matters and to enforce that law in their own forums.santa clara pueblo,supra,at.
as separate sovereigns the united states constitution,tribes have historically been regarded as unconstrained by those constitutional provisions framed specifically as limitations on federal or state authority.however,congress retains the plenary authority to limit,modify,or eliminate the powers of local that tribes otherwise possess.santa clara pueblo,supra,at.
title of the icra,united states code sections represents an exercise of this authority.section states no indian tribe in exercising powers of shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws or deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law.in usc uscs,the on
