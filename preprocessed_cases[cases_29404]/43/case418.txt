facts and procedural history 
on may,the united states,through the bureau of indian affairs bia,entered into a contract with the tribe to perform structural modifications to the bonneau dam on the rocky boy indian reservation in montana.on july,earthwalker engineering earthwalker and the tribe entered into a contract concerning the dam construction july subcontract.on august,earthwalker and the tribe signed an contract for to complete all the modifications to the dam august subcontract.the august subcontract incorporated provisions of a longer general provisions contract.the two subcontracts also incorporated scope of work provisions for the final design and the early warning system of the dam disputes arose concerning earthwalker performance under the subcontract,and the tribe terminated the subcontract on may.
about one year later,demontiney filed a complaint in the chippewa cree tribal court tribal court against the chippewa cree tribal business committee business committee and the tribe.shortly thereafter,demontiney filed another complaint against the business committee and the tribe in tribal court alleging breach of contract.the complaint indicated that p laintiff prays for the chippewa tribal court remedies to be exhausted and move him to the federal court system.in an affidavit attached to the second complaint,demontiney stated that he had appeared before the chippewa cree business committee on this matter and had no relief.demontiney then moved for a default judgment against the business committee and the tribe.the tribal court denied the motion for default judgment and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.the court found that the case was moot because the contract had been completed and the defendant sic have terminated their contractual relationship with the plaintiff due to plaintiff failure to deliver contract documents demontiney had not established that the tribe had waived its sovereign immunity and the proper forum for resolving the dispute was the business committee.two months later,the tribal court issued another order dismissing the case without prejudice and indicated that its ruling could be appealed within five days.demontiney did not appeal the decision.
demontiney also filed a complaint concerning the unpaid balance of the subcontract with a contracting officer of the bia.the contracting officer made a final determination that because there was no contract between earthwalker and the bia,no relief was available.demontiney did not appeal the contracting officer decision.
on november,demontiney filed a complaint against the united states and the tribe in the united states district court for the district of montana.demontiney asserted jurisdiction pursuant to the contract disputes act of,the prompt payment act,and the equal access to justice act.demontiney alleged that earthwalker had entered into a contractual agreement with the tribe to provide engineering services for the dam project,and that the bia had approved the subcontract and had overseen its performance.demontiney further claimed to have exhausted tribal judicial and administrative remedies and administrative remedies under the contract disputes act.
in his prayer for relief,demontiney requested representing the alleged balance due under the subcontract,plus twelve percent interest under the prompt payment act in costs and expenses incurred for performance under the subcontract,plus interest for payment to another firm for work completed in connection with earthwalker performance on the subcontract and attorneys fees under the subcontract terms and the equal access to justice act.
the tribe filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,stating that the subcontract was between a tribal member and the tribe and should be resolved by the administrative,legislative,and judicial branches of the tribal government.the tribe also argued that demontiney had not exhausted tribal remedies,and that the tribe had not waived its sovereign immunity.
the united states filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment.the united states contended that federal sovereign immunity barred demontiney claims against the bia in district court and that the contract disputes act,the prompt payment act,and the equal access to justice act did not provide jurisdiction in this context.the united states also contended that demontiney was not entitled to bring a claim against it under the contract disputes act because there was no privity of contract between earthwalker and the bia.
the tribe filed a separate response to the united states motion to dismiss.in the response,the tribe agreed that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the united states,but argued that there was privity between earthwalker and the bia because of the bia close oversight of the subcontract and the nearly identical terms of the contract and the subcontract.
the district court granted the motions to dismiss of the united states and the tribe.the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction over either the united states or the tribe for demontiney contract claims because neither the united states nor the tribe had waived its sovereign immunity or had its sovereign immunity abrogated by congress.the district court also found that if earthwalker was in privity with the bia,then demontiney would have jurisdiction to pursue his contract claims against the united states under the contract disputes act in the court of federal claims.without making this privity determination,the district court transferred demontiney claims against united states to the court of federal claims.
demontiney appeals.
discussion 
we review de novo whether an indian tribe possesses sovereign immunity,united states james,cir whether congress has statutorily waived an indian tribe sovereign immunity,hopi tribe navajo tribe,cir whether the united states has waived its sovereign immunity,commodity futures trading commission frankwell bullion,cir and whether dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was correct,brady united states,cir.
we address whether the united states sovereign immunity has been waived or abrogated and whether the tribe sovereign immunity has been waived or abrogated.
federal sovereign immunity 
for demontiney to state a claim against the united states in district court,he must establish privity of contract with the bia and a waiver of federal sovereign immunity.we need not resolve privity because no waiver of federal sovereign immunity has been shown.demontiney asserts waiver or abrogation of federal sovereign immunity arising from the indian and education assistance act the contract disputes act the prompt payment act and the equal access to justice act.we consider each,but none shows a waiver.
a.the indian and education assistance act 
demontiney argues that the indian and education assistance act isdeaa waives the united states sovereign immunity for an action brought by demontiney under the contract disputes act.we disagree.the isdeaa waiver of federal sovereign immunity is limited to contracts entered into by indian tribes or tribal organizations and the government.because demontiney can not establish that he or earthwalker is a tribe or tribal organization,he could not have entered into a contract with the bia.
in,congress passed the isdeaa,stat.codified as amended principally at et.congress incorporated into the isdeaa findings that state in part 
t he prolonged federal domination of indian service programs has served to retard rather than enhance the progress of indian people and their communities by depriving indians of the full opportunity to develop leadership skills crucial to the realization of,and has denied to the indian people an effective voice in the planning and implementation of programs for the benefit of indians which are responsive to the true needs of indian communities.
congress enacted the isdeaa to encourage indian and tribal control over administration of federal programs for the benefit of indians,by authorizing contracts between the united states,through the secretaries of the interior and of health and human services,and indian tribes.
in,congress amended the isdeaa to waive federal sovereign immunity in federal district court for certain contract claims.indian and education assistance act amendments of,stat.codified as amended at et 
the united states district courts shall have original jurisdiction over any civil action or claim against the appropriate secretary arising under this subchapter and,subject to the provisions of subsection d of this section and concurrent with the united states court of claims,over any civil action or claim against the secretary for money damages arising under contracts authorized by this subchapter.
a.subsection d provides 
the contract disputes act public law,act of november,stat,as amended shall apply to contracts,except that all administrative appeals relating to such contracts shall be heard by the interior board of contract appeals established pursuant to section of such act.
these provisions grant the district court concurrent jurisdiction over suits against the federal government for contract claims arising under contracts as defined by the isdeaa.
a contract is defined as 
a contract or grant or cooperative agreement utilized under section of this title entered into under part a of this subchapter between a tribal organization and the appropriate secretary for the planning,conduct and administration of programs or services which are otherwise provided to indian tribes and their members pursuant to federal law.
a tribal organization is defined,in pertinent part,as 
t he recognized governing body of any indian tribe any legally established organization of indians which is controlled,sanctioned,or chartered by such governing body or which is democratically elected by the adult members of the indian community to be served by such organization and which includes the maximum participation of indians in all phases of its activities 
the parties agree that the underlying contract is a contract.demontiney argues that earthwalker also entered into a contract with the bia.demontiney relies on selected parts of statutory language in section of amendments to the isdeaa that he contends create a waiver of sovereign immunity for his contract claims against the united states 
with respect to claims resulting from the performance of functions under a contract,grant agreement,or cooperative agreement authorized by the indian and education assistance act an indian tribe,tribal organization or indian contractor is deemed hereafter to be part of the bureau of indian affairs in the department of the interior while carrying out any such contract or agreement and its employees are deemed employees of the bureau while acting within the scope of their employment in carrying out the contract or agreement provided,that after september,any civil action or proceeding involving such claims brought hereafter against any tribe,tribal organization,indian contractor or tribal employee covered by this provision shall be deemed to be an action against the united states and will be defended by the attorney general and be afforded the full protection and coverage of the federal tort claims act 
title iii,stat,codified at notes citations omitted.demontiney argues that the above language referring to an indian contractor becoming part of the bia in the department of interior and referring to claims being brought against any indian contractor support his arguments of waiver of immunity.he argues that the isdeaa provisions cited above,read together,authorize him as a private party to enter into a contract with the bia and provide a waiver of federal sovereign immunity under the contract disputes act pursuant to.
we reject demontiney argument.the language of section,including the term indian contractor,applies to tort claims brought under the federal tort claims act ftca against a contractor who has a contract.however,this language does not support a claimed waiver of sovereign immunity in a contract action such as demontiney.
we agree with the eighth circuit reasoning in fgs constructors,carlow,cir,that congress did not intend contracts to include contracts entered into by private parties.in fgs constructors,the united states,through the bia,and the oglala sioux tribe entered into a contract pursuant to the isdeaa to repair a dam located on an indian reservation.id.at.the tribe entered into an agreement with a project engineer and a general contractor the general contractor,in turn,hired fgs constructors as a subcontractor to perform key repair and reconstruction work.id.at.fgs constructors brought an action in district court against the united states under the ftca for negligence of the general contractor imputed to the federal government.id.the district court dismissed the claim against the united states for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.
affirming the district court dismissal of the tort claim,the circuit court expressly considered the language of section and held that the isdeaa only waived sovereign immunity for claims brought by tribal organizations that entered into contracts and did not contemplate suits by private parties.id.at.quoting the definition of a contract in j,which is restricted to contracts between a tribal organization and the appropriate secretary,the court concluded that the purpose and policy of the isdeaa are best served if indian contractor is limited to a organization that may itself enter into a contract,not a private party that has been retained to work on a project funded by a contract.id.at see also dawavendewa salt river project agric.improvement power,cir citing fgs constructors and concluding that contracts only involve situations arising pursuant to particular contracts between tribes and two departments within the federal government wooten hudson,d,holding that private individuals can not enter into a contract comes flying united states.
this view is reinforced by the legislative history of the indian and education assistance act amendments of,which defines a contract as an intergovernmental contract that is not a procurement contract.this definition recognizes the unique nature of contracts between the federal government and indian tribal governments,or tribal organizations authorized by tribal governments to enter into such contracts with the federal government,at,reprinted in.to expand the definition of contracts to include private parties,contrary to the definition provided by congress,would undermine tribal authority and the isdeaa goal to assist tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal governments,capable of administering quality programs and developing the economies of their respective communities.b.
demontiney claims for breach of contract do not arise under a contract even if we assume that demontiney is in contractual privity with the bia by virtue of his contract with the tribe,demontiney is not a tribe or tribal organization and can not be considered to be a party to a contract.because demontiney is not a party to a contract,he can not take advantage of the isdeaa waiver of federal sovereign immunity for claims in district court.although waives sovereign immunity in district court for contract actions pertaining to disputes arising from contracts,nothing therein provides support for demontiney argument that a sovereign immunity waiver permits his claims against the united states in district court 
demontiney also contends that federal regulations passed pursuant to the isdeaa governing contracts contemplate a waiver of sovereign immunity by the united states to the extent that a contractor or tribe becomes embroiled in litigation.we do not agree.the regulations cited by demontiney require a tribe that enters a contract to comply with equal opportunity in hiring and to direct subcontractors to comply with such requirements.the regulations also allow a tribe to request that the united states join the tribe litigation with subcontractors over equal opportunity issues to protect the united states interest.finally,the regulations require a tribe to maintain insurance and prohibit the insurance carrier from invoking the tribe sovereign immunity as a defense.these regulations do not abrogate the united states sovereign immunity.
prompt payment act 
demontiney contends that the prompt payment act,et,gives subject matter jurisdiction here.we disagree.the prompt payment act is not an independent basis of jurisdiction.it provides for the payment of interest by the government on its debts.the district court correctly concluded that the prompt payment act only applies in situations,not present here,where payment and amount of payment are not in dispute.l a jackson enters.united states,fed.cl,aff sub nom.jackson united states.the prompt payment act does not provide demontiney with subject matter jurisdiction for his contract claims.
equal access to justice act 
demontiney contends that the equal access to justice act,and,provides a waiver of the united states sovereign immunity for his contract claims.the text of the statute does not support demontiney argument.the statute states,in pertinent part 
an agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award,to a prevailing party other than the united states,fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with that proceeding,unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
the supreme court has held that the equal access to justice act waiver of sovereign immunity is limited the equal access to justice act renders the united states liable for attorney fees for which it would not otherwise be liable,and thus amounts to a partial waiver of sovereign immunity.any such waiver must be strictly construed in favor of the united states.ardestani ins,d see also sorenson mink,cir.because demontiney has not prevailed on any claim,the equal access to justice act is not applicable and does not provide subject matter jurisdiction.
contract disputes act 
demontiney contends that the contract disputes act of,et,provides district court jurisdiction for his contract dispute.however,the contract disputes act,in conjunction with the tucker act,a and the little tucker act,a,do not waive federal sovereign immunity for district court jurisdiction here.instead,the statutes grant the court of federal claims jurisdiction to adjudicate any contract claims demontiney might have against the united states.
the tucker act provides jurisdiction in the court of federal claims for claims against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states.a.the little tucker act,as amended by the contract disputes act,gives district courts concurrent jurisdiction with the court of federal claims for 
any other civil action or claim against the united states,not exceeding in amount,founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress,or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort,except that the district courts shall not have jurisdiction of any civil action or claim against the united states founded upon any express or implied contract with the united states or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort which are subject to sections g and a of the contract disputes act of.
the little tucker act does not give district courts jurisdiction for contract claims exceeding,and does not give district courts jurisdiction for claims covered by sections g and a of the contract disputes act.id.the district court does not have jurisdiction over demontiney claims under the little tucker act because his claims under the subcontract for the unpaid balance exceeds the limit and his claims arise,if at all,under section a of the contract disputes act a.see id.
here,any contract claim demontiney might have against the united states would be covered by the contract disputes act because he claims contractual privity with a federal executive agency,the bia,and the contract concerns the procurement of services or the procurement of construction,alteration,repair,or maintenance of real property.a.see also janicki logging mateer,cir.demontiney submitted his claim in writing to a contracting officer who rejected the claim,but demontiney did not follow the contract disputes act procedure of appealing the contracting officer adverse decision to the agency board of contract appeals.see a.demontiney also did not follow the alternative procedure of filing a claim in the court of federal claims.see a.instead,demontiney filed his claims against the united states in federal district court.that court correctly concluded it lacked jurisdiction and the court ordered demontiney claims against the united states transferred to the court of federal claims pursuant to.see mendenhall kusicko,cir 
conclusion 
the united states has not waived its sovereign immunity to suit in district court,and demontiney only possible basis for federal court jurisdiction is now in the court of federal claims.
ii.tribal sovereign immunity 
demontiney contends that the tribe has waived or had its sovereign immunity abrogated by congress.the supreme court has repeatedly declared a presumption favoring tribal sovereign immunity.suits against indian tribes are barred by sovereign immunity absent a clear waiver by the tribe or congressional abrogation.oklahoma tax comm citizen band potawatomi indian tribe,d see also santa clara pueblo martinez,d congressional abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity can not be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.there is a strong presumption against waiver of tribal sovereign immunity.pan am.sycuan band of mission indians,cir.
demontiney advances four theories that he claims show waiver or abrogation of the tribe sovereign immunity the subcontract waives the tribe sovereign immunity for disputes arising under the subcontract the isdeaa abrogates tribal sovereign immunity the tribe waived sovereign immunity by incorporating the indian civil rights act into its constitution and the absence of a meaningful tribal remedy creates a waiver of sovereign immunity.
contractual waiver 
demontiney argues that the tribe waived its sovereign immunity by the terms of its subcontract with earthwalker,citing provisions from the july subcontract,the august subcontract,and the general provisions contract incorporated into the august subcontract.
in the july subcontract,demontiney cites two provisions,one indicating that the subcontract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the chippewa cree tribe and the other granting the chippewa cree tribal court exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising under the agreement paragraphs,a provision authorizing an award of reasonable attorneys fees and other court costs for successful defense of a contract breach paragraph a severability provision providing for the enforceability of the remaining provisions of
