the indian child welfare act of et icwa establishes minimum federal standards a state court must follow when removing an indian child from his or her family.congress has defined indian child for these purposes as any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.
we granted review to consider whether two state court rules adopted to implement icwa are valid.when a child is eligible for tribal membership but is not an indian child as defined in icwa,rule c of the california rules of court requires the juvenile court to proceed as if the child is an indian child and to take steps to secure tribal membership for the child.ibid.we conclude rule c is invalid because it conflicts with the legislature intent to enforce icwa by codifying its provisions,including the federal definition of indian child see welf,subd.a,thus leaving cases not involving indian children subject to the statutes generally applicable in dependency proceedings.rule c is inconsistent with those statutes,and with the legislature intent,and thus invalid.in contrast,the related rule c merely directs the juvenile court to pursue tribal membership for a child who is already an indian child as defined in icwa,in order to prevent the breakup of the indian family and to qualify the child for tribal services.this rule is consistent with state law and valid.
background 
this is an appeal from a child dependency proceeding involving the minors abbigail born and justin born.in december,the sacramento county department of health and human services dhhs filed petitions in the juvenile court alleging the children were dependents of the court because their mother,jaime,could not adequately supervise and protect them.see welf,subd.b.the court removed the children from jamie custody and placed them temporarily with their maternal grandmother.at a subsequent hearing joseph acknowledged paternity,and the court found he was the children biological and presumed father.joseph,while not a member of an indian tribe,informed the court he believed he had cherokee ancestry.to obtain the information necessary to determine whether abbigail and justin were indian children to whom icwa applied,the court ordered dhhs to notify the relevant tribes pursuant to federal and state law.see a welf,subd.a.
in january,the cherokee nation informed the dhhs by letter that abbigail and justin were eligible for enrollment and affiliation with cherokee nation by having direct lineage to an enrolled member,namely joseph.however,despite their eligibility for membership in the tribe,the children were not indian children because neither of their biological parents was a member.see.the letter continued cherokee nation is not empowered to intervene in this matter unless the or eligible parent s apply for and receive membership.however,when tribal enrollment of the parent or occurs the tribe must be notified of their right to intervene.due to the tribal eligibility of the children in question,cherokee nation recommends applying all the protections of icwa to this matter from the beginning of the case.hopefully this will prevent any future delays in procedural matters if or when the parents or become enrolled members 
in view of the tribe response,joseph informed the court he intended to apply for membership.following rule c,the court stated it would proceed as if abbigail and justin were indian children to whom icwa applied.dhhs objected that icwa did not apply because the children were not indian children as defined by that law.in response,the court explained that it seems likely icwa will apply,given joseph intention to pursue tribal membership,and that it would really seem to be in everyone interest to treat this case as what it likely to become and thus avoid the need for additional,future proceedings to comply with icwa should the children status change before disposition.the dhhs moved for reconsideration,arguing rule c was invalid.the court denied the motion and,following rule c,stated it would proceed as if icwa applied.the court followed the same rule by directing the dhhs and counsel to make reasonable efforts to secure tribal membership for the children.two continuances were granted for this purpose.
in may,joseph and counsel for abbigail and justin reported the applications for tribal membership were still pending because the tribe required additional birth and death certificates.continuing to proceed as if icwa applied,the court held a jurisdictional and dispositional hearing.see welf.as icwa would require,the court heard expert testimony to the effect that continued custody of abbigail and justin by their parents was likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage see e,f and found that fact to be true by clear and convincing evidence see e,f.also as icwa would require,the court found that reasonable efforts had been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the indian family and that those efforts had proved unsuccessful see d,and that the children placement with their maternal grandmother met icwa placement preferences see b i a member of the indian child extended family.based on these findings,the court adjudged the children to be dependents of the court and ordered them placed with their maternal grandmother.
the dhhs appealed.the agency contended that rule c and related rule c were invalid,and that the juvenile court erred by proceeding as if icwa applied and directing the agency to make efforts to secure tribal membership for the children.the court of appeal concluded the rules conflicted with state law and reversed.without disturbing the juvenile court jurisdictional and dispositional findings,which no party has challenged,the court of appeal ordered the juvenile court to enter a new judgment that does not direct the application of icwa provisions to the minors,until such time as they may qualify as indian children under the icwa and california definitions of the class.
we granted joseph petition for review.
ii.discussion 
congress adopted icwa in response to concerns over the consequences to indian children,indian families,and indian tribes of abusive child welfare practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of indian children from their families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement,usually in homes.adoptive couple baby girl d,quoting mississippi choctaw indian band holyfield.icwa addresses these concerns by establishing minimum federal standards for the removal of indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of indian culture,and by providing for assistance to indian tribes in the operation of child and family service programs.
in any given case,icwa applies or not depending on whether the child who is the subject of the custody proceeding is an indian child.congress defined indian child for these purposes to mean any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either a a member of an indian tribe or b is eligible for membership in an indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an indian tribe.when applicable,icwa imposes specific requirements on child custody proceedings in state court.among other things,when the court knows or has reason to know that an indian child is involved,the party seeking to remove the indian child from the custody of its parent or indian custodian,or to terminate parental rights,must notify the parent or indian custodian and the indian child tribe of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention.a.if the parent,indian custodian or tribe can not be determined,notice must be given to the bureau of indian affairs bia.ibid.the tribe may intervene at any point in the proceeding,c.under certain circumstances,the court must transfer such proceeding to the jurisdiction of the tribe,subd.b.if the proceeding is not transferred,the party seeking to remove an indian child must satisfy the court that active efforts have been ma
