gary raymond ahidley,pleaded guilty to assault with a dangerous weapon count,a,and assault resulting in serious bodily injury count,a,charges resulting from a crime he committed in indian country.ahidley was sentenced to months imprisonment.
ahidley offenses implicated the mandatory victims restitution act of mvra.restitution was ordered in the amount of,with payment due immediately.ahidley now appeals the restitution order.he contends that there was insufficient evidence to justify the amount of the restitution award and that the district court erred in imposing an immediate obligation to pay restitution,instead of establishing a reasonable restitution payment schedule after considering his financial resources and other factors.
we have jurisdiction under.we affirm the district court order regarding the restitution amount.however,we conclude that the district court plainly erred in imposing an restitution obligation on ahidley without consideration of the requisite mvra factors.accordingly,we vacate that aspect of its restitution order and remand for the court to set an appropriate payment schedule.
background 
on october,ahidley and his girlfriend ava joyce pollock,along with two of her children,were staying the night at his cousin home.the couple had been drinking alcohol throughout the day,and ahidley admitted he was intoxicated.according to ahidley,pollock was belittling him and fussing about his haircut.vol.ii,presentence investigation report psr.he attempted to hold her to talk,but she pulled away.this angered ahidley,and he pulled a pocket knife out and stabbed pollock.one of pollock children witnessed the incident.the stabbing occurred late in the evening,after 
ahidley claims he did not intend to stab pollock,but she was standing too close.id.after realizing she was injured,pollock woke the defendant sister,tracey ahidley,who also was staying at the home,and asked her for a ride to the hospital.ahidley drove pollock and her children to the hospital in ruidoso,new mexico.
the stab wound resulted in lacerations to pollock liver and kidney,and a penetrating trauma to her ascending colon.the serious nature of the wounds necessitated airlifting pollock to a hospital in lubbock,texas for treatment and surgery.she remained in the hospital for one week.the treating physician estimated eight weeks for recuperation,but he expected a full recovery.
ahidley pleaded guilty to the charges on july,and the probation office prepared a presentence investigation report psr.the psr noted that ahidley was a highschool dropout who apparently had no specialized skills or training.ahidley reported having no assets or liabilities.the probation office examination of a credit report confirmed the latter,the absence of liabilities and indicated that ahidley had no credit at all.at the time of his arrest,ahidley was living with,and being supported by,family members.the psr concluded that based upon his financial situation,ahidley does not have the means to pay a fine.id.
however,the psr noted that the mvra was applicable to ahidley case and required the district court to order restitution for his criminal conduct,without consideration of ahidley ability to pay.the initial psr stated that ahidley owed restitution to cardiology consultants in the amount of and lubbock diagnostic radiology in the amount of.the report noted medicaid officials would be submitting a request for restitution within days.
on october,the probation office amended the psr to include a request for restitution in the amount of from the new mexico human services department,medical assistance division nmhsd.the claim was submitted on an apparent form letter stating that the nmhsd medicaid program provided assistance to pollock for treatment that may be related to the accident that occurred on or around october.vol.ii,psr addendum,nmhsd letter at.
on january,more than three months after the psr was initially amended,ahidley filed a sentencing memorandum objecting to certain aspects of the report.see vol.i,doc.ahidley mentioned the psr restitution figure in a brief passage of his memorandum.id.at.he devoted the bulk of his energy,however,to challenging the psr findings a that pollock suffered an injury between serious and and b that the appropriate criminal history category was iii.id.at.on february,the probation office filed another addendum.it represented to the court that the addendum fairly state d any objections that have been made.id.vol.ii,psr addendum at.the addendum addressed ahidley objections concerning the bodily injury enhancement and his criminal history.it made no mention,however,of the restitution amount.more specifically,it did not aver that ahidley had raised any objections concerning restitution.
the district court sentenced ahidley on february.during the sentencing hearing,when the topic turned to restitution,ahidley counsel interposed an objection he stated,your honor,one thing about restitution.i assume that there evidence supporting that.it was my intention to object to the restitution,if the court does have evidence before it supporting the restitution award.vol.iii,tr.sentencing hearing at.the court noted the objection,but referred to numerous claims listed in the psr.id.at.it ordered restitution in the amount cited by the probation office,which the government noted was around.id the court declined to impose a fine b ased upon ahidley resources.id.
the district court was silent at the sentencing hearing regarding the schedule of is,about the timetable that would control ahidley obligation to pay the restitution.in its written judgment docketed three days after the sentencing,however,the district court specifically addressed this issue.it stated the restitution will be paid immediately.id.doc,at.
ii.discussion 
we review the legality of an order of restitution de novo.see united states nichols,cir.the factual findings supporting restitution are reviewed for clear error and the amount of restitution for abuse of discretion.see united states osborne,cir.ahidley acknowledges that he did not preserve an objection to the restitution payment schedule however,we may review for plain error.see united states overholt,cir see also.b a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court attention.
amount of restitution 
because ahidley was convicted of a crime of violence,the mvra required the district court to order restitution to the victims of the offense.see a,c a i requiring restitution for crimes of violence see also defining crime of violence.the mvra calls for restitution in the full amount of each victim losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.f a.this amount should include costs for the necessary medical services for recovery.see id.b a.
we have recognized that the determination of restitution is not an exact science and that the calculation of a loss need not be precise.united states kravchuk,cir.in assessing the reliability of loss figures,courts are permitted to draw inferences from the totality of the circumstances through an exercise of logical and probabilistic reasoning.united states atencio,cir internal quotations omitted quoting united states jones,cir noting that an appellate court will uphold a criminal conviction when the jury factual inferences in support of the verdict are based upon logical and probabilistic reasoning.
ahidley argues that the nmhsd letter requesting restitution in the amount of is insufficient evidence on which to base the restitution amount because it does not detail the actual medical services rendered to pollock.he further asserts that there is nothing to demonstrate that the treatment pollock received,for which nmhsd claimed reimbursement,was limited to injuries caused by his offense.ahidley hinges his argument on a seventh circuit decision and the equivocal language of the nmhsd letter,which requests reimbursement for treatment that may be related to the incident.
we are unpersuaded by ahidley arguments.nothing in the record would have given the district court a reason to question the loss amount claimed by nmhsd.furthermore,its probable accuracy was supported by inferences that the district court could have reasonably made from the evidence regarding the severity of pollock injuries and the medical interventions undertaken to treat her.in other words,the amount claimed by nmhsd for pollock medical care is consistent with the expenditures one might reasonably expect to be required to medically treat someone under similar circumstances.
in commenting on the extent of the injuries that ahidley inflicted upon her,pollock stated 
ahidley was the reason why i was in this hospital and had to have surgery done.i was in the hospital for about one week.i had surgery on my liver and kidney.my liver was stitched,but my kidney was left alone because it was cut in half.i was suppose sic to go for a,but i have because of the cost.for about two months after i left the hospital a home health nurse came twice a day to clean my wounds on my stomach and right side.
vol.ii,psr.in sum,a hospital incurred costs to treat pollock,including performing surgery to repair her vital organs,and providing her with a bed,and presumably nursing care,for one week.and,after the surgery,pollock still needed costly treatment home healthcare providers treated her for about two months.in light of these facts,the figure that nmhsd claimed as reimbursement for covering the costs of pollock treatment seems entirely reasonable.and the district court could properly conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that it was accurate.
the probation office made a specific request to nmhsd for information related to costs that it incurred for the medical treatment of pollock injuries,which ahidley caused on october.one can not reasonably conclude that,in responding to this federal governmental entity,nmhsd would have elected to include costs associated with any other treatment.nor has there been any credible suggestion that pollock suffered injuries around october that were unrelated to ahidley criminal conduct.the fact that nmhsd could have employed more unqualified language in its more direct than the phrase may be related to is of little significance.although directly addressing the question of costs incurred in connection with pollock treatment,nmhsd correspondence was basically a generic form letter.see supra note.the district court properly relied upon the nmhsd letter in setting the amount of restitution.
ahidley contrary argument relies on united states menza,cir.there,the seventh circuit vacated a restitution award and remanded for an evidentiary hearing because it concluded that the sentencing court had not developed an adequate record to permit appellate review.menza,at.in particular,the seventh circuit concluded that the sentencing court had given an inadequate explanation and insufficient reasoning regarding its acceptance on their face of invoices of the drug enforcement administration and defendant landlord and that it needed to determine whether the losses incurred by the dea and meriter the landlord are specifically attributed to and directly related to the criminal conduct that formed the basis for defendant convictions.id.at.
menza is readily distinguishable.the two invoices at issue in menza raised more questions than they answered.it was undisputed that the reimbursement amount claimed in the dea invoice included costs for the disposal of items that were not related to defendant offense.id.at.in that circumstance,the failure of the invoice to itemize identifying costs related to the offense a major deficiency.further,the landlord invoice raised a significant possibility of,in that it showed that the landlord was seeking reimbursement for environmental assessment and work that appeared to be similar to the kind of activities for which the dea was separately seeking reimbursement.id.at.given the problematic nature of these invoices,it is hardly surprising that the seventh circuit questioned why the sentencing court would accept them on their face.
in contrast to menza,the documentation at issue its with reasonable certainty the losses recoverable through a restitution order.in particular,it did not raise concerns about the inclusion of costs.this documentation related to one thing and one thing costs incurred by nmhsd for care provided to pollack for injuries she suffered on october,at ahidley hands.given this singular focus,unlike the situation in menza,the district court would not have been impeded in arriving at a proper restitution amount by the absence of a specific itemization of costs.accordingly,ahidley reliance on menza is misplaced.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in setting the restitution amount.
payment schedule 
the mvra outlines the procedure for issuing and enforcing restitution orders and provides that the district court shall specify in the restitution order the manner in which,and the schedule according to which,the restitution is to be paid.f.the court is granted considerable discretion in structuring a payment schedule.overholt,at.the statute provides 
a restitution order may direct the defendant to make a single,payment,partial payments at specified intervals,payments,or a combination of payments at specified intervals and payments.
f a.furthermore,when the court finds from the evidence that the defendant economic circumstances do not permit him a to pay currently any amount of a restitution order,and b to pay the full amount of a restitution order in the foreseeable future under any reasonable schedule of payments,it may enter an order direct ing the defendant to make nominal periodic payments.id.f b.
in determining a payment schedule,the statute expressly instructs the court to consider certain factors regarding an individual defendant,including the defendant financial resources,his other assets including whether jointly or individually controlled,his projected earnings and other income,and his financial obligations.see id.f a c.although extensive remarks are not necessary,we must be able to discern from the record that this consideration has taken place.see united states coates,cir alito,rejecting the government argument that the district court may satisfy its duties under section through its silence.we decline to enter the zone of appellate speculation as to whether a district court has considered f factors.kravchuk,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states zanghi,cir.
in united states zunie,cir,we recently addressed the requirement that a district court set a restitution payment schedule in light of the statutory factors.at.there,the defendant alleged that the district court erred by imposing restitution without regard to his indigence and ordering to be due immediately the total amount of restitution.id.we deemed it unnecessary to go beyond the first contention of error.we confirmed that under the mvra a district court must consider a defendant financial resources and the other f factors in setting an appropriate restitution payment schedule.id.we remanded for such consideration.
in the language of f,the district court restitution payment schedule in this case required ahidley to pay a single,payment.the court written judgment provided the restitution will be paid immediately.vol.i,doc.at.nothing in the record,however,indicates that the district court engaged in the requisite consideration of the statutory factors,including ahidley financial resources.indeed,at the sentencing hearing,the district court was completely silent about the subject of a restitution payment schedule.therefore,the court would not have had any occasion to engage in the mandated statutory analysis.
in failing to consider on the record the f factors in imposing a restitution payment schedule on ahidley,it is beyond peradventure that the district court erred.see zunie,at remand ing for the district court to set an appropriate payment schedule in light of the statutory factors.as the government correctly suggests,however,the real question is whether it committed plain error.the government concedes that if zunie was decided under a plain error standard,this court must remand this case and instruct the district court to set a paymen
