this appeal is part of a dispute over whether the secretary of the interior the secretary properly took a small tract of land into trust on behalf of the wyandotte tribe of oklahoma.because the secretary has already taken the land at issue into trust,sovereign immunity precludes the relief sought by plaintiffs.consequently,we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.
we have previously described the underlying dispute in this matter and will recite only the details directly relevant to this appeal this case arises from a dispute over the status of a acre parcel of land in wyandotte county,kansas,known as the shriner tract.the wyandotte tribe of oklahoma sought to purchase the shriner tract in so that the united states could place the land into trust on behalf of the tribe.a gaming facility was to be built on the tract.notice of intent to take the land into trust pursuant to public law,stat,was published by the secretary on june.congress provided that of the funds appropriated by public law shall be used for the purchase of real property which shall be held in trust by the secretary for the benefit of the wyandotte tribe.stat.at,b.the tribe represented that it intended to acquire the shriner tract using these public law funds.
shortly thereafter,the governor of kansas,the sac and fox nation of missouri,the iowa tribe of kansas and nebraska,and the prairie band of potawatomi indians sued under the administrative procedure act apa,et,to enjoin the secretary planned course of action.plaintiffs were signatories to a compact that permitted the tribes to operate gaming establishments in kansas the opening of a casino on the shriner tract by the wyandotte tribe could affect the plaintiff tribes plans to operate their own gaming facilities.plaintiffs argued inter alia that the funds used by the wyandotte tribe to acquire the shriner tract did not come exclusively from public law funds.if the wyandotte tribe used other funding to purchase the shriner tract,the secretary decision to acquire the land was arguably improper.
and thus began a case that would spawn recurring trips from the district court to the tenth circuit and back.shortly after plaintiffs filed their initial complaint,the district court granted them a temporary restraining order tro enjoining the secretary from taking the shriner tract into trust on behalf of the wyandotte tribe.the wyandotte tribe intervened for the purpose of challenging the tro and appealed the matter to the tenth circuit.before this court,plaintiffs argued that the tro was necessary because the district court would be deprived of jurisdiction to review the secretary actions once the shriner tract was actually taken into trust.the wyandotte tribe and united states attorney countered that an emergency stay of the tro was needed because,otherwise,the tribe would lose its right to acquire the shriner tract pursuant to a land contract.they also represented that lifting the tro would not affect or bar the ultimate resolution of whether the shriner tract can be used for class iii gaming pursuant to the indian gaming regulatory act.determining that dissolution would best preserve the status quo,we ordered the tro dissolved 
subject to the conditions which constitute the law of this case,that the respective rights of the parties to obtain judicial review of all issues which have been raised in the complaint below shall be preserved,including standing of all parties,jurisdiction,compliance by the secretary with all requirements of law,and the ultimate question of whether gaming shall be permitted on the subject land.
the wyandotte tribe then closed on the shriner tract,and the secretary took the land into trust on the tribe behalf 
the district court then dismissed plaintiffs complaint,determining that the wyandotte tribe was a necessary and indispensible party that could not be joined due to sovereign immunity.sac fox nation of babbitt,d.we reversed that ruling on appeal.see norton,at.further,we concluded that the secretary acted arbitrarily in finding that the wyandotte tribe used only public law funds to purchase the shriner tract.norton,at.accordingly,we remanded to the district court with directions to enter partial judgment consistent with our holdings and to remand in part to the secretary for further consideration of whether.funds were used for the acquisition.norton,at.the issue of the united states sovereign immunity was not discussed.
on remand,the district court entered partial judgment,remanded to the secretary,and closed the case.see kempthorne,at.reaffirming an earlier decision,the secretary determined that only public law funds were used to acquire the shriner tract.see id.at.after a new lawsuit was filed,the district court upheld the secretary determination under the apa.see id.at.however,we vacated the district court judgment on appeal,holding that sovereign immunity barred plaintiffs second lawsuit.we reasoned that congress had not waived sovereign immunity for challenges to the united states title to real property held in trust for an indian tribe.id.at interpreting the quiet title act qta.at the same time,we expressly reserved the question of whether the united states could divest a court of jurisdiction if it took this land into trust for the wyandotte tribe after the complaint was filed and served.kempthorne,at.
plaintiffs then successfully moved the district court to their original lawsuit which was filed before the shriner tract was taken into to federal rule of civil procedure b.plaintiffs success,however,was the district court later dismissed the initial lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.sac fox nation of kempthorne,rdr,wl,unpublished.it determined that the united states had not waived its sovereign immunity plaintiffs claim because plaintiffs challenged the united states title to real property held in trust for an indian tribe.in so holding,the court declined to adopt plaintiffs position that sovereign immunity determinations should be made by reference to the facts in existence at the time a complaint was filed.the governor of kansas and the iowa tribe of kansas and nebraska timely appealed.
before proceeding to our analysis,we note that the issue of whether the wyandotte tribe may open a gaming facility on the shriner tract is not before us.in dissolving the tro in,we explicitly referenced the position of the united states attorney and the wyandotte tribe that dissolution would not affect or bar the ultimate resolution of that issue,which is now the subject of separate proceedings.see wyandotte nation indian gaming comm n,d remanding to the secretary the question of whether gaming may be conducted on the shriner tract.therefore,the sole issue before us is whether we retain jurisdiction over plaintiffs challenge to the secretary acquisition of the shriner tract in trust on behalf of the wyandotte tribe.
to evaluate this limited question,we must begin by classifying plaintiffs cause of action.at the time they filed their complaint,plaintiffs sought review of a decision made by an agency the secretary decision to take the shriner tract into trust.this type of suit is authorized by the apa,which provides both a cause of action and a waiver of sovereign immunity for claims in which a plaintiff has suffered a legal wrong because of agency action.consequently,when their complaint was filed and served,sovereign immunity did not bar plaintiffs claim.
once the secretary took the shriner tract into trust,however,the nature of plaintiffs claim changed.unlike their complaint,which sought to prevent the shriner tract from being taken into trust,there appears to be no dispute that the relief plaintiffs have in mind at the present time is to remove the shriner tract from being held in trust or to somehow encumber how the land will be used while it remains in trust.sac fox nation of kempthorne,wl,at.
it has long been the rule that the qta provides the exclusive means by which adverse claimants may challenge the united states title to real property.block north dakota ex rel.bd.of sch.lands,d emphasis added moreover,it is equally well settled that the qta prohibition of suits challenging the united states title in indian trust land may prevent suit even when a plaintiff does not characterize its action as a quiet title action.neighbors for rational,norton,cir citation omitted see also united states mottaz,d.these stringent rules are designed to protect the solemn obligations and specific commitments that the federal government ha s made to the indians regarding indian lands.mottaz,at.quotations omitted.
in determining whether a suit must be treated as a quiet title action sufficient to invoke the qta,we focus on the relief sought by the plaintiffs.kempthorne,at citation omitted.seeking to remove land currently held in trust by the united states or to encumber that land constitutes a challenge to the government title sufficient to bring a claim within the ambit of the qta,despite the fact that plaintiffs do not themselves seek title to the land.see neighbors,at.consequently,if plaintiffs case is to proceed,it must do so exclusively under the qta the apa is no longer relevant given the relief sought.
plaintiffs attempt to avoid this conclusion by arguing that the shriner tract is not fully in trust.they do not contend that the united states lacks title to the shriner tract,but rather argue that the land is not in trust within the meaning of the qta for three reasons.first,plaintiffs claim the land was taken into trust subject to a condition subsequent the resolution on the merits of the issues timely raised in the complaint.according to the plaintiffs,this condition subsequent is evident from the secretary prior representations to this court and the wording of our stay of the district court tro.we note that the primary purpose of the conditions language in our stay was to allow resolution of the ultimate question of whether gaming shall be permitted on the subject land.in any event,we decline to consider plaintiffs condition subsequent argument because they did not advance it before the district court.although sovereign immunity and thus subject matter jurisdiction are at issue in this case,our responsibility to ensure even sua sponte that we have subject matter jurisdiction before considering a case differs from our discretion to eschew untimely raised legal theories which may support that jurisdiction.we have no duty under the general waiver rule to consider the latter.daigle shell oil,cir citation omitted.
second,plaintiffs argue that in sac fox nation of missouri norton,the secretary represented that the shriner tract is not in trust for the purposes of the qta,and that this representation constitutes the department of the interior interpretation of b plaintiffs contend we should uphold this interpretation unless it is plainly erroneous.see city of.springs solis,cir.yet even assuming the secretary representations to this court constitute agency interpretation,the issue here is not the effect of b,but of the qta.plaintiffs fail to make any reasoned argument that we should defer to agency interpretation of the qta.moreover,for chevron deference to apply to an agency interpretation of a statute,the agency must be responsible for its administration.see hydro,epa,cir.congress has not delegated the administration of the qta to the department of the interior.see.thus,the agency interpretation of the qta is not entitled to deference.
third,plaintiffs argue that the shriner tract is not in trust because the secretary decision regarding acquisition was not authorized by law.for purposes of the qta,however,the secretary need only make a colorable claim that the land is held in trust on behalf of an indian tribe.wildman united states,cir.to hold otherwise would defeat the purpose of the indian lands exception.the very purpose of the doctrine of sovereign immunity is to prevent a judicial examination of the merits of the government position.id.the united states has made such a colorable claim it has presented a facially valid title showing that it holds the shriner tract in trust for the wyandotte tribe.accordingly,the shriner tract is in trust for the purposes of the qta,and if plaintiffs are to proceed,they must do so under the qta.
we must next consider the district court conclusion that congress has not waived sovereign immunity with respect to plaintiffs challenge to the trust acquisition.a district court evaluation of sovereign immunity and its decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction are reviewed de novo.ordinance ass dep t of the interior sec y,cir.
the concept of sovereign immunity means that the united states can not be sued without its consent.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,jacks,cir.courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over a claim against the united states for which sovereign immunity has not been waived.normandy apartments,dep t of hous.urban,cir.consequently,plaintiffs may not proceed unless they can establish that the united states has waived its sovereign immunity with respect to their claim.see pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d sydnes united states,cir.
as discussed supra,the apa provided a waiver of sovereign immunity for plaintiffs action when they sought to prevent the secretary from taking the shriner tract into trust.after the land was actually taken into trust,however,the nature of plaintiffs claim changed.they now seek to remove the land from trust or otherwise encumber title.although the qta waives sovereign immunity for cases to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the united states claims an interest,that waiver does not apply to trust or restricted indian lands.a.thus,we must decide whether a congressional waiver of sovereign immunity should be examined as of the time plaintiffs filed and served their complaint.if not,and sovereign immunity must be reassessed after filing,this court lacks jurisdiction.
plaintiffs contend a rule applies because the supreme court has consistently held that if jurisdiction exists at the time an action is commenced,such jurisdiction may not be divested by subsequent events.freeport mcmoran,kn energy,d citations omitted.but in freeport mcmoran,the supreme court was referring to diversity jurisdiction the context in which the rule originated,see mollan torrance,wheat.subsequent to freeport mcmoran,the supreme court has clarified that the rule applies to all challenges to jurisdiction premised upon diversity of citizenship.grupo dataflux atlas global group,d emphasis added.
the rule is a doctrine,supported in the diversity context by sound policy considerations.see id.at.ginsburg,dissenting.in diversity cases,litigants are free to move between the states no court may enjoin a civil litigant from changing her citizenship solely because she filed a complaint in federal court or had the misfortune to be sued.thus,reassessing diversity jurisdiction after a complaint is filed and served would waste judicial resources and encourage manipulation.connectu,llc zuckerberg,cir rule applies in diversity actions because heightened concerns about and strategic behavior offer special justifications for it new rock asset partners,preferred entity advancements,cir from the outset,the underlying concern of the time of filing rule was the risk that parties would deploy procedural tactics to manipulate federal jurisdiction.
in contrast,the rule has been applied only rarely to federal question cases.kabakjian united states,cir quotation omitted see also connectu,at although there are outliers,courts have been careful not to import the rule indiscriminately into the federal question realm.the only consistent use of the rule in federal question cases occurs in the area of removal an area in which the danger of manipulation is high.connectu,at.even in diversity cases,a district court can sometimes,after suit is filed,permit the destruction of subject matter jurisdiction.kabakjian,at.accordingly,we reject plaintiffs contention that the supreme court statements regarding the rule in diversity cases control our analysis.
relatively few cases have directly addressed the question of whether the existence of sovereign immunity must be assessed at the time of filing.however,the supreme court did discuss that issue in the relatively early case of beers arkansas,how.there,plaintiff beers sued the state of arkansas in arkansas state court to collect interest due on state bonds.id.at.while the suit was pending,the arkansas legislature passed an act requiring claimants to present the bonds at issue to the court or face dismissal.id.when beers failed to produce the bonds,the state court dismissed the suit.on appeal,the supreme court affirmed.the court rationale regarding the supremacy of the doctrine of sovereign immunity guides our analysis today 
it is an established principle of jurisprudence in all civilized nations that the sovereign can not be sued in its own courts,or in any other,without its consent and permission but it may,if it thinks proper,waive this privilege,and permit itself to be made a defendant in a suit by individuals,or by another state.and as this permission is altogether voluntary on the part of the sovereignty,it follows that it may prescribe the terms and conditions on which it consents to be sued,and the manner in which the suit shall be conducted,and may withdraw its consent whenever it may suppose that justice to the public requires it.
id.at emphasis added.
although the focus of the court in beers was the contention that arkansas actions violated the contracts clause,see const.art.i,cl,we may not lightly disregard the holding that a waiver of sovereign immunity may be withdrawn whenever a sovereign may suppose that justice to the public requires it,beers,at.the supreme court aimed this language squarely at withdrawals of consent to be sued,further stating that courts can not inquire whether the law operated hardly or unjustly upon the parties whose suits were then pending the legislature might have repealed the prior law altogether,and put an end to the jurisdiction of their courts in suits against the state,if they had thought proper to do so id.at.
there is an irreconcilable conflict between the court holding that a state may withdraw a waiver of sovereign immunity in the throes of litigation and the rule plaintiffs ask us to endorse.if the existence of sovereign immunity were determined at the time a complaint is filed,a sovereign could not withdraw its consent after filing,as was permitted in beers 
the logic of beers has withstood the test of time.eleven years ago,the supreme court confirmed its continued adherence to beers,noting,we have even held that a state may,absent any contractual commitment to the contrary,alter the conditions of its waiver of sovereign immunity and apply those changes to a pending suit.coll.sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d citing beers.and seven years ago,the first circuit relying in part on beers rejected a rule with respect to sovereign immunity determinations.maysonet robles cabrero,cir.
in maysonet robles,a group of plaintiffs filed suit against a corporate entity created by the commonwealth of puerto rico to liquidate the proceeds of the puerto rico urban renewal and housing corporation.id.at.while suit was pending,the puerto rico legislature passed an act dissolving the defendant entity and transferring all of its assets to the department of housing,which,as an arm of puerto rico,was entitled to sovereign immunity.id.after substituting the department for the original defendant,the district court dismissed the suit on sovereign immunity grounds,and the first circuit affirmed.id.at.although the court acknowledged that the rule was for certain jurisdictional inquiries,it held that plaintiffs attempted analogies to the current case context were ultimately unconvincing because,u nlike a private individual or corporation,a state retains its sovereign immunity as a personal privilege and,whether it is the original defendant or is added as a party later,it can not be sued involuntarily.id.at quotation omitted.
noting that it does not require a particularly jaundiced eye to recognize that the puerto rico legislature passed the act with the precise goal of raising the shield of immunity and that s uch jurisdictional would be beyond the pale for any private litigant,the first circuit nonetheless recognized that a judicially created doctrine can not eclipse sovereign immunity.id.at.i t has been nearly a century and a half since beers held that because the waiver of such immunity is entirely within the sovereign prerogative,a state may alter the conditions of waiver and apply those changes to torpedo even pending litigation.id.at citation omitted.
despite its unequivocal holding,plaintiffs contend that beers does not control this suit because executive,not legislative,action resulted in the withdrawal of the qta waiver and only legislative action can effectuate or withdraw a waiver of sovereign immunity.see jacks,at.their argument is misdirected.congress designed the qta in such a manner that its waiver of sovereign immunity necessarily turns on executive action in cases dealing with indian trust lands if the executive branch purchases land,the qta waives sovereign immunity.a.if the executive branch purchases land in trust for an indian tribe,the qta waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply.id.even outside the indian trust context,executive action may dictate an answer to the sovereign immunity question if the executive branch purchases land but later disclaims any interest in it,the qta waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply.e.
thus,as in beers,legislative action is at issue.congress provided within the text of the qta itself that its waiver of sovereign immunity could be withdrawn,and that the conditions for withdrawal turned on executive branch action.in beers,the legislature provided for a withdrawal of a waiver of sovereign immunity in a separate statute.we see no reason to treat these two situations differently.
in light of beers,we can not endorse a rule that freezes sovereign immunity status at the time a complaint is filed.like the maysonet robles court,we acknowledge that such a rule allows the government to manipulate pending cases in a manner prohibited in private litigation.nonetheless,we trust congress,unlike any other entity,to set the rules of the game congress may not always resolve the waiver issue wisely nevertheless,the constitution vests that decision in majoritarian hands harold krent,reconceptualizing sovereign immunity,vand.
we recognize that we must inevitably weigh in on an existing circuit split and that this opinion puts us at odds with two of our sister circuits,which have held that the presence of a waiver of sovereign immunity under the qta should be determined as of the date the complaint was filed.bank of hemet united states,cir see also delta savings loan ass irs,cir adopting the bank of hemet rule without discussion in applying a rule,these circuits were of the opinion that t he time is long past when the bar of sovereign immunity should be preserved through strained and interpretations of the relevant acts of congress.bank of hemet,at.
we disagree with bank of hemet and instead adopt the first circuit approach,which takes a view of sovereign immunity that is consistent with the supreme court jurisprudence.bank of hemet and delta savings loan were decided during an era when many courts took an erroneously lax approach to interpreting waivers of sovereign immunity.college sav.bank,at.describing a case as the nadir of the court approach to sovereign immunity and waiver.after these cases were decided,the court has reaffirmed its historically strict approach to sovereign immunity.in lane pena,it clarified that courts must construe waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly 
a waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text,and will not be implied.moreover,a waiver of the government sovereign immunity will be strictly construed,in terms of its scope,in favor of the sovereign a statute legislative history can not supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text the unequivocal expression of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist upon is an expression in statutory text.
d citations omitted accord orff united states,d.this jurisprudence demonstrates that a narrow construction of a waiver is not strained and,bank of hemet,at rather,such interpre
