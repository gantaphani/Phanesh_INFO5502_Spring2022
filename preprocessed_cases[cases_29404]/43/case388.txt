the united states brought this action,on behalf of itself and as trustee for the skokomish indian tribe the tribe and its members,asking for declaratory judgment to invalidate the condemnation proceedings brought by the city of tacoma tacoma and seeking to void land transfers made by the tribe long thought by tacoma to be settled.after cross motions for summary judgment,the district court granted the united states motion,invalidating the condemnation proceedings.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
factual.funk condemnation proceedings 
in,tacoma began plans to develop the cushman hydroelectric power project on the north fork of the skokomish river to that end,tacoma instituted condemnation proceedings in state court,entitled tacoma funk,against private landowners with property in the area of the proposed project.the landowners included five tribal members who held allotted lands three allotments were held in fee by the tribal members with a reversionary interest in the united states.two were held in trust by the united states for tribal members benefit.the united states was not a party in funk.
on november,a bench trial was held on whether construction of the project was a public use.about a year later,the state court held that the project was a public use and that the condemnations were appropriate and necessary for the project.the state court ordered tacoma to pay in damages for portions of two allotments and perpetual easements across three.the court entered a conditional judgment on this order,subject to the united states government approval,through its proper authorities.
thereafter,percy brush,assistant city attorney,contacted william sams,superintendent of the taholah indian school,about the condemnation.by letter of october,brush told sams of the proceedings and said that the clerk of the court in shelton,washington held the amounts required by the judgment,subject to the federal government approval.brush asked sams to take this matter up with the proper authorities and take such steps as are necessary towards protecting the government.
sams responded,by letter of november,that the allotments are each and all trust patented allotments,the title to the land remaining in the government of the united states,and such lands are not subject to condemnation proceedings.on that day sams also wrote the commissioner of indian affairs at the department of the interior i have notified the assistant attorney of the city of tacoma that condemnation proceedings against these trust patented lands will not lie that the title yet remains in the government of the united states and that their only method of securing the fee title to such lands is pursuant to the act of june.
by letter of december,meritt,assistant commissioner of indian affairs at the department of the interior,instructed sams that condemnation of allotted lands for public purposes was authorized by section of the act of march,stat.codified at.by letter of may,mount,assistant united states attorney for the western district of washington,similarly advised sams in view of,i am inclined to believe that the procedure as adopted by the city in this condemnation suit is in all respects legal.sams passed along mount letter to meritt and said that the appraisement of the lands was fully sufficient and fair and just to all concerned.
by letter of june,meritt responded to sams,approving the state court conditional judgment and directing sams to present the original of this letter to the clerk of the court at shelton,washington,with request that the amount of the awards be turned over to you to be handled for the benefit of the indians entitled.the letter was approved and signed by goodwin,assistant secretary of the department of the interior.in july,sams complied with these directions,gave the letter to the clerk of the court,and asked that the funds be given to him for distribution.
subsequent proceedings and events 
the parties also point to several events that occurred between the funk decision and the institution of this action in.
agency proceedings 
in,the federal power commission fpc,the predecessor of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc,issued a minor part license,authorizing tacoma to flood acres of united states forest service land.city of tacoma,ferc at,wl.the fpc by order said that the license will not interfere or be inconsistent with the purpose for which any reservation affected thereby was created or acquired.id.after,the ferc issued an order extending the same right by granting tacoma annual licenses for the next years.in,after this action started,the ferc issued an order granting tacoma a license to continue operating the cushman project.city of tacoma,ferc,wl see city of tacoma,ferc,wl.the order recognized tacoma property interests in the five allotments,but acknowledged that this litigation would materially affect whether the lands were considered reservations.ferc at,wl.in march,the ferc issued an order on rehearing,finding that the five allotments fell within the fpa definition of reservations based on the district court grant of summary judgment.ferc,wl at.
skokomish indian tribe france 
in an action against the state of washington,tacoma,and several corporations and individuals,the tribe sought to quiet title on tidelands next to the reservation by the hood canal.see skokomish indian tribe france,cir.the united states was not a party to the action.
the district court held that the tribe challenges to the fpc license were barred by laches and equitable estoppel.it held also that the action was a collateral attack barred by res judicata,that the issues should have been raised by the tribe or the united states in the fpc hearings.we affirmed,holding that there was no clear error in the findings on which the district court based its conclusions that the tidelands were not part of the reservation.
tribal resolution 
in march,the skokomish tribal council passed a resolution on the funk proceedings,to the effect that the state court lacked jurisdiction to condemn the property and that neither the united states nor the tribe was a party in the action,as was required.the resolution asked the commissioner of indian affairs to undertake litigation and all other steps necessary to set aside or otherwise secure relief from the illegal condemnations.
procedural history 
on may,the united states filed this federal court action,seeking for the tribe a declaratory judgment that would invalidate the condemnation proceedings,and seeking damages for trespass.the district court bifurcated trial of liability and remedy.cross motions for summary judgment on liability followed.
on november,the district court granted summary judgment to the united states and denied tacoma cross motion for summary judgment.the district court held that the united states had standing,that it was not equitably estopped,and that the condemnation proceedings were void because brought in state court and the united states was not a party.
after gaining summary judgment on liability,the united states declined to seek damages for trespass.on september,the united states filed a motion for entry of final judgment and to terminate discovery.tacoma opposed,contending that discovery was needed to identify all parties bound by the judgment.the district court granted the motion and entered final judgment on december.tacoma timely appealed on january.

tacoma contends that the united states lacks standing to bring this action and that,notwithstanding the contentions of the united states and the tribe,the funk proceedings or the actions of the united states effectively conveyed property interests in the five allotments.we hold that the united states has standing to pursue this action,and that the united states did not convey its interest in the five allotments.
standing requires that the plaintiff suffered an injury in fact that there is a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and that there is a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
the united states meets the first requirement.see,united states hellard.restricted indian land is property in which the united states has an interest.the united states has suffered injury to its property rights in all the allotments,whether the united states interest for the tribe is fee simple or reversionary.see heckman united states.the united states also suffered an injury as the trustee.see seminole nation united states.see generally.and the united states has an independent,governmental interest when it has not been made a party in condemnation proceedings of restricted indian lands.hellard,at.united states candelaria.
tacoma argues that the united states can not fulfill the causal connection requirement,urging that the alleged harm is not fairly traceable to tacoma actions because the federal officials approval of the conditional judgment was an intervening cause of the alleged harm.but this ignores the fact that the initial and primary causes of the alleged injury were tacoma institution of the funk proceedings and its failure to name the united states as a defendant.there remains a fairly traceable connection between the plaintiff injury an the conduct of the defendant.steel citizens for a better env t,d citation omitted see bowling united states.the united states has capacity to sue for the purpose of setting aside conveyances of lands allotted to indians under its care,where restrictions upon alienation have been transgressed.
tacoma also contends that the united states can not meet the redressability requirement,because the united states has not proved that it,the tribe,or the tribe members have a current interest in the five allotments.thus,the argument runs,it is unclear how a declaratory judgment can redress the alleged wrong.however,we conclude that the alleged injury would be redressed through the cancellation of the state judgment and the setting aside of the conveyances.although it may be not yet known precisely which individuals or entities would benefit from such relief,the united states would benefit as land owner and trustee.thus,tacoma redressability argument fails.we hold that the united states has standing to proceed in this action.
validity of the conveyances 
condemnations of allotted lands for public purposes are governed by,which provides 
lands allotted in severalty to indians may be condemned for any public purpose under the laws of the state or territory where located in the same manner as land owned in fee may be condemned,and the money awarded as damages shall be paid to the allottee.
while appears to give a broad power of condemnation to tacoma,the supreme court has interpreted the provision narrowly.in minnesota united states,the supreme court held that,under,t he united states is an indispensable party defendant to condemnation proceedings regarding trust allotments.a proceeding against property in which the united states has an interest is a suit against the united states.citations omitted.holding that the state court in which the suit was initially brought lacked jurisdiction,the court noted that contains no permission to sue in the court of a state.id.at.the court further explained that t here are persuasive reasons why should not be construed as authorizing a suit in a state court and that t he judicial determination of controversies concerning such lands has been commonly committed exclusively to federal courts.id.footnote omitted see also united states united states fid.guar.holding that a missouri court acted without jurisdiction and that its judgment,purporting to adjudicate a against the united states and a federally recognized indian tribe without a waiver of sovereign immunity,was void.
minnesota is particularly relevant,because two of the allotments that tacoma purported to condemn were held in trust by the united states,as were the allotments in minnesota the remaining three,although held in fee by individual indians,were subject to restraints on alienation and reversionary interests in the united states.it has long been settled that those two types of allotments are to be treated identically as to congressional control and limitations on alienability.see united states ramsey.moreover,minnesota s holding regarding trust allotments expressly relied on earlier holdings regarding allotments in which the united states held a reversionary interest.minnesota,at.as indicated in minnesota,those earlier holdings were similarly strict in their requirement that the united states be joined in any court proceedings adjudicating the rights to allotted land 
in the case of patents in fee with restraints on alienation it is established that an alienation of the indian interest in the lands by judicial decision in a suit to which the united states is not a party has no binding effect but that the united states may sue to cancel the judgment and set aside the conveyance made pursuant thereto.

although minnesota was issued after the condemnation proceedings,it interpreted a statute that came into effect in,two decades before the condemnation proceedings.minnesota interpretation of is thus properly considered to be binding as to all attempted condemnations of allotted lands governed by,regardless of whether the condemnation proceedings predate or postdate the decision in minnesota 
when the supreme court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it,that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events,regardless of whether such events predate or postdate the announcement of the rule.

moreover,the supreme court interpretation of in minnesota can not be considered a change of operative law.the theory of a judicial interpretation of a statute is that the interpretation gives the meaning of the statute from its inception,and does not merely give an interpretation to be used from the date of the decision.rivers roadway express,d.as was explained by the supreme court in rivers,a judicial construction of a statute is an authoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise to that construction.id.at.in a footnote attached to the above statement of rule,the court elaborated 
when this court construes a statute,it is explaining its understanding of what the statute has meant continuously since the date when it became law.in statutory cases the court has no authority to depart from the congressional command setting the effective date of a law that it has enacted.
in sum,minnesota and its authoritative construction of section control.the superior court in funk lacked jurisdiction to condemn the five indian allotments in which the united states continued to hold a valid property interest,and the proceedings are therefore void.no subsequent approval or ratification by federal officials could remedy the underlying jurisdictional problem,united states fid.guar,at,and the federal officials who purported to ratify the court decision lacked the authority independently to alienate the allotments.see united states clarke,d holding that only in a formal judicial proceeding may allotted lands such as this be acquired by a city or state for public use.under settled law,we must affirm the correct decision of the district court and conclude that the condemnation proceedings were without effect and conveyed no interest to tacoma.
here,there can be no argument that equitable estoppel bars the united states action because,when the government acts as trustee for an indian tribe,it is not at all subject to that defense.see,united states ahtanum irrigation,cir see also cramer united states.holding that,in suit by united states to set aside a land patent of land granted to a,the government could not be estopped from bringing the suit on behalf of the indians in possession by earlier,unlawful act s or declaration s of its officers or agents cato united states,cir noting the rule that a suit by the united states as trustee on behalf of an indian tribe is not subject to state defenses.
because we are bound by minnesota,we hold that the conveyances of the five allotments were invalid.we affirm summary judgment to the united states.
i must respectfully dissent.although i agree with the majority that,as a general rule,we regard a judicial interpretation of a statute as an authoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise to that construction,rivers roadway express,d,i believe the instant case presents exactly the kind of rare case which the court in united states estate of donnelly recognized might be exempted from the full retroactive effect of a decision construing a statute.see united states donnelly,d.i would hold that in cases such as the instant one,in which the decision to be retroactively applied announced a new interpretation of the statute,and in which both compelling equitable considerations as well as principles of finality weigh against retroactive application of the decision,the general rule must give way to familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.see landgraf usi film,d.
as an initial matter,i do not find the language from rivers which the majority quotes to be binding in this case.while the majority cites rivers for the general proposition that judicial interpretations of statutes are generally retroactively applied to the date of enactment,the most succinct and squarely controlling articulation of this principle was announced in united states donnelly,the case which i believe,as i discuss below,should control our analysis.although donnelly held that a cts of congress are generally to be applied uniformly throughout the country from the date of their effectiveness onward,donnelly,at.emphasis added,it also stated that certain kinds of justified reliance could warrant withholding retroactive application of a decision construing a statute as congress intended it.id.at.thus,donnelly dealt squarely with precisely the issue that we currently confront.
by contrast,the language from rivers that the majority relies upon was written in response to an entirely different legal question than the one presented here.in rivers,the court was grappling with the sole question whether a act altering a rule of law established in a supreme court case interpreting the civil rights act applies to cases pending when it was enacted.at.in response to this question,the rivers court held that when congress intends to supersede a rule of law embodied in one of our decisions its intent to reach conduct preceding the corrective amendment must clearly appear.id.at.while the court noted its belief that when this court construes a statute,it is explaining its understanding of what the statute has meant continuously since the date when it became law,id.at,it did not squarely address the issue of the appropriate scope of retroactive application of its own decisions interpreting statutes,nor did it preclude the possibility of a limiting principle to the general rule 
while we generally give due deference to supreme court dicta,see united states baird,cir,such deference can not and should not be unlimited.see batjac productions goodtimes home video,cir citing united states crawley,cir as noting reasons for rejecting dicta,such as unnecessary to the outcome of the case can be deleted without affecting the argument not grounded in the facts of the case issue addressed was not present as an issue in the case.in particular,dicta should not be controlling when there is another case more squarely on point.see humphrey ex r united states.general expressions,in every opinion,are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used.if they go beyond the case,they may be respected,but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit,when the very point is presented for decision.assuming that the broad rivers language is what it appears to should not trump the significant equitable and finality concerns at play in this case.
in a case subsequent to rivers,the court also announced that,in general,n ew legal principles,even when applied retroactively,do not apply to cases already closed,particularly cases that present special concerns.reynoldsville casket hyde,d.reynoldsville casket also recognized certain principles that might limit retroactive application of a new rule even in cases which were pending when the novel decision was issued.see reynoldsville casket,at.i believe these same principles are applicable in this case,in particular general principles of equity reflect ing both reliance interests and other significant policy justifications,and principle s of law,such as that of finality that limit the principle of retroactivity itself.id.at.for all of these reasons,donnelly,and not rivers,should control in this case.
under donnelly,the court decision in minnesota united states,should not be retroactively applied to the parties in this case.although the supreme court has never clearly set out a limiting principle to retroactive judicial statutory interpretation,i believe that the decisions in donnelly and reynoldsville casket provide us with ample guidance.in particular,i believe that the presence of the following factors prohibits full retroactive application of the decision in minnesota in this case the presence of a novel decision regarding the statute,such that the city of tacoma can claim justifiable reliance on its earlier interpretation of the statute the fact that the government did not adhere to the statutory construction it now seeks to rely upon at the time of the underlying proceedings the fact that the underlying proceedings,when viewed in their entirety,comply with the spirit and the purposes of the rule announced in minnesota as well as all but one of the elements required to give a proceeding res judicata effect the serious finality concerns raised by vacating a proceeding upon which the parties have relied for over eighty years,and which the government did not seek to challenge until nearly sixty years after the intervening statutory decision and the fact that no injustice or actual prejudice is alleged to have resulted from the underlying action.
first,unlike the plaintiffs in donnelly,the city of tacoma faced the task of interpreting a vague statute that provided no guidance as to how to proceed with condemnation of tribal lands.donnelly,at.in other words,the city of tacoma faces the retroactive application of,for all practical purposes,a new rule of law,at least as measured by the position it was in in.see chevron oil huson,d a new rule of law is created when a court overrul es clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied,or decides an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.citing hanover shoe,united shoe mach,d and allen state bd.of elections,d.at the time of the funk proceedings,the minnesota decision was not such a foregone conclusion that the city of tacoma was unreasonable in believing that it was permissible to enter only a conditional judgment that was explicitly subject to the approval of the united states.see allen,at.resolution of a case not clearly foreshadowed when resolution of the issues is subject to rational disagreement.see also hanover shoe,at.the clear language of provided no guidance as to how a state should proceed when condemning reserved land,merely stating that a state was permitted to condemn lands allotted in severalty to indians.see donnelly,at.
contrary to the majority assertion,the supreme court cases preceding minnesota provided no more guidance to the city of tacoma than the statute.in bowling miami inv.united states,the court focused on the scope of the united state authority regarding allotted land,holding that the united states has capacity to sue for the purpose of setting aside conveyances of lands allotted to indians under its care,where re
