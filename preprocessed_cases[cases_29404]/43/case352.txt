can an indian tribe bring claims against the united states under the federal tort claims act for violation of a treaty,or against a city and a public utility under a treaty and 
the skokomish indian tribe tribe and its members brought suit in federal district court against the united states,the city of tacoma city and tacoma public utilities tpu,alleging harms caused by the cushman hydroelectric project project,a project comprised of two dams,two reservoirs,diversion works,two power houses and transmission lines.the project,completed in,floods over thirty acres of federal land in a total project area of acres located upstream from the tribe land.the project has diverted the flow of the skokomish river north fork to facilities and led to aggradation of the river this has allegedly caused flooding of the tribe reservation,failure of septic systems,contamination of water wells,blocking of fish migration,damage to the tribe orchards and pastures and silting over of many of the tribe fisheries and shellfish beaches.the tribe claims the project has caused it nearly billion in losses.
the tribe sued for damages resulting from the project impact on tribal lands and fisheries,alleging both state and federal causes of action,including claims arising under the treaty of point no point treaty,stat.the treaty ceded the tribe territory to the united states,but reserved a tract for the tribe.it also reserved for the tribe t he right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations in common with all citizens of the united states and the privilege of hunting and gathering roots and berries on open and unclaimed lands.
the district court dismissed the united states as a defendant and granted summary judgment in favor of the city and tpu on the and claims.the court also dismissed the tribe claim under c for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.a divided panel of our court affirmed,but held that the district court should have dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we took the case en banc.skokomish indian tribe united states,cir.
claims against the united statesa.claims 
the tribe seeks relief against the united states pursuant to the federal tort claims act ftca.the tribe alleges that the united states violated its obligations under the treaty by allowing continued operations of the project and by failing to take legal action on the tribe behalf or fund litigation,thereby breaching its fiduciary responsibilities to the tribe under the treaty.
these claims are not properly brought under the ftca,which authorizes suits against the united states 
for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
b emphasis added the tribe claims against the united states are properly characterized not as tort claims,but as claims that the united states violated its obligations under the treaty.the claims are thus quite different from those in cases like berkovitz united states,d,and indian towing united states,on which the tribe relies.in berkovitz,a federal agency allegedly acted tortiously in approving the release of a polio vaccine that did not meet safety standards.in indian towing,the coast guard acted negligently in its operation of a lighthouse because it did not use due care to make certain that the light was kept in good working order,causing more than in damages to a barge and its cargo.at.the tribe is not claiming the united states behaved tortiously,but rather that the united states failed to abide by its contractual obligations to the tribe under the treaty.
the tribe claims may best be characterized as arising under the tucker act,or its counterpart for indian claims,the indian tucker act.the tucker act gives the court of federal claims exclusive jurisdiction over claims for damages exceeding that are founded upon any express or implied contract with the united states.a.the indian tucker act extends the court of federal claims jurisdiction to 
any tribe,band,or other identifiable group of american indians residing within the territorial limits of the united states or alaska whenever such claim is one arising under the constitution,laws or treaties of the united states,or executive orders of the president,or is one which otherwise would be cognizable in the court of federal claims if the claimant were not an indian tribe,band or group.
it is under the tucker and indian tucker acts that the federal courts have considered claims most similar to those of the tribe.for example,in united states mitchell mitchell ii,d,an indian tribe brought a tucker act cause of action in the court of claims the court of federal claims predecessor against the united states for breach of trust responsibilities that originated with a treaty,which was later codified in federal law.this is very much like our case,in which the tribe claims against the united states are for breach of its fiduciary obligations under the treaty.
because we lack subject matter jurisdiction over the tribe damages claims against the united states,but believe they might properly have been brought under the indian tucker act,we exercise our discretion to transfer these claims to the court of federal claims.see whenever an appeal,including a petition for review of administrative action,is noticed for or filed with a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction,the court shall,if it is in the interest of justice,transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed beck atl.richfield,cir per curiam.
federal power act claims 
the tribe also asserts the united states violated the federal power act fpa,by failing to submit and include license conditions protective of the skokomish reservation fish and wildlife,to fully consider environmental factors before issuing a project license,and to require evidence that the city,as a license applicant,possessed sufficient water rights for the project and complied with state and federal laws requiring fishways at dams and prohibiting impairment of navigation.the fpa,however,specifically provides each licensee hereunder shall be liable for all damages occasioned to the property of others by the construction,maintenance,or operation of the project works or of the works appurtenant or accessory thereto,constructed under the license,and in no event shall the united states be liable therefor.c emphasis added.
the plain language of the fpa is clear.it differentiates between the united states and licensees,and unequivocally exempts the united states from liability.when the statutory language is clear,it trumps.lamie united states,d.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of all fpa claims against the united states.
ii.claims against the city of tacoma and tacoma public utilities 
a treaty between the united states and an indian tribe is essentially a contract between two sovereign nations.washington.state commercial passenger fishing vessel ass n,d fishing vessel.nonetheless,treaties constitute the supreme law of the land,breard greene,d per curiam,and they have occasionally been found to provide rights of action for equitable relief against parties,see united states winans.
equitable relief,however,merely ensures compliance with a treaty that is,it forces state governmental entities and their officers to conform their conduct to federal law.the tribe here would have us go further and hold that it may recover monetary damages against the city and tpu for alleged treaty violations.we find no basis for doing so 
the supreme court has held that the treaty of point no point and similar treaties are and thus do not require implementing legislation to form the basis of a lawsuit.see fishing vessel,at.to make this determination,the court looked at language common to the treaties,which stated that the treaties shall be obligatory on the contracting parties as soon as they are ratified by the president and senate of the united states.id.emphasis added alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted see also treaty.however,the city and tpu are not contracting parties to the treaty.nor is there anything in the language of the treaty that would support a claim for damages against a party.alexander sandoval,d the judicial task is to interpret the statute congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.touche ross redington,d o ur task is limited solely to determining whether congress intended to create the private right of action asserted and as with any case involving the interpretation of a statute,our analysis must begin with the language of the statute itself.
the tribe has argued that in fishing vessel and puyallup tribe department of game of washington puyallup i,d,the supreme court held that tribes may have a cause of action against parties under a treaty,even in the absence of a specific treaty provision.but the tribe misunderstands the significance of those cases.in fishing vessel,the court interpreted a group of treaties,including the one at issue here,which granted indian tribes t he right of taking fish,at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations in common with all citizens at.quoting treaty of medicine creek,stat,substantially similar to treaty of point no point.the court held that this provision secured to the tribes the right to harvest a share of each run of anadromous fish that passed through tribal fishing areas and not merely a right to compete with fishermen on an equal basis.id.at.the tribes were thus entitled to an equal measure of the harvestable portion of each run that passed through a usual and accustomed tribal fishing ground,adjusted downward if tribal needs could be satisfied by a lesser amount.id.at.
the court then held that its order was enforceable by injunction.see id.at.this is quite different from finding a right to sue a party for damages under a theory the supreme court avoided in fishing vessel.
puyallup i is not to the contrary.in that case,the court held that the state of to a treaty between the puyallup tribe and the united regulate the modes of fishing allowed as an appropriate exercise of the state police power because the manner in which the fishing may be done and its purpose are not mentioned in the treaty.at.the court suggested that,even though the state could regulate in this instance,it could not pass legislation that would directly interfere with rights secured by a treaty.see id.we would have quite a different case if the treaty had preserved the right to fish at the usual and accustomed places in the usual and accustomed manner.but the court did not hold that the tribe had a private right of action under the treaty for damages.in fact,the puyallup tribe did not bring a claim at all.it was the state of washington that had sued the tribe,seeking an injunction and declaratory relief that would allow the state to regulate certain fishing areas named in the treaty.the court did not consider whether the tribe had a right of action even for equitable relief,let alone monetary damages going back nearly years.
the tribe gets no help from antoine washington,d.antoine stands for the proposition that when a treaty has been implemented by congress,neither an express provision precluding state qualification nor the consent of the state is required to subject a state to the provisions of the treaty.id.at.holding that a state is precluded from passing laws inconsistent with a treaty is quite different from saying that a party can be sued for damages under the treaty.
finally,county of oneida oneida indian nation,d county of oneida ii,is inapposite.in that case,the supreme court found that the plaintiff tribes could assert a federal common law damages claim for unlawful possession of land.the court decision was not based on any treaty.rather,it was based on federal common law principles regarding aboriginal possessory rights in land.see id.at.by contrast,the tribe in our case is seeking to collect damages for violation of fishing rights reserved to it by treaty.
thus,we hold that there is no basis for implying the right of action for damages that the tribe seeks to assert.
we turn next to the tribe claims under.the supreme court recently held in inyo county indians,d,that a tribe is not a person capable of bringing a claim under section for violation of a sovereign prerogative.the court reasoned that qualification of a sovereign as a person who may maintain a particular claim for relief depends on the legislative environment in which the word appears.id.at.quoting georgia evans.to illustrate circumstances in which sovereigns may assert claims under section,the court cited evans,in which a state,as purchaser of asphalt shipped in interstate commerce,qualified as a person entitled to seek redress under the sherman act for restraint of trade.inyo county,at.citing evans,at.it also cited pfizer,government of india,d,which held that a foreign nation,as purchaser of antibiotics,ranked as a person qualified to sue pharmaceuticals manufacturers under our antitrust laws.at.citing pfizer,at.
the tribe here is not suing as an aggrieved purchaser,or in any other capacity resembling a private person.id.at.rather,the tribe is attempting to assert communal fishing rights reserved to it,as a sovereign,by a treaty it entered into with the united states.see united states washington,cir the treaties must be viewed as agreements between independent and sovereign nations each tribe bargained as an entity for rights which were to be enjoyed communally.recognizing that s ection was designed to secure private rights against government encroachment,id.at,as well as the longstanding interpretive presumption that person does not include the sovereign.agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens,d,we conclude that the tribe may not assert its fishing rights under section 
as for the individual members of the tribe,while we have suggested that some rights might be cognizable on behalf of a tribe members under section,see united states washington,cir,we have noted that the hallmark for determining the scope of section coverage is whether the right asserted is one that protects the individual against government intrusion,hoopa valley tribe nevins,cir quoting white mountain apache tribe williams,cir.in hoopa valley,for instance,we held that section could not be used to enforce a collective right to tribal.
the tribe rights do not give rise to individual actions cognizable under section.as we stated in settler lameer,cir,with regard to fishing rights similar to those that the tribe members assert here,the fishing rights reserved in the relevant treaty are communal rights of the tribe,even though the individual members benefit from those rights.see also whitefoot united states,noting that interests in fisheries are communal,subject to tribal regulation because the tribe members seek to vindicate communal,rather than individual rights,they do not have cognizable section claims against the city or tpu 
we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the city and tpu.the tribe claims can not be asserted under the treaty or under section.
the tribe brought a series of claims against the city and tpu based on the property damage resulting from aggradation of the skokomish river.the claims included inverse condemnation,trespass,tortious interference with property,conversion,negligence,negligent misrepresentation,private and public nuisance,and violation of washington revised code section,which prohibits persons from going onto the land of another and wrongfully causing waste or injury to the land or to personal property.we find that all of the tribe claims are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.
under washington law,the statute of limitations for inverse condemnation is ten years.highline sch.dist.port of seattle.the statutes of limitations for trespass,negligence,conversion,tortious interference,nuisance and actions under washington revised code section are three years.see.
the district court found that the tribe claims began to accrue no later than february.on that date,russell busch,then attorney for the tribe,wrote a letter to gary hansen at the washington department of ecology,stating 
please consider this letter both a formal protest and an intergovernmental comment by the skokomish indian tribe with regard to the referenced water rights applications for permit and any other water use authorizations sought by the city of tacoma in the skokomish river basin.
the skokomish tribe resides upon a federal indian reservation on the skokomish river downstream from the applicant city of tacoma diversions and impoundments.it is the position of the tribe that applicant actions reduce the natural flow of the river in such a way that indian treaty fisheries are seriously reduced both on the reservation and at other usual and accustomed places,in violation of the treaty of point no point the federal reserved water rights of the skokomish reservation are unlawfully interfered with and the reduction of tributary inflow caused by tacoma impoundments and diversions is a direct and proximate cause of channel aggradation and flooding on and above the reservation.
we agree with the district court that this was the applicable date of accrual.though the tribe argues that this is a factual issue that should have been submitted to the jury,where there is clear evidence of when the claims accrued,the court may make this determination.see reichelt,fradkin northshore util.to start the statute of limitations running in washington,all that is required is 
w hen a plaintiff is placed on notice by some appreciable harm occasioned by another wrongful conduct,the plaintiff must make further diligent inquiry to ascertain the scope of actual harm.the plaintiff is charged with what a reasonable inquiry would have discovered.stated more succinctly,the law does not require a smoking gun in order for the statute of limitations to commence.
giraud quincy farm,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.busch formal protest of the project in is sufficient to meet this standard.thus,because the tribe did not file its complaint until november,more than ten years after its claims accrued,its claims are.
there is an exception to the statute of limitations for certain trespass claims.where a plaintiff can show that its claim is a continuing violation,the statute of limitation serves only to limit damages to those incurred in the period before the suit was filed.fradkin,at.to show a continuing violation,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the damage is reasonably abatable,which means that t he condition can be removed without unreasonable hardship and expense,id.at quoting mangini,cal th,d.it is the plaintiff burden to prove reasonable abatability.see mangini,d,at.
the district court held that the tribe alleged damages were not reasonably abatable,precluding a finding of a continuing violation.the tribe expert estimated the value of the tribe property before the damage at.supp.at.the same expert estimated the total remediation cost at.id.given this large discrepancy between the cost of repair and the actual value of the land,it is clear that the damages could be abated only with unreasonable hardship and expense the district court correctly concluded that there was no continuing violation.
the tribe also claims the city and tpu violated c,which requires licensees to maintain project works in a condition so as not to impair navigation.section c provides that e ach licensee hereunder shall be liable for all damages occasioned to the property of others by the construction,maintenance,or operation of the project works or of the works appurtenant or accessory thereto,constructed under the license,and in no event shall the united states be liable therefor.
the district court dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,holding that section c does not provide a private right of action.this follows the second circuit decision in dilaura power authority of state of,cir,and the circuit decision in south carolina public service authority ferc.
dilaura and south carolina public service authority held that section c does not create a federal private right of action,but instead preserves only existing claims against licensees.dilaura,at pub.serv,at.their holdings were based on a reading of the statute as well as its legislative history.the legislative history revealed that all discussion during the floor debates centered on the premise that damages caused by licensees should be determined in accordance with state law.id.at.as the circuit explained,since congress intended for the statute merely to preserve existing state laws governing the damage liability of licensees,it follows that the commission may not encroach upon this state domain by engrafting its own rules of liability.id.we believe this interpretation of section c is the correct one and thus see no cause for parting company with our sister circuits.we affirm the district court dismissal of the tribe section c claim.
iii.recusal motion 
the tribe also appeals the district court denial of its motion to disqualify the district judge.sixteen months after filing its complaint,and after the district court had already ruled on a number of claims,the tribe asserted that judge burgess had an obligation to recuse himself because he was a utility customer,and the outcome of the case might substantially affect his utility bill.judge burgess denied the motion,finding it untimely.the tribe moved for reconsideration,and judge burgess again denied recusal.judge burgess then referred the motion to chief district judge coughenour,who also held it was untimely,because judge burgess had already ruled on at least fifteen different motions and trial was less than five months away.
a motion for recusal must be made with reasonable promptness after the ground for such a motion is ascertained.preston united states,cir see also wood mcewen,cir per curiam waiting sixteen months after discovering the grounds for recusal was untimely and resulted in a waiver.the tribe knew it was litigating a case against tpu in tacoma federal court,before a judge.it should have known when it filed its complaint that it might want to seek recusal of the judge assigned to the matter.at the very least,the tribe admits that it believed it had grounds for recusal at least seven months before filing the motion.the district court thus did not abuse its discretion in denying the recusal motion.see kulas flores,cir 
iv.class certification 
because we affirm the district court,we need not address the district court denial of class certification.see alexander whitman,cir because the court held that dismissal of the complaint was proper,it did not need to address the propriety of the district court denial of plaintiffs motion for class certification.
affirmed in part and transferred to the court of federal claims in part.
i concur in the majority opinion with two exceptions.first,with respect to the right of individual members of the tribe to bring a claim against the city and tpu,i agree with judge berzon dissent at pages.second,i disagree with the majority conclusion that the statute of limitations has run on the tribe claims for nuisance and trespass.under washington law,even a permanent structure like a dam or a sewer can result in a continuing nuisance or trespass.if there is a continuing nuisance or trespass,then the plaintiff can seek damages for the three years immediately preceding the filing of the complaint,because the act for which damages are sought is a present,ongoing act rather than a past,completed act.here,a question of fact remains concerning the proper application of the statute of limitations.
under washington law the difference between a permanent nuisance or trespass and a continuing nuisance or trespass is that the latter is reasonably abatable,that is,the defendant can take curative action to stop the continuing damages,tort law and practice ed.the question of permanent versus continuing nuisance or trespass is separate from the question of damages or remediation of consequential harms,even though money is involved in each analysis.for example,a trespass can cause huge damages but be very cheap to fix,or vice versa.
the tribe has produced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the aggradation allegedly caused by the cushman dam project diversion of the north fork of the skokomish river is reasonably abatable.to survive summary judgment,the tribe had to produce evidence from which a rational finder of fact could conclude that the aggradation of the skokomish river mainstem can be abated without unreasonable hardship and expense.fradkin northshore util.
two pieces of evidence support the tribe claim that the aggradation is reasonably abatable.first,at least two of the tribe technical consultants stated that aggradation can be abated by dredging the river or decreasing the amount of water diverted away from the north fork second,tacoma license from ferc directed it to develop specific measures proposed to increase the channel conveyance capacity of the skokomish mainstem,including flow manipulation and flushing flows.
the ferc order supports the tribe showing,for summary judgment purposes,that these measures to abate aggradation would be feasible.in fradkin,the court held that summary judgment was improper where the plaintiff had produced a report recommending certain measures to remedy the condition and where the trespassing utility had itself attempted to fix the problem.id.the court did not discuss the cost of such measures or the value of the plaintiff property in relation to these measures.id.in jacques pioneer plastics,me cited in fradkin,at,a document even more similar to the ferc order sufficed to raise a genuine issue of material fact a compliance order from a state agency that directed the contaminating parties to submit a remediation feasibility study.id.at.several courts have noted that abatability is not necessarily a return to the status quo ante or a complete elimination of the problem.see,mangini,cal th,d,something less than total decontamination may suffice to show abatability cited in fradkin,at beck dev.pac.transp,th,d,noting that the ability to remediate to levels demanded by the regulatory agencies was sufficient abatability hanes cont l grain,we disagree that in order to show a nuisance can be abated,it must be shown that the entire nuisance can be eliminated,and a reduction or lessening of the nuisance is insufficient a nuisance can be abated to the degree where it is no longer a substantial interference.
there is evidence in the record from which a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that abatement of the aggradation itself is economically feasible.the ferc license states that the measures to increase mainstem conveyance capacity are not to exceed million.for summary judgment purposes we should presume that ferc considered the reasonableness of this sum,as well as the feasibility of the measures,in relation to the economic situation of the city and the cushman dam project.for this reason,i believe that,for summary judgment purposes under washington law,the ferc order is sufficient evidence that abatement of mainstem aggradation could be economically feasible.
the majority,in contrast,concludes that abatement is unreasonable as a matter of law,because the cost of remediating the damage to property caused by the aggradation and associated flooding is about percent more than the value of the tribe property in its prior condition.op.at.i do not agree that this price tag renders the condition unabatable as a matter of law.moreover,the cited estimate of remediation costs is primarily for repairs to sewer and systems and to homes.it does not address the perhaps much lower cost to abate the aggradation itself,by way of dredging or flushing flows.the aggradation is the underlying condition caused by the diversion of water by the cushman project and it should be the focus of the abatability inquiry 
in conclusion,i am persuaded that the tribe claims for nuisance and trespass survive summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds i respectfully dissent from the majority contrary conclusion.
according to the majority,indian tribes and their members can not,under federal law,sue municipalities for damages for violation of rights secured by indian treaties.the case law simply does not support the majority broad pronouncement.indeed,county of oneida oneida indian nation,d county of oneida ii,is quite directly to the contrary,permitting suits for damages under federal common law for violation of aboriginal rights reserved by treaty.
more specifically,supreme court precedent,as well as cases from the courts of appeals,support the conclusions that a both tribes and individual members of tribes may sue municipalities for damages for violations of the tribes treaty rights and b individual tribe members may sue under for violations of their asserted right to take fish at the usual and accustomed times.the majority contrary assertions largely ignore two centuries of understandings concerning the federal protection of indian aboriginal and particular,the understanding that indian treaties in large part simply preserve some aboriginal rights in exchange for cession of a portion of indian land.whether the majority conclusions would make sense if we were developing the law of indian rights to the use of land and water i do not think they not the question,as we are not free to reinvent established doctrine.i therefore respectfully dissent 
without examining what rights,if any,the tribe reserved under the treaty of point no point treaty,stat.the majority mistakenly dismisses all possibility that the tribe can seek damages for violations of any such rights.this by a misplaced focus on cases concerning attempts to imply causes of action from statutes or from international settled precedent concerning indian rights.the scope of a cause of action to enforce indians aboriginal rights,including such rights reserved in treaties with the united states,can not sensibly be resolved by invoking lines of authority developed in areas of the law lacking the long tradition of federal common law protection accorded indian property and related rights.as the majority reasoning fails to appreciate the uniquely federal nature of the land,water,and fishing claims by indians,it is largely beside the point.there are hard issues in this case concerning the precise import of several precedents concerning indians rights,but the majority simplistic approach misses them all.
i note at the outset that the majority is quite correct in in rights of action are available for equitable relief against parties to indian treaties.ante at.from this starting point,however,the majority rushes to the unsupported conclusion that a tribe may not recover monetary damages for alleged treaty violations.in doing so,the majority makes three major missteps conflating interpretation of this indian treaty with a private cause of action under treaties and federal statutes asserting that the status of tacoma public utilities tpu and the city of tacoma city somehow absolves those entities of responsibility here and conjuring a distinction between damages and equitable relief inconsistent with binding authority.
the majority rests its constrained interpretation of the rights reserved the relief available to treaty upon a foundation of wholly irrelevant cases.cases construing title vi of the civil rights act alexander sandoval,d or the securities exchange act of touche ross redington,d have little relevance to the interpretation of indian treaties the supreme court has made clear that indian treaties are unique,governed by different canons of construction than those that apply to statutes and other treaties.see,county of oneida ii,at.
moreover,there is no general rule preferring equitable relief over damages when implying a cause of action.rather,were the statutory private cause of action cases pertinent,they would not support any distinction between equitable and damages relief,unless there is some indication that congress specifically intended such a distinction.sandoval,at.the judicial task is to interpret the statute congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.touche ross,at.o ur task is limited solely to determining whether congress intended to create the private right of action asserted and as with any case involving the interpretation of a statute,our analysis must begin with the language of the statute itself.the majority points to no indication that congress intended to allow suits in equity but not for damages to enforce indian fishing rights reserved by treaties.
in short,the cases cited by the majority for the proposition that equitable but not damages relief is available with regard to rights reserved by a federal indian treaty are of no help at all in establishing that point.
in addition to its reliance on inapposite strands of case law,the majority also suggests that,even if the treaty is,the treaty can not be enforced against the city and tpu because they are parties no case cited by the majority,and no case i have discovered,supports the conclusion that rights created in an indian treaty can only be enforced by one signatory against the other,whether for equitable relief or for damages.instead,the cases relying on the principle that states and their agents are bound to respect rights are legion.see,county of oneida ii,at.approving a federal common law suit against two counties for violation of federal aboriginal rights partly secured by treaty washington.state commercial passenger fishing vessel ass n,d fishing vessel suit brought by the united states on its own behalf and as trustee for seven indian tribes against the state of washington to enforce treaty rights other tribes,the state fisheries and game departments,and one commercial fishing group were joined as parties united states washington,cir suit brought by numerous indian tribes and the united states on the tribes behalf against the state of washington to enforce treaty rights several private parties intervened and appealed kimball callahan,cir suit brought by individual indians against officers of the state of oregon to enforce treaty rights.
further,as the majority recognizes,united states winans,enforced indian treaty rights even against private.so did united states washington,at.
in winans,the united states,on behalf of certain members of the yakima nation,brought suit to enjoin private land owners from preventing indians exercise of their treaty rights to fish on the defendants private property.see at.the court held that the treaty between the united states and the tribe fixe d in the now privately owned land such easements as enable the right to be exercised.id.at.explained winans 
the right to resort to the fishing places in controversy was a part of larger rights possessed by the indians which were not much less necessary to the existence of the indians than the atmosphere they breathed t he treaty was not a grant of rights to the indians,but a grant of right from reservation of those not granted the treaty imposed a servitude upon every piece of land as though described therein the contingency of the future ownership of the lands,therefore,was foreseen and provided other words,the indians were given a right in the right of crossing it to the right to occupy it to the extent and for the purpose mentioned.no other conclusion would give effect to the treaty.and the right was intended to be continuing against the united states and its grantees as well as against the state and its grantees 
id.at.emphasis added.similarly,united states washington held that,i n light of winans,fishing vessel,and the stevens treaties language and power as the supreme law of the land,the district court correctly determined that the tribes have a right to harvest shellfish on private tidelands.at emphasis added.
so,then,if the treaty is and the treaty can be enforced against parties,what is left of the majority assertion that the tribe can not seek damages for elimination of fishing rights secured by a treaty to fill this gap,the majority asserts,repeatedly but without citation to any pertinent authority,that in a case involving a nonsignatory to the treaty,there is a determinative distinction in enforcing these rights between an action for damages and an action for equitable relief.ante at.
the entirety of the majority reasoning on this point seems to be that the cases upholding causes of action for violation of indian treaty rights but providing only equitable relief implicitly held that damages are not available.in neither fishing vessel nor puyallup tribe department of game of washington,d,however,were the indians seeking damages.see fishing vessel,at.suit seeking an interpretation of the treaties and an injunction requiring the state to protect the indians share of anadromous fish runs puyallup tribe,at.these suits were brought by respondents in the state court against the indians for declaratory relief and for an injunction.that,presumably,is why the availability of damages was not discussed courts are not in the habit of commenting on the availability of relief no one wants.so,even if this availability of damages were a question of first impression,the majority would need more than its ipse dixit to support the damages equitable relief distinction central to its conclusion.
more important,the question before us emphatically is not one regarding an undecided question.there is binding authority supporting awarding monetary relief when indians seek to enforce their aboriginal rights,including such rights reserved in a treaty.
the first sentence of justice powell opinion in county of oneida ii explains these cases present the question whether three tribes of the oneida indians may bring a suit for damages for the occupation and use of tribal land allegedly conveyed unlawfully in.at.emphasis added.to answer this question,the court explored at some length the historical availability of federal causes of action to enforce indian aboriginal rights,whether secured by treaties or not,concluding that indians have a federal common law right to sue to enforce their aboriginal land rights.id.at.consequently,the oneidas could maintain their damages action for violation of their possessory rights based on federal common law.id.at.moreover,this circuit,citing county of oneida ii,has similarly affirmed the ability of an indian tribe to bring a damages action against a public utility based upon a federal common law cause of action.see united states pend oreille pub.util.dist,cir see also mescalero apache tribe burgett floral,cir.this authority makes plain that indian tribes may bring a damages action under federal common law to enforce their rights to use of land.
a closer examination of the nature of the tribe claimed rights further reveals the majority fundamental misunderstanding of the very claim it summarily dismisses.like the oneidas the tribe here is not simply seeking to enforce rights created by the treaty.rather,it is claiming to enforce an aboriginal right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations emphasis added reserved in the treaty.see oneida indian nation county of oneida,d county of oneida i characterizing the right claimed by the tribe as one in which federal law now protects,and has continuously protected from the time of the formation of the united states,possessory right to tribal lands,wholly apart from the application of state law principles which normally and separately protect a valid right of possession see also winans,at.
in this instance,the primary right at issue is not a claim to plenary possession of land but,instead,a claim of right to both the kind of servitude enforced in winans,and to a preservation of the fish flow itself.this distinction might matter were we to consider,on the merits,the asserted reach of the rights reserved in the treaty.but there is no conceptual distinction that would explain why the right to possession asserted in county of oneida ii,if it existed which is what the bulk of that opinion addressed,see at.would support a cause of action for damages,while the fishing rights here asserted,if they exist which neither the majority nor i address,see supra note would not.
for these reasons,as the language from winans suggests,the prism through which the majority is viewing the treaty rights issue is inverted.the majority proceeds on the premise that federal enforcement of rights traceable to an indian treaty always follows the same principles as enforcement of treaties with nondomestic nations.but indian fishing rights,as winans indicates,were not granted by the treaties rather,they were reserved by the treaties and are traceable to aboriginal possessory interests,given up in part in treaties.as such,the rights thus derived are enforceable,if at all,under federal common law.see county of oneida ii,at.nez perce tribe idaho power,holding that the federal common law action recognized in county of oneida i is available for damages actions based on purported tribal fishing rights,noting that the tribe right to fish is aboriginal in origin,as it was in county of oneida i,and is reinforced by federal common law and the treaty.
once more,so to state is not to settle the question whether the rights here preserve fish runs from reserved by the treaty of point no point.see supra note.it is only to say that if the right was reserved,it is enforceable in a damages action under the federal common law.in failing to acknowledge that possibility,and,instead,resting on inappropriate analogies to treaties with foreign governments and on federal statutes having nothing to do with indian rights,the majority reaches a conclusion in direct conflict with binding law.
after concluding that treaties,though and enforceable in equity against third parties,may not be enforced in damages against a party other than the signatories,the majority goes on to hold that neither the tribe nor any individual members may bring suit under.this conclusion,like the conclusion that there is no possible federal common law cause of action for damages based upon rights,reflects an inattention to nuance in the case law with regard to the rights of indian tribes and their members.
first,the majority relies upon inyo county indians of the bishop community,d,to support its conclusion that the tribe may not,because of its status as a sovereign,bring a claim under section.see ante at.
inyo county held that a tribe may not sue under to vindicate a right held solely because of its status as a sovereign.see inyo county,at.as the majority recognizes,ante at,this narrow holding leaves open the possibility that a tribe may bring suit to vindicate rights similar to those held by private persons.see id.at.discussing cases in which the supreme court had held states and foreign nations to be persons.
the tribe here,unlike the tribe in inyo county,did not base any of its claims on rights or privileges held as a sovereign sovereign immunity,but rather on fishing rights assertedly traceable to federal law and therefore beyond the authority of local governmental entities to impair,because of the supremacy clause.no special immunity premised on sovereignty as such is claimed.instead,the underlying right asserted is one akin to a property right or a water right,commonly held by private parties,including entities such as corporations or associations.compare id.at.t he tribe rests its case entirely on its claim that,as a sovereign,it should be accorded a special immunity that private casinos do not enjoy.stevens,concurring in the judgment.inyo county therefore does not settle whether for purposes of this case,the tribe qualifies as a person who may sue under to vindicate the rights asserted in its complaint.
hoopa valley tribe nevins,cir,is not to the contrary.hoopa valley held that b ecause the right to tribal government protects the powers conferred upon the tribe,and not individual rights,it falls outside the scope of.id.at.but,as in inyo county,the tribe in hoopa valley was attempting to assert a tribal government right,held solely because it was a,its freedom from state taxation.
hoopa valley also relies on a distinction between power conferring provisions and rights conferring provisions of federal law,holding that power conferring provisions,such as the supremacy clause,are not rights that can be vindicated under.id.while the supremacy clause can not,by itself,form the basis of a claim,see golden state transit city of los angeles,d,that is because the supremacy clause is not a source of any federal rights.id.citation omitted.in dennis higgins,d,however,the supreme court upheld a cause of action under based on the commerce clause,rejecting the argument that the commerce clause could not be the basis of a cause of action because it merely allocates power between the federal and state governments and does not confer rights.id.at.the court instead held that the commerce clause both was a power allocating provision and constituted a substantive restriction on permissible state regulation of interstate commerce.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.somewhat similarly,in golden state transit,the court held that rights created by the national labor relations act can support a action,because in that circumstance follows as a matter of substantive right.at.quoting brown hotel restaurant employees and bartenders int l union local,d.
here,the bases of the tribe claims are the takings and due process clauses of the federal constitution,although the fishing rights assertedly unconstitutionally taken are traceable to the treaty and,ultimately,to aboriginal possession.while it was a treaty in this instance that assertedly preserved the fishing rights,in other instances similar indian fishing and hunting rights are preserved by agreement or statute,not treaty.see antoine washington,d.the rights here at issue,then,unlike the status central in inyo county and hoopa valley tribe,are only indirectly and marginally connected to the sovereign status of the tribe.private entities can also assert takings and due process claims,tracing their asserted property rights to federal grants,reservations,agreements or statutes.i would therefore be inclined to hold that is available to remedy the violations of federal law alleged by the tribe 
i need not answer that question definitively,however,as i am quite certain that a suit can be maintained by the individual tribe members.the majority reasoning to the contrary runs thus the only rights cognizable under are individual rights the tribe right to fish is a communal right therefore,individual members may not bring suit to enforce their fishing rights.
before addressing this syllogism,i note that there is no support for the more general proposition that rights can not support a cause of action,period.the only case that even suggests as much,united states washington,cir washington i,held only that claims resulting solely in the interpretation of treaties are not cognizable under,but that if a state violates these now known and rights,there would be an actual conflict between state and federal law which might give rise to a action.id.at citation omitted.so even this rather odd holding indicates that there are cases in which violations of rights secured in part by indian treaties can give rise to claims.and,in fact,we have so recognized in a later appeal in united states washington,cir washington ii,where we awarded fees under,explaining 
t he case before us differs from these earlier cases in a single critical respect while previous litigation has attempted to define the treaty rights,this proceeding is purely an action to enforce them 
the tribes are entitled to section fees to enforce such treaty rights.
id.at citation omitted.
in light of washington ii,washington i should be reconsidered rather than relied upon.ordinarily,whether a case is cognizable under does not turn on whether the rights are or not,although qualified immunity does turn upon that consideration.see saucier katz,d wong ins,cir.the pertinent precedent for present purposes is therefore washington ii,recognizing that indian treaty fishing rights can give rise to a action.
as to the majority individual fishing rights syllogism,this circuit has granted relief to individual tribe members suing to enforce their treaty fishing rights.see kimball,at granting declaratory relief to individual indians suing to enforce their rights to hunt,trap,and fish within the klamath indian reservation free of oregon fish and game regulations,pursuant to a treaty.kimball was later cited by the supreme court in support of the proposition that s uch treaty rights as the right to hunt and fish can be asserted by dion as an individual member of the tribe.united states dion,d.dion cited for this proposition,in addition to kimball,winans and united states felter,cir.id.
while kimball did not involve a suit brought under,it did reject the logic of the majority opinion that individual tribe members may not enforce treaty fishing rights because they are communal.as kimball explained 
although the treaty giving exclusive fishing rights to the quinaielts was with the tribe,the court held in mason sams,that the right of taking fish was a right common to the members of the tribe and that a right to a common is the right of an individual of the community.id.
from mason it is clear that an individual indian enjoys a right of user in tribal property derived from the legal or equitable property right of the tribe of which he is a member.
at quoting mason,at parallel citation omitted.the hunting and fishing rights at issue in kimball,like the fishing rights here,were rights.see id.at 
individual indians have brought a number of cases in the district courts to enforce their treaty rights.while i recognize these opinions do not squarely address whether the individual plaintiffs have stated a cognizable cause of action under,they do indicate that other courts have found this marriage of treaty rights and to be acceptable.see,canadian regis band of mohawk indians ex rel.francis new york,d oyler finney,aff,cir unpublished table decision mille lacs band of chippewa indians minnesota,aff,cir,aff,d lac courte oreilles band of lake superior chippewa indians wisconsin,appeal dismissed,cir per curiam sohappy smith,aff in part,cir per curiam.
i would therefore hold that the individual indians may bring suit under asserting violation of fishing rights.
in sum,because i find no support for barring the tribe and its members from bringing under the federal common law based on rights or via respectfully dissent.once more,because the majority does not decide the question,critical though it is,i do not decide whether the tribe or its members have alleged a right to preservation of fisheries that is protected under federal common law or.
aggradation occurs when deposits of sediment cause the floor of the river to build up over time,leading to flooding and elevated water tables.
the ftca also requires plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing suit.see mcneil united states,d.the tribe met this requirement by filing an administrative claim for damages on september,which was rejected on november.see amended complaint at.
the indian tucker act is identical to the tucker act,except that it specifies indian tribes as eligible claimants.the indian tucker act was passed because there had been considerable doubt as to whether the tucker act applied to indian tribes.see gregory sisk,yesterday and today of indians,breach of trust,money,and sovereign immunity,tulsa.
we reject defendants contention that the fpa preempts the tribe damages claims against the city and tpu.defendants argument is based on the fact that in,the city received a license from the federal power commission fpc authorizing the flooding of acres of federal land that would result from the project.see city of tacoma,at,wl.defendants assert that the tribe claims are actually collateral attacks on the licensing decision,which are governed by the fpa and which the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider.see b.the license was a narrow minor part license,applying by its terms only to the occupancy and use of a tract of land approximately acres in area said land constituting a minor part of said power project.as the federal energy regulatory fpc recognized,the license did not authorize the construction,operation,and maintenance of the cushman project.city of tacoma,at.it is true that the fpa provides exclusive jurisdiction for the courts of appeals to review and make substantive modifications to ferc licensing orders.cal.save our streams council,yeutter,cir.but the tribe is not attempting to collaterally attack the licensing decision rather,it is suing for damages based on impacts that are not covered by the license.the fpa does not preempt the tribe claims.
judge berzon dissent misreads our opinion as assuming that the cases upholding causes of action for violation of indian treaty rights but providing only equitable relief implicitly held that damages are not available.berzon dissent at.we find only that those cases did not recognize an implied right of action for damages,and that there are no grounds for inferring that the parties to the treaty intended to create such an action.gebser lago vista indep.sch,d stating that courts implying rights of action have a measure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme that best comports with the relevant enactment.similarly mistaken is the dissent description of our opinion as holding that indian tribes and their members can not,under federal law,sue municipalities for damages for violation of rights secured by indian treaties.berzon dissent at.we analyze a specific set of claims brought under a specific treaty,and we thus have no occasion to consider whether different rights of action might be implied from other treaties.
in her dissent,judge berzon relies on united states washington,cir washington ii.berzon dissent at.but in that case we ruled only that lower courts must distinguish between litigation defining and enforcing treaty rights in determining whether attorney fees should be awarded under.id.at.we did not consider,let alone resolve,whether indian tribes may properly sue as persons under section for violation of rights the question does not appear to have been raised.
judge berzon disagrees with our conclusion in significant part based on kimball callahan,cir kimball ii,where we reaffirmed our prior holding in kimball callahan,cir kimball i,that an individual indian possessing treaty rights to hunt,fish,and trap on a former reservation retained those rights even though he relinquished his tribal membership pursuant to a tribal termination act.kimball ii,at.as the dissent concedes,however,the kimball cases did not involve a suit brought under.berzon dissent at.moreover,the cases dealt with the rights of individual indians after their tribe was terminated.indeed,we expressly distinguished washington,at,and whitefoot,at,on the ground that n either of these cases was concerned,as was kimball i,with the tribal rights of individual indians upon the termination of a tribe.kimball ii,at.our case likewise does not involve claims made by individual indians after the tribal entity has been ii further limited kimball i
