a venerable legal latinism,lex non cogit ad impossibilia,teaches that the law does not compel the impossible.guided by that august adage,we hold that a subpoena duces tecum compelling the production of documents to a grand jury can not be enforced by civil contempt sanctions before a successor grand jury,and we accordingly vacate the district court order holding the appellant in civil contempt.we reject,however,the appellant additional contentions that tribal sovereign immunity shielded it from subpoena and that the subpoena was unreasonably broad in scope.
because this case is under seal,we provide only a cursory rehearsal of the facts.on october,appellant narragansett indian tribal historic preservation office nithpo was served with a subpoena duces tecum issued by a grand jury in the district of rhode island the previous month the subpoena directed the custodian of nithpo records to appear before the grand jury with a series of documents on the morning of october.during the course of ensuing negotiations with nithpo as to the scope of the subpoena,the government repeatedly extended the return date for the subpoena.when these negotiations proved fruitless,the government ultimately set a return date of february.on the last day before that deadline,nithpo informed the government that it would not produce the subpoenaed records before the grand jury,asserting inter alia that tribal sovereign immunity shielded it from the grand jury subpoena power.
the sitting grand jury was subsequently discharged,and a new grand jury was empanelled in its place on april.on may,the government moved to compel nithpo compliance with the subpoena,representing in its motion that although the subpoena had been issued by a previous grand jury,the investigation had been transferred to the grand jury.nithpo objected to the government motion and moved to quash the subpoena on grounds of tribal sovereign immunity and unreasonableness.
on august,the district court entered an order granting the government motion to compel and,except for some narrowing of the scope of the subpoena,denying nithpo motion to quash.the court ordered nithpo to comply with the october,grand jury subpoenas at a mutually agreed upon date and time within days.after nithpo custodian of records failed to appear on the date,september,the government moved for a court order requiring nithpo to show cause why it should not be held in civil contempt for its noncompliance.the district court issued a show cause order on october,and after a contempt hearing the following month,adjudged nithpo in civil contempt and imposed a fine of per day of noncompliance beginning on december.this appeal followed.
nithpo raises three primary arguments on appeal,contending that the underlying subpoena was no longer enforceable following the discharge of the issuing grand jury in april nithpo enjoyed tribal sovereign immunity from the grand jury subpoena power and the subpoena was unreasonably broad in scope under.c.we address each argument in turn,reviewing de novo the district court legal determinations as to enforceability and sovereign immunity,see project kemp,cir,and reviewing for abuse of discretion the district court decision as to reasonableness under rule c,see united states larouche campaign,cir.
enforceability 
in response to the district court show cause order,nithpo contended unsuccessfully that the district court could not enforce a subpoena issued by a defunct grand jury.nithpo raises the same argument in this appeal,averring that civil contempt sanctions for noncompliance with a subpoena can not be imposed beyond the life of the grand jury under whose aegis the subpoena was issued.the government in turn suggests that civil contempt sanctions are keyed to the life of the grand jury for which the contempt order was issued here,the grand jury empanelled on april.the parties arguments rest on divergent interpretations of the applicable statute and caselaw,to which we presently turn.
we have described the federal courts contempt power as one of the most potent weapons in the judicial armamentarium.project,at.although that authority was not codified until,civil contempt sanctions have been employed against recalcitrant grand jury witnesses since the earliest days of the federal courts.douglas berman,note,coercive contempt and the federal grand jury,colum,see also,gompers buck stove range.unlike criminal contempt sanctions,incarceration for civil contempt is not for the purpose of punishing recalcitrant respondents but rather is the modern persuasive tool that is used in substitution of the barbaric placing of stones on the subject chest,which was formerly used to literally press the recipient into submission.united states marquardo,cir.an imprisoned civil contemnor is therefore said to carr y the keys of his prison in his own pocket.gompers,at internal quotation marks omitted.in keeping with this coercive function,courts have long recognized that civil contempt sanctions are necessarily limited to the period in which the contemnor can unlock the figurative prison door by purging himself of contempt.see,shillitani united states,marquardo,at in re grand jury proceedings caucus,cir united states levine,cir loubriel united states,cir,united states collins.
in shillitani,involving two consolidated cases in which the district courts ordered recalcitrant grand jury witnesses imprisoned until they purged their contumacy or until two years had passed,the supreme court held that the period of confinement was inappropriate to the extent that it exceeded the term of the sitting grand jury.as the court explained,
the justification for coercive imprisonment as applied to civil contempt depends upon the ability of the contemnor to comply with the court order.where the grand jury has been finally discharged,a contumacious witness can no longer be confined since he then has no further opportunity to purge himself of contempt.accordingly,the contempt orders were improper insofar as they imposed sentences that extended beyond the cessation of the grand jury inquiry into petitioners activities.having sought to deal only with civil contempt,the district courts lacked authority to imprison petitioners for a period longer than the term of the grand jury once the grand jury ceases to function,the rationale for civil contempt vanishes,and the contemnor has to be released.
at citation and footnote omitted.shillitani did,however,leave open the possibility of reiterative contempt sanctions before successive grand juries the court explained in a footnote that although any given period of confinement for civil contempt could not last beyond the term of the sitting grand jury,sentences of imprisonment may be continued or reimposed if the witnesses adhere to their refusal to testify before a successor grand jury.id.at.
four years after the supreme court decision in shillitani,congress enacted title iii of the organized crime control act,stat,codified at,in an endeavor to codify present civil contempt practice with respect to recalcitrant witnesses in federal grand jury and court proceedings,at section a provides 
whenever a witness in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the united states refuses without just cause shown to comply with an order of the court to testify or provide other information,including any book,paper,document,record,recording or other material,the court,upon such refusal,or when such refusal is duly brought to its attention,may summarily order his confinement at a suitable place until such time as the witness is willing to give such testimony or provide such information.no period of such confinement shall exceed the life of 
the court proceeding,or 
the term of the grand jury,including extensions,
before which such refusal to comply with the court order occurred,but in no event shall such confinement exceed eighteen months.
the parties dispute the significance of both shillitani and a in this case.their sharpest dissensus,however,concerns the import of our holding in caucus distributors,in which we relied on both shillitani and a to hold that civil contempt fines could not extend beyond the life of the original grand jury and into the term of a successor grand jury.at.our holding rested on shillitani conclusion that the justification for coercive civil contempt vanishes when the contemnor can no longer purge himself 
perhaps our most significant difficulty lies in contemplating how,when witnesses have been subpoenaed,as here,both to appear to testify and to bring documents to a specific grand jury and that jury has been discharged,a court would handle attempts to purge a court would be placed in the anomalous position of determining whether the response of a witness in supplying or failing to supply documents facilitated or frustrated the work of a grand jury that no longer existed particularly since it would be relatively simple and clear cut for a successor grand jury to reimpose coercive sanctions,we prefer not to enter this thicket.
the government suggests that caucus distributors is distinguishable from this case in that both the underlying subpoena and the subsequent contempt order were issued during the term of the first grand jury.in its estimation,the original grand jury contemplated in caucus distributors is the one before which the subpoena was enforced via contempt sanctions here,the second grand jury nithpo,by contrast,implies that caucus distributors instead focused on the grand jury under whose auspices the underlying subpoena was issued in the first place here,the defunct first grand jury.
we find caucus distributors inconclusive on this point.moreover,although the government highlights the language of a limiting confinement to the term of the grand jury before which such refusal to comply with the court order occurred,we conclude that a also does not address the precise question presented in this case.the issue before us is not the proper duration of the contempt order imposed during the second grand jury term,but rather whether that contempt order,based on nithpo failure to comply with a previous grand jury subpoena,was properly issued at all.
the government position is not without some support in the caselaw.confronted with a case similar to this one,in which an initial grand jury issued a subpoena duces tecum and the district court granted the government motion to compel compliance during the term of a successor grand jury,the circuit distinguished our holding in caucus distributors and held that the first grand jury subpoena could be enforced during the term of the successor grand jury.in re sealed case.in the circuit view,because the successor grand jury had indisputably carried the investigation forward,the concerns that we had stated in caucus distributors about determining when an investigation has ceased were not implicated.id.citing caucus,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the circuit,like the government on this appeal,also pointed to our observation in caucus distributors that a subpoena issued by one grand jury may be used to obtain evidence for a second grand jury.caucus,at citing in re grand jury proceedings sutton,cir upholding a district court order commanding delivery of documents subpoenaed by an expired grand jury.that isolated sentence,however,can not bear the weight placed upon it.because the government in caucus distributors did not move to compel compliance before the second grand jury,we did not have occasion,as we do now,to determine the enforceability of the first grand jury subpoena before a successor grand jury.indeed,we cited sutton for this proposition only in describing the underpinning of the government unsuccessful argument in caucus distributors.as an observation not essential to the determination of the legal questions then before the court,this statement is therefore dicta.arcam pharm.fara,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also dedham water,cumberland farms dairy,cir 
to the extent that sutton and sealed case approve the use of the contempt power in the circumstances now before us,we disagree with those decisions.such a rule,allowing the imposition of contempt sanctions even where a contemnor is unable to purge himself of contumacy before the subpoenaing grand jury,would vitiate the coercive rationale for civil contempt.the second grand jury may have taken up the investigation,but the subpoena was issued in the name of,and ordered the production of records before,the first grand jury at a specified date and time.as judge hand stated in loubriel,nithpo duty to testify was measured by the subpoena,the only process under which nithpo could be required to appear and to testify at all.at.that subpoena did not require nithpo attendance before any other than the october grand jury.see also in re grand jury,august,mcclintock merchantile,cir finding no basis for anxiety that the respondent can be required to appear before some other grand jury under a subpoena direct ing attendance on a certain day,at a certain hour,before the august term,of the grand jury.it follows as a matter of logic that nithpo could only comply with the subpoena so long as the issuing grand jury was in existence.
in this case,the subpoenaing grand jury was dead to begin with it had expired even before the government moved to compel compliance with its subpoena.the district court order granting the motion to compel therefore ran afoul of the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia literally,t he law does not compel to impossible ends,black law dictionary ed.see collins,at.nithpo could not produce documents before a grand jury that no longer existed,and therefore could,of course,be no longer compelled to discharge a duty which had ended.loubriel,at see also in re grand jury proceedings,thursday special grand jury.term,cir the subpoenas issued by the september term grand jury clearly do not have force as a result of the expiration of that grand jury.accord in re special investigation,the grand jury was dead.there was no one to whom the subpoena was returnable it thus was impossible to enforce the subpoena.
the impossibility of compliance in turn left nithpo unable to purge itself of contempt.the proverbial key in nithpo pocket fit a lock that no longer existed.gompers,at.we accordingly take guidance from shillitani dictate that civil contempt sanctions are inappropriate when a contemnor has no further opportunity to purge himself of contempt.at.because it was impossible for nithpo to purge itself of contempt,the contempt order served no coercive purpose and was therefore improperly entered.see loubriel,at following discharge of the subpoenaing grand jury,appellant could not be lawfully detained thereafter,merely to compel compliance with the subpoena sara sun beale et,grand jury law and practice.ed.t he witness confinement can not last longer than the session of the grand jury before which the witness was subpoenaed,because the termination of the grand jury session ends the witness ability to comply with the court order,and thus ends the possible coercive effect of the civil contempt sanction.see also levine,at.
in parting,we note that the government has argued that this conclusion would establish an arbitrary and formalistic rule requiring reissuance of subpoenas upon each transfer between grand juries,which merely creates a trap for the unwary prosecutor and an incentive for contemnors to engage in delaying tactics,as happened here.of concern to us,however,is that the government proposed alternative allowing reiterative civil contempt sanctions before future grand juries based on noncompliance with an old subpoena would render the grand jury subpoena process all but meaningless.particularly since we and other courts have long recognized that a prosecutor may simply obtain subpoenas issued in blank by the court,fill in the blanks,and have the witnesses served without consulting the grand jury,in re melvin,cir a point that the government itself stresses on this appeal we see no great administrative difficulty in requiring,as a precondition to the use of coercive contempt power,the issuance of a new subpoena for each new grand jury.if the current grand jury or a successor desires information from a recalcitrant nithpo,the government need do no more than obtain a new,enforceable subpoena.that is a small pr
