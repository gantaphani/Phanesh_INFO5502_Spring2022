gregg and others,including the fallis brothers,had been drinking most of the evening of july,at a bar,a residential trailer,and then finally,at a mint farm.while at the mint farm,gregg expressed interest in a woman who rejected him to spend time with jerrod.after receiving this rejection,gregg and his friend jacob big eagle big eagle drove around the reservation.upon their return,they found the woman with jerrod in james new car,leaving the mint farm.according to witnesses,gregg accelerated,spraying gravel onto james new car before returning to the mint farm to rejoin the drinking party.gregg testified he did not recall the incident or spraying dust or gravel onto james car.
when jerrod returned to the mint farm,he confronted gregg about the gravel and informed his brother of the incident.the fallis brothers,gregg,and big eagle attempted to ascertain the damage.gregg said he saw no damage,but offered to pay for any repairs resulting from sprayed gravel.there was a verbal altercation between james and gregg,which escalated when james pushed gregg.gregg was then by james companion,francis red tomahawk chaske.while gregg was on the ground,chaske kicked gregg in the head until he was stopped by brent sazue.neither james nor jerrod kicked gregg.however,when gregg stood up,james hit him one to three times and he fell back down.
after the fight,the party dispersed.big eagle,sazue,and jerrod,the only persons remaining on the mint farm other than gregg,helped gregg to his feet.gregg,seeing his truck domelight lit,went to his truck.he returned from his truck with a rifle,threatening sazue and jerrod.big eagle grabbed the rifle from gregg and put it into his truck.sazue and jerrod then approached gregg and asked what was wrong with him because,they claimed,friends do not pull guns on friends.gregg apologized and thereafter jerrod invited gregg and big eagle to celebrate independence day with him and james.jerrod and sazue then left the mint farm.
as gregg was ready to depart,big eagle visited with him and noticed gregg was crying and upset.gregg testified he was upset big eagle did not stand up for him during the fight.gregg testified big eagle said if i did stand up for you then,i will now.the two then departed the mint farm.although big eagle had put gregg rifle into his car,at some point gregg had retrieved the rifle.gregg testified he then drove to a bluff overlooking the missouri river to think about the events which had transpired when he noticed a rifle in his truck which did not appear to be his,but appeared to be the type of automatic rifle used in iraq.reminded of iraq,he threw the rifle,along with the clips,into the river 
gregg testified he became afraid big eagle would confront james and jerrod and went to look for him.in his search and approximately forty minutes after the prior altercation,gregg arrived at chaske residential trailer where the group was drinking the night before gregg saw james car and testified he decided to apologize again to james because he was afraid of james and wanted to avoid a family feud from forming.a witness testified to hearing gregg ask where chaske was.
upon arrival,james came out of the trailer,stating,you come back for more you want to fight gregg testified james then tried to pull gregg out of his truck.other witnesses testified james opened the door,but then closed it immediately.during the altercation,gregg grabbed a pistol in his car and pointed it at james,telling him to back away.gregg testified james responded by saying,you want to fuck with guns i got guns and then ran toward his truck.three other witnesses testified they heard james say the first sentence,but they did not hear him say he had guns.as james was running away from the truck,gregg shot at james nine times,hitting him five times in the back and wounding him fatally.gregg then left the scene and called big eagle.big eagle informed gregg that james had died.
gregg was indicted on charges of first degree murder on an indian reservation in violation of,and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,in violation of c.a jury found gregg not guilty of first degree murder,but found him guilty of second degree murder and of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence.the district court sentenced gregg to months for the second degree murder conviction and to the statutory minimum of months for the conviction of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence.pursuant to c d ii,the sentences were made to run consecutively.gregg now appeals his convictions and sentence.
gregg challenges his convictions arguing he lacked the state of mind necessary to support a conviction of second degree murder,the requisite crime of violence supporting the firearm charge specifically,gregg argues the district court erred by excluding both general opinion and reputation evidence regarding james violent nature as well as specific acts evidence of james alleged prior violent conduct.gregg argues this evidence goes both to whether james was the aggressor in the confrontation and to gregg state of mind.
we review the evidentiary rulings of a district court only for abuses of discretion,and will reverse only when an improper evidentiary ruling affects the substantial rights of the defendant or when we believe that the error has had more than a slight influence on a verdict.united states ballew,cir see also united states two eagle,cir a ruling on admissibility will not be reversed on appeal absent a clear and prejudicial abuse of discretion.if the ruling is purely a legal interpretation of the federal rules of evidence,the ruling is reviewed de novo.see united states smith,cir.
gregg argues the district court erred by preventing testimony from gregg and other witnesses regarding specific instances of james prior violent conduct to prove james was the aggressor.the government,by motion in limine,sought to prevent testimony regarding any specific act of violence committed by james.in response,gregg trial counsel notified the district court he did not intend to introduce such specific acts evidence,but would only seek to introduce reputation evidence regarding james violent character.the district court granted the motion in limine while allowing gregg to elicit reputation evidence regarding james violent character.
a defendant can introduce evidence of a victim violent character to establish conformity therewith in homicide cases where is raised.see.a evidence of a person character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith except e vidence of a pertinent trait of character of the alleged victim of the crime offered by an accused,or by the prosecution to rebut the same,or evidence of a character trait of peacefulness of the alleged victim offered by the prosecution in a homicide case to rebut evidence that the alleged victim was the first aggressor.united states emeron taken alive,cir when a defendant raises a claim,reputation evidence of the victim violent character is relevant to show the victim as the proposed aggressor.see also smith united states.e vidence that the deceased had the general reputation of being a quarrelsome and dangerous person,was competent with regard to issue of,especially if his character in this respect was known to the defendant.
however,a victim violent character is not an essential element of the charge of murder or the defense of.see united states talamante,cir when character evidence is used circumstantially to create an inference that a person acted in conformity with his or her character,rule allows proof of character only by reputation and opinion.bingham baker.serv.cbc,cir pe
