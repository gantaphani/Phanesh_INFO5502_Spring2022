a jury convicted donovan new of two counts of involuntary manslaughter for causing a accident that resulted in the death of his father and cousin.he raises several issues on appeal,and we affirm.
on june,new drove with his father and cousin on highway near the pine ridge indian reservation in south dakota.new and his cousin had been drinking heavily that day.at around,the driver lost control of the vehicle,which went into a ditch on the opposite side of the road,rolled twice,and landed in a field.the vehicle had been traveling at about miles per hour at the time of the accident,on a road with a speed limit of miles per hour.new and his cousin were thrown from the vehicle,and new father was trapped in the back seat.only new survived.at the scene,new claimed that his cousin was the driver.
new was flown to rapid city regional hospital.hospital staff performed a blood test,which showed a blood alcohol content and the presence of marijuana.later that day,he was given a variety of medications due to his spinal injuries,difficulty breathing,and pain in his chest and shoulder.
the following afternoon,special agent charles cresalia of the federal bureau of investigation arrived at the hospital to interview new.new admitted that he had been driving at the time of the crash and had consumed alcohol earlier in the day.
several weeks after the accident,new went to the bureau of indian affairs bia building at pine ridge to reclaim his belongings left at the scene of the accident.while there,he spoke with bia special agent fred bennett.new told bennett that he had been driving at the time of the accident,although he also said that others were telling him that he was not the driver,and that he was having doubts about his memory of that night.in late july,bennett arrested new on charges of involuntary manslaughter.in a interview,new said he was not sure who was driving.
at trial,the jury heard evidence from various lay witnesses,officers,doctors,and experts in accident reconstruction.new also testified in his own defense that he could not remember who was driving at the time of the crash.the jury found him guilty on both counts of involuntary manslaughter.at sentencing,the district court applied an adjustment for obstruction of justice under the advisory guidelines based on a finding that new committed perjury during the trial.the court ultimately sentenced new to consecutive terms of months imprisonment on each count of involuntary manslaughter.
new claims that his statements made during the interview in the hospital room should have been suppressed because agent cresalia took those statements in violation of the rule of miranda arizona,d.miranda requires that law enforcement agents provide certain prescribed warnings before conducting an interrogation of a suspect who is in custody.id.at.new contends that he was in custody during the hospital interview,because he was physically unable to leave,and that agent cresalia was thus required to advise him of the miranda warnings before questioning him.we review the district court decision on this matter de novo.united states axsom,cir.
the supreme court in miranda stated that warnings are required when interrogation is initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.miranda,at.since then,the court has clarified that a suspect is entitled to miranda protection when he is in custody,and that the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest.california beheler,d per curiam internal quotation omitted.the custody inquiry thus turns on whether,given the totality of the circumstances,a reasonable person would have felt at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave,thompson keohane,d,or in this case,to terminate the interrogation and cause the agent to leave.
at the time of the interview in question,new was in a private hospital room,confined to his bed in a neck brace and under medication.when agent cresalia entered,he identified himself to new,explained he was investigating the fatal accident,and told new that he did not have to talk.cresalia advised new that he would not be arrested,that he could stop the interview at any time,and that he could ask the agent to leave the room at any time.the district court found that cresalia used neither force nor deceptive tactics during the interview.new used his call button to summon his nurse twice during the interview,but never sought to terminate the meeting with cresalia.the final eight minutes of the conversation were tape recorded,and the district court found that new answers appeared to be very coherent.the district court heard extensive evidence regarding new medications,and found expressly that new was not impaired at the time of the interview,and that even if he was under the influence of narcotic painkillers,there is no evidence that he was so intoxicated that he did not understand his rights.new was not arrested at the conclusion of the interview.
new physical condition and immobility require careful analysis of whether miranda should apply,but we conclude,based on the totality of the circumstances,that new was not in custody.in resolving this question,we focus on the restraint imposed by the government agents,axsom,at,because t he sole concern of the fifth amendment,on which miranda was based,is governmental coercion.colorado connelly,d see also united states erving,cir.t he most obvious and effective means of demonstrating that a suspect has not been taken into custody is for the police to inform the suspect that an arrest is not being made and that the suspect may terminate the interview at will.united states griffin,cir internal quotation omitted.agent cresalia made use of this obvious and effective means by informing new at the outset that he could terminate the interview at any time,and that he would not be arrested.cresalia followed through with his assurance by making no arrest at the end of the encounter.the agent himself placed no constraints on new movement or on his ability to communicate with hospital staff.there is no basis to question the district court finding that the agent used no force or deceptive tactics,and we do not think the atmosphere in this hospital room,where a nurse was summoned twice to attend to new during the interview,can be fairly described as police dominated.see id.at.given that cresalia plainly communicated new freedom to decline the interview and took no other actions to aggravate the environment,we conclude that new was not in custody,and that miranda warnings were not required 
we also conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that new statements to agent cresalia were voluntary.a confession is voluntary if it is the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker.schneckloth bustamonte,d.new argues that the influence of medications,the psychological implications of his circumstances,and his physical helplessness in a strange location combined to render his statements to cresalia involuntary.we are not persuaded.
our cases hold that a confession may not be found involuntary absent some type of coercive activity on the part of law enforcement officials.united states kime,cir.there was no coercive activity by agent cresalia that overbore new will or impaired his capacity for.see schneckloth,at.the district court finding that new suffered from no mental impairment from medication is supported by expert testimony and not clearly erroneous.against that backdrop,cresalia simple act of asking questions in a minute interview,while emphasizing that new was not under arrest and was free to terminate the meeting,is not the sort of conduct that results in an overborne will attributable to an agent of the government.see generally united states lebrun,cir en banc.
new also appeals the admission of two prior convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol dui.evidence of prior crimes is not admissible to prove a defendant bad character or propensity to commit bad acts,but it may be admissible for other purposes,including to prove requisite knowledge.see.b.one element of the charged offense in this case was satisfied by proof that the defendant knew,or could reasonably foresee,that his conduct was a threat to the lives of others.doc,jury instruction.the government offered the evidence of prior convictions to prove that element.we review the district court evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion.united states spears,cir en banc.
we agree with the view of several courts,summarized by the tenth circuit,that a jury could infer from defendant prior drunk driving convictions that he is especially aware of the problems and risks associated with drunk driving.united states tan,cir see united states loera,cir united states fleming,cir t he driving record was relevant to establish that defendant had grounds to be aware of the risk his drinking and driving while intoxicated presented to others.new contends that we should take a different view in this case,because there is no evidence that he was actually driving a vehicle in the incidents that led to his prior convictions.south dakota law authorizes a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol where an intoxicated person either drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle.codified laws.thus,the state supreme court upheld a conviction even where a defendant was merely asleep behind the wheel of a stationary vehicle with the keys in one of his pockets.state kitchens.our decision in united states mccall,cir en banc,held that a felony conviction for dui qualifies as a violent felony under e only if there is evidence that the offender was actually driving while intoxicated.because we concluded in mccall that an offender convicted of dui without driving did not present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,at,new argues that absent evidence that his prior convictions were premised on actually driving while intoxicated,the convictions are not probative of his knowledge in the instant case.
we are not persuaded that mccall analysis of e dictates the proper interpretation of federal rule of evidence b.the issue in this case was not whether the conduct underlying new prior convictions presented a serious potential risk of physical injury,but whether the fact that new sustained those convictions tended to make it more probable that he had knowledge of the risks of driving while intoxicated.the prior convictions were relevant,because o ne who drives a vehicle while under the influence after having been convicted of that offense knows better than most that his conduct is not only illegal,but entails a substantial risk of harm to himself and others.tan,at emphasis in original internal quotation omitted.whether or not new prior convictions involved the underlying conduct of driving a vehicle is not dispositive.an offender who has been convicted and punished for operating a parked car while intoxicated would be acutely aware of the seriousness with which society treats drunk driving the risk of injury to others is so grave that even one who merely gets behind the wheel of a vehicle while intoxicated is subject to criminal sanction.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that new prior dui convictions were admissible to show knowledge under rule b.
new next contends that the district court erred by declining to order production of agent bennett case report after he testified.the jencks act requires the district court,on the motion of a defendant,to produce any statements of a government witness that relate to the subject matter of the witness testimony,after the witness has testified on direct examination.b.the statements that must be produced include any written statement made by the witness.id.e.we review a district court ruling under the jencks act for clear error.united states newton,cir.
in this case,defense counsel discovered through cross examination of agent bennett that the agent had prepared a case report that the government had not produced.in a bench conference,the prosecutor declared that she had turned over all information bennett had gathered in the course of his investigation,but that she had not turned over his report describing details of the case,because it contained no impeachment or exculpatory material.the court asked the prosecutor if she had reviewed this report for material discoverable under brady maryland,d.when the prosecutor affirmed that she had,the court declared,case report is not covered under discovery rules.it summaries of interviews,any brady material,any jencks material.i going to deny the request.
there is no requirement in the jencks act that a statement meet a threshold for impeachment value or include exculpatory evidence before it is discoverable.as long as it is a statement that relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified,b,then it should be ordered produced.the report at issue is a typewritten document,headed details of case,that sets forth actions that bennett took on the date of the accident and observations that he made at the scene of the accident.the agent report describing what he saw and did at the crime scene is related to his testimony on direct examination about the crime,and we see no basis to conclude that it is not a statement discoverable under the jencks act.
having determined that there was noncompliance with the jencks act,we must consider whether the error requires reversal of new conviction.where,as here,there is no indication of bad faith on the part of the government,we will not reverse unless there is a showing of prejudice to the defendant.united states douglas,cir united states roberts,cir.
new gave only one example of potential prejudice in his brief on appeal.he contends that bennett report mentioned that one of new shoes was found stuck on the vehicle center console,which was dislodged from its original location.new claims he could have used this information to show a discrepancy between what bennett remembers from the scene and the testimony of another officer regarding the scene.even without the report,however,new was able to adduce the relevant evidence from bennett.on direct examination,bennett testified that he had seen new shoe at the center console of the vehicle.on cross examination,he testified that the console was ajar.in short,bennett testimony on the witness stand was entirely consistent with his written report on these points.there is no reason to believe that new was prejudiced by his inability to review bennett prior consistent statement.
at oral argument,new counsel argued that bennett report would have helped his cross examination of agent cresalia.new claims that his confession to cresalia was influenced by detailed information that cresalia gave him about the crash,which convinced new that he must have been the driver.cresalia testimony was inconsistent with new assertion that cresalia provided detailed information,because cresalia said he only knew the barest information about the accident from two phone conversations he had with bennett.bennett courtroom testimony agreed with cresalia.
this theory is an unlikely basis for showing prejudice under the jencks act,for the purpose of the disclosure requirement is to assist the defense in the witness who made the statement,not with questioning some other witness in this case,a witness who already had testified before bennett even appeared.see jencks united states,d.even so,bennett report is not inconsistent with cresalia testimony.bennett recorded that in the first telephone conversation,he gave cresalia the names of the victims and briefed him on the investigation.bennett had not yet been to the scene,so this briefing could not have included the details that new claims cresalia divulged to him.as to their second conversation after bennett arrived at the scene,bennett noted in his report only that he had paged cresalia,and that cresalia returned the message immediately and briefed sic on the investigation.bennett wrote that he asked cresalia to do a blood draw and check new condition.the report does not state that bennett provided cresalia with details about the accident a
