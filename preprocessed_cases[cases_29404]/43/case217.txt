factual and procedural background 
tribal land 
the tohono nation,formerly known as the papago tribe,is a federally recognized indian tribe with over members.the tribe is descended from native americans who resided for centuries along the banks of the gila river in arizona.in,by executive order,president chester arthur set aside for the nation a acre gila bend reservation in southwestern arizona.the size of the reservation was later reduced to acres by executive order of president william howard taft.in,in order to provide flood protection to areas,the federal government completed construction of the painted rock dam,located on the gila river approximately ten miles from the gila bend reservation.in subsequent decades,flooding from the dam caused major damage to the reservation,destroying farm land and rendering the reservation land economically unviable.the nation was left with a reservation which for all practical purposes could not be used to provide any kind of sustaining economy.the nation sought a legislative remedy,rather than engaging in lengthy litigation,and petitioned congress for a new reservation on lands that would be suitable for agriculture.
ii.gila bend indian reservation lands replacement act 
in,pursuant to section of the southern arizona water rights settlement act,stat,congress recognized its trust responsibility to find a different land base for the nation.section authorized the secretary of the interior the secretary to conduct a study of the reservation,and to find lands suitable for a tribal reservation.the ensuing study concluded that the reservation land had little economic value and was unsuitable for agriculture or grazing.another study found that there were no public lands within a mile radius of the reservation that were suitable as potential exchange properties for the reservation.
in,congress passed the act to facilitate the replacement of the reservation lands,and to promote the economic of the nation.the act authorized the nation to assign acres of tribal land within the gila bend indian reservation to the federal government in exchange for authorized the nation to purchase up to acres of private land,which would,at the request of the nation,be held in trust for the tribe,and thereby be incorporated into tribal land and released the nation claims against the united states for past injuries to land and water rights,a,c d,a.the act requires that purchased private land be held in trust and not be outside the counties of maricopa,pinal,and pima,arizona,or within the corporate limits of any city or town.id.d.in,the nation assigned its rights in the reservation lands and relinquished its claims against the united states.
iii.acquisition of land and trust application 
in august,the nation purchased acres of unincorporated land within maricopa county,arizona the replacement lands for million.the replacement lands are wholly located in an unincorporated county island,surrounded on all sides by land incorporated within the city of glendale the city,and include,among other properties,a acre portion known as parcel.
on january,the nation filed an application with the bureau of indian affairs,requesting that the replacement lands be taken into trust pursuant to the act.at the same time,the nation publicly revealed its plan to build a casino on parcel of the replacement lands pursuant to the authority of the indian gaming regulatory act,igra.pursuant to the igra,gaming activities may only take place on land that is part of an indian reservation.thus,having at least some portion of the replacement land held in trust which transforms the land into tribal land is a precondition to the nation conducting gaming operations on that portion of the land.on march,as a result of an ongoing action,the nation modified its application to request that only parcel of the replacement lands be taken into trust,and that the department of the interior hold in abeyance the rest of the nation application for the transfer of the replacement lands.
on july,the secretary determined that parcel satisfied all the legal requirements of the act,and that taking parcel into trust was mandatory.the secretary adopted the position that,under arizona law,the replacement lands are not part of the city because they are not within the city corporate limits.he expressly concluded that parcel is not within the corporate limits of any city or town based on the plain and jurisdictional meaning of corporate limits under the act.the secretary also agreed that the trust application concerning the remaining portions of the replacement lands would be held in abeyance,pending a new request by the nation.the secretary published notice of his decision on august.he was then permitted to take parcel into trust days after publication of notice of his decision.see b.
iv.opposition and litigation 
the nation trust application and subsequent plans to build a gaming casino on parcel have been vigorously opposed by defendants,the gila river indian community,and others.
shortly after the secretary july decision,the city,the gila river indian community,and others filed lawsuits against the department of the interior in the district of arizona,challenging the parcel decision as a violation of the administrative procedure act and the constitution.the nation subsequently intervened as a defendant,and the state of arizona and various state legislators intervened as plaintiffs.the lawsuits were consolidated into one proceeding,denominated gila river indian community united states,cv.in march,the district court in gila river indian community upheld the secretary decision and rejected statutory and constitutional challenges brought by the city,the state of arizona,and others.the plaintiffs in that case appealed.the district court enjoined the united states from taking parcel into trust and enjoined the city from annexing parcel during the pendency of the appeal.
in an opinion issued on july,we affirmed the district court decision in part and reversed in part.see gila river indian community united states,cir.we concluded that the phrase within the corporate limits under section d of the act was ambiguous,and we instructed that the matter be remanded to the secretary to reconsider the phrase in light of the ambiguity we identified.id.at.once our mandate issued,and the district court remanded gila river indian community united states to the secretary consistent with the ninth circuit opinion and mandate,it terminated the case,thereby dissolving its injunction.
on june,we vacated submission of the present appeal pending the secretary determination on remand.in response to our remand,on july,the secretary reaffirmed that the phrase within the corporate limits has a jurisdictional rather than geographical meaning and was meant to describe lands that have actually been incorporated by a municipality.applying this definition,the secretary determined that parcel was not within the corporate limits of the city and that the legal requirements under the act for acquiring
