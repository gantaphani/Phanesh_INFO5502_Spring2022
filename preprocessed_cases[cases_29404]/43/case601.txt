introduction 
mother shirley appeals from the juvenile court jurisdictional finding under welfare and institutions code section and dispositional order under section removing her adoptive son francisco from her care.mother also alleges that the department of children and family services dcfs failed to adhere to the indian child welfare act icwa based on mother own claim of cherokee heritage.we affirm the juvenile court because substantial evidence supports its findings that francisco came under the court jurisdiction per section,subdivision j,that substantial danger to francisco existed if he remained in mother care,and that there were no reasonable means to protect francisco without his removal from mother custody.we also conclude that the icwa is inapplicable to francisco case as francisco is neither a member of an indian tribe,nor is he the biological child of a member.
facts and procedural background 
mother and the adoptive father adopted two siblings,francisco and his year old sister fabiola,in april.three years later,fabiola suddenly developed diabetes,and then contracted influenza b and pulmonary mucormycosis,a rare fungal infection.she died shortly thereafter in march from multiple organ failure.the dependency proceedings in this case arise out of concerns for francisco well being and safety,following the sudden illness and death of fabiola.dcfs initially filed the section petition for francisco under subdivisions b and j,alleging mother medical neglect of fabiola and the risk of future abuse and neglect to francisco by mother.at the time dcfs filed the section petition,francisco was not detained from mother custody.based on increasing concerns regarding mother lack of appropriate judgment and decision making as to the medical care of fabiola,mother refusal to disclose francisco whereabouts to dcfs,and francisco vulnerability due to his autism,dcfs detained francisco with a court order.
during its investigation of mother home and her care of the two children,dcfs reviewed referrals from mandated reporters,relatives,and neighbors dating from to present,all which reported mother abuse of foster adoptive children.dcfs recognized a pattern of emotional,verbal,and physical abuse within the referrals,and confirmed the allegations of abuse with statements from fabiola,a former foster child named miracle,who was previously removed from mother home due to allegations of abuse,and family members.based on that information,dcfs amended its section petition under subdivisions b and j to include its new theory that mother habitually verbally abused fabiola and that francisco was at risk of emotional harm and similar abuse.
in support of its petition,dcfs provided evidence that mother was physically and verbally abusing fabiola and francisco,and that mother had a long history of foster child abuse.the evidence consisted of dcfs investigation into referrals alleging emotional,verbal,and physical abuse by mother toward fabiola,francisco,and various foster children,as well as interviews with family members and relevant parties,and dcfs social workers observations.
mother abuse of fabiola and francisco 
interviews with fabiola and family members indicated that mother was frequently calling fabiola derogatory names,two expletives in particular,and that mother physically abused both fabiola and francisco.the abuse motivated fabiola to run away from mother home on several occasions.in june,shortly after fabiola had run away from home and returned,fabiola reported to dcfs that mother had been calling her names and putting her down.she also stated that mother lies a lot and also has her lying for her.fabiola disclosed that mother biological son also called her names and physically hit her.
fabiola reported to dcfs in may that mother had called her derogatory names because she had an attitude and had sex with a year old boy.fabiola also stated that mother lied and was mean to her.on another occasion,fabiola told dcfs that mother hit her buttocks with a broom handle.this verbal and physical abuse was of particular significance as fabiola was in therapy,taking antidepressants,and under the care of a psychiatrist at that time.
furthermore,dcfs discovered that mother did not attempt to retrieve fabiola after she learned of fabiola whereabouts when fabiola ran away.in connection with its investigation of this runaway incident,dcfs also noted that francisco ran out of the house unsupervised and did not return for several hours.based on these events,dcfs determined that mother had neglected the children and initiated voluntary family maintenance services for mother and the children.
former foster child miracle,who lived in mother home with fabiola and francisco,also confirmed the abuse.she stated that w hen i was living there mother would put us down and verbally abuse us.miracle stated that mother whoop ed francisco when he misbehaved.she reported that mother would tell lies regarding the foster children.
some of mother family members corroborated that mother was verbally abusive toward the children.three family members two of mother nieces and mother sister stated that mother called fabiola derogatory names.one of the nieces had previously lived with mother and had witnessed the verbal abuse.additionally,all three expressed great concern regarding mother motives for taking care of the children and her integrity,alleging that she had a history of lying and that she was money hungry.
francisco and fabiola biological mother expressed concerns that fabiola was bullied by mother.the biological mother explained that mother and mother biological son would regularly call fabiola derogatory names.she also stated to dcfs that mother whipped francisco when he misbehaved.following fabiola death,the biological mother reported to dcfs that mother publicly made very upsetting and disparaging remarks at fabiola wake,saying that fabiola was incorrigible and abusive to francisco.
in addition to the verbal and physical abuse,there was evidence that mother was not providing the children with a sanitary living environment and was requiring fabiola to do the majority of the housework and cooking.in march,during fabiola admission to the hospital,a children social worker csw reported that mother own bedroom smelled like dog urine and feces and was filled with clothing and other belongings.at that time,mother refused to allow the csw to enter and evaluate francisco and fabiola rooms.during an interview,one of francisco adoptive maternal cousins stated that the home was unsanitary,not too safe,and not a kid environment two of mother family members,the children biological mother,as well as foster child miracle confirmed that mother required the children,fabiola in particular,to perform all of the housework and cooking for the household.
mother prior history of abuse 
there were also many allegations regarding mother physically and verbally abusing,and neglecting other children in her care.historically,mother had five different foster children removed from her care on five separate occasions due to allegations of verbal,emotional,and physical abuse.
in june,two foster children were removed from mother care when dcfs substantiated claims of caretaker absence.two months later,a child was removed from mother care after allegations were substantiated that the child was malnourished,anemic,overweight,and hyperpigmented from diaper rash,and that mother home was dirty,smelled of urine,and lacked fresh food.in,another foster child was removed from mother care after a neighbor reported hearing mother physically beat the child.years later in,foster child miracle disclosed at school that she was physically and emotionally abused by mother.fabiola and francisco were also in mother care at this time.although the allegations were deemed unfounded,miracle was removed from mother care.
most recently,an infant was removed from mother care in march based on concerns for the child health and safety.in relation to dcfs investigation of mother treatment of francisco and fabiola,a csw visited mother at mother home on march.during the visit,she observed mother inappropriate treatment of a foster child,who h
