this litigation has a lengthy history which is only briefly reviewed here.in,the ottawa and chippewa indian nations and the united states government signed the treaty of washington.under the terms of the treaty,the indians ceded some of their lands and waters,encompassing large portions of what is now the state of michigan and the great lakes,to the united states government while reserving certain rights in the ceded territory.article of the treaty provides,in part the indians stipulate for the right of hunting on the lands ceded,with the other usual privileges of occupancy,until the land is required for settlement.stat.the interpretation of the latter clause,and its application to modern circumstances,are in dispute in this litigation.
a.the tribes treaty right to fish in the great lakes 
the united states brought this lawsuit against the state of michigan in,on its own behalf and on behalf of the bay mills indian community,to protect the tribe rights to fish in certain waters of the great lakes under the treaty and to enjoin the state of michigan alleged interference with those rights.united states michigan,modified in part,cir.thereafter,the bay mills indian community and the sault marie tribe of chippewa indians successfully moved to intervene as plaintiffs and added certain state officials as defendants.id.at.the michigan united conservation clubs mucc,a sportsman group,also filed a motion to intervene as a defendant.id.at.
pursuant to a motion filed by the plaintiffs,the district court,in a written opinion,bifurcated the case into a declaratory phase and a remedial phase.the court planned to consider in the first phase w hether the indians reserved or retained fishing rights in the great lakes waters purportedly ceded by them under the treaty of,and whether the state of michigan had jurisdiction to regulate the exercise of those rights by treaty tribe members.the court declared that if such rights were found to exist and could be regulated by the state of michigan,the court would proceed to the second phase to determine which,if any,state regulations may be applied to the indians in the exercise of their reserved rights.
in the same opinion,the district court denied mucc motion to intervene,noting that its decision was based largely upon the fact that there will be separate trials as to the declaratory and remedial aspects of this case.the court explained that,although mucc had an interest in the case,it had failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the state of michigan would not adequately represent its interest with respect to the issues to be decided in the declaratory phase.the court permitted mucc to participate as amicus curiae and noted that mucc could renew its motion to intervene once the status of the indians treaty rights had been decided.on appeal,more than years ago,this court affirmed,concluding that the record did not indicate that mucc was inadequately represented by the state of michigan.united states michigan united conservation clubs,cir unpublished disposition.
at the conclusion of the declaratory phase,the district court found that the tribes retained the right to fish in the waters of the great lakes and connecting waters ceded by the treaty of.united states michigan.at.the court also concluded that the tribes right to fish in the great lakes could not be regulated by the state of michigan except as authorized by congress.id.at.on appeal,this court affirmed in part,holding that t he fishing rights preserved to the indians in the treaty continue to the present day as federally created and federally protected rights.united states michigan,at.however,this court also held that the state of michigan could regulate the tribes fishing rights under certain circumstances,and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.id.at.meanwhile,during the pendency of the appeal,the district court permitted the grand traverse band of ottawa and chippewa indians to intervene in the case.
during the ensuing district court proceedings,the parties and amici curiae sought to resolve the conflicts between indian and interests regarding the management and allocation of the great lakes fishery in view of the tribes recognized treaty rights.in,after extensive negotiations,the parties reached a settlement regarding the allocation of the great lakes fishery and signed an agreement for entry of a consent judgment,which was adopted by the district court and remained effective for years.in,the parties stipulated to the entry of another consent decree,to remain effective until.
b.the tribes inland treaty rights 
before,the parties were litigating claims involving only the indians right to fish in the great lakes,and did not seek any judicial determination regarding the tribes right to hunt and fish on inland lands and waters.in,the united states circulated,but did not file,a draft supplemental complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the tribes inland treaty rights.on september,the state of michigan formally launched the current phase of the litigation by filing a motion for leave to file a counterclaim against the tribes.the state of michigan asserted that the purpose of the counterclaim was to begin the process of determining whether any usufruct u ary rights under the treaty of washington outside of the great lakes and connecting waters exist.the counterclaim sought a declaration that the tribes do not retain any hunting fishing rights in inland areas under the treaty of washington,except for sic on federal lands,that have never passed out of federal control and to sic which the exercise of those rights is not inconsistent with the purpose for federal ownership.the district court entered an order granting the motion on november,and the counterclaim was filed the next day.
on january,the tribes filed a joint reply to the state of michigan counterclaim.the tribes elected not to assert sovereign immunity as a defense,but instead,denied that the treaty right is limited to federal lands that have never passed out of federal control and on which the exercise of the treaty right is not inconsistent with the purpose of federal ownership.
in anticipation of a status conference scheduled for february,the parties filed a joint status report in which they jointly proposed a schedule premised on a trial.according to the report,the parties had agreed that d iscovery and trial in this phase of this litigation would be limited to the issues raised by defendants counterclaim,the reply thereto,and the united states supplemental complaint.
at the status conference,the parties discussed the expected course of the proceedings and the witnesses to be called at trial.because the state of michigan had not named the united states as a,believing it to be immune from suit,counsel for the united states informed the court that he would be filing a supplemental complaint so that the issue raised by the state of michigan counterclaim would be final and binding on all parties.counsel for the proposed intervenors also participated in the conference and notified the parties of his intent to file a motion to intervene in the case.
on february,the district court entered a case management order,mandating,among other things,that all motions for joinder of parties and all motions to amend the pleadings be filed by april.the united states filed a timely motion for leave to file its supplemental complaint.the complaint did not seek to expand the issues raised in the state of michigan counterclaim,but merely sought a declaratory judgment that the tribes
