three juvenile defendants,each of whom is a member of an indian tribe and who pleaded true to a charge of aggravated sexual abuse with children,appeal their conditions of probation or supervision requiring registration under the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,et.defendants argue that sorna registration requirement contravenes the confidentiality provisions of the federal juvenile delinquency act fjda,et,and also challenge its constitutionality.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and.because we conclude that congress,in enacting sorna,intentionally carved out a class of juveniles from the fjda confidentiality provisions,and that sorna registration requirement is constitutionally sound,we affirm the district courts imposition of the sex offender registration conditions.
background 
these consolidated appeals united states juvenile male,united states juvenile male,and united states juvenile male involve juvenile proceedings against three native americans who pleaded true to committing aggravated sexual abuse with children.as a condition of probation or supervision,each was required to register as a sex offender pursuant to sorna.
juvenile defendants 
an enrolled member of the fort peck tribes,was charged with committing an act of juvenile delinquency pursuant to et for offenses committed in july.was born on june,and thus was seventeen years old at the time of the offense and is twenty years old at present.if had been an adult at the time of the offense,the charge against him would have constituted aggravated sexual abuse with children in violation of a and c.
on august,pleaded true to the information without entering into a plea agreement.on august,the district court entered a disposition sentencing to a term of probation,subject to several conditions.as special conditions,the district court ordered to comply with the requirements of the sex offender registration and notification act comply with sexual offender registration requirements for convicted offenders in any state in which resides and register in person as a sex offender with law enforcement in the jurisdiction in which resides,is employed,and is a student.

on april,pleaded true to the information pursuant to a plea agreement.the plea agreement states that by pleading true pursuant to this agreement is waiving all the rights set forth in paragraph nine,however,paragraph nine does not mention sex offender registration or any condition of supervision.separately,the plea agreement states that has been advised and understands,that under the sex offender registration and notification act,a federal law,the defendant must register and keep the registration current.
at the june,sentencing hearing,counsel noted that the question of whether or not a juvenile should be required to register underneath sorna was unresolved and pending before the ninth circuit.the district judge stated that the issue that before the ninth circuit is whether you can require a juvenile to register under sorna at all and that issue,as far as i concerned,is preserved by you.
on june,the district court sentenced to official detention for three years,recommending that be placed in a therapeutic environment for youthful offenders,and ordered two years of juvenile delinquent supervision following his release from detention,subject to a number of special conditions.as special conditions,the district court ordered to comply with the requirements of the sex offender registration and notification act and register in person as a sex offender with law enforcement in the jurisdiction in which resides,is employed,and is a student.

on august,pleaded true to the information without entering into a plea agreement.at the september,sentencing hearing,counsel objected to the imposition of sorna registration requirements on.the district court agreed to withhold entry of a final order pending its review of supplemental briefing on the sorna issue.both the government and m.filed supplementary memoranda in which argued that he should not have to register under sorna sex offender registration requirements because is a juvenile and his registration would be anathema to the fundamental purpose of the fjda.
on september,the district court entered a disposition sentencing to two years of official detention,recommending that be placed in a therapeutic environment for youthful offenders.the district court ordered to enter juvenile delinquent supervision following his release from detention until september,his eighteenth birthday,subject to a number of special conditions.as special conditions,the district court ordered to comply with sexual offender registration requirements for convicted offenders in any state in which resides and register in person as a sex offender with law enforcement in the jurisdiction in which resides,is employed,and is a student.
b.the federal juvenile delinquency act fjda 
the fjda,et,governs the detention and disposition of juveniles charged with delinquency.united states three juveniles,cir.first enacted in,the fjda was intended to provide for the care and treatment of juvenile delinquents,id.at quoting,at,in recognition of significant differences between juvenile delinquents and adult offenders.as congress later noted in a committee report on proposed amendments to the fjda,o ur objective must be to minimize the youngster penetration into all negative labeling,institutional processes a t each critical step,we should exhaust the less rejecting,the less stigmatizing recourses before taking the next expulsive step,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we have concluded that the purpose of the fjda is to enhance the juvenile system by removing juveniles from the ordinary criminal justice system and by providing a separate system of treatment for them.united states juvenile,cir quoting united states frasquillo zomosa,cir.these safeguards are necessary in order to avoid the stigma of a prior criminal conviction and to encourage treatment and rehabilitation.united states doe,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus a successful prosecution under the act results in a civil adjudication of status,not a criminal conviction.juvenile,at quoting united states doe,cir.s o long as a juvenile remains within the auspices of the fjda for sentencing,he or she is presumptively capable of rehabilitation,and any sentence imposed by a district court must accord with this presumption.id.
the fjda includes a number of provisions to ensure that information about juvenile delinquency proceedings remains safeguarded.provides that any proceedings against an alleged juvenile delinquent may be convened at any time and place within the district,in chambers or otherwise.u.a further provides that t hroughout and upon the completion of the juvenile delinquency proceeding,the records shall be safeguarded from disclosure to unauthorized persons.a.i nformation about the juvenile record may not be released when the request for information is related to an application for employment,license,bonding,or any civil right or privilege,except for in limited circumstances relating to court proceedings,treatment,law enforcement investigation,or national security.id.moreover,the statute specifies that the identity and image of the juvenile may not be disclosed even where proceedings are opened or documents are released neither the name nor picture of any juvenile shall be made public in connection with a juvenile delinquency proceeding.e.
c.the sex offender registration and notification act sorna 
on july,congress enacted the adam walsh child protection and safety act,et,which includes the sex offender registration and notification act sorna.congress enacted sorna i n order to protect the public from sex offenders and offenders against children,and in response to the vicious attacks by violent predators.sorna thus establishes a comprehensive national system for the registration of those offenders.id.
sorna defines sex offender as an individual who was convicted of a sex offense.the statute also specifies that 
the term convicted or a variant thereof,used with respect to a sex offense,includes adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile for that offense,but only if the offender is years of age or older at the time of the offense and the offense adjudicated was comparable to or more severe than aggravated sexual abuse as described in section of title,or was an attempt or conspiracy to commit such an offense.
emphasis added.under c,any person who knowingly engages in a sexual act with another person who has not attained the age of years may be convicted of aggravated sexual abuse.id.any individual convicted of violating is classified as a tier iii sex offender under sorna.
under sorna comprehensive national registration system,sex offenders must register,and keep the registration current,in each jurisdiction where the offender resides,where the offender is an employee,and where the offender is a student.a.the offender must appear in person,allow the jurisdiction to take a current photograph,and verify the information in each registry.each jurisdiction must make public the contents of its sex offender registry,including each registrant name,address,photograph,criminal history,and status of parole,probation,or supervised release.b,a.tier iii sex offenders must register with the applicable jurisdiction every months.id.the registration period for a tier iii offender is for life,u.a,with the possibility of a reduced period of years if the offender maintains a clean record,b.
ii.mootness 
for a case or controversy to be justiciable under article iii,it must remain extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.arizonans for official english arizona,d internal quotation marks omitted.t hroughout the litigation,the party seeking relief must have suffered,or be threatened with,an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.spencer kemna,d quoting lewis cont l bank,d 
in united states juvenile male juvenile male ii,d,vacating cir,the supreme court found that an appeal of a similar sex offender registration condition was moot because the order of juvenile supervision imposing the condition had expired prior to the ninth circuit decision id.at.the defendant in juvenile male ii pleaded true to charges that he engaged in sexual acts that,if he had been an adult,would have constituted aggravated sexual assault.id.at citing a,c.the defendant was sentenced to official detention followed by a period of juvenile supervision,with the condition that he register as a sex offender,until his birthday.id.defendant challenged the registration condition,but while his appeal was pending before us,he turned and the supervision order requiring him to register as a sex offender expired.id.at.the supreme court found that the expiration of the order rendered the appeal moot,because the defendant was no longer subject to the condition that he sought to challenge on appeal.id.at.
in criminal cases,a defendant wishing to continue an appeal after the expiration of his or her sentence must suffer some continuing injury or collateral consequence sufficient to satisfy article iii.see spencer,at.accordingly,to determine whether there was an ongoing collateral consequence,the court,in united states juvenile male juvenile male i,d,had certified a question to the montana supreme court,inquiring whether 
r espondent duty to remain registered as a sex offender under montana law was contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his federal order that required him to register as a sex offender,or is the duty an independent requirement of montana law that is unaffected by the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile supervision conditions 
id.at citations omitted.the montana supreme court responded that the state law duty to remain registered as a sex offender is not contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his federal supervision order,but is an independent requirement of montana law.juvenile male ii.at internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court then concluded,on the ground that any decision an appellate court could make would have no effect,not even on the state registration requirement,that the ninth circuit lacked the authority under article iii to decide this case on the merits.id.at.
the government argues that the three consolidated cases under review here are similarly moot because the defendants are required to register independently under montana state law regardless of any decision by this court addressing their sorna obligations under federal law.we disagree.first,each of the juvenile defendants in this case is currently subject to an unexpired condition of his release or supervision requiring sex offender registration under sorna.indeed,the conditions requiring registration will remain in effect until august,for,september,for,and march for second,in addition to those conditions,all three defendants are subject to sorna independent registration requirement for a period of at least years,if not for the duration of their life,because of their status as tier iii sex offenders.a,b.this federal requirement that the defendants register as sex offenders is independent from any requirement under state law.because this federal requirement remains in effect,whether defendants are properly subject to sorna registration requirement remains a live controversy for us to adjudicate,and these consolidated appeals thus are not moot.
in juvenile male ii,the supreme court considered and rejected the argument that the appeal in that case can not be considered moot in any practical sense because respondent may have an independent duty to register as a sex offender under sorna itself.at.the supreme court held that because the defendant had only challenged the validity of the special conditions of supervision,any broader question related to sorna requirement was not at issue.id.at.the court did acknowledge that the independent,continuing obligation under sorna,in another case,might provide grounds for a challenge to sorna registration requirements.id.the instant consolidated appeal is precisely such a case,as each defendant objects both specifically to the special condition requiring registration and generally to the constitutionality of sorna as applied to juveniles,and therefore is not moot.
iii.conflict between fjda and sorna 
we next consider whether the sorna registration requirement imposed by the district court contravenes the confidentiality provisions of the fjda.we review a district court construction or interpretation of a statute de novo.see beeman tdi managed care servs,cir united states cabaccang,cir en banc.
the government argues that sorna and the fjda do not conflict because they each operate on different classes of individuals and agencies.specifically,it contends that the fjda confidentiality provisions restrict disclosure of the records of juvenile proceedings by employees of the court or any government agency,u.c,while sorna reporting requirements operate directly on the juvenile himself.we disagree with that characterization,and find that several provisions of the two statutes conflict because sorna registration provision makes public information that would otherwise remain confidential under the fjda.
the fjda provides that u nless a juvenile who is taken into custody is prosecuted as an adult neither the name nor picture of any juvenile shall be made public in connection with a juvenile delinquency proceeding.e emphasis added.the fjda further provides that information about the juvenile record may not be released when the request for information is related to an application for employment,license,bonding,or any civil right or privilege.a.sorna,however,requires that a sex offender registry include the name,address,physical description,criminal history and status of parole,probation,or supervised release,current photograph,and other identifying information.sorna further requires that each jurisdiction shall make available on the internet,in a manner that is readily accessible to all jurisdictions and to the public,all information about each sex offender in the registry.a.because it is clear that the government public release of juvenile records authorized by sorna would have been prohibited under the fjda prior to the passage of sorna,we find that the two statutes conflict.
where two statutes conflict,the,more specific provision generally governs.see acosta gonzales,cir c onflicting statutes should be interpreted so as to give effect to each but to allow a later enacted,more specific statute to amend an earlier,more general statute.internal quotation marks omitted,abrogated on other grounds by garfias rodriguez holder,cir.sorna unambiguously directs juveniles over the age of convicted of certain aggravated sex crimes to register,and thus carves out a narrow category of juvenile delinquents who must disclose their juvenile crimes by registering as a sex offender.for all other juvenile delinquents,the fjda confidentiality provisions remain in force.
the relationship between sorna and the fjda is further clarified by congress clearly stated intent to limit confidentiality in the case of certain juvenile sex offenders.see,pt,at while the committee recognizes that states typically protect the identity of a juvenile who commits criminal acts,in the case of sexual offenses,the balance needs to change no longer should the rights of the juvenile offender outweigh the rights of the community and victims to be free from additional sexual crimes strikes the balance in favor of protecting victims,rather than protecting the identity of juvenile sex offenders.cong.rec,daily ed.july,statement of kennedy this compromise allows some offenders over to be included on registries,but only if they have been convicted of very serious offenses.thus,congress was aware that it was limiting protections under the fjda by applying sorna to certain juvenile delinquents,and intended to do so.
we therefore hold that the district court properly applied sorna registration requirements to the juvenile defendants in these cases.although the defendants may disagree with the policy implications of sorna,particularly with regard to confidentiality,congress appears to have considered those concerns in enacting sorna.our review is limited to interpreting the statutes,and both the statutory text and legislative history of sorna suggest its reporting and registration requirements were intended to reach a limited class of juveniles adjudicated delinquent in cases of aggravated sexual abuse,including appellants.
iv.constitutional challenges 
defendants further argue that subjecting juvenile sex offenders to sorna registration is unconstitutional.in particular,they allege that doing so violates i the equal protection clause ii the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment iii the right against iv substantive due process v procedural due process and vi the right to effective counsel.we review the constitutionality of a statute de novo.eunique powell,cir citing gray first winthrop,cir.
equal protection 
defendants argue that sorna registration requirements violate the juveniles right to equal protection by irrationally distinguishing between juvenile sex offenders over fourteen,who are categorically required to register as sex offenders,and other juvenile offenders,who are entitled to an adversary hearing on whether transfer to adult court is appropriate.
the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment applies strict scrutiny if the aggrieved party is a member of a protected or suspect class,or otherwise suffers the unequal burdening of a fundamental right.city of cleburne cleburne living center,d.government actions that do not involve suspect classifications will be upheld if they are rationally related to a legitimate state interest.fields palmdale sch,cir.
however,defendants juvenile sex offenders over the age of fourteen do not fall within a protected class.we have previously rejected the argument that sex offenders are a suspect or protected class.united states lemay,cir.further,age is not a suspect classification under the equal protection clause.gregory ashcroft,d citing city of cleburne,at we have declined,however,to extend heightened review to differential treatment based on age.
this conclusion is consistent with that of the sixth circuit,which heard an equal protection challenge to a similar juvenile registration requirement in doe michigan department of state police,cir.there,the defendants challenged a michigan sex offender registration program,in part,because it requir ed youthful trainees charged with sex offenses to register while not requiring youthful trainees charged with other offenses to do so.id.at.the sixth circuit,noting that the set of suspect classifications recognized by the supreme court was limited,held that the classification raised by the plaintiffs does not implicate a suspect class and that review is accordingly appropriate.id.at.
because defendants in this case have failed to establish membership in a recognized protected class,sorna is subject to rational basis review for the purpose of equal protection analysis.sorna language and legislative history clearly indicate the legislative purpose for which it was enacted.see in enacting sorna,congress establishes a comprehensive national system that is designed to protect the public from sex offenders and offenders against children applicability of the sex offender registration and notification act,noting that sorna was designed for the protection of the public.we have held that protecting our communities is a legitimate legislative purpose.see doe tandeske,cir holding,with regard to alaska sex offender registration laws,that the statute provisions serve a legitimate purpose of public safety,which is advanced by alerting the public to the risk of sex offenders in their community internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has also held that there is no doubt that preventing danger to the community is a legitimate regulatory goal.united states salerno,d.thus,sorna requirements satisfy rational basis review and do not violate the equal protection clause.
cruel and unusual punishment 
defendants argue that by sanctioning a class of juvenile offenders with registration requirements,sorna violates the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.
the eighth amendment mandates that e xcessive bail shall not be required,nor excessive fines imposed,nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.the amendment prohibits not only barbaric punishments,but also sentences that are disproportionate to the crime committed.solem helm,d holding that defendant eighth amendment right was violated where defendant received the penultimate sentence for a minor,check writing offense.
the bar for cruel and unusual punishment is high.see,united states nagel,cir citing ewing california,d affirming sentence of years to life imposed for felony grand theft of three golf clubs under three strikes law harmelin michigan,d affirming life in prison without the possibility of parole for offender possessing grams of cocaine hutto davis,d no constitutional error in two consecutive terms of years in prison for possession with intent to distribute and distribution of ounces of marijuana.
although defendants understandably note that sorna may have the effect of exposing juvenile defendants and their families to potential shame and humiliation for acts committed while still an adoles
