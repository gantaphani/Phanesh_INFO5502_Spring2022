the nation operates gaming activities at four gaming facilities in seminole county,oklahoma.in an effort to increase revenues from these facilities,the nation added amusement games,which it characterizes as games of skill.the nation offered for play one particular amusement game known as red hot.
on may,the nigc chairman concluded that the red hot machines were impermissible class iii gaming devices and issued a temporary closure order may order directing the nation to cease operating these machines.the nation filed an appeal of the may order with the nigc.
after receiving the may order,the nation offered for play several new amusement machines,in addition to red hot,under the following names buffalo nickels,rainbow reels,fantasy fives,pot o gold,and lucky cherries.on september,the nigc chairman determined that these new games were also class iii games.accordingly,the nigc chairman issued a second temporary closure order september order ordering the nation to cease all gaming activities in all of its gaming facilities.
on january,the government filed a complaint in federal district court for enforcement of the may and september closure orders the government moved for a preliminary injunction.the district court notified the parties by order that the hearing on the government motion would be combined with a trial on the merits of the government suit.on february,the district court denied the motion and dismissed the suit reasoning that the nigc chairman exceeded his authority in ordering the closure of all the nation gaming facilities.the government appeals the district court dismissal of the suit.
on february,a hearing was held before a presiding official po appointed by the united states department of the interior office of hearings and appeals on the nation appeals from the may and september orders.on april,the po issued a recommended decision in which he concluded that the nigc met its burden of proof with regard to the may order but failed to meet its burden of proof with regard to the september order.the po recommended that the may order be sustained and the september order be vacated.

on august,the nation filed suit in federal district court seeking review of the nigc permanent closure order.this case is still pending before the district court.
iii.discussion 
the nation has moved for dismissal under rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure,arguing that the government appeal is moot because the nigc chairman temporary closure orders were superseded by the nigc permanent closure order.
pursuant to article iii of the constitution,federal courts may adjudicate only actual controversies.lewis cont l bank,d fischbach activities ass,cir.the controversy must exist during all stages of the appellate review.fischbach,at.once such controversy ceases to exist,the action is moot and this court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter.id.an exception to the mootness doctrine,however,arises when the case is capable of repetition,yet evading review.gannett depasquale,d quotation omitted fischbach,at.this exception applies when the duration of the challenged action is too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subjected to the same action again.gannett,at.
the nigc chairman temporary closure orders have been superseded by the issuance of a permanent closure order by the nigc.thus,the temporary closure orders are no longer in effect.this case,however,fits the narrow exception to the mootness doctrine for conduct capable of repetition,yet evading review.the nigc chairman temporary closure orders are too short in duration to be fully litigated in court prior to their administrative expiration or replacement by permanent orders.temporary closure orders,by their very nature,are short in duration.igra requires the nigc to quickly review temporary closure orders and either dissolve them or issue permanent closure orders.b providing an indian tribe with the right to a hearing before the commission to review a temporary closure order within thirty days of its issuance and requiring the commission to decide whether to dissolve the order or issue a permanent closure order within sixty days of the hearing.the nation argues,however,the nigc chairman temporary orders are not so short in duration as to require this court to exercise jurisdiction over this appeal.rather,the nation argues,the government failure to seek an expedited appeal and its multiple requests for additional time to file appellate briefs delayed appellate review until after the issuance of the permanent order.the course of proceedings in this appeal,however,are irrelevant.the nigc statutory obligation to quickly conduct a hearing within thirty days of the issuance of a temporary order and decide whether to dissolve or make permanent the order within sixty days of the hearing,creates a paradigm in which a temporary order will not remain in effect throughout the appellate process.accordingly,the nigc chairman temporary closure orders are of a sufficiently limited duration to ordinarily escape appellate review.
the nation also argues that the issues in this appeal are not of a limited duration because they will be litigated in the case involving the permanent closure order.the issue in this appeal is whether the nigc chairman statutory authority to issue temporary closure orders extends to the closure of a tribe entire gaming operation.the nigc chairman statutory authority,however,is not at issue in an appe
