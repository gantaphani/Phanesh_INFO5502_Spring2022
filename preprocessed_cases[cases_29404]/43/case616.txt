this is an appeal by mother from certain findings and orders made by the juvenile court subsequent to hearings held pursuant to welfare and institutions code section and for reasons to be explained,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on october,a section petition was filed by respondent sonoma county human services department department,alleging that mother placed her infant daughter minor,at substantial risk of suffering serious physical harm or neglect as a result of her inability to provide care or protection due to a history of substance abuse,lack of cooperation with hospital staff,and her previous failure to reunify with minor siblings,subds.b,g,j.the section petition was thrice amended,adding allegations under subdivisions a and f that two of minor siblings were injured while in mother care,and one of these sibling injuries led to her death,which mother could not adequately explain.
on november,the juvenile court sustained the allegations in the second amended section petition and,on march,declared minor a dependent of the court 
on october,the juvenile court found the indian child welfare act applied based upon proof that mother is a member of the manchester point arena band of pomo indians tribe.the tribe advised the juvenile court that,although minor is considered an adoptable child,it would only support legal guardianship as a permanent plan in order to protect her best interest in a continued tribal relationship 
on march,the juvenile court issued a dispositional order that,among other things,bypassed reunification services for mother pursuant to section,subdivisions b,b,and b.specifically,the juvenile court found clear and convincing evidence that mother caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect,that minor had suffered severe physical abuse by parents,that reunification services for mother with respect to minor had been terminated and that mother had not subsequently made a reasonable effort to treat the problems leading to the removal the juvenile court also noted that mother was not amenable to services and had not been successful at rehabilitating herself despite extensive efforts on her behalf by the department and the tribe.
the juvenile court decision to bypass services was consistent with the department recommendation in the disposition report,which noted,among other things,that,while mother entered a residential treatment program on december,she left the program on january,and,as of the end of february,had failed to enter a different program despite telling the department she would do so.
minor was thereafter placed in the home of prospective guardians and,on september,the juvenile court ordered guardianship as the permanent plan and dismissed the dependency proceedings.among other exit orders,the juvenile court ordered visitation between mother and minor to occur at least once a month.
unfortunately,the legal guardianship terminated on november,after minor guardians gave notice they were no longer willing to provide for her care.accordingly,the juvenile court vacated its earlier order of dismissal and reinstated the dependency.
at a december,hearing on the department request to change a court order,the department informed the juvenile court that a new placement agreeable to the tribe had been found,and that it anticipated presenting new letters of guardianship to the court at the next hearing.the juvenile court then advised the parties to return for a permanency planning review hearing on february,prompting mother attorney to state for the record that she was entitled to be considered for reunification services before new letters of guardianship could be presented given the termination of minor original guardianship.
the february,permanency planning review hearing was ultimately continued until may,based upon the department request to allow more time for minor to become attached to her new placement.in the meantime,the juvenile court ordered that mother monthly visits with minor would resume in april 
in anticipation of the may hearing,the department filed a status review report noting,among other things,it appears that mother is at odds with her tribe.she has been informed numerous times by the tribe,and the department concurs,that she would need to complete the attached treatment goal plan in order for any consideration of reunification for any of her children to be considered.she has not participated in any planning for reunification,much less participated in any of the plan.in addition,the report noted that mother has been somewhat threatening to the current foster family,with threats made in the previous reporting period,and to the undersigned knowledge,she continues to be unsupportive of this placement.it is sad to see mother staying stuck in her anger,and how this negatively impacts her involvement with her children and with her tribe.
at the may,hearing,the juvenile court admitted the department report into evidence,acknowledged its recommendation that a new guardianship be established,and scheduled a settlement conference for june.
a contested hearing was then held on july,for which the parties submitted briefing on the issue of whether reunification services for mother should be considered,given that services for her had been bypassed.following this hearing,the juvenile court denied mother request to reconsider the issue of reunification services,affirmed guardianship as the permanent plan and appointed successor guardians.the juvenile court also ordered supervised visitation for mother twice annually in june and december for two hours.the juvenile court then again dismissed the dependency proceedings.
on july,mother filed a timely notice of appeal of the juvenile court july findings and orders.
discussion 
mother raises two issues for our review.first,mother contends the juvenile court reversibly erred by refusing to revisit the issue of whether she should receive reunification services after minor previously ordered legal guardianship was terminated and the dependency proceedings were reinstated for the purpose of establishing a new guardianship.second,mother contends the juvenile court erred by limiting her visitation with minor to twice a year without first determining whether more frequent visitation would be detrimental to minor.we address each issue in turn below.
i.did the juvenile court err by declining to revisit the reunification services issue when appointing new guardians 
as set forth above,this dependency was dismissed after a legal guardianship was established as minor permanent plan.however,on december,the juvenile court vacated the dismissal and reinstated the proceedings after minor guardians requested that the guardianship be terminated.at that time,mother counsel advised the juvenile court that,because the guardianship was being terminated,mother was entitled to be considered for reunification services pursuant to section.
several months later,after ordering briefing and hearing argument on the issue,the juvenile court declined mother request to consider reunification services for her.the juvenile court reasoned that a contested hearing on reunification services was not required because minor permanent plan of legal guardianship remained unchanged by the termination of the original guardianship 
when the guardianship was selected as the permanent plan back on september,this court retained jurisdiction over the guardianship and would have had jurisdiction over the guardianship until the child reached the age of majority,was emancipated or died.
when the court received notification as to the current position of the guardians,the court would have,if a successor guardian was available,the court could have without resuming jurisdiction appointed successor guardians because the court continued to have jurisdiction over the guardianship dealing with issues of visitation and the like.
so each time there a request made in a dependency guardianship case,it does mean the court reinstates the dependency proceedings and it resets the clock each time so the court is allowed to manage the guardianship without triggering the reinstatement of dependency proceedings.
in this particular case,there were no successor guardians readily available.so the court had to resume jurisdiction because there were no successor guardians.the permanent plan has been and continues to be guardianship.that has never changed.successor guardians have now been located,appear to be appropriate from all accounts no one has said they not and the court is once again affirming that guardianship is the permanent plan and does appoint the successor guardians and adopting the orders and findings as it relevant to the court ruling.
according to mother,the juvenile court refusal to hold a contested hearing on whether to order reunification services pursuant to section was erroneous and prejudicial.in making this argument,mother relies on both subdivision b and subdivision f of section.the following law applies.
when a permanent plan of legal guardianship is ordered for a minor,the juvenile court may,once the guardianship is established,dismiss the dependency proceedings and retain jurisdiction over the minor as a ward of the guardianship,subd.a,see also cal.rules of court,rule a in re th.section governs the termination of a guardianship.relevant here,subdivision b provides if the court has dismissed dependency jurisdiction following the establishment of a legal guardianship and the legal guardianship is subsequently revoked or otherwise terminated,the county department of social services or welfare department shall notify the juvenile court of this fact.the court may vacate its previous order dismissing dependency jurisdiction over the child.unless the parental rights of the child parent or parents have been terminated,they shall be notified that the legal guardianship has been revoked or terminated and shall be entitled to participate in the new permanency planning hearing.the court shall try to place the child in another permanent placement.at the hearing,the parents may be considered as custodians but the child shall not be returned to the parent or parents unless they prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that reunification is the best alternative for the child.the court may,if it is in the best interests of the child,order that reunification services again be provided to the parent or parents,subd.b.
section,subdivision f,also relied upon by mother,applies where,unlike here,a child is in a placement other than the home of a legal guardian and jurisdiction has not been dismissed.specifically,in such cases,section requires a status review hearing to be held at least every six months,subd.d.during this hearing,i f the reviewing body determines that a second period of reunification services is in the child best interests,and that there is a significant likelihood of the child return to a safe home due to changed circumstances of the parent,pursuant to subdivision f,the specific reunification services required to effect the child return to a safe home shall be described,subd.e.subdivision f,in turn,provides unless their parental rights have been permanently terminated,the parent or parents of the child are entitled to receive notice of,and participate in,those hearings.it shall be presumed that continued care is in the best interests of the child,unless the parent or parents prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that further efforts at reunification are the best alternative for the child.in those cases,the court may order that further reunification services to return the child to a safe home environment be provided to the parent or parents up to a period of six months,and family maintenance services,as needed for an additional six months in order to return the child to a safe home environment,subd.f.
according to mother,section,subdivisions b and f,by their express terms,required the juvenile court in this case to consider anew whether to grant her reunification services before appointing new guardians for minor.her argument,of course,hinges on the principles of statutory construction.specifically,i n determining the proper scope of section,our primary task is to determine legislative intent.in order to do so,we must begin with the wording of the statute itself.citation.where the language of the statute is clear,there is no need to resort to other indicia of legislative intent no need for construction then exists.citations.in re kelly th.we simply give the statute words a plain and commonsense meaning.citation.in doing so,however,we do not consider the statutory language in isolation.citations.rather,we construe the words of the statute in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute citation.west pico furniture pacific finance loans cal d.in other words,we must harmonize the various parts of a statutory enactment by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole people mendoza,supra,cal th at,so that all of the statutes in the scheme will have effect.travelers indemnity gillespie cal d.and w e must also avoid a construction that would produce absurd consequences,which we presume the legislature did not intend.people mendoza,supra,cal th at accord,flannery prentice cal th,d.in re charles th.further,we keep in mind that every word,phrase and provision employed in a statute is intended to have meaning and to perform a useful function.in re kelly,supra,th at.as such,we must avoid a construction that would render any word,phrase or provision superfluous.ibid.
as noted above,in this case,in denying mother request for a contested hearing on reunification services,the juvenile court relied on the fact that the permanent plan of guardianship was undisturbed by termination of minor original guardianship.according to the juvenile court,the only outstanding issues with respect to permanency planning in this case were locating a suitable successor guardian and issuing new letters of guardianship,rendering consideration of reunification services unnecessary.however,as mother points out,the juvenile court reasoning in this regard has already been rejected by at least one appellate court.
specifically,in in re th,the juvenile court granted a section petition filed by the child aunt requesting to be appointed guardian after the child original guardian died.in doing so,the juvenile court summarily denied the child father section petition challenging the aunt appointment as guardian and requesting that he be considered for the role and for reunification services.id.at.in summarily denying the father petition,the juvenile court in found it unnecessary to consider the father for the role of guardian and for receipt of reunification services because his petition failed to establish that it would be in the child best interests to change her placement.id.at.
rejecting the juvenile court decision and reasoning,the appellate court clarified that section is implicated not only by petitions to terminate a guardianship,but by petitions to modify a prior guardianship order by,among other things,appointment of a successor guardian.section s express provisions embody the legislature policy determination that,when a change in a guardianship is made,the dependency court must provide notice to parents,consider and evaluate possible custody solutions,and consider whether to provide reunification services.see also cal.rules of court,rule c no distinction between petitions to terminate or to modify a guardianship.in re,supra,th at.accord in re jessica th,section recognizes that there may be a need to terminate a guardianship established as the permanent plan for a dependent child.to this end,it sets forth a procedure for notice,evaluation of the problems and possible solutions,and a mechanism by which reunification services to the parent s might be reinitiated if the guardianship is terminated.thus,the court concluded that the juvenile court committed reversible error by denying the father his statutory rights under section to participate in the hearing to terminate or modify his child guardianship and to be considered for,among other things,reunification services.in re,supra,th at.
we agree with the court interpretation of section,including the court conclusion that the statute applies to any change in guardianship,whether there is a petition to terminate a guardianship or to modify a prior guardianship order by appointing a successor guardian.in re,supra,th at.accordingly,we reject the suggestion by the juvenile court in our case that mother request pursuant to section to consider reunification services was inappropriate because,even though there was a change in guardianship,the permanent plan remained the same.
the department makes an additional statutory interpretation argument with respect to section in seeking affirmance of the trial court ruling.specifically,the department argues that the legislature use of the phrase further reunification services in section,subdivision f,demonstrates the intent that,when a guardianship is being terminated,the juvenile court need not consider reunification services for a parent,like mother,initially bypassed for services pursuant to section,subdivision b.similar to section,subdivision f,california rules of court rule c rule c authorizes the juvenile court to consider further efforts at reunification if the parent proves by a preponderance of the evidence that such efforts would be in the child best interest,and section,subdivision b,provides that reunification services may again be provided to the parent if the juvenile court finds it would be in the child best interests.
contrary to the department argument,however,we decline to interpret the terms further and again in section and rule c in such a manner as to impose a restriction on the class of parents entitled to be considered for reunification services during proceedings to terminate or modify a legal guardianship.in reaching this conclusion,we first look to the ordinary dictionary definition of these terms in re kelly,supra,th at,which,in this case,is not particularly enlightening.for example,again is defined as another time,once more,anew,or in addition.merriam webster collegiate,ed.further,in turn,is defined as in addition or to a greater degree or extent.id.at.
as these definitions reflect,the meaning of again and further for purposes of section,subdivisions b and f,respectively,are quite ambiguous.on the one hand,the terms could simply mean that,under section,the juvenile court should consider the broader issue of whether to grant or deny reunification services anew,more thoroughly,or in addition to other issues.on the other hand,the terms could mean,as the department suggests,that the juvenile court should consider the more narrow issue of whether to grant reunification services once more or an additional time to a parent who already received such services.either of these interpretations,we conclude,would be reasonable.
further,looking more closely at these terms in context,keeping in mind the nature and purpose of section in re kelly,supra,th at,we note that neither subdivision b nor subdivision f expressly authorizes the juvenile court to provide reunification services to parents previously bypassed for such services,but neither does the identified statutory language expressly restrict the juvenile court from doing so.moreover,section is quite clear that the juvenile court must provide all parents whose parental rights remain intact both notice that the legal guardianship has been revoked or terminated and the opportunity to participate in the new permanency planning hearing,subd.b.section is equally clear that the juvenile court may consider the parents as custodians,however the child shall not be returned to the parent or parents unless they prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that reunification is the best alternative for the child,subd.b.see also in re th,under section,subd.b,if the parental rights have not been terminated,a parent must receive notice of the hearings and may present evidence that reunification services are in the child best interests.and,while the circumstances under which the child may be returned to the parent are indeed restricted,nowhere in the statute does the legislature restrict the nature or scope of the parent participation in these proceedings.had the legislature intended to limit the parent statutory right of participation to matters other than presenting evidence that reunification services should be offered to facilitate the possible return home of the child an odd,if not absurd result,we believe the legislature would have employed clearer language.see people mendoza,supra,cal th at courts must avoid a construction that would produce absurd consequences,which we presume the legislature did not intend.
as a final note on this issue,we add that interpreting section so as not to unnecessarily restrict the parent statutory right to participate in the new permanency planning hearing is,we conclude,more consistent with dependency law express goal of protecting the minor best interests because it leaves to the juvenile court in the first instance the determination of whether reunification services should be ordered.the juvenile court,not this court,is far better suited to this task,given its superior proximity to the parties and their constantly changing needs.
accordingly,for the reasons stated,we reject the department proposed statutory interpretation of section as an alternative basis for affirming the juvenile court denial of mother request to be considered for reunification services before the appointment of successor guardians for minor.
however,ultimately,our inquiry with respect to mother challenge does not end with our legislative interpretation of section.while we have already concluded the juvenile court erred by reading section in such a way as to preclude mother from reopening the issue of reunification services,this court recently confirmed t he standard of review where a parent is deprived of a due process right is whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.citation.in re thomas th.superior court th.as such,the juvenile court order must stand so long as we can conclude that mother suffered no prejudice either because it would have been an abuse of discretion to rule in her favor citation or because it is not reasonably probable that she would have obtained a more favorable result had the court exercised its discretion.superior court th,see also superior court,supra,th at.
having reviewed the record in this case,we would indeed conclude mother suffered no prejudice from the juvenile court refusal to consider granting her reunification services,as there is simply no evidentiary basis for doing so.in particular,while the department opposed mother request for consideration of reunification services after the dependency proceedings were reinstated and the original guardianship was terminated,it nonetheless addressed the reunification issue in a report dated may,in anticipation of the planning review hearing.in this report,the department advised the court that mother has been informed numerous times by the tribe,and the department concurs,that she would need to complete the attached treatment goal plan in order for any consideration of reunification for any of her children to be considered.she has not participated in any planning for reunification,much less participated in any of the plan.the report also noted that mother remained consumed by anger,had made threats to minor foster family,and had generally been unsupportive of minor placement despite the negative impacts her conduct had on her relationship with both minor and the tribe.this evidence of mother poor conduct in the period,which mother does not appear to have addressed,is in addition to the clear and convincing evidence underlying the juvenile court initial decision to bypass services for her,including her role in the death of another child through abuse or neglect and in the severe physical abuse of minor,her failure to make a reasonable effort to treat the problems that had led to the removal of minor,and her failure to rehabilitate despite extensive efforts on her behalf by the department and the tribe.under these circumstances,there is no reasonable probability that mother would have obtained a more favorable result had the juvenile court reopened the reunification services issue before appointing the su
