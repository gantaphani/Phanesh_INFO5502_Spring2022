emery garret tindall pleaded guilty to assault resulting in serious bodily injury in violation of a and.the district court enhanced tindall sentence after concluding the injuries could have resulted in the loss of the victim life.on appeal,he argues the district court improperly relied on the presentence report psr in making fact findings about the seriousness of the victim injuries.as a result,tindall claims the district court lacked sufficient evidence to support a enhancement and then applied the enhancement inconsistently from other courts in our circuit.
finding no error in the district court sentence,we affirm.
background 
following tindall plea of guilty to assault resulting in serious bodily injury,the government prepared a psr,which related the following 
beginning in late afternoon on july,tindall and his mother were drinking with friends,including james whiteantelope,and a few others.around midnight,the group drove to whiteantelope parents home on an indian reservation in wyoming to drop off whiteantelope.arriving at his parents home,whiteantelope got out of the car and grabbed tindall mother by her arm.tindall uttered an expletive and asked what whiteantelope was doing,to which whiteantelope responded with a profanity.tindall then got out of the car,swung at whiteantelope head with his fist,missed,and started chasing him to the house.having caught up to whiteantelope,tindall hit him in the back of the head.whiteantelope fell face first onto the steps leading up to his parents house,and tindall jumped on top,hitting whiteantelope at least three more times in the head.tindall then got back into the car,and the group drove off.
noticing whiteantelope heavy bleeding,his family took him to the emergency room.the treating doctor stated the arterial laceration to the back of whiteantelope head posed a substantial risk of death at the time of the injury because of the amount of blood loss,vol.at,which the doctor quantified as half his blood,id.at.although immediate medical attention mitigated the danger to whiteantelope,the doctor did state,if unchecked,whiteantelope would have bled to death.id.at.
the psr calculated a base offense level of and a enhancement for causing injury.after a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,the psr arrived at a total offense level of.tindall,with no prior convictions,had a criminal history score of zero.a criminal history score of zero category i and a total offense level of yielded an imprisonment range of months under the united states sentencing guidelines ussg.under the applicable statute,a,the maximum term of imprisonment for tindall offense is years.
tindall objected to a enhancement,arguing a enhancement for causing serious bodily injury would be more appropriate because tindall did not plead to conduct involving a injury,and tindall did not use a weapon and did not intend to cause a injury.the government,while agreeing with the psr recommended enhancement,stated it would not object to a lesser enhancement of five levels.
the district court,relying on the doctor assessment of the injury,overruled tindall objection and sentenced him to months incarceration,in the middle of the advisory guidelines range.
ii.discussion 
tindall raises three arguments that,in his view,require a remand to the district court for resentencing the district court failed to comply with federal rule of criminal procedure in adopting the psr injury recommendation,the psr did not contain sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that whiteantelope had suffered a injury,and the district courts in our circuit are inconsistent in their applications of the injury enhancement.tindall argues these three errors led to the district court application of the enhancement.
we disagree with each argument.
interplay between a and the guidelines 
before turning to tindall arguments on appeal,it is useful to review the relevant provisions of the statute under which tindall pleaded guilty as well as applicable guidelines sections.we do this because the main thrust of tindall arguments betrays a misunderstanding of the district court task at sentencing.
tindall arguments rely heavily on the statutory language of the offense of conviction.but the district court looks not only to the offense of conviction at sentencing.rather,it also looks to the guidelines to determine the appropriate advisory sentencing range.as the government correctly pointed out during sentencing,tindall confusion comes from the use of the term serious bodily injury in both the statute under which tindall pled guilty as well as the use of the term in the sentencing guidelines,vol.at.
statutory language.under a tindall pleaded to a charge of a ssault resulting in serious bodily injury.to define the term serious bodily injury,b,which defines this term as bodily injury involving a a substantial risk of death b extreme physical pain c protracted and obvious disfigurement or d protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty.id.h.focusing on subsections a and b,either a substantial risk of death or extreme physical pain suffices to establish a violation of a.
tindall pleaded guilty to assaulting whiteantelope and causing him serious bodily injury,as the term is used in the statute.the plea agreement did not specify whether tindall assault resulted in a substantial risk of death or extreme physical pain.but under the plea agreement,tindall ha d been advised of of the sentencing guidelines regarding use of relevant conduct in establishing his sentence,vol,doc.at.we thus look to the guidelines to determine how tindall conduct affects his sentence.
sentencing guidelines.assault under a triggers the application of ussg,which establishes a base offense level of and allows various enhancements.two possible enhancements are relevant to this appeal.a enhancement applies if the victim sustained serious bodily injury.id.b b.but if the victim suffered permanent or bodily injury,a enhancement applies.id.b c.
under the guidelines,serious bodily injury means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty or requiring medical intervention such as surgery,hospitalization,or physical rehabilitation.id.cmt.l emphasis added.permanent or bodily injury means injury involving a substantial risk of death loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty that is likely to be permanent or an obvious disfigurement that is likely to be permanent.id.at j emphasis added.
under the guidelines,then,tindall resulting in serious bodily for different sentencing calculations depending on the type of harm whiteantelope suffered.in other words,although a lumps both a substantial risk of death and extreme physical pain into the serious bodily injury category,the guidelines call for different enhancements based on the nature of the injury.that tindall pleaded to serious bodily injury under the statute does not mean he should automatically receive only a enhancement under the guidelines.both a five and a enhancement are consistent with a plea to assault resulting in serious bodily injury under a,depending on the nature of the victim injuries.
arguments on appeal 
with this understanding of the guidelines in mind,we turn to tindall three arguments for remand.
necessity of rule findings 
tindall first argument challenges the district court compliance with rule requirements.see.rule i a allows the sentencing court to accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact.but the court any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing,or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.id.i b.we review de novo the district court compliance with the federal rules of criminal procedure.united states,cir citing united states kravchuk,cir.
we recently stated unequivocally that to invoke the district court rule obligation,the defendant is required to make specific allegations of factual inacc
