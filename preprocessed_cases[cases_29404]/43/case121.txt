is a member of the omaha tribe of nebraska.in august,left her tribe in nebraska and moved to the sac and fox tribe of the mississippi in the meskwaki settlement in tama county,iowa.there,she began living with papakee and blackcloud in papakee house.every day,the three drank heavily,to the point of intoxication.
according to the prosecution evidence,in early september,on a day the three had spent drinking beer and vodka,papakee and blackcloud sexually abused inside papakee house.testified that papakee and blackcloud held her down on a bed and forced a cucumber into her vagina.following the incident,left papakee house and began staying at the home of one of papakee relatives.the assault was reported to the tama county sheriff office later that week.
a grand jury returned an indictment against papakee and blackcloud based on this incident.count of the superseding indictment charged each defendant with knowingly causing,and attempting to cause,another person to engage in a sexual act by using force against that person,in violation of,and a.count charged each defendant with knowingly engaging in,and attempting to engage in,a sexual act with another person who was incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct and physically incapable of declining participation in,and communicating unwillingness to engage in,that sexual act,in violation of,and.following a jury trial,papakee and blackcloud were convicted of sexual abuse as charged in count,but acquitted of aggravated sexual abuse as charged in count.
at sentencing,the district court determined that blackcloud base offense level was under ussg a.it then applied a specific offense characteristic for aggravated sexual abuse under b,even though the jury had acquitted blackcloud on count.based on an offense level of and a criminal history category iv,the court sentenced blackcloud to months imprisonment,the top of the advisory guideline range.
as to papakee,the district court also started with a base offense level of and applied a specific offense characteristic for aggravated sexual abuse.the court then determined that papakee was a career offender under.application of the guideline raised papakee offense level from to and his criminal history category from iv to vi.after concluding that papakee advisory guideline range was months to life imprisonment,the court sentenced him to months.the court stated,moreover,that it would have imposed the same sentence even if papakee was not a career offender.without the enhancement,papakee advisory guideline range was to months imprisonment,but the court stated that it would have imposed a sentence of months based on a.
papakee contends that the district court abused its discretion at trial by excluding evidence designed to attack credibility.papakee sought to introduce testimony from wesley sebetka,a deputy in the tama county sheriff office,that while he was interviewing about the sexual abuse,told him that he was cute and asked him if he wanted to crawl into bed with her.the district court ruled that the proffered testimony was inadmissible under federal rule of evidence and,alternatively,under rule.
rule provides that,in any civil or criminal proceeding involving alleged sexual misconduct,evidence offered to prove that any alleged victim engaged in other sexual behavior,or to prove any alleged victim sexual predisposition,is not admissible,unless certain enumerated exceptions apply.according to papakee,rule does not bar evidence of statements to sebetka,because her statement that the deputy was cute and her proposal that he crawl into bed with her do not qualify as sexual behavior or evidence of her sexual predisposition.
we conclude that the district court properly excluded the disputed testimony under rule.the testimony tended to show that propositioned sebetka for sex within a short time after the alleged assault by papakee and blackcloud.we agree with the district court that a sexual proposition is other sexual behavior within the meaning of rule a.the ordinary meaning of behavior extends to the manner in which a person conducts herself,webster third new international dictionary,and when a person undertakes conduct aimed at engaging in sexual activity,that conduct is naturally understood to be sexual behavior.there is no reason to believe that the rule is limited to sexual intercourse or sexual contact.to the contrary,the advisory committee notes explain that the word behavior should be construed to include activities of the mind,such as fantasies or dreams.advisory committee notes see also wilson city of des moines,cir concluding that female employee statements about vibrators and male sex organs constituted sexual comments and behavior that was governed by rule.if a person unexpressed desire to engage in sexual activity is inadmissible,then surely her expression of that desire to another person also comes within the scope of the rule.
papakee maintains that even if statements qualify as sexual behavior,then the disputed testimony should have been admitted under rule exception for evidence the exclusion of which would violate the constitutional rights of the defendant.b c.according to papakee,the court exclusion of the testimony violated his rights under the confrontation clause.we disagree.a restriction on an accused right to introduce evidence may not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purpose that the restriction is designed to serve,michigan lucas,d,but that principle was not violated here.rule serves important purposes of preventing harassment or embarrassment of sexual abuse victims,and the proffered evidence was of little or no probative value.see united states bordeaux,cir.papakee contends that met with sebetka shortly after leaving papakee residence,and that her intoxicated state was relevant to her ability to perceive and recall the events of that evening.but the district court did permit testimony that was intoxicated when she met with sebetka.tr.ii,at.the court excluded only evidence of the sexual proposition,which had little,if any,relevance to the question whether was sexually abused by papakee and blackcloud.there was no error.
papakee and blackcloud both challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions.each defendant was convicted of sexual abuse as charged in count,in violation of,and.sections,and make it unlawful for an indian in indian country knowingly to engage,or attempt to engage,in a sexual act with another person who is incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct,or physically incapable of declining participation in,or communicating unwillingness to engage in,that sexual act.the term sexual act refers,among other things,to the penetration,however slight,of the genital opening of another by any object,with an intent to abuse,humiliate,harass,degrade,or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.id.c.section makes it unlawful for any person to aid or abet the commission of a federal offense,including the offense of sexual abuse.
the jury was properly instructed that it could convict each defendant on count under any one of four theories that the defendant engaged in sexual abuse that the defendant attempted to engage in sexual abuse that the defendant aided and abetted the commission of sexual abuse or that the defendant aided and abetted the commission of attempted sexual abuse.because the jury returned a general verdict of guilty in the case of each defendant,we do not know which theory or theories the jury found that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt.we will therefore uphold the jury verdicts if the evidence is sufficient to support the defendants convictions under any one of the alternative theories.turner united states,d.the evidence is sufficient if,after vie
