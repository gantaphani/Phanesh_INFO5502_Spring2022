article i of the constitution authorizes congress to regulate commerce with indians.as an original matter,the power to recognize an indian tribe might be thought quintessentially and exclusively presidential,western shoshone business council babbitt,cir,like the power to recognize or not recognize a foreign nation,banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d political recognition is exclusively a function of the executive clark allen.mingtai fire marine ins.united parcel service,cir,even though article i also gives congress the power to regulate foreign commerce.but indian tribes are not are what chief justice marshall called domestic dependent nations,cherokee nation georgia,pet.and the general view nowadays,which none of the parties to this suit has questioned though of course a concession on a jurisdictional issue does not bind us,is that congress has the power,both directly and by delegation to the president,to establish the criteria for recognizing a tribe.see,cherokee nation of oklahoma babbitt,fletcher united states,cir western shoshone business council babbitt,supra,at.this makes practical sense.congress has passed a number of statutes granting various benefits and immunities to indian tribes,provided they are recognized by the federal government,indian and education assistance act of,b indian financing act of,c see greene babbitt,cir.naturally and legitimately,congress is concerned which groups of indians are given the status of tribes.but the analogy to recognition of foreign governments has prevailed to the extent that congress has delegated to the executive branch the power of recognition of indian tribes without setting forth any criteria to guide the exercise of that power.see.
in,the department of the interior promulgated a regulation that sets forth such criteria.a group of indians that is seeking recognition as a tribe entitled to federal largesse the regulation calls recognition acknowledgment and the terminology may be significant,as we see later has to satisfy seven criteria a the group has been identified from historical times to the present,on a substantially continuous basis,as indian b a substantial portion of the group inhabits a specific area or lives in a community viewed as american indian and distinct from other populations in the area,and its members are descendants of an indian tribe which historically inhabited a specific area c the group has maintained tribal political influence or other authority over its members as an autonomous entity throughout history until the present d the group has a governing document e the group has lists of members demonstrating their descent from a tribe that existed historically f most of the members are not members of any other indian tribe g the group status as a tribe is not precluded by congressional legislation.in,the miami nation of indians of indiana petitioned interior for recognition that it was an indian tribe.obviously the fact that it calls itself a nation is not dispositive.twelve years later,interior ruled that the miami had not satisfied criteria b and c the ones we quoted rather than paraphrased of the regulation and therefore would not be recognized.the miami nation sought judicial review in the district court and appeals to us from that court decision upholding interior ruling.d.earlier decisions by the district court in this protracted litigation are cited in the opinion.
in the president of the united states had made a treaty ratified by the senate with the miami indians,stat,a tribe described in the treaty as consisting of both indiana miamis and western miamis.although the matter is not free from doubt,we shall assume that the miami nation,though limited to indiana miamis,is the tribe referred to in the treaty and it is obvious from the treaty that the president recognized the tribe as being,indeed,an indian tribe.it is equally obvious that indian nations,like foreign nations,can disappear over go the way of sumeria,phoenicia,burgundy,the ottoman empire,prussia,the republic of texas,and the republic of vietnam,whether through conquest,or voluntary absorption into a larger entity,or fission,or dissolution,or movement of population.
in the century and a half since president pierce signed the treaty with the miami indians,and especially since,the miami has dwindled.today there are only about indiana miamis,scattered across the nation,with only resident in a more or less contiguous group of five indiana which,however,the miamis,who live dispersed throughout the area rather than in their own separate communities within it,constitute less than one half of one percent of the counties population.only about percent of this group socialize with one another.on average only percent attend the annual reunion that is the sole organized event of the group.we were told at argument without contradiction that it has been decades since any member of the miami nation sought to avail himself or herself of any of the benefits or immunities that congress has extended to members of recognized indian tribes.
there is a tribal council,but it performs no meaningful governance functions.there is scant contact between the council and the rest of indiana miamis,and the instances in which the council has tackled important issues,such as cemetery relocation,are few and far between.since the council has rarely dealt with the kind of governmental or political issues that agitate tribes,including hunting and fishing rights,disputes between tribal factions,and loss of tribal lands.the council has been more active since,when it bestirred itself to seek federal recognition of the miami nation.it now operates a number of programs concerned with welfare such as programs and economic development,and it has sought and obtained grants to fund these programs.but such programs,charitable rather than administrative in character,are a far cry from governance.
the indiana miamis have thus failed to satisfy the two quoted criteria in the department of the interior regulation.but they argue that the regulation is invalid because not authorized by congress.this is clearly incorrect,see,james hhs,western shoshone business council babbitt,supra,at nor is it clear that it has to be authorized by congress.recognition is,as we have pointed out,traditionally an executive function.when done by treaty it requires the senate consent,but it never requires legislative action,whatever power congress may have to legislate in the area.what is more,and placing in question whether we are even authorized to review the decision not to recognize the miami nation,recognition lies at the heart of the doctrine of political questions.the doctrine identifies a class of questions that either are not amenable to judicial resolution because the relevant considerations are beyond the courts capacity to gather and weigh,see,nixon united states,d laurence tribe,american constitutional law,vol,ed,or have been committed by the constitution to the exclusive,unreviewable discretion of the executive political branches of the federal government.baker carr,d jones united states.tucker united states of commerce,cir made in the usa foundation united states,cir mingtai fire marine insurance united parcel service,supra,at gordon texas,cir barclays bank plc franchise tax,d banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,supra,at.
the second branch of the doctrine,which is based on the extreme sensitivity of the conduct of foreign affairs,judicial ignorance of those affairs,and the long tradition of regarding their conduct as an executive prerogative because it depends on speed,secrecy,freedom from the constraint of the unjudicial mindset that goes by the name not engaged by a dispute over whether to recognize an indian tribe.but the first branch,which focuses on the nature of the questions that the court would have to asks whether the answers would be ones a federal court could give without ceasing to be a court,ones within the cognitive competence,as distinct from the authority,of federal engaged by such a dispute.consider the case usually thought to have invented the doctrine,luther borden,how.rather than adopt a new constitution after the break with england,rhode island continued to use its colonial charter as its constitution.this action or rather inaction was unpopular.restive citizens convened a constitutional convention not authorized by the charter.the convention adopted a new constitution to which the charter government,however,refused to submit,precipitating rebellion and the establishment in of a rival state government.the supreme court refused to decide which of the two competing state governments was the legitimate one.it would have been very difficult to gather and assess,by the methods of litigation,the facts relevant to such a decision,and even more difficult to formulate a legal concept of revolutionary legitimacy to guide the decision.
so if the residents of what was once the kingdom of the two sicilies asked a federal court to recognize it as an independent nation,the court would invoke luther borden and tell them to take up the matter with the state department.clark allen,supra.the question whether the miami nation constitutes a nation with a government with which the united states might establish relations is similar.it comes as no surprise,therefore,that the action of the federal government in recognizing or failing to recognize a tribe has traditionally been held to be a political one not subject to judicial review.william canby,american indian law in a nutshell ed see united states holliday,wall.cherokee nation of oklahoma babbitt,supra,at western shoshone business council babbitt,supra,at felix cohen handbook of federal indian law rennard strickland ed.
but this conclusion assumes that the executive branch has not sought to canalize the discretion of its subordinate officials by means of regulations that require them to base recognition of indian tribes on the kinds of determination,legal or factual,that courts routinely make.by promulgating such regulations the executive brings the tribal recognition process within the scope of the administrative procedure act.morton ruiz,d hein capitan grande band of diegueno mission indians,cir.and the act has been interpreted to require agencies,on pain of being found to have acted arbitrarily and capriciously,to comply with their own regulations whether formal,as here,or doctrines of a common law character until the regulations are altered by proper procedures,webster doe,d service dulles,d head start family education program,cooperative educational service agency,cir cherokee nation of oklahoma babbitt,supra,at florida institute of technology fcc,canby,supra,at,and to make compliance with the regulations judicially reviewable,provided there is law to apply to determine compliance,a webster doe,supra,at.heckler chaney,d sprague king,cir as there is if despite the lack of statutory criteria,the agency regulation establishes criteria that are legal in the sense not just of being obligatory but of being the kind of criteria that courts are capable of applying.ellison connor,cir mcalpine united states,cir.
as we explained in nlrb kemmerer village,cir,with reference to the labor the point is equally applicable to the department of the interior no one questions the validity of the doctrine,the nlrb rule that an organization is exempt from the national labor relations act if it is incapable of engaging in meaningful collective bargaining in this proceeding.the only question is whether the board misapplied the doctrine in the present case.this is a question for us because the board is bound by its own rules until it changes them,continental web press,nlrb,cir,including the rules that it has adopted in order to channel what would otherwise be an essentially unreviewable discretion in the deployment of its limited prosecutorial resources,state bank of india nlrb,cir.see also motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mutual automobile ins,d aramark nlrb,cir en banc.to put it more succinctly,the requirement of reasoned requirement that the apa places on agencies and that sets them apart from that an agency may not deviate from its regulations without a reason,unlike a legislature,which can repeal a statute without giving a reason for its change of heart.see continental web press,nlrb,supra,at.a rational person acts consistently,and therefore changes course only if something has changed.schurz communications,fcc,cir.
two exceptions should be noted.first,as the law to apply provision of the apa makes clear,the fact that a regulation has been promulgated does automatically make compliance with the regulation a justiciable issue.it depends on what the regulation says it may not set forth sufficiently criteria to provide guideposts for a reasoned judicial decision.second,whatever it says,the regulation will not remove a case from the rule of that branch of the doctrine that is based not on the analytical or epistemic limitations of courts but on a lack of judicial authority,that is,the assignment of exclusive decisionmaking responsibility to the nonjudicial branches of the federal government.if in a matter within his exclusive authority the president wants to regularize the exercise of discretion by his subordinates,and to this end promulgates a regulation,the regulation does not empower the courts to jump in and determine compliance with it the area is out of bounds for the courts.but this case,as we have seen,is not ruled by the second branch of the doctrine,and so far as the first branch is concerned mcalpine united states,supra,found that another indian regulation of the department of the interior was a and hence justiciable rule and the existence of such a rule renders inapplicable the only branch of the doctrine that pertains to the recognition of indian tribes.florida united states department of the interior,cir,reached a contrary conclusion from mcalpine,but only because it disagreed that the regulation in question was sufficiently directive to count as law.id.at.it did not disagree with the principle that mcalpine expounded and we accept.
the department of interior regulation on recognition,the terms of which we quoted or paraphrased earlier,breaks the recognition issue down into a series of questions that are legal in the relevant sense,that is,are the sort of questions that courts are equipped to answer.the doctrine is therefore not in play and does not prevent the miami nation from arguing that the department of the interior committed error in the interpretation or application of the regulation,as by arbitrarily failing to recognize the miami nation as a tribe when the anthropologist that the department itself had retained to conduct a study of the question recommended otherwise.there was no error in the department handling of the anthropologist evidence,however.the department had not,by its action in hiring an anthropologist to advise it,delegated to her the authority to determine whether the regulatory criteria for recognition had been met.it could not arbitrarily disregard the anthropologist evidence,and it did not.it reviewed her report and found many errors and unsubstantiated conclusions.and it obtained additional information,after the anthropologist submitted her report,that further undermined the conclusions in it.
the miami nation makes the additional argument,however,that the department used the wrong standard when it refused to recognize the miami nation as a tribe,namely the standard applicable to the recognition of a group of indians that is seeking tribal status for the first time,a group never before recognized as a tribe though it must have been a tribe since historical times in order to be eligible for recognition under the regulation.the miami nation had been recognized back in was not seeking so the applicable standard,it argues,is that applicable to the abandonment of tribal status.actually,recognition had been withdrawn by the department of the interior in,the miami nation argues.we need not decide the issue we can ignore the démarche.
the department ignored the distinction between recognition and abandonment.the regulation under which it proceeded does not mention abandonment no regulation does,so far as we have been able to discover and it might seem,therefore,that we are back in the arena of undomesticated discretion where ei
