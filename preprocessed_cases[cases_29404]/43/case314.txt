appellants appeal from the district court order dismissing their complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.appellants are individuals who unsuccessfully petitioned the table mountain tribal council for admission to the table mountain rancheria,an indian tribe.their complaint sought an order compelling the table mountain rancheria to admit them as members.the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over appellants claims because this case was indistinguishable from those in which tribal immunity precludes federal court jurisdiction over tribal membership disputes.in so holding,the district court rejected appellants attempts to establish subject matter jurisdiction.
appellants contend that this case is distinguishable from those in which tribal immunity precludes jurisdiction.they claim that immunity does not apply because their claims do not involve tribal membership disputes.instead,they purport to assert a collateral attack on the judgment in table mountain rancheria association et james watt,secretary of the interior,no.also,they argue that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction by virtue of its ancillary authority to enforce the watt settlement agreement,and that the tribal appellees immunity is waived because of their participation in watt.in passing,appellants assert that the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.
we have appellate jurisdiction over this timely appeal from the district court final judgment pursuant to,and affirm the judgment of dismissal.the district court properly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order appellees to admit appellants as members of the table mountain rancheria.we do not reach the issue of whether tribal immunity defeats appellants claims.appellants subject matter arguments suffer from a more fundamental flaw appellants have failed to establish that the district court has subject matter jurisdiction over their causes of action even if the table mountain rancheria is not immune from suit.
in or around,the united states purchased a parcel of land in fresno county,california from private individuals,and thereafter held the land in trust for the table mountain band of indians.the land became known as the table mountain rancheria tmr,and was considered an indian reservation and indian country within the meaning of rancheria residents were recognized as indians for purposes of federal law.
on august,congress enacted the california rancheria act,stat.the rancheria act,inter alia,authorized an exchange of title to rancheria assets,and a promise that the bureau of indian affairs bia would continue to provide essential benefits,such as irrigation and educational programs to rancheria residents,if,in return,the tmr voluntarily relinquished its trust status,and the tmr residents forfeited their indian status.
a proposed plan for distribution of rancheria land,drafted pursuant to the rancheria act,divided the rancheria into parcels,most of which were to be conveyed to individual rancheria residents.the remaining parcels were earmarked for the rancheria water system,and were to be conveyed to a legal entity formed solely to receive the remaining parcels.sometime after july,the proposed plan was approved.as a result,the rancheria assets were distributed to the table mountain rancheria association tmra and individual residents.in addition,the rancheria lost its trust status,and its residents lost their indian status.
in,the tmra,several individuals who had forfeited their indian status in return for rancheria assets,along with several dependent members of their families,filed a putative class action,entitled table mountain rancheria association et james watt,secretary of the interior,et,no.watt,in the united states district court for the northern district of california.the watt complaint named clarence jones,lester burrough,barnes,lewis barnes,and william walker as plaintiffs and the secretary of the interior,the secretary of health and human services,and the united states,as defendants.
the named plaintiffs in the watt action sought to certify two classes 
persons named in the distribution plan as distributees of tmr assets,or the ir indian heir s,assign s,executor s,administrator s,or successor s in interest who,by reason of having been named as distributees were considered by the federal government to have lost their status as indians under federal law 
all indian persons,other than distributees,who were named in the tmr distribution plan as dependents of distributees,and who,for that reason,were deemed by the united states to have lost their status as indians under federal law.
on april,the district court certified both classes.
the watt plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to inform the rancheria residents who approved the distribution plan of the obligations of the united states under the rancheria act,the relative advantages and disadvantages of accepting termination,the options available to them under the rancheria act and the legal consequences of exercising those options.the watt complaint further alleged that the watt defendants caus ed plaintiff dependents to be ineligible to receive federal services provided exclusively to indians,and to enjoy other federal rights available to indians,including such rights as having land held in trust for them.emphasis added.
the watt complaint sought rescission of the distribution plan and a declaration that the purported termination of the plaintiffs indian status and the trust status of the lands of the table mountain rancheria is void and that plaintiff distributees and dependents have been and remain eligible to participate in all federal programs and benefits provided to indians because of their status as indians.emphasis added.
on march,the watt parties stipulated to a settlement and judgment.the stipulation provided that the named plaintiffs 
represent the class of persons certified as consisting of all persons named in the distribution plan of the table mountain rancheria as distributees of the assets of said rancheria,or the indian heir s,assign s,executor s,administrator s,or successor s in interest thereof who,by reason of having participated in the distribution of the assets of said rancheria at any time have been considered by the government of the united states or any other governmental entity to have lost their status as indians under the laws of the united states.
emphasis added.the stipulation also required the secretary of the interior to list the table mountain band of indians as an indian tribal entity under part b,and permit any class member or successor who received title to an asset because of the distribution to elect to restore any such interest to federal trust status by conveying it to the united states for the benefit of the tribe.the watt settlement further stated that t he status of the named individual plaintiffs and class members as indians under the laws of the united states is confirmed.the settlement provided that plaintiffs would dismiss their damages claims against the secretary of the interior and the united states.
the district court approved the stipulated settlement on june.the watt court retained jurisdiction to enforce the judgment for one year after its date of entry.
on december,the secretary of the interior published a notice in the federal register,pursuant to b,designating the tmr as a federally recognized indian tribal entity eligible to receive services from the bia.indian tribal entities recognized and eligible to receive services from the united states bureau of indian affairs,
sometime thereafter,the tmr enacted a constitution and established tmr membership requirements.section of the constitution stated 
the membership of the tmr shall consist of the following 
a all persons of california indian descent who were listed as distributees or dependent members of distributees in the plan for the distribution of the assets of the table mountain rancheria as approved by the commissioner of indian affairs on july.
b all lineal descendants of persons named on the base roll provided such descendants possess at least degree california indian blood,regardless of whether the ancestor through whom eligibility is claimed is living or deceased.
the table mountain tribal council interprets and applies these provisions.
after the adoption of the tribal constitution,the plaintiffs in this action unsuccessfully petitioned the tribal council for admission to the table mountain rancheria.they alleged entitlement to membership because they are direct descendants of dependents of or of dependents of distributees of the distribution plan and have the requisite degree of california indian blood.
on january,filed the instant action in the united states district court for the northern district of california,the same court in which the watt action was filed.they named as defendants the tmr several members of the table mountain tribal council,a former table mountain tribal council chairperson,several current tribal members who served as representatives of the plaintiff classes in watt,the secretary of the interior,and the united states.
the complaint in this action complaint alleges a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing against all appellees because of their purported failure to insure that appellants were treated the same as the named parties in watt.the complaint seeks damages for this particular breach against the defendants,and declaratory and injunctive relief against the united states and the secretary of the department of the interior.the complaint also alleges a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against all appellees,who allegedly participated in an ongoing conspiracy to refuse appellants membership in the tribe.appellants allege that the duty arose by virtue of the appellees role as watt class representatives.the complaint alleges that this particular breach entitled appellants to any and all benefits provided by the tmr to any and all members which would include casino profits.
additionally,the complaint prays for an injunction requiring the tribe to recognize appellants as members of the tmr declaratory relief that appellants are members of the tmr and equally entitled to benefits from the federal government and tmr as are other members of the tribe and a full accounting of any and all benefits bestowed by the federal government defendants to table mountain rancheria any of its members from to the present.the complaint also seeks an order compelling the united states and the secretary of the interior to order the tmr to admit the plaintiffs as members.
on july,the district court granted in part and denied in part the appellees motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.it concluded that neither an act of congress nor the stipulated judgment in the watt action provides any basis for the district court exercise of jurisdiction over tribal membership determinations.in particular,the district court concluded that the indian gaming regulatory act,et,did not confer subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether the tribe or its officers acted wrongfully in denying appellants membership applications.also,the district court distinguished appellants claims from those which attack a judgment collaterally,noting that appellants have not elected to plead their case on a collateral attack theory.
next,the district court noted that the relief sought against the government defendants appears to be premised upon the fact that the secretary of the interior breached a duty owed to appellants by failing to order the tribe to admit them as members.the district court concluded that appellants failed to cite any federal statute or treaty authorizing the government defendants to force the tmr or its officers to admit any particular individual as a member.therefore,it concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the breach of duty claims brought against the government defendants.
finally,the district court addressed the question of whether appellants could maintain a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief under the apa in order to review the secretary of the interior failure to act upon a petition to admit appellants as members of the tmr.the district court stated that the apa gives rise to federal question jurisdiction,but only for claims brought against a federal agency,and not claims brought against the united states.it determined that the complaint failed to state a claim for relief under the apa.as a result,all claims against the tribal defendants,the watt plaintiffs,and the united states were dismissed with prejudice.the apa claim against the secretary of the interior was dismissed without prejudice with leave to amend.no amendment was filed.the complaint was dismissed in its entirety on december.
appellants contend that the district court erred in ruling that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their claims.we review a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.lewis norton,cir.
as a preliminary matter,we address appellants attempt to distinguish this case from those in which tribal immunity precludes federal court jurisdiction over tribal membership disputes.see,opening br.at t he tribe does not have immunity since it waived that immunity in its pursuit as a party plaintiff in watt.we do not reach this contention,because even if it had merit,it would not mandate reversal.appellees contend that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because appellants complaint contains no federal claim for relief.tribal appellees resp.br.at.we agree and affirm on this ground.
sovereign immunity limits a federal court subject matter jurisdiction over actions brought against a sovereign.vacek united states postal,cir.similarly,tribal immunity precludes subject matter jurisdiction in an action against an indian tribe.lewis,at.yet the absence of immunity does not establish the presence of subject matter jurisdiction.rather,the cornerstone of federal subject matter jurisdiction is statutory authorization.see,exxon mobil allapattah,d f ederal courts have no jurisdiction without statutory authorization.
to confer subject matter jurisdiction in an action against a sovereign,in addition to a waiver of sovereign immunity,there must be statutory authority vesting a district court with subject matter jurisdiction.see,arford united states,cir explaining that in order to maintain an action against the united states,there must be both statutory authority granting subject matter jurisdiction and a waiver of sovereign immunity.therefore,to establish that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over their claims,appellants can not rest on the assertion that principles of immunity do not apply.rather,appellants must establish some form of statutory authorization for their claims.see vacek,at quoting kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d explaining that the party asserting jurisdiction has the burden of establishing jurisdiction.
the district court described federal courts hesitation to intrude upon matters of tribal membership as a straightforward application of the doctrine of sovereign immunity.however,appellants case is more infirm than those in which we have found a lack of subject matter jurisdiction as a result of tribal immunity.indeed,the leading cases on federal jurisdiction over tribal matters arise in the context of claims for which a federal court has federal question jurisdiction.see donovan coeur tribal farm,cir explaining that respect for tribal exempts purely intramural matters such as conditions of tribal membership,inheritance rules,and domestic relations from the general rule that otherwise applicable federal statutes apply to indian tribes santa clara pueblo martinez,d declining to read title i of the indian civil rights act of icra,to authorize a cause of action in federal court for declaratory and injunctive relief to enforce the icra substantive provisions.tribal immunity in those cases precluded jurisdiction even though the claims at issue implicated federal statutes.as explained below,appellants arguments fail regardless of whether tribal immunity applies 
appellants first contend that the district court mistakenly analyzed their claims as membership disputes beyond the court jurisdiction.they argue that their claims ar
