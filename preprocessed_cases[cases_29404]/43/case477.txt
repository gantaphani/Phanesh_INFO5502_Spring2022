the united states government appeals the district court decision to suppress leland jeremy lopez two confessions to killing dalton box.the district court concluded that lopez confessions were the product of police coercion and,thus,involuntary.having jurisdiction under,we affirm.
viewed in the light most favorable to lopez,who was the prevailing party,see united states,cir,the evidence presented at the suppression hearing indicated the following on may,at approximately,dalton box was shot to death as he left a party at valentina wing home in towaoc,colorado,on the ute mountain ute indian reservation in southwestern colorado.two eyewitnesses identified year old lopez as the shooter.one of these eyewitnesses told police that lopez knocked box to the ground with the first shot and then walked over to the fallen box and shot him several more times before kicking him in the head.
police arrested lopez at approximately that same day and took him to the towaoc police station.there,at approximately,bureau of indian affairs bia agent james hopper and federal bureau of investigation fbi agent john wallace gave lopez his miranda warnings.lopez agreed to talk to the agents,and they interviewed him for approximately an hour.during this interview,lopez denied shooting box and told the agents that he had been at his mother home asleep when the shooting occurred.lopez agreed to a gunshot residue test,which was conducted at this time.during this first interview,lopez asked to talk to his mother.although the agents said he could talk to her,lopez was never permitted to do so.
after talking to several other witnesses,agents hopper and wallace again interviewed lopez at that same day.by this time,lopez had slept and appeared more rested than he had during the first interview earlier in the day.he was,however,in pain from a beating that he had received two days earlier,on may,when he was not in custody,a beating which apparently precipitated the shooting.although officers had offered lopez food during the day,lopez could not eat solid food because his jaw had been broken during the may beating.
at the start of this second interview,the agents again gave lopez his miranda warnings,after which lopez again agreed to talk to the agents.initially,lopez reiterated that he had been home asleep at that morning,when the killing occurred.lopez,however,suggested two of his friends,mondo mccook and corey morris might have shot box.
the agents then insinuated that the gun residue test they had conducted on lopez earlier in the day had produced positive results,even though the agents had not actually yet received any test results.further,the agents told lopez that they had up to six witnesses who had identified him as the shooter,when in fact they had just two eyewitnesses.finally,the agents misrepresented to lopez that they had found his footprints at the crime scene they had,in fact,found footprints,but had not identified whose they were.
in addition to these misrepresentations,agent hopper told lopez that hopper would prove lopez mother was a liar if she tried to corroborate lopez alibi of being asleep at her house at the time of the killing.lopez interpreted this to mean that if his mother testified on his behalf,the government would make her a liar on the stand.
agent hopper also took two pieces of paper and wrote the words mistake and murder on them and asked lopez whether his killing box was an accident or intentional murder.agent hopper then asked lopez to make a choice.the agent took two more pieces of paper and wrote the numbers six and sixty on them.lopez testified that agent hopper told him if you cooperate,you know,you could be looking at six years.and if you do cooperate and give us answers,you could be looking at years.
agent hopper also told lopez about a murder case in which the suspects had cooperated and gotten less time than the suspects who had not cooperated.according to the agent,the suspects in that other case were treated leniently because the crime had been a mistake.
at,over an hour into the second interview,a crying lopez told the agents that he had shot box by mistake.lopez testified at the suppression hearing that he admitted to shooting box in order to avoid spending sixty years in jail,as well as to prevent his mother from being prosecuted.for the next two hours,lopez gave the agents the details of his shooting box.the agents testified that,while lopez was telling them about the killing,he was crying and would go in and out of sobbing.this second interview lasted almost four hours,ending at approximately on may.
agent hopper and an officer from the cortez,colorado police department again interviewed lopez at approximately noon on may,before taking lopez to court for his initial appearance.this third interview lasted only thirty minutes.in between the second and third interviews,lopez had slept and had breakfast.at the start of the third interview,agent hopper again gave lopez his miranda warnings,after which lopez agreed to talk with the officers.a crying lopez again confessed,reiterating the story he had told the agents the night before.at the end of this interview,lopez asked agent hopper if the agent would give lopez a hug,and agent hopper obliged this request.
a grand jury indicted lopez,charging him with malice aforethought murder occurring within indian country,in violation of,lopez moved to suppress the statements he had made in each of the three interviews he had with the federal agents on may and.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the motion to suppress lopez statements from the first interview,but granted the motion to suppress his confessions given during the second and third interviews.the government appeals the district court decision to suppress lopez confessions.
ii.standard of review 
in reviewing the district court order granting or denying a motion to suppress,this court accepts the district court factual findings unless clearly erroneous and considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the district court determination.united states toles,cir.we are mindful that at a hearing on a motion to suppress,the credibility of the witnesses and the weight given to the evidence,as well as inferences and conclusions to be drawn therefrom,are matters for the trial judge.id.quotation omitted.however,w e review de novo the ultimate issue of whether a statement was voluntary,taking into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the confession,at quotations,citation omitted.in conducting this review,this court must examine the entire record and make an independent determination of the ultimate issue of voluntariness.united states lugo,cir quotation omitted.
iii.analysis 
the government bears the burden of showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that a confession is voluntary.see missouri seibert,d.the question this court must resolve is whether 
the confession is the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker if it is,if he has willed to confess,it may be used against him.if it is not,if his will has been overborne and his capacity for critically impaired,the use of his confession offends due process.
united states perdue,cir quoting culombe connecticut,d see also schneckloth bustamonte,d.further,w hen the government obtains incriminating statements through acts,threats,or promises which cause the defendant will to be overborne,it violates the defendant fifth amendment rights and the statements are inadmissible at trial as evidence of guilt.toles,at.this court determines the voluntariness of a confession based upon the totality of the circumstances,considering both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.id.at.no single factor is determinative.lugo,at.
the government first argues that the district court erred by basing its decision to suppress lopez confessions on a single agent hopper induced lopez confessions by promising him leniency.the district court did note that i f a policeman has made a promise of leniency,the resulting statement is the product of inducement,and thus involuntary.reading the district court decision in its entirety
