background 
white eagle was the bureau of indian affairs bia superintendent at the fort peck indian reservation.the bia is the federal government trustee for lands on fort peck in northeastern montana,which is home to the assiniboine and sioux tribes.until early,the bia oversaw the fort peck credit program credit program,which provided a supplemental source of credit to tribal members and was intended to rais e the economic status of members of the tribes to a point where they can look to the same sources of financing as are looked to by other citizens.one of white eagle duties was to sign loan documents for credit program loans that pledged trust assets as collateral.
the credit program was staffed with four tribal employees and two bia employees a loan specialist and a loan assistant.the four tribal employees were supervised by the two bia employees,who,in turn,were supervised by toni greybull,the bia administrative officer.white eagle was greybull immediate supervisor and the two women worked together at fort peck for many years.
greybull was a central participant in a fraudulent scheme to advantage credit program employees.the setup was not particularly complicated credit program employees obtained loans by filing applications in the names of nominee,or,relatives and then splitting the proceeds amongst themselves.to avoid the credit committee tasked with application review and approval,greybull approved many of the loans herself.this scheme was extensive an office of the inspector general oig audit revealed that of the approximately million loaned by the credit program,around million went to credit program employees and their family members.
greybull died in march,leaving behind a number of unpaid loans in others names.in may,greybull sister linda christiansen approached white eagle with documentation for nominee loans that greybull had taken out in christiansen name as well as in the name of arthur greybull,iii toni greybull son.christiansen requested that the loans be repaid out of greybull life insurance.apparently worried that inquiries about the loans would lead to an audit that potentially would expose the fraud,white eagle contacted greybull husband arthur greybull and falsely informed him that toni greybull not the nominee borrowers had outstanding loans with the credit program.greybull husband then paid the loans with money from greybull life insurance.
greybull was not the only beneficiary of the loan program.white eagle also obtained loans from the credit program,though not through the use of nominee borrowers.in,she took out a loan of,and in february she obtained a loan for.white eagle made payments as required under the terms of the loans.the loan was modified twice to allow borrowing of additional funds in january the loan was increased by,and in june it was increased by another.these modifications were approved by the credit program credit committee,not greybull.although the government does not allege the loans were fraudulently procured,white eagle loan modification was contrary to specific directives she had received.when the bia regional director discovered in late that white eagle had taken out loans,he told her to pay them off and discontinue participation in the credit program due to the conflict of interest.the government argues that white eagle credit program loans also violated the prohibition on holding financial interests that conflict with conscientious performance of duty.see b.
at trial,the government argued that greybull arranged the loan modification as quid pro quo for white eagle assistance in dealing with possible discovery of the nominee loan scheme triggered by greybull mother patricia menz.in september,menz visited the credit program offices to pay off a loan she had personally taken out and discovered,to her surprise,that other loans had been taken out in her name and without her knowledge or consent.the credit program employee who assisted menz had obtained fraudulent loans himself and knew that greybull had obtained fraudulent loans.he directed menz to speak to greybull for answers to her questions.instead,and without telling greybull or others involved in the scheme,menz contacted the oig and reported the loan irregularities.
menz did not complain to the bia or the credit program,and there was no official reason for white eagle to address her concerns.nonetheless,in december,white eagle sent menz a letter on bia letterhead falsely assuring her that she owed nothing because the loans had been erroneously listed in her name and had also been paid off.the day before white eagle sent the letter,she had applied for the increase in her loan.although the loan was approved by the credit committee,the government presented evidence that greybull its approval,even prevailing upon credit program staff to release a hold on white eagle account.the government also argued that the loan issued on unusually favorable terms.under its theory,the and favorable loan modification was a payoff for white eagle assistance in the coverup.
the fraudulent scheme was uncovered during a audit conducted by the fort peck tribes.the audit determined that fraud had been taking place since at least the early,with participation by six credit program employees.the investigation also identified christiansen and greybull iii the nominal recipients of the loans paid off by greybull life insurance as participants.
white eagle prosecution arose out of the audit.in march,the government charged white eagle with six counts stemming from her involvement in the fraudulent scheme and the loan modifications.the jury found her guilty on all counts.the district court imposed a sentence of months on counts i through v,and months for count vi,to run concurrently.white eagle appeals her convictions on all counts,as well as the district court application of the sentencing enhancement based on the value of the bribe.
convictions 
white eagle preserved her claim of insufficient evidence by moving for a judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence.we therefore review de novo the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the conviction.united states tucker,cir.evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction if,when construed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states nevils,cir en banc quoting jackson virginia,emphasis in original.
counts i and ii conspiracy,theft and conversion of indian tribal organization property 
in counts i and ii,the government alleged that white eagle and greybull conspired to embezzle or convert credit program funds.according to the government,the object of the conspiracy was white eagle loan modification.we note that these charges are narrowly targeted,particularly in comparison to the nominee borrower scheme.counts i and ii focus on menz discovery of the loans in her name,white eagle assistance in the attempted,and white eagle receipt of a loan modification events beginning in late,long after greybull nominee scheme occurred was implemented.
the jury was properly instructed that conspiracy required an agreement between two or more persons and a plan to commit at least one of the crimes alleged in the indictment as an object of the conspiracy.ninth circuit model criminal jury instruction.the government argues that t he jury could infer an agreement from greybull loans and white eagle attempt to cover up the fraudulent activity.however,it does not argue that greybull loans,which predated the alleged conspiracy,were its object.instead,under each of the misappropriation theories,white eagle loan modification is touted as the object of the conspiracy obtaining monies that her supervisor had prohibited misapplication or using her lawful authority over the funds to gain what was an otherwise unauthorized possession of the funds embezzlement and conversion.hence,we analyze white eagle loan modification,not greybull fraudulent nominee loans,as the basis for the convictions on counts i and ii.
the government presented no evidence that white eagle defrauded the credit program or that the applications for her loan and subsequent modifications were inaccurate or incomplete.see carlos blaza holder,cir analyzing charge for misapplication of bank funds and holding that a conviction for misapplication necessarily involves intent to defraud united states dreitzler,cir to show misapplication,the government must prove that the bank funds were disbursed under a false record.unlike core participants in the nominee borrower scheme,white eagle did not use nominee borrowers to surreptitiously gain a personal benefit.id.at upholding misapplication conviction where defendant set up bogus loan transactions,presented forged documents to the bank,and received the proceeds of the loans which he used for his insurance agency benefit.the posture of white eagle participation forecloses a conviction under a traditional misapplication theory involving fraud or misrepresentation of some kind.
the government instead tethers its theory to two restrictions affecting white eagle participation in the credit program.the first restriction is that white eagle supervisor in instructed her not to borrow from the credit program the second,b,prohibits holding financial interests that conflict with conscientious performance of duty.however,neither violation of an employer instruction nor a civil rule by itself supports a conviction for conversion,theft,or misapplication of funds.
this conclusion follows from analogous cases involving prosecutions for misapplication of bank funds under.in united states wolf,cir,the defendant submitted fraudulent loan applications in the name of borrowers and additionally failed to make disclosures required by federal reserve regulation despite evidence that the loan applications were fraudulent,we reversed the misapplication conviction because of the serious risk that the jury would find wolf guilty of criminal misapplication because he failed to comply with regulation o,a civil regulation.see also united states christo,cir a conviction,resulting from the government attempt to bootstrap a series of checking account overdrafts,a civil regulatory violation,into an equal amount of misapplication felonies,can not be allowed to stand.u nder the logic of christo and wolf,it is impermissible to use the violation of a civil statute to ipso facto supply a crucial element of a criminal offense.united states eriksen,cir.the government misapplication theory,predicated at best on an employer directive and a civil regulation,can not support a conviction here.
the government embezzlement and conversion theories also fail because white eagle never controlled or had custody of the funds that she later borrowed.even though she signed paperwork for loans involving the pledge of trust assets as collateral,the credit committee of which white eagle was not a member approved loans before a check would issue.see id.at explaining that e mbezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation of property by a person to whom such property has been entrusted,or into whose hands it has lawfully come alteration in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted united states andreen,cir c onversion encompasses the use of property,placed in one custody for a limited purpose,in an unauthorized manner or to an unauthorized extent.nor does greybull shepherding white eagle loan modification through the approval process and signing paperwork constitute embezzlement.in contrast to greybull own nominee loans which circumvented the credit committee,white eagle loan modification was ultimately approved by the credit committee.even in the light most favorable to the government,the evidence contradicts an embezzlement or conversion theory.
because the alleged object of the conspiracy the loan modification was not itself criminal,there can be no conspiracy.see united states montgomery,cir holding that a conspiracy requires an agreement to engage in criminal conduct.the government can not bootstrap itself to a criminal conviction simply because white eagle disobeyed a supervisor order or contravened a general civil conflict of interest statute.we reverse white eagle convictions on counts i and ii.
count iii bribery 
the quid pro quo alleged here is simple.white eagle,as bia superintendent,helped greybull cover up her fraudulent scheme in exchange greybull helped her obtain a favorable loan modification.the government was required to prove that white eagle was a public official she received some thing of value in return for being induced to do or omit to do an act in violation of her official duty and she acted corruptly that is,with the intent to be influenced to perform an act that violated her official duty.see b c united states leyva,cir.
white eagle does not challenge her status as a public official.instead,she argues that she received nothing of value because greybull assistance with the loan modification was unnecessary and that she did not act corruptly because her actions could not have affected the oig investigation.white eagle also challenges the sufficiency of the indictment,which alleges that agreement and payment took place after she sent the letter to menz.
the evidence is consistent with bribery,and surely sufficient under jackson virginia.at evidence is sufficient if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt emphasis in original.upon hearing of menz concerns,white eagle conducted almost no investigation into whether menz loans were actually paid,and did not report the issue to her superior.instead,on december,she wrote a letter to menz on bia letterhead falsely assuring her that the loans had been paid off and that they had only erroneously been listed under menz name.only one day earlier,white eagle had applied for the loan modification.the modification appears to have issued on irregular and favorable terms it included improved repayment provisions,and the documentation did not include a pledge of trust assets as was normally required.greybull,whose signature appeared on the application,the loan and prevailed upon the credit program to release a hold on white eagle account that arose after a borrower for whom white eagle had defaulted on a loan.
a rational jury could easily infer a quid pro quo from these facts,concluding that white eagle wrote menz a letter to alleviate her concerns and turned a blind eye to the nominee borrower scheme in exchange for greybull later assistance in securing a quick and favorable loan modification.although the loan modification might well have issued without greybull involvement,the jury was entitled to find that her assistance was something of value,particularly given the favorable terms.
white eagle also argues that she took no corrupt actions because her letter to menz could not have affected the oig response to menz complaint.in doing so,she misconstrues the import of the letter transmitting the letter was corrupt regardless of its impact,as success is not an element of the offense.moreover,white eagle failed to report the obviously illegal nominee borrower scheme.see united states birdsall,adopting,for bribery purposes,a broad definition of official acts and noting that t o constitute official action,it was not necessary that the conduct be prescribed by statute hardisty,cir same.the jury had ample evidence to conclude that white eagle actions were corrupt.
white eagle argues that a person can not be bribed for a past act and urges us to reject the indictment because it states that white eagle agreed to the scheme and accepted the payment in january,after she sent the letter to menz.but the indictment sets no dates in stone.while count iii states that white eagle agreed to the scheme and received the loan modification on or around january,the evidence in the record is consistent with an agreement between white eagle and greybull that predated the december letter to menz.moreover,any challenge to the sufficiency of count iii of the indictment is misplaced regardless of any imprecision as to timing.the indictment tracks the language of the bribery statute,contains the elements of the offense,and specifies which of white eagle actions violated the law,thus allowing her to avoid another prosecution on the same actions.see hamling united states,united states milovanovic,cir.we affirm white eagle conviction under count iii.
count iv falsification,concealment,or covering up of a material fact 
the district court properly instructed the jury that a conviction under a requires that the defendant had a duty to disclose material information,the defendant falsified,concealed,or covered up such a fact by trick,scheme,or fraud,the falsified,concealed,or covered up fact was material,the falsification concealment was knowing and willful,and the material fact was within the jurisdiction of the executive branch.see united states varbel,cir indictment alleging concealment in violation of failed where there was no duty to disclose see also united states moore,cir.white eagle challenges the legal sufficiency of her duty to report greybull fraud and claims that she did report the fraud to darryl lacounte,the bia deputy regional director.
white eagle claim that she reported the fraudulent scheme does not withstand scrutiny.she argues only that she told lacounte that greybull husband had paid the balance of a loan for one of greybull relatives.this hardly counts as an actual report alerting lacounte to the fraudulent activity.lacounte testimony also contradicts white eagle claim that she reported the fraud.he recalled discussing greybull husband payment with white eagle,but did not remember hearing about greybull fraud.lacounte also testified that he would have reacted to any report regarding fraudulently obtained loans but he did not investigate or take any actions.the jury was entitled to reject white eagle account and credit lacounte testimony.we can not overturn its credibility determinations.see united states yossunthorn,cir noting that a jury credibility finding can not be reviewed on appeal.we therefore focus our analysis on whether white eagle failure to report greybull fraud can support a conviction for concealment under a.
white eagle,like all government employees,had a duty to disclose waste,fraud,abuse,and corruption to appropriate authorities,codified in the code of federal regulations as a b asic obligation of public service.see b.it is not disputed that white eagle violated this fundamental rule.however,she is not charged with breaching the public trust or failing to perform her duties as a public servant or government employee.instead,she is charged with fraudulent concealment,a narrower offense under the umbrella of fraud and false statements.ch.because failing to report fraud in violation of generally applicable ethical principles is not equivalent to a false statement,the facts do not support a conviction under a 
as other circuits have recognized,a conviction under a is proper where a statute or government regulation requires the defendant to disclose specific information to a particular person or entity.see united states tobon builes,cir.so,for example,when a defendant submits a report that omits particular information that by law must appear in the report,a conviction for concealment is proper.see united states muntain.the same holds true when a defendant responds to specific questions on a particular topic.see united states stewart,cir holding that sec investigator specific questions regarding another individual stock trades created a duty to disclose information about those trades.
in these situations,the defendant silence is akin to an affirmative misrepresentation,and therefore logically falls within the scope of s prohibition on false and fraudulent statements.see united states mubayyid,cir b y filing the false form,which he signed under penalty of perjury,mubayyid did not passively fail to disclose material facts he engaged in an affirmative act of concealment his conduct is therefore sufficient grounds for a conviction under a.citation omitted.similarly,if a financial institution fails to report particular transactions as required by law,its silence is effectively a statement that no such transactions took place.united states puerto,cir holding that a defendant is guilty of concealment of a material fact when he causes either an inaccurate currency transaction report or no currency transaction report to be sent to the internal revenue service.
we can identify no analogous silent statement by white eagle.it is true that white eagle concealed greybull loans by writing a false letter to menz claiming that the loans had been paid off and by inducing greybull husband to pay the loan balances with life insurance proceeds.however,neither act involved an affirmative false or misleading statement to the government.the government argues that white eagle further concealed the fraud by informing lacounte that greybull nominee loans had been paid off,but not telling him that they had been fraudulently obtained in the first place.but that incomplete report while misleading did not contravene a specific reporting duty.white eagle partial disclosure made no representation,explicit or implicit,as to the existence of fraud in the credit program.her acts may be improper and unethical,but they are not sufficient for a concealment conviction under a.
the circuit treatment of an analogous issue in united states safavian,is instructive.the court overturned a conviction under a that,like here,arose out of an alleged violation of b.id.at.the defendant,a gsa employee,sought ethical advice about participating in golf trip sponsored by jack abramoff,but did not disclose abramoff business before the gsa in his request for the ethics opinion.id.at.the government argued that the defendant omission of this relevant detail breached his duty to disclose under the regulation and other ethical principles.id.at.the court acknowledged the ethics rules required disclosure relating to corruption,but found that the relationship between those requirements and the duty to report under a was tenuous at best.id.it noted that there was no indication of the particular facts or information that should be disclosed,and that the regulation contained no indication that it applied to the defendant conduct.id.at.it reversed the conviction under a because there was no duty to disclose.id.
the same reasoning applies here.although the regulation discusses reporting fraud and corruption,b,it does not provide specifics on what kind of information should be reported or to whom.nor does it discuss criminal liability for failure to abide by its provisions.see safavian,at under the fifth amendment,the defendant must have fair notice of what conduct is forbidden t his fair warning requirement prohibits application of a criminal statute to a defendant unless it was reasonably clear at the time of the alleged action that defendant actions were criminal.first three alterations in original citation omitted.nothing in a or the regulation indicates that a failure to report could effectively be read as a statement that no fraud was taking place.because the government did not show that white eagle violated a specific duty to report credit program fraud,we reverse her conviction as to count iv.
count v public acts affecting a personal financial interest 
white eagle was also indicted under a,the basic criminal conflict of interest statute based on her alleged concealment of greybull fraudulent scheme.according to the government,the concea
