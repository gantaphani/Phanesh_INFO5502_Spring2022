an indictment was filed in the united states district court for the district of south dakota,charging milk with the aforementioned crimes.the case proceeded to trial.milk requested a jury instruction both prior to trial and at the close of evidence setting forth his definition of public housing authority.milk proposed instruction defined a public housing authority as follows 
the term public housing authority is defined as a public housing agency that participates in public housing.a public housing agency means any state,county,municipality,or other governmental entity or public body,or agency or instrumentality thereof which is authorized to engage in or assist in the development or operation of public housing.
appellant app.at.the district court rejected milk proposed instruction and drafted its own jury instruction.the district court instruction defined public housing authority as an agency created by a federal,state,local or tribal government body for the purposes of making housing available to qualified individuals.id.at.milk moved for judgments of acquittal after the close of the government case and after the close of the evidence,arguing that because the term public housing authority within the meaning of does not include tribal housing authorities,milk was not guilty as a matter of law.the district court denied the motions.milk also proposed jury instructions for two lesser included offenses possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute,in violation of,and possession of marijuana,in violation of.the district court denied milk request to give these two lesser included offense instructions,the jury convicted him of the charged crimes,and he appeals.
a.the meaning of public housing authority as used in.
the crime of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute within feet of a public housing authority has four essential elements the defendant possessed marijuana,the defendant knew that he was in possession of a controlled substance,the defendant intended to distribute some or all of the marijuana to another person,and the defendant possessed the marijuana within feet of a housing facility owned by a public housing authority.see.milk argues that the district court erred when it denied his motions for judgment of acquittal and when it gave the jury an instruction indicating that tribal housing authorities were within the meaning of public housing authority as used in.each of these alleged errors followed from the district court interpretation of the statute.we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.united states mcintosh,cir,cert.denied,d.
the starting point in any question of statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself.id.at.the statute at issue in this case provides that 
any person who violates section a of this title or section of this title by distributing,possessing with intent to distribute,or manufacturing a controlled substance in or on,or within one thousand feet of a housing facility owned by a public housing authority is subject to twice the maximum punishment authorized by section b of this title and at least twice any term of supervised release authorized by section b of this title for a first offense.
where the language of a statute is unambiguous,the statute should be enforced as written unless there is clear legislative intent to the contrary.mcintosh,at.the text of the statute indicates that the enhanced penalties for conducting drug transactions apply whenever the transaction occurs within feet of any housing facility owned by a public housing authority,which plain language in our view means only nonprivate sector,governmental,housing authorities.the statute does not distinguish between federal,state,local,county,or even tribal housing authorities.because the text of the statute does not limit its application to any specific type of public housing authority,we decline to read that distinction into the statute.see id.at courts are obligated to refrain from embellishing statutes by inserting language that congress has opted to omit.quoting root new liberty hosp,cir.
milk advances two arguments in an attempt to circumvent the plain language of the statute.first,milk argues that public housing authority is a term of art specifically defined in other parts of the code as excluding indian housing authorities.second,milk argues that clear legislative history demonstrates that public housing authority does not include indian housing authorities.both of his arguments hinge upon a definition of public housing authority found in title of the code of federal regulations and in title of the united states code.
