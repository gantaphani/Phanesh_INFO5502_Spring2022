the question in this case is whether the fair political practices commission fppc can sue an indian tribe to force it to comply with reporting requirements for campaign contributions contained in the political reform act pra,government code section et 
real party in interest,the fppc,filed suit against agua caliente band of cahuilla indians the tribe,alleging failure to disclose lobbying activities and contributions to political campaigns,as required by the pra.the tribe claims that,as a indian tribe,it is immune from suit under the doctrine of tribal immunity.in this writ proceeding,the tribe asks this court to issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its ruling denying the tribe motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction and enter a new order granting the motion.
we shall deny the tribe petition we shall conclude,on the one hand,that the doctrine of tribal immunity,as announced by the united states supreme court,has no foundation in the federal constitution or in any federal statute but is rather a doctrine created by the common law power of the supreme court.on the other hand,the state has a constitutional right,under article iv,section and the tenth amendment to the united states constitution,to maintain a republican form of government.that form of government entails government by representatives elected by the people.the right to sue to enforce the pra is necessary to preserve a republican form of government free of corruption and therefore has constitutional stature.the constitutional right of the state to sue to preserve its republican form of government trumps the common law doctrine of tribal immunity.the fppc can therefore sue the tribe.
factual and procedural background 
fppc complaint sought civil penalties and injunctive relief for the tribe alleged violations of the pra.the complaint alleged an express purpose of the pra,as stated in section,is to ensure that contributions to california election campaigns be fully disclosed to the public in order that voters may be fully informed and improper practices may be inhibited.section mandates that specified contributions be disclosed to the public in a timely manner the pra also mandates reporting of lobbying activities to regulate lobbyists and ensure that lobbyists do not exert improper influence on public officials.
the complaint alleged the tribe is a federally recognized indian tribe and constitutes a person pursuant to section of the pra,which defines person as an individual,proprietorship,firm,partnership,joint venture,syndicate,business trust,company,corporation,limited liability company,association,committee,and any other organization or group of persons acting in concert.
the complaint alleged the tribe constituted a major donor subject to pra reporting requirements because of the tribe extensive contributions to political campaigns,including more than in,in the first half of,and in the first half of.
in the first cause of action,the complaint alleged two pra violations for failure to file campaign statements by july,and january,as required by section.the tribe made contributions to california candidates and committees totaling at least between january and june of,but failed to file the disclosure statement by the july,due date.the tribe did not file the required statement until october,more than two years after the due date.the tribe made contributions totaling at least between july and december of,but failed to file the disclosure statement by the january,due date.the tribe filed an untimely statement on march,but amended it in a final statement on november.
in a second cause of action,the complaint alleged the tribe failed to report,in its july,statement,a march contribution to a statewide ballot measure committee on proposition.proposition authorized expenditure of million per fiscal year for eight years for projects that included a passenger rail line from los angeles to an area of palm springs where the tribe operates a casino.
in a third cause of action,the complaint alleged pra violations for failure to report late contributions totaling more than million under section,which requires the donor to file a report within hours of making a contribution before an election but after the closing date of the last statement.
in a fourth cause of action,the complaint alleged four pra violations for failure to report lobbying interests,leaving voters unable to correlate the tribe campaign contribution information with the interests being lobbied by the tribe.
the complaint sought monetary penalties,as authorized by sections and,and an injunction commanding the tribe to file disclosure statements required by the pra.
in november,the tribe,specially appearing,filed a motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction.the tribe asserted it was immune from suit under the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity.the tribe also asserted all the information sought by the lawsuit was available to fppc through other sources,reports filed by the recipients of the campaign contributions.
on february,the trial court issued a written ruling denying the tribe motion to quash.the trial court observed that case law applying the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity concerned activities affecting tribal or economic development,not activities affecting the governance and development of another sovereign.to apply immunity to pra enforcement actions would intrude upon the state exercise of its reserved power under the tenth amendment of the united states constitution,to regulate its electoral and legislative processes,and interfere with the republican form of government guaranteed to the state by article iv,section of the united states constitution.
on april,the tribe filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court,seeking a writ to make the trial court grant its motion to quash.we denied the petition.
on july,the california supreme court granted the tribe petition for review and transferred the matter to this court with directions to vacate the order denying mandate and to issue an order directing respondent to show cause why the relief sought should not be granted.
on august,we issued the order to show cause.
fppc filed a return to the petition.we also allowed the filing of amicus curiae briefs by the attorney general of the state of california and california common cause,both in support of fppc position.
discussion 
in this proceeding,the tribe does not contend it is immune from the pra requirements for disclosure of campaign contributions.rather,the tribe contends it is immune from a lawsuit to enforce the pra 
the tribe argues it has immunity from any state lawsuit unless it waives immunity which it has not done or unless congress expressly authorizes the suit which congress has not done.
courts have recognized tribal immunity from suit in a variety of contexts,kiowa tribe manufacturing tech,d kiowa tribe indian tribes enjoy immunity from suit on contracts regardless of whether they were made on or off the reservation oklahoma tax com.potawatomi tribe,d state may impose tax on indian cigarette sales to,but may not sue tribe to collect tax puyallup tribe washington game,d state court had no jurisdiction to order tribe to limit number of fish which members may catch and report number middletown rancheria workers comp.appeals bd.th,d workers compensation appeals board lacked jurisdiction over indian tribe for purposes of enforcing california workers compensation laws redding rancheria superior court th,d indian tribe was immune from tort suit arising outside of tribal lands,where woman alleged she was injured while working as a bartender at a redding hotel,hosting a party for the indian tribe casino.
the tribe suggests tribal immunity from suit has a constitutional basis because the constitution gives congress plenary power over indian affairs.however,the tribe cites no authority specifically stating that tribal immunity from suit is a constitutional imperative.
in fact,the doctrine of tribal immunity from suit is not found in the federal constitution or in any federal statute,but is a matter of federal common law.the term federal common law,although it has eluded precise definition,is law that is neither constitutional nor statutory.see erwin chermerinsky,federal jurisdiction ed defining federal common law as the development of legally binding federal law by the federal courts in the absence of directly controlling constitutional or statutory provisions martha field,sources of law the scope of federal common law,harv,defining federal common law as any rule of federal law created by a court when the substance of that rule is not clearly suggested by federal or congressional.united states enas circ.
thus,the supreme court has said,indian tribes have long been recognized as possessing the immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by sovereign powers.citations.santa clara pueblo martinez,d tribe was immune from suit in federal court brought by female tribe member alleging violation of the indian civil rights act icra,et which required indian tribes to afford equal protection to its members see also,kiowa tribe,supra,d doctrine of tribal immunity developed almost by accident long chemehuevi indian reservation d.tribal immunity is based on policy considerations rather than specific constitutional provisions and is generally considered to be coextensive with the sovereign immunity of the federal government.the common law sovereign immunity possessed by the tribe is a necessary corollary to indian sovereignty and.citation.of course,because of the peculiar status of the indian tribes,the tribe immunity is not congruent with that which the federal government,or the states,enjoy.citations.three affiliated tribes wold engineering,d state statute,insofar as it disclaimed jurisdiction over suits by tribal plaintiffs against for which there was no other forum,was preempted by federal legislation.
in support of its assertion that tribal immunity from suit is a constitutional imperative,the tribe cites oneida oneida indian nation,d,which held a tribe could sue counties in federal court for the counties use of tribal land,and which referred to the constitutional provision giving congress the power to regulate commerce with indian tribes,art.i,cl.the tribe also cites worcester v.the state of georgia pet,which said the constitution confers on congress the powers of war and peace of making treaties,and of regulating commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.these powers comprehend all that is required for the regulation of our intercourse with the indians.worcester,which rejected the state of georgia attempt to apply its criminal laws within tribal lands,also said,t he whole intercourse between the united states and this indian nation,is,by our constitution and laws,vested in the government of the united states.id.at.
we recognize that state courts have said,f ederal authority over native american indian matters derives primarily from the power to regulate commerce with native american indian tribes,art.i,cl.and secondarily from the power to make treaties,art.ii,cl.citations.the united states constitution is silent regarding state action in these areas.a review of the evolving decisional law makes clear the federal government predominance over native american indian affairs in general and over indian land in particular.citation.middletown rancheria workers comp.appeals,supra,th,d.the policy of leaving indians free from state jurisdiction and control is deeply rooted in this nation history and has two independent but interrelated bases federal preemption and the internal sovereign rights of indian tribes.citations.states may regulate within indian country only when state control is not preempted by federal law or when state control does not infringe on tribal sovereignty.citations.id.at,d,italics omitted enforcement of california workers compensation laws by administrative board would unlawfully infringe on tribe right to govern its own employment affairs.
additionally,courts have come to favor federal preemption over inherent sovereignty as the primary justification for the preclusion of state authority over indian affairs.citation.the basis for this assertion of exclusive federal authority over indian affairs is rooted in three provisions of the united states constitution the indian commerce clause art.i,cl,which gives congress the exclusive power to control indian commerce the treaty clause art.ii,cl.and the supremacy clause art.vi,cl,which,together with extensive congressional legislation on indian affairs,has broadly preempted state law.citation.boisclair superior court cal d,construing federal legislation for state court jurisdiction over individual indians.
authority for applying the doctrine of tribal immunity in this case can not be found in the indian commerce clause.the united states constitution,article i,section,which describes the powers granted to congress,states in clause that congress has the power t o regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.this clause can not support tribal immunity in this case because it grants a power to congress,and congress has not granted the tribe immunity from this suit,and it concerns the regulation of commerce,and this case concerns not commerce but rather the political process.
nor can such authority be found in the treaty clause art.ii,cl,because the tribe has cited no treaty that exists between it and the federal government.
nor does the supremacy clause suggest that the doctrine of tribal immunity is other than a common law rule.the supremacy clause tells us that federal law trumps state law,but it does not provide textual support for adoption of the law in the first place.
we therefore conclude that the doctrine of tribal immunity,as it is sought to be applied in this case,is neither a constitutional nor a statutory doctrine.rather,it is a creature of the common law power of the united states supreme court.
on the other hand,the tenth amendment to the united states constitution states,the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution,nor prohibited by it to the states,are reserved to the states respectively,or to the people.
but what are these powers that are reserved to the states surely one such power is the power and duty to maintain a republican form of government,since maintenance of that form of government is mandated by article iv,section of the united states constitution,which provides in relevant part,t he united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government 
the right and duty of the state to maintain a republican form of government necessarily includes the right to elect representatives and to protect against corruption of the political process.thus,b y the constitution,a republican form of government is guaranteed to every state in the union,and the distinguishing feature of that form is the right of the people to choose their own officers for governmental administration.duncan mccall.e ach state has the power to prescribe the qualifications of its officers and the manner in which they shall be chosen.citations.such power inheres in the state by virtue of its obligation to preserve the basic conception of a political community.gregory ashcroft,d age discrimination in employment act did not apply to appointed state judges,and mandatory retirement of state judges did not violate equal protection clause.
in a series of cases in which individuals sought to rely upon the constitutional guarantee of a republican form of government,the united states supreme court held the question to be a nonjusticiable political question.the situation was described most recently by the high court in new york united states at pages through,d new york,as follows 
in most of the cases in which the court has been asked to apply the guarantee clause,the court has found the claims presented to be nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine.citations.
the view that the guarantee clause implicates only nonjusticiable political questions has its origin in luther borden,how,in which the court was asked to decide,in the wake of dorr rebellion,which of two rival governments was the legitimate government of rhode island.the court held that it rests with congress,not the judiciary,to decide what government is the established one in a state,at.over the following century,this limited holding metamorphosed into the sweeping assertion that v iolation of the great guaranty of a republican form of government in states can not be challenged in the courts.citation.
this view has not always been accepted.in a group of cases decided before the holding of luther was elevated into a general rule of nonjusticiability,the court addressed the merits of claims founded on the guarantee clause without any suggestion that the claims were not justiciable.citations.
more recently,the court has suggested that perhaps not all claims under the guarantee clause present nonjusticiable political questions.citation.contemporary commentators have likewise suggested that courts should address the merits of such claims,at least in some circumstances.citations.
we need not resolve this difficult question today.new york,supra,d.
we agree with professor laurence tribe,who has opined that,in light of new york,supra,d,the question of the justiciability of the guarantee clause when asserted by a state is not foreclosed.see tribe,american constitutional law ed.as professor tribe has said,to be sure,the supreme court has never held that the guarantee clause confers judicially cognizable rights upon individuals but it need not follow from the unavailability of the guarantee clause as a textual source of protection for individuals that the clause confers no judicially enforceable rights upon states as states.it is,after all,to every state that the promise of the guarantee clause is addressed.tribe,op.cit.supra.
we conclude it is entirely appropriate for the state to invoke the guarantee clause,together with its reserved right under the tenth amendment,to preserve its republican form of very essence of its political corruption.and we so hold.
there can be no doubt that the pra accomplishes this aim.
the united states supreme court said recently,to the extent that large political contributions are given to secure a political quid pro quo from current and potential office holders,the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.nixon shrink missouri gov pac,d.
the purpose of california pra is to insure a electorate and to prevent corruption of the political process.thirteen committee weinreb d.costs of conducting election campaigns have increased greatly,and candidates have been forced to finance their campaigns by seeking large contributions from lobbyists and organizations who thereby gain disproportionate influence over governmental decisions,subd.c.the people enact the pra to accomplish the following purposes a receipts and expenditures in election campaigns should be fully and truthfully disclosed in order that the voters may be fully informed and improper practices may be inhibited.b the activities of lobbyists should be regulated and their finances disclosed in order that improper influences will not be directed at public officials.government has a substantial interest in providing the electorate with information as to where political campaign money comes from deterring corruption and avoiding the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions to the light of publicity and detecting violations of contribution limits.buckley valeo,d upholding reporting requirements of federal election campaign statutes against a first amendment challenge.statutes requiring campaign contribution disclosures serve to protect the integrity of the electoral process and a republican form of government.
but does this federal constitutional right of the state to maintain the integrity of its republican form of government entail the right to bring suit to enforce the right 
our supreme court has recognized that rules or procedures necessary to secure a constitutional right may themselves be given constitutional stature.these rules and procedures add flesh to otherwise skeletal constitutional rights.several examples should suffice.
in miranda arizona,d miranda,the supreme court held that,in order to preserve a citizen right not to incriminate himself under the fifth amendment,police officers had to give citizens in custody certain advisements miranda rights before interrogating them.in dickerson united states,d,the court held that the miranda warnings and the consequences of not giving them were required by the federal constitution and could not be overruled by an act of congress.id.at.
similarly,the fourth amendment to the federal constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.in wilson arkansas at page,d,the high court held that police officers were required to knock and announce their presence before entering a residence as an element of the reasonableness inquiry under the fourth amendment.
again,in another fourth amendment case,mapp ohio,d mapp,the high court held that the rule requiring the exclusion at trial of unlawfully obtained evidence is an essential part of both the fourth and fourteenth amendments.id.at.the court reasoned,were it otherwise,the freedom from state invasions of privacy would be ephemeral id.at.
in this case,the state resort to the judicial process is a procedure essential to enforce its reserved right and duty to maintain a republican form of government.what else is it to do,call out its well regulated militia we daresay no one would sanction such a remedy.we conclude that,without a right to bring suit,the state constitutional right to preserve its republican form of government would be ephemeral.mapp ohio,supra,d.
the tribe and our dissenting colleague argue that fppc has alternatives for bringing suit,to approach the tribe and negotiate an agreement which the tribe asserts it would view with willingness and cooperation,or to seek legislation from congress.these alternatives are uncertain they do not persuade us to apply tribal immunity to bar this action to enforce the pra.moreover,absent the threat of a lawsuit,we see no incentive for the tribe to agree to comply with fppc reporting requirements.
the tribe says the information sought by fppc is readily available because the tribe posted information about its campaign contributions and lobbying activities on its website.however,fppc is not required to rely on informal,perhaps incomplete,reporting.
the tribe argues a pra enforcement action against the tribe is unnecessary for protection of the electoral process,because the pra also requires recipients of campaign donations to report the contributions,and therefore disclosure by the contributor is merely duplicative of the same information.however,it stands to reason that the requirement for both payor and payee to file disclosure statements will act as a check to discourage omissions by one or the other.thus,the fact that recipients are supposed to report contributions does not constitute an alternative method of enforcement.
we therefore conclude that resort to a judicial remedy is essential to secure the state constitutional right to guarantee a republican form of government free of corruption.as such,the right to sue must be given constitutional stature.see dickerson united states,supra,d.
in this case,the state,through fppc,is asserting a right guaranteed by the constitution of the united states.the tribe asserts a common law immunity.the state constitutional right trumps the tribe common law immunity,because no even the united states supreme the common law power to make up a rule that conflicts with the united states constitution.thus,the united states supreme court has said,the departments of the government are legislative,executive and judicial.they are coordinate in degree to the extent of the powers delegated to each of them.each,in the exercise of its powers,is independent of the other,but all,rightfully done by either,is binding upon the others.the constitution is supreme over all of them,because the people who ratified it have made it so consequently,anything which may be done unauthorized by it is unlawful.dodge woolsey how,italics added.
the tribe cites various cases where the doctrine of tribal immunity has been applied.see ante.however,all of these cases are distinguishable because in none of them did a state assert a federal constitutional right to bring suit that trumped the common law doctrine of tribal immunity.it is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.citations.in re marriage of cornejo cal th,d.
the tribe cites cases for the supposed proposition that the tenth amendment is immaterial to the question of tribal immunity,which is controlled exclusively by federal law.the cited cases do not help the tribe.matter of guardianship of,at pages through held federal indian child welfare not infringe on the state tenth amendment reserved powers over domestic relations cases where there was no evidence the federal legislation was arbitrary.here,there is no issue of federal legislation.the other case,city of roseville norton d,at pages through city of roseville,also involved federal legislation.there,two california cities challenged the federal secretary of the interior decision,under federal legislation to restore land to indians,to take a parcel of land into trust for an indian tribe for the purpose of operating a casino.the district of columbia district court rejected the cities argument that,in the absence of express powers granting the federal government authority to set land aside for the purpose of operating a casino in contravention of state law,the taking violated the state tenth amendment powers.the district court said congress had plenary power to deal with indians,and the tenth amendment does not reserve authority over indian affairs to the states.ibid.unlike the city of roseville case,no federal legislation is at issue here.in rejecting the tenth amendment argument,the city of roseville case did state that congress power to deal with indians stems from the constitution itself.citation.id.at.however,the cited case,morton mancari at pages through,d morton,which held federal legislation granting indians an employment preference in the bureau of indian affairs bia did not constitute impermissible discrimination against,merely said,the plenary power of congress to deal with the special problems of indians is drawn both explicitly and implicitly from the constitution itself.article i,cl,provides congress with the power to regulate commerce with the indian tribes,and thus,to this extent,singles indians out as a proper subject for separate legislation.article ii,cl,gives the president the power,by and with the advice and consent of the senate,to make treaties.this has often been the source of the government power to deal with the indian tribes.the court has described the origin and nature of the special relationship 
in the exercise of the war and treaty powers,the united states overcame the indians and took possession of their lands,sometimes by force,leaving them dependent people,needing protection of necessity,the united states assumed the duty of furnishing that protection,and with it the authority to do all that was required to perform that obligation and to prepare the indians to take their place as independent,qualified members of the modern body politic citations.literally every piece of legislation dealing with indian tribes and reservations,and certainly all legislation dealing with the bia,single out for special treatment a constitutuency of tribal indians living on or near reservations.morton,supra,d,italics added.thus,neither morton nor city of roseville stands for the proposition that the doctrine of tribal immunity has a constitutional basis or that the tenth amendment is immaterial to the question of tribal immunity,which is controlled exclusively by federal law.
in a letter filed after completion of briefing,the tribe cites a recent case,carcieri norton d,which held the federal department of the interior acceptance of a parcel of land into trust for the benefit of an indian tribe did not violate the tenth amendment.however,carcieri merely relied upon morton,supra,d and city of roseville,supra,d.as we have explained,those cases have no application here.
we recognize the united states supreme court recently heard oral argument in a case involving indian states lara cir,cert.granted,d.however,lara does not appear to have any bearing on the case before us.in lara,a nonmember indian was prosecuted in a tribal court for public intoxication,resisting arrest and violence against a police officer on an indian reservation.after he was convicted and served his sentence,the federal government sought to prosecute him in federal court for the same offense.the question in lara was whether the federal court prosecution was barred by the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment.the tribal prosecution was pursuant to a federal statute recogniz ing and affirm ing the inherent power of tribes to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all indians.the federal statute was enacted in response to a united states supreme court case holding tribes had lost their inherent sovereign power to prosecute members of other tribes for offenses committed on their reservations.the question in lara,as framed by the department of justice,was whether the federal statute validly restored the tribes sovereign power to prosecute members of other tribes rather than delegating federal prosecutorial power to the tribes such that a federal prosecution following a tribal prosecution for offenses with the same elements was valid under the double jeopardy clause.no such issue is presented in the case before us.
in the case before us,the trial court properly denied the tribe motion to quash service of summons.the trial court has jurisdiction to adjudicate this dispute.
this case confirms the wisdom of justice holmes observation that the life of the law has not been logic it has been experience.holmes,the common law.
disposition 
the tribe petition for a writ of mandate is denied.the parties shall bear their own costs in this writ proceeding.cal.rules of court,rule a.
i respectfully dissent.the issue in this case is a narrow one.the question is whether the fair political practices commission fppc can sue a federally recognized indian tribe to enforce california law regarding the reporting of political campaign contributions and lobbying activities,et the political reform act of political reform act.i conclude that the agua caliente band of cahuilla indians the tribe has a constitutionally derived right of sovereign immunity from suit,and this right is not trumped by california constitutionally derived right to regulate its electoral process through the authority of a lawsuit.as i shall explain,this case does not present the issue of federal common law versus a state unchartered constitutional guarantee of a republican form of government.rather,this case pits the tribe constitutionally derived right of sovereign immunity from suit against california constitutionally derived right to regulate its electoral process,and these two rights can be harmonized here because viable regulatory alternatives to this lawsuit exist.
the majority opinion concludes that the fppc can sue the tribe in state court and therefore denies the tribe petition for writ of mandate.the majority determines that the tribe does not have a federal constitutional right of sovereign immunity because the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity is federal common law and has no foundation in the united states constitution or in any federal statute.the majority concludes,in contrast,that states do have a federal constitutional right to maintain a republican form of government,anchored in the guarantee clause and the tenth amendment,art.iv,amend.the majority reasons that the right to sue to enforce the political reform act is necessary to preserve a republican form of government.therefore,the constitutional right of the state to sue to preserve its republican form of government trumps the common law doctrine of tribal immunity.
the majority fails to recognize that while the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity began as a judicially created doctrine,it is anchored in the united states constitution.therefore,the doctrine has a constitutional basis.
the united state
