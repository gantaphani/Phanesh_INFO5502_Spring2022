this is an appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction in an environmental challenge to a major gold mining project on the side of tenabo in nevada.the mountain has religious significance for indian tribes.
the are the south fork band council of western shoshone of nevada,and other tribes and organizations the tribes.the tribes originally filed this action against the united states department of the interior and its bureau of land management blm after blm issued its final environmental impact statement approving the project.the project developer,barrick cortez,cortez appeared as an intervenor and is also an appellee.
this court denied the tribes emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal,but expedited the briefing and argument of the appeal.the district court opinion is published at south fork band dep t of interior,d,and devotes most of its consideration to claims brought under the religious freedom restoration act rfra.these claims are not pursued on appeal.
before us are claims alleging violations of the federal land policy management act flpma,et,and the national environmental policy act nepa,et.in determining whether a preliminary injunction should issue,we are bound by the supreme court recent opinion in winter natural res.def.council,d.we must decide whether the tribes have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is denied that the balance of the equities tips in their favor and that an injunction is in the public interest.id.at.the tribes must make each of these showings to be entitled to injunctive relief.id.at.
to succeed on the merits of their action under the administrative procedure act,the tribes must show that blm action was arbitrary and capricious or contrary to law.see a see also motor veh.mfrs.ass state farm mut.ins,d.given the thorough consideration of the project impact on the tribes religion in the environmental impact statement eis,which was approved after more than two years of study and consultation with the tribes and with the public,we conclude that the tribes have not satisfied their burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits of their flpma claims.we reverse the denial of injunctive relief on the nepa claims,however,and remand for the entry of an injunction pending preparation of an eis that adequately considers the environmental impact of the extraction of millions of tons of refractory ore,mitigation of the adverse impact on local springs and streams,and the extent of fine particulate emissions.
factual and procedural background 
this appeal concerns a proposed gold mining project in the cortez mining district,located in lander county,nevada on and near tenabo,a western shoshone sacred site.gold mining has been a dominant industry in lander county since the,and the cortez mine has been in operation since.between and,miners identified two new gold sources near cortez existing mining operations.in,cortez submitted a proposal for the cortez hills expansion project,which would extend cortez mining activities to the areas of the deposits.as originally pro posed by cortez,the project would have involved ten years of active mining and up to three years of ore processing,followed by site closure and reclamation.the specific activities cortez proposed included digging a new mine pit adding facilities for cyanide processing adding areas for disposal of approximately billion tons of waste rock upgrading its mine dewatering systems to remove surface and ground water that would otherwise fill the mines and building and operating a conveyor system.the project as originally proposed would have disturbed acres within the project boundary.of the disturbed acreage,acres were public land and acres were private land belonging to cortez.
after cortez proposal was submitted,blm determined that it constituted a major federal action for which nepa required the preparation of an eis,and that the project was also subject to flpma.blm published a notice of intent to prepare an eis in december,and over the following two years,blm studied the potential impacts of the project and consulted with south fork and other local tribes.blm published a draft eis on october,which evaluated five alternatives cortez proposal,three action alternatives not at issue in this appeal,and a alternative in which cortez would continue its current mining activities without further expansion.the draft eis evaluated these alternatives in light of their impacts on geology and minerals water soils vegetation wildlife woodlands range resources paleontology native american cultural resources native american values air quality land use and access recreation social and economic values environmental justice visual resources noise and hazardous materials and solid waste.
after receiving public comments on the draft eis,blm developed and evaluated a fourth action alternative known as the revised cortez hills pit design alternative.described in the final eis feis published on october,this alternative involved smaller expansions to cortez existing mining pits and waste rock disposal areas,a larger under ground mining component,and smaller facilities.
blm record of decision rod,published on november,adopted the revised cortez hills pit design alternative and required cortez to comply with the environmental protection measures described in cortez original proposal and with all mitigation measures listed in the feis.the agency concluded that,with these safeguards,there would be no unnecessary or undue degradation of the public lands,and therefore no violation of flpma.flpma provides in relevant part that agencies such as blm must take action to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation,which is defined as harm to the environment that is either unnecessary to a given project or violates specified environmental protection statutes.see b.
on november,the tribes filed a complaint against the department of the interior and blm in the district of nevada.cortez intervened as a defendant.the tribes moved for a preliminary injunction.after holding a hearing,the district court first issued a denial from the bench and then filed a published opinion denying the injunction on february.see south fork band,wl.
the tribes filed a notice of appeal on february,and a few days later,the district court denied south fork motion for a stay pending appeal.on february,this court denied an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal,but ordered briefing and argument expedited.
discussion 
flpma claims 
the primary claims that the tribes presented in the district court related to the exercise of their religion.the tribes claimed in the main that the project would violate rfra because it would create a substantial burden to the exercise of their religion.rfra prohibits governmental entities from imposing substantial burdens on the exercise of religion,even if such burdens arise from a rule of general applicability,unless the government can demonstrate that the rule is both in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.a b.although the district court agreed with the tribes that they had standing to bring the rfra claim and that rfra applies to the use and management of the government own land,see south fork band,wl,at,the court denied the rfra claims on the merits,concluding that the tribes had not shown there was a likelihood of success of establishing a substantial burden on the exercise of the tribes religion,id.at.the court stressed that the tribes would continue to have access to the areas that were identified during consultation with the tribes as having the most religious significance.the tribes have not appealed the denial of preliminary injunctive relief on the rfra claims.
the tribes do appeal the denial of injunctive relief on a flpma claim that is substantially the same as the rfra claim,but is cast in procedural rather than substantive terms.see norton utah wilderness alliance,d gros ventre tribe united states,cir the flpma is primarily procedural in nature,and it does not provide a private right of action.flpma creates a duty on the part of agencies like blm to take action to prevent unnecessary and undue degradation of the lands.b.for the purposes of this case,unnecessary or undue degradation is defined as any harmful activity that is either not reasonably incident to an approved mining operation or that violates a state or federal law relating to environmental or cultural resource protection.
to support the flpma claim,the tribes rely heavily upon executive order eo,which imposes an obligation on the executive branch to accommodate tribal access and ceremonial use of sacred sites and to avoid physical damage to them.see.may.the district court expressly recognized that blm was required to comply with the executive order.south fork band,wl,at.after reviewing the extensive study that the agency had made of the sacred sites and their uses,however,the court concluded that the tribes failed to show blm conduct of the study was arbitrary,or that blm violated any duty under eo when it found the project would neither harm areas identified during the study as sacred,nor materially affect access to those areas.id.
in this appeal from the denial of injunctive relief,the tribes do not question the sufficiency of blm consultation with its tribal consultants or the adequacy of blm study of the potential effects of the project on the tribes religious uses and practices.the tribes contend that,on the basis of its consultation and study,the blm arbitrarily focused on the specific sites identified during the study.according to the tribes,the blm should have treated the entire mountain as sacred to the tribes.
it is true that the extensive record of consultation with the tribes contains references to the entire mountain as being a sacred site.there are,however,many more specific references to the particular sites on the mountain that are used for religious observance.these significant sites include the top of the mountain,the white cliffs immediately below the top of the mountain,the pediment area of groves on the slope of the mountain,the shoshone wells,and the horse canyon.
in the eis,blm concluded that access to and use of those more discrete sites for cultural and religious observance would not be impeded by the project as approved,and the tribes do not dispute that conclusion.the tribes also do not articulate the manner in which they seek agency accommodation for the entire mountain.eo refers to protecting the ceremonial uses of sacred sites.see.may,agencies shall accommodate access to and ceremonial use of indian sacred sites by indian religious practitioners and avoid adversely affecting the physical integrity of such sacred sites.
not only did the study of the project effects extend over two years,but the eis devoted over seventy pages to its discussion of blm consultation with the tribes concerning their religious practices.as a result of blm consultation and recognition of the need to accommodate religious practices,the original scope of the project was reduced.moreover,and significantly,the eis stated that the blm would continue consulting with the tribes regarding the project impact on their religious practices throughout the life of the project.
we see no basis to disturb the district court conclusion that the tribes failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success in establishing any arbitrary or capricious agency action in relation to blm obligation under eo to accommodate the tribes need for access to and use of religious sites.
the tribes remaining flpma claim is that blm acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to find an unnecessary or undue degradation of scenic resources as a result of the mining operation.according to the record,blm has a system of classifying visual impacts due to mining projects.class i areas are the most highly protected areas,while class iv areas allow the most visual impact.
the areas affected by the mining project in this case were designated by blm as belonging to classes iii and iv.blm determined that some of the mining facilities would satisfy the visual impact standards associated with their particular classification,either during the life of the project or after reclamation of the site.other facilities,however,were deemed unlikely to meet the relevant visual impact standards,but the agency determined that the adverse visual impacts were not significant enough to justify disapproving the project.the tribes fail to point to any relevant action on blm part that was arbitrary or unreasonable.we will not the agency weighing of the compliant and noncompliant visual resource areas in light of its experience and expertise.trout unlimited lohn,cir.we affirm the district court determination that the tribes failed to show a likelihood of succeeding on their flpma claims.
ii.nepa claims 
nepa requires that all federal agencies prepare,for every major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,a detailed statement on the environmental impact of the proposed action.c.an adequate eis is essential to informed agency and informed public participation,without which the environmental objectives of nepa can not be achieved.see a robertson methow valley citizens council,d discussing nepa effort to infuse a broad national commitment to protecting and promoting environmental quality into the ongoing programs and actions of the federal government.
ore transportation 
the tribes claim blm violated nepa by failing to analyze the air quality impacts of the transportation of ore to an processing facility.blm estimates in the eis that this mine expansion will make five million tons of refractory ore available for extraction.it will be transported miles to the goldstrike facility for processing,in two shipments per day,every day,for ten years.the processing of that refractory ore will result in the release of some quantity of mercury,a hazardous air pollutant.the transport of the ore,the tribes allege,will negatively impact air quality.blm now maintains,nonetheless,that these environmental impacts need not be discussed in the eis,because no increase in the rate of toxic ore shipments is proposed,and the facility is permitted under the clean air act.
the air quality impacts associated with transport and processing of the five million tons of refractory ore are prime examples of indirect effects that nepa requires be considered.the council on environmental quality regulations define indirect effects as those caused by the action,and later in time or further removed in distance,but still reasonably foreseeable.b.an agency must consider them.b.
blm is incorrect in asserting that these effects need not be considered simply because no change in the rate of shipping and processing is forecast.that may be so,but the mine expansion will create ten additional years of such transportation that is,ten years of environmental impacts that would not be present in the scenario.
moreover,even on a basis,there has been no consideration of the environmental impact of the transportation and processing of the refractory ore.blm argument to the contrary depends on the assumption that,because processing is ongoing,these impacts must have been analyzed in a nepa document already.but that assumption is baseless there is no indication that these impacts were properly considered at any time,even on a basis.
appellees make several arguments in defense of the omission.first,cortez asserts that the mercury impacts are discussed in the eis,citing a map that shows aggregated mercury emissions from all gold mines in the state as a percentage of total mercury emissions.a close examination of the eis belies the claim.the eis does not indicate that blm accounted for the mercury emissions of the separately owned,goldstrike facility in preparing this analysis in any event,the cited figure sheds no light on the specific effect at environmental impact of processing ore from this project.see wildlands center blm,cir holding that a general discussion of an environmental problem across a large area did not satisfy nepa.
in the alternative,cortez asserts that the draft eis for a different mine betze pit blm responsibilities und
