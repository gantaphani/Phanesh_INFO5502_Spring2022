the district court did not err when it declined to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,because the government sufficiently proved that the victims were indians within the meaning of.we further hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to require that the jury return a special verdict form,because the district court sufficiently explained its decision not to require a special verdict instructed the jury that it must unanimously reject miguel angel ramirez theory in order to find ramirez guilty and ensured that the jury understood that the government bore the burden of disproving ramirez defense.the district court also did not plainly err by referring the jury back to the original jury instructions,in response to the jury question about specific intent,because ramirez agreed that no supplemental instruction should be given,and the instructions already addressed the jury question.lastly,under the plain error standard,ramirez right to a fair trial was not violated by the prosecutor compelling ramirez to call other witnesses liars,because ramirez has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the admission of his testimony or that the prosecutor actions constituted a miscarriage of justice.we have jurisdiction under.we affirm.
background 
ramirez lived in the home of teresa valenzuela teresa,teresa mother,dolores valenzuela dolores,and teresa father and brother,on the tohono indian reservation reservation in arizona.on april,the valenzuela family discovered that ramirez had been using dolores debit card to steal money from her bank account.the valenzuela family immediately asked ramirez to leave the home 
during the course of the week following ramirez departure from the valenzuela home,ramirez telephoned teresa multiple times per day.one evening,ramirez entered the valenzuela home using a house key he had been given and teresa bedroom as she slept.dolores,upset by the incident,purchased new locks for the home.the new locks,however,were not the correct size and were never installed.
on april,dolores and teresa went to the bank and discovered nearly in recent unauthorized withdrawals from dolores account.as a result,dolores filed a fraud report with her bank.while teresa and dolores were in the bank reporting the fraud,ramirez again telephoned teresa.teresa told him that dolores was reporting the theft.dolores also spoke to ramirez and told him that she would be pursuing criminal charges.ramirez admitted to dolores that he had stolen over from her,but promised to pay her back.
on the morning of april,ramirez returned to the valenzuela home.ramirez was aware that teresa father and brother were not at the valenzuela home that morning.the parties dispute what occurred after his arrival.ramirez description of what occurred after his arrival is vastly different from that of teresa and dolores.ramirez testified that he returned to the house to retrieve the car keys to an inoperable vehicle that he had left there.when he arrived at the house,he knocked several times on the front door.because no one answered,he began to open the door with the house key that was in his possession.before he was able to open the door with his key,dolores opened it for him and admitted him into the home to retrieve his vehicle keys.while ramirez talked with teresa,dolores attacked him from behind with a kitchen knife.ramirez pulled out his butterfly knife and fought off dolores in.
teresa and dolores,however,testified that they awoke on april,to the sound of their dog barking.as they met in the living room,dolores and teresa heard the sound of a key turning real slowly in the front door lock.dolores went to the front door as it was opening and blocked it with her body.ramirez was standing at the door and asked if he could come inside.according to dolores and teresa,dolores refused to let ramirez inside and threatened to call the police.ramirez,however,forced the door dolores backwards.ramirez then began stabbing dolores repeatedly with a knife,after which he began to stab teresa.dolores attempted to place her body between teresa and ramirez in an attempt to protect teresa and made several attempts to grab the knife out of ramirez hand.teresa testified that dolores screamed for teresa to get out of the house and to get help.teresa was able to escape to a neighbor house and waited there for the paramedics to arrive.
at some point during the struggle,dolores grabbed a knife and stabbed ramirez in the throat,causing him to immediately fall down.dolores again stabbed ramirez in the throat and then left the house.when the police arrived,they found ramirez on the floor.
a federal grand jury indicted ramirez on two counts of assault with intent to commit murder on an indian reservation,in violation of a and,and two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm on an indian reservation,in violation of a and.
at trial,the treating trauma surgeon an expert as to trauma surgery and trauma service testified that teresa had been stabbed at least times,including multiple stab wounds to her chest,abdomen,back,arms,and right hand.the trauma surgeon also testified that dolores had been stabbed at least times,and had multiple wounds inflicted to her face,jaw,chest,abdomen,back,underarm,and the web spacing between her fingers.the trauma surgeon also indicated that the wounds on dolores hands suggest ed someone trying to defend them self from a stab by trying to grab the knife away.a forensic pathologist testified that,in his expert opinion,the wounds suffered by both dolores and teresa were consistent with a person defending herself.testimony at trial also established that ramirez had far fewer injuries than teresa or dolores.ramirez had multiple stab wounds in the neck,had five stab wounds on his upper back,and may have had one on his arm.
ramirez called a dna expert,who testified regarding the blood found on the knives recovered from the crime scene.the dna expert testified that ramirez blood was only identified on one of the knives.she also testified that the major contributor of the blood samples on two of the knives was dolores,and that the major contributor of the blood sample on the knife ramirez admittedly brought into the home with him was teresa.
at the close of the government,ramirez moved for a judgment of acquittal,primarily arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the victims were indians.the district court denied the motion.at the close of all testimony,ramirez renewed his motion,which the district court again denied.
before the case went to the jury,ramirez requested that the jury be provided with a special verdict form to ensure unanimity regarding ramirez affirmative defense that he acted in.the district court declined to include a special verdict form and instead added the language with you all agreeing to the instruction as recommended by the commentary to ninth circuit model jury instruction.the district court found that a special verdict form would be inappropriate because it might impermissibly shift the burden of proof on that issue to ramirez.
after the jury was instructed and began deliberating,the jury submitted a question to the district court,asking,what constitutes specific intent to commit murder all parties agreed that the existing jury instruction,which followed ninth circuit model jury instruction for assault with intent to commit murder,adequately addressed the jury question,and that the jury should be referred to the original jury instructions.ramirez counsel explicitly noted that the ninth circuit model jury instructions state that specific intent is not defined and recommended that the district court tell the jury that the court can not provide you with such a definition.
on june,the jury convicted ramirez on all charged counts.after the jury guilty verdict,ramirez filed a motion for judgment of acquittal and new trial.although ramirez had concurred with the district court answer to the jury question at the time,ramirez motion argued that the court should have provided the jury with a specific intent definition.
at the september,hearing on the motion,ramirez repeated his argument regarding the definition of specific intent and contended,for the first time,that the jury question indicated that the evidence was insufficient to establish his intent to commit murder for purposes of counts one and three the district court rejected these arguments.
the district court additionally rejected ramirez untimely motion for judgment of acquittal on counts one and three,finding that the evidence of ramirez intent to murder dolores and teresa was overwhelming.accordingly,the district court denied ramirez motions for a new trial and for a judgment of acquittal.
ii.standards of review 
we review de novo the district court determination of indian status under because it is a mixed question of law and fact.united states bruce,cir.we also review de novo the denial of a motion to acquit for insufficient evidence.see united states hardy,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,we must determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.see jackson virginia,d.
we review a district court formulation of jury instructions for abuse of discretion.see united states shipsey,cir.we also review a district court decision to use a special verdict form for abuse of discretion.see united states reed,cir.jury instructions,even if imperfect,are not a basis for overturning a conviction absent a showing that they prejudiced the defendant.united states frega,cir.
we ordinarily review a district court response to a jury question for abuse of discretion.see united states,cir.we review the district court response to the jury question in this case for plain error,however,because ramirez did not object to the court decision to refer the jury back to its original jury instructions.see united states mciver,cir.
because ramirez did not object to the prosecutor questions regarding the veracity of other witnesses,instead raising the issue of alleged trial error for the first time on appeal,we review only for plain error.see.b united states olano,d.under the plain error standard,relief is not warranted unless there has been error,that was plain,and that affected substantial rights.see united states recio,cir.under the third limitation of the plain error standard,the error must have been prejudicial it must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.olano,at.rule b normally requires that we make the same kind of inquiry,with one important difference it is the defendant rather than the government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.id.if those conditions are met,we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if the prosecutor actions,viewed in the context of the entire trial seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings,or where failing to reverse a conviction would result in a miscarriage of justice.united states geston,cir quoting united states tanh huu lam,cir.
iii.discussion 
a.the district court jurisdiction under 
ramirez argues that the district court should have dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because there was insufficient evidence that the victims were indians within the meaning of.he contends that the documents produced at trial failed to establish that the victims had ever completed the application process and become certified members of the tohono nation nation.ramirez argues that the documents were simply applications to join the nation and did not meet the standard of a certified tribal enrollment roster.we disagree.
section provides for the prosecution of crimes committed in indian country by against indians.united states keys,cir citation omitted.while the term indian has not been statutorily defined,t he generally accepted test for indian status considers the degree of indian blood and tribal or government recognition as an indian.bruce,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the first prong requires some indian blood.id.thus,evidence of a parent,grandparent,or who is clearly identified as an indian is generally sufficient to satisfy this prong.id.
the second prong requires evidence that the native american has a sufficient link to a formerly sovereign people.id.at citation omitted.courts analyzing this prong have considered evidence of tribal enrollment government recognition formally and informally through receipt of assistance reserved only to indians enjoyment of the benefits of tribal affiliation and social recognition as an indian through residence on a reservation and participation in indian social life.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the district court correctly found that the government presented sufficient evidence of dolores and teresa status as indians.first,both dolores and teresa testified that they were members of the nation,and that they resided in the san xavier district,which is part of the nation.teresa testified that dolores had enrolled her in the nation when she was a child.as a result of her enrollment,she was given a tribal identification card stating that she is a member of the nation.second,dolores and teresa presented certificates of final determination of approval by tohono nation of application for enrollment.both certificates noted the dates when the applications for enrollment were submitted,the dates when the hearings on the applications were held,and the tohono council council determination that both were eligible for enrollment as a member of the tohono nation.the council also made a final determination of approval on both certificates and ordered that dolores and teresa names be placed upon the membership roll of the nation.
lastly,the director of membership services for the nation explained to the jury that san xavier is located within the reservation,and that an individual must be a member of the nation to reside on the reservation and receive a tribal identification card.the director noted that enrollment in the nation was based on lineage and descendancy.an applicant therefore had to prove that he or she was a descendant of another member of the nation.after examining both dolores and teresa certificates,the director stated that both women were enrolled members of the nation.
thus,the evidence was sufficient to establish both dolores and teresa status as indians within the meaning of.see bruce,at duro reina,cir,rev on other grounds,d.accordingly,we hold that the district court correctly ruled that it had jurisdiction to hear the case.
ramirez request for a special verdict form 
ramirez contends that the district court abused its discretion by not requiring the jury to return a special verdict form stating that the jury unanimously agreed that ramirez did not act in.we disagree.
although there is no per se prohibition,a s a rule,special verdicts in criminal trials are not favored.reed,at quoting united states,cir brackets in original.this rule is fashioned to protect the rights of criminal defendants by preventing the court from pressuring the jury to convict.id.whether or not it is appropriate to use a special verdict should be determined according to the particular circumstances of each case.id.quoting,at brackets in original.we noted in reed that v erdict forms are,in essence,instructions to the jury.id.
the district court appropriately instructed the jury that it must unanimously reject ramirez theory in order to find ramirez guilty.united states southwell,cir noting that t he failure to properly instruct the jury on the unanimity requirement was constitutional error.the district court included a specific unanimity instruction within the instruction,stating that t he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt,with all of you agreeing,that the defendant did not act in reasonable.that instruction conformed with both ninth circuit model jury instruction and ninth circuit model jury instruction specific issue unanimity.the unanimity requirement was unambiguous,southwell,at discussing how t he jury could reasonably have read the unanimity instructions one of two ways and that referring the jury back to the instructions did nothing to clear up the ambiguity,and the instruction
