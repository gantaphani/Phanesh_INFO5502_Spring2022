in march the south dakota department of social services dss removed and her siblings,and fianna,from the custody of their parents,sherman peneaux and juanita swalley,based on allegations that peneaux had abused fianna.at that time was three years old,and was two.the children were placed in the spotted tail crisis center,and subsequently reported that peneaux had sexually abused her and extinguished a cigarette on her body.made the statements to tribal police investigator grace her many horses,forensic investigator lora hawkins,child care case worker zane mcclarnnan,pediatrician lori strong,and two different foster parents,edith connot and penny norris.
in march,peneaux was indicted on four counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child under the age of twelve,c counts,one count of assault with a dangerous weapon,a count v,and one count of assault resulting in serious bodily injury,a count vi.
the case went to trial in september,and the government called tribal investigator grace her many horses after other witnesses had provided background information.she testified without objection about statements made during an interview with her.she reported that told her that she had been sexually and physically abused.then the government called to the stand her testimony was inconsistent.on direct examination denied that peneaux had abused her,but acknowledged that she had previously told people that she had been sexually abused.the prosecutor presented her with drawings of a naked man and woman and asked her to mark the part of peneaux body which had touched her and the part of her body which peneaux had touched.circled the genital region and anus on both the male and female diagrams.when she was asked to identify the areas she had marked,she called them the and butt.without objection the diagrams were received into evidence as exhibits.was also asked how she received the burn mark on her stomach.she responded that peneaux had inflicted it with a lit cigarette,but she denied he had ever burned her when questioned by defense counsel.
the government called other individuals with whom had spoken prior to trial.zane mcclarnnan,an employee of the spotted tail crisis center,testified that told him that my dad likes to undress me and would lay on top of me.stepmother,juanita swalley,was asked about statements she had made to the fbi and whether she had disclosed that told her daddy was doing loving to me and other similar comments.swalley answered that she could not remember precisely what she had told the agents,but she acknowledged that she had signed the statement she gave to the fbi.the defense did not object to the testimony of either of these witnesses.
foster parent edith connot testified to an incident she had observed at her home.she saw under her kitchen table touching the genitals of her four year old son.when connot explained that such behavior was inappropriate,replied that her father touched her in that way.again there was no objection by the defense.other foster parent,penny norris,testified that she saw many little white marks on body.told her that peneaux had burned her with his cigarettes when norris asked if she had been bitten by bugs.norris also testified to statements made by,brother,that peneaux had also burned him with a cigarette.no objection was raised to any of this testimony.the defense did object to testimony norris gave about a conversation she had with allison during a wellness check of which she had arranged after learning that peneaux might have physically and sexually abused the child.norris reported that allison had remarked that the circular marks on could be cigarette burns.
the government next called forensic investigator lora hawkins,who testified to statements had made during two separate interviews.hawkins testified that during the first interview told her that my daddy gets on top of me,that my daddy touches my,and that he wanted her to touch by his.hawkins also testified that when asked where peneaux had touched her,grabbed her crotch.hawkins further testified that during their second interview,consistently presented the same information and told her that peneaux had touched her genitals both with his fingers and his penis and that he had tried to penetrate her anus with his penis.not only did the defense not object to hawkins testimony,it offered to introduce the video recordings of these interviews into evidence if the government did not.peneaux counsel also had written transcripts of the videos made and entered them into evidence.
lora strong,a pediatrician who examined both and her brother,was another government witness.she testified about statements indicating that peneaux had abused her sexually and physically and about her own physical findings.when strong asked whether anyone had touched her where she goes pee from,responded yes.when asked who had done it,she stated sherman.when asked where peneaux hurt her,pointed to her genital area.when asked about her circular scar,replied sherman hurt me.when asked how,she answered burn with cigarette.
although the defense did not object to strong testimony about,it did object to her testimony about brother,no grounds were given for the objection,and it was overruled.strong then testified that had a circular scar on his right knee which was similar to the one found on.she also testified that when she asked how he got hurt,he responded burn.when asked what that meant,he answered sherman and sherman hurt.
the final government witness was fbi agent william grode,who interviewed peneaux while he was awaiting trial.grode testified that peneaux admitted that he sometimes slept in the nude and that his children often got into bed with him and that would snuggle up to him.
the defense called witnesses who testified that they never saw peneaux sexually or physically abuse or his other children.the assistant to health care provider testified that had been examined numerous times before she was removed from her parents custody and nothing in her records indicated she had been burned.no physical evidence indicating sexual abuse had been reported,and strong had noted that her genitals were normal for her age.although the mark on her stomach was consistent with the possibility of a cigarette burn,strong admitted something else could have caused it.betty kallinger,a physician assistant at the horizon health care mission where was often treated,testified that medical records did not indicate that she had been burned and that the scar could have resulted from an infected sore.
at the conclusion of the government case the defense moved for a judgment of acquittal which was denied.the defense again moved for judgment of acquittal at the conclusion of all the evidence the court reserved ruling on the motion and submitted the case to the jury.the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts,and the defense moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and alternatively for a new trial.both motions were denied.peneaux appeals,arguing that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions and that the district court abused its discretion by admitting statements which were hearsay and which violated his constitutional right to confrontation.
peneaux argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction,in large part because prior out of court statements should not have been admitted and can not be considered as substantive evidence.in reviewing his sufficiency argument we consider the same quantum of evidence that was considered by the trial court in determining whether a motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted,even if some of the evidence is later determined to be inadmissible.united states kenyon,cir see also lockhart nelson,d united states cruz,cir united states alexander.we thus start by considering all the evidence.although evidentiary errors will sometimes require a new trial,the issue on a motion for judgment of acquittal is whether the evidence at trial was sufficient to support a conviction.kenyon,at.in considering whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain peneaux conviction we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,resolving conflicts in the government favor,and accepting all reasonable inferences that support the verdict and will only reverse the conviction if we find that no reasonable jury could have found him guilty.united states washington,cir.
peneaux complains that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction on all counts.peneaux was convicted on counts for sexual abuse of a child under the age of twelve.c.peneaux argues that contradicted these charges by denying the abuse ever occurred and that medical evidence established that genitals showed no signs of sexual trauma.the government produced many witnesses who confirmed that said she had been sexually abused by peneaux.it also provided a logical explanation,through strong testimony,as to why genitals may not have been damaged or scarred by the abuse.
peneaux challenge hinges on the credibility of the various witnesses.credibility is the province of the jury,kenyon,at,and we resolve any conflicts in favor of the jury verdict.united states goodlow,cir.while there was conflicting testimony,we find after reviewing the entire record that a jury could have reasonably determined that peneaux was guilty on counts and we affirm the district court denial of the motion for acquittal on these counts.
as to count v charging assault with a dangerous weapon,peneaux complains that the government did not prove that the cigarette was a dangerous weapon under a because it failed to show that a burn could endanger life or cause serious bodily harm.the issue of whether a cigarette constitutes a dangerous weapon is a question of fact for the jury,and its verdict will not be lightly overturned.united states phelps,cir.to sustain a conviction under a,the government must have presented sufficient evidence that appellant assaulted the victim with an object capable of inflicting bodily injury,not that the victim actually suffered bodily injury as a result of the assault.united states lecompte,cir.such innocuous objects as pool sticks,united states guilbert,cir,and chairs united states johnson,cir,have been found to constitute dangerous weapons in certain circumstances,and we have no doubt that extinguishing a lit cigarette on the body of a three year old child could inflict serious bodily harm.we conclude that the government has satisfied its burden.
as to count vi charging assault resulting in serious bodily injury,peneaux argues that the alleged burn on torso does not meet the definition of serious bodily injury under b incorporating the definition provided in h,but that it is merely a bodily injury under h.appellant apparently overlooks the fact that the definition of serious bodily injury includes both extreme physical pain and protracted and obvious disfigurement.h b c.the government offered testimony from strong that the scar on abdomen was consistent with a cigarette burn,pictures of it were introduced into evidence,and the jury heard testimony from various individuals indicating that peneaux had caused the scar by burning with a cigarette.determining whether an injury is serious is an issue for the jury to decide based on its common understanding of the term,united states two eagle,cir,and we find it entirely reasonable for a jury to conclude from the evidence that burning a three year old with a lit cigarette would cause extreme physical pain or obvious disfigurement constituting serious bodily injury under h b c.both the government and peneaux made their respective arguments to the jury the jury weighed the evidence and found against peneaux.
finally,peneaux challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for counts v and vi.peneaux argues that the government failed to prove he inflicted any burn.on direct examination stated that peneaux had burned her with his cigarette,and her out of court statements about this were confirmed by numerous government witnesses.the jury also saw photographs of the scar and heard medical testimony that the circular scar on was consistent in shape and diameter to ones inflicted by a cigarette.based on the record before us,we find that a reasonable jury could have found peneaux guilty and we affirm the district court denial of peneaux motion for acquittal on counts.
peneaux complains that the district court improperly admitted prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence.he devotes much of his brief to arguing that unsworn prior inconsistent statements can not be admitted as substantive evidence under rule d a.the government does not refute this argument,but instead contends that these statements were properly admitted in this case as substantive evidence under rule,the residual exception to the hearsay rule,and rule,the exception for statements related to medical diagnosis or treatment.peneaux cites no authority for the proposition that a jury can not consider residual hearsay as substantive evidence,and we have repeatedly allowed the admission of residual hearsay testimony for that purpose.united states dorian,cir united states renville,cir.if the testimony was properly admitted,it may be considered as substantive evidence,and the district court was not obligated to tell the jury it could not consider inconsistent statements as substantive evidence.
in order for testimony to be admissible under rule there must be a showing that the statement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness to the other hearsay exceptions the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts the general purposes of the rules and the interests of justice will best be served by its admission and adequate notice must be given to the opposing party.see.united states balfany,cir.we review the district court determination of admissibility of residual hearsay testimony for abuse of discretion.united states thunder horse,cir.where the defendant has failed to preserve the error for appeal,however,we review the admission of evidence only for plain error.united states carter,cir.
peneaux complains that out of court statements to zane mcclarnnan,penny norris,juanita swalley,and lora hawkins should not have been admitted under rule.he argues that prior inconsistent unsworn statements are not evidence of a material fact and can not be more probative than the victim own testimony.according to him,admission of such statements is contrary to the congressional intent limiting the use of statements admitted under rule.because peneaux did not object to this testimony during trial we review its admission only for plain error.in order to establish plain error,a party must demonstrate an error,that is plain,and which affects substantial rights.if those elements are met,we will not reverse unless the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states olano,d.
in this case there is no issue about adequate notice under rule.well before trial the government complied with the rule by filing notice of its intent to introduce prior out of court statements through the testimony of zane mcclarnnan,penny norris,lora hawkins,and juanita swalley.the notice also provided information about the nature of the statements or where they could be located,along with the names,addresses,and phone numbers of the witnesses.the defense made no response or objection to the notice,and it did not object at trial to the admission of out of court statements through the testimony of these witnesses.
although peneaux has not argued that these statements are untrustworthy,we nevertheless consider the issue,for as the trustworthiness of a statement i
