this case is yet another of the difficult indian jurisdiction cases considered by this court.the precise question presented is whether there is colorable tribal court jurisdiction over a nonmember federal trademark and related state law claims against tribal defendants for alleged passing off of cigarettes on the internet,on the reservation of another tribe,and elsewhere.philip morris usa,manufactures and markets marlboro cigarettes,one of the most recognized brands in the united states.king mountain tobacco company,a tribal corporation on the yakama indian reservation,along with delbert wheeler,and richard kip ramsey,company founders and members of the tribe collectively,king mountain,sell king mountain cigarettes in packaging that philip morris claims infringes and dilutes its trademarks and trade dress.
we are faced with dueling lawsuits.philip morris sued king mountain in federal court,alleging various federal and state law claims and seeking,among other things,injunctive relief against king mountain continued sale of its products.king mountain followed with an action for declaratory relief against philip morris in yakama tribal court,which prompted philip morris to seek an injunction in federal court against the tribal proceedings.king mountain asked the district court to stay its proceedings pending the tribal court determination of its jurisdiction.
the district court granted king mountain requested stay,concluding there was a colorable claim to tribal court jurisdiction under the formulations found in montana united states,d,strate contractors,d,and nevada hicks,d.we agree that these cases provide the foundation for our analysis,but we disagree that they point to a colorable claim of jurisdiction.rather,we conclude that the tribal court does not have colorable jurisdiction over nonmember philip morris federal and state claims for trademark infringement on the internet and beyond the reservation.
factual backgroundand prior proceedings 
philip morris,the maker of cigarettes,claims that marlboro is the most and brand of cigarettes.philip morris sells marlboro cigarettes throughout the united states and the world,including to stores on the yakama reservation.philip morris contracts directly with some of these stores,while others obtain its products through distributors.
delbert wheeler and richard kip ramsey are both enrolled members of the yakama indian nation.together they own mountain tobacco company,king mountain tobacco company,which is a corporation that was formed and licensed under the laws of the yakama indian nation in.king mountain began selling cigarettes to stores on the yakama reservation in early,and shortly thereafter to members of other indian tribes,including the onodaga nation and seneca tribe in new york,via phone and mail orders.king mountain cigarettes are also sold to the general public via the internet,through websites such as www.cheap cig.com and www.smoke.com,but king mountain denies that it markets its cigarettes on the internet or sells directly to those that do.there is no contractual or other relationship between king mountain and philip morris.
philip morris marlboro packaging bears a distinctive red roof design,featuring two red triangles filling the top corners of its otherwise white package such that there is a white peak with red above it.king mountain cigarette packages feature an image of a snowcovered mountain against a red backdrop.several aspects of philip morris package design are registered with the united states patent and trademark office the uspto.registration and.
philip morris claims that the appearance of king mountain packaging is a close copy or imitation of its marlboro packaging such that consumers are both actually and likely to be confused,that philip morris marlboro trademark is infringed and diluted,and alleges that its reputation is tarnished.king mountain,on the other hand,argues that its packaging depicts as pahto in the yakama mountain of spiritual and cultural significance to the yakama tribe and that any resemblance to philip morris packaging is inadvertent and incidental.king mountain applied to register its package design but the uspto refused registration,citing two of philip morris registrations.
philip morris filed suit against king mountain in federal district court,alleging violations of the lanham act and washington state law.the amended complaint includes claims for trademark infringement,trade dress infringement,trademark dilution,and unfair competition.king mountain responded by filing an action for declaratory relief in the yakama tribal court,claiming that philip morris had come upon the reservation to do business without permission of the yakama indian nation,was not licensed thereby,and in so doing submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the yakama tribal court.king mountain sought a declaration that it was not infringing philip morris trademark and trade dress and further alleged that philip morris actions violated the yakama treaty of.once it received notice of this tribal court action,philip morris sought an injunction in federal court against those proceedings.
in response to philip morris effort to enjoin king mountain continued use of its packaging,king mountain argued that philip morris had failed to exhaust tribal remedies,and that it had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of the lanham act claims.the district court denied philip morris requested injunctions and granted king mountain motion to stay the federal case to allow the tribal court to address its own jurisdiction.the district court reasoned,relying on stock west taylor,cir en banc,that abstention is appropriate where there exists a colorable question whether the tribal court has jurisdiction over the asserted claims.the court framed the question as whether the yakama indian nation could regulate the activities at issue in this case and concluded that i t is not clear that the tribe would not have regulatory authority over trademarks the court also concluded that it is not clear whether tribal courts have adjudicative authority to address trademark claims against tribal members whose conduct occurred on reservation lands.in light of these uncertainties,the district court held there was a colorable question of the existence of tribal court jurisdiction over the case.
on appeal from this order,philip morris argues that the court improperly denied its motions for injunctions and erred in granting king mountain motion to stay the district court proceedings.we have jurisdiction under a to review the order denying these injunctions and granting the motion to stay the proceedings.agcaoili gustafson,cir holding that jurisdiction over appeal from grant of motion to stay is proper under a.
tribal jurisdiction cases are not easily encapsulated,nor do they lend themselves to simplified analysis.the supreme court itself observed that questions of jurisdiction over indians and indian country are a complex patchwork of federal,state,and tribal law.duro reina,d.and we have acknowledged that t here is no simple test for determining whether tribal court jurisdiction exists.stock west,confederated tribes of the colville reservation,cir.despite these complications,the answer to the tribal jurisdiction question in this case can be divined in a logical fashion from the teachings of three supreme court cases montana,strate,and hicks.these teachings are affirmed in important respects by the court most recent tribal jurisdiction decision in plains commerce bank long family land cattle,d.
these cases provide the foundation for the following guiding principles.in considering tribal jurisdiction,we look first to the member or nonmember status of the unconsenting party,which is,in this case,philip morris,a nonmember.hicks,at.souter,concurring it is the membership status of the unconsenting party,not the status of real property,that counts as the primary jurisdictional fact.as to nonmembers a tribe adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative jurisdiction.strate,at.
apart from treaties,there are two potential sources of tribal jurisdiction a tribe inherent sovereignty and congressional statutory grant.in general,the inherent sovereign powers of an indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.montana,at.this restriction is subject to two exceptions the first exception relates to nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members the second concerns activity that directly affects the tribe political integrity,economic security,health,or welfare.strate,at.
if neither of the montana exceptions is applicable,we consider whether such regulatory jurisdiction has been congressionally conferred.hicks,at.tribal courts are not,however,courts of general jurisdiction,and a mere failure to affirmatively preclude tribal jurisdiction in a statute does not amount to a congressional expansion of tribal jurisdiction.id.at.the historical and constitutional assumption of concurrent jurisdiction over cases is completely missing with respect to tribal courts tribal courts,it should be clear,can not be courts of general jurisdiction in this sense.finally,tribal jurisdiction is,of course,cabined by geography the jurisdiction of tribal courts does not extend beyond tribal boundaries.atkinson trading shirley,d.
taking these principles together,we conclude that the yakama tribal court does not have colorable jurisdiction over king mountain tribal action for declaratory relief insofar as it implicates philip morris federal trademark infringement claims against king mountain and its principals,members of the yakama tribe.thus,exhaustion would serve no purpose other than delay.strate,at.to understand the basis for this conclusion beyond the summary principles cited above,it is useful to begin with an explication of the supreme court decision in montana and trace its application through strate and hicks.
i.the montana rule and its progeny 
in montana,in considering a tribe authority to impose hunting and fishing restrictions on nonmembers within the reservation,the supreme court examined the scope of tribes legislative power stemming from their inherent sovereignty,and found it narrowly limited with respect to nonmembers.the exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal or to control internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes,and so can not survive without express congressional delegation.montana,at.from this observation,the court deduced the general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.id.at.
to be sure,the court noted,indian tribes retain inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over on their reservations,even on fee lands.id.first,a tribe may regulate,through taxation,licensing,or other means,the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members,through commercial dealing,contracts,leases,or other arrangements.id.citing williams lee,d,and other cases.second,a tribe may also retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of on fee lands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity,the economic security,or the health or welfare of the tribe.id.at.again citing williams,d,and other cases.outside of these two exceptions,as the court emphasized in montana,the tribes inherent sovereignty does not give them jurisdiction to regulate the activities of nonmembers.see plains commerce bank.at given montana s general proposition that the inherent sovereign powers of an indian tribe do not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe,efforts by a tribe to regulate nonmembers,especially on fee land,are presumptively invalid.internal quotations and citations omitted.
while delineating the scope of tribes regulatory jurisdiction over nonmembers,montana did not directly address the scope of tribes adjudicatory jurisdiction.the supreme court turned to the question of tribal adjudicative jurisdiction sixteen years later in strate.strate arose out of a traffic accident between two nonmembers that occurred on a state highway running through the reservation.in support of tribal court jurisdiction,the plaintiff argued that montana did not apply,because it only addressed the regulatory jurisdiction of tribes,not their adjudicatory jurisdiction.in rejecting this argument,the court noted that w hile montana immediately involved regulatory authority,the court broadly addressed the concept of inherent sovereignty.strate,at.quoting montana,at.as to nonmembers,it held that a tribe adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative jurisdiction.absent congressional direction enlarging jurisdiction,we adhere to that understanding.subject to controlling provisions in treaties and statutes,and the two exceptions identified in montana,the civil authority of indian tribes and their courts with respect to fee lands generally do es not extend to the activities of nonmembers of the tribe.id.quoting montana,at.alteration in original.while leaving open whether tribes adjudicative jurisdiction over nonmembers is narrower than the legislative jurisdiction delineated inmontana,the court made clear in strate that it is,at least,no broader.
finally,in hicks,the court confronted the issue of tribal adjudicative jurisdiction over nonmembers stemming not from the tribe inherent sovereignty,the focus of montana,but from a congressional grant.the plaintiff in hicks was a tribal member who sued nonmember state officials under a federal statute.after concluding the tribal court did not have jurisdiction arising from its inherent sovereignty under the montana framework,the court addressed the argument that tribal courts are courts of general jurisdiction and thus fully capable of adjudicating claims.the court firmly rejected this position,reasoning that the historical and constitutional assumption of concurrent jurisdiction over cases is completely missing with respect to tribal courts.hicks,at.it then turned to whether the federal statute gave the tribe jurisdiction it is true that some statutes proclaim jurisdiction over certain questions of federal law but no provision in federal law provides for jurisdiction over actions.id.at.the court went on to note that tribal jurisdiction over suits would be problematic,because the federal removal statute did not provide for removal from tribal court,which would deny those sued in tribal court the right to a federal forum that they would otherwise enjoy.id.at.
from these three foundational supreme court cases,we can discern the ground rules governing tribal adjudicatory jurisdiction over nonmembers.as a general rule,tribes do not have jurisdiction,either legislative or adjudicative,over nonmembers,and tribal courts are not courts of general jurisdiction.nevertheless,stemming from their inherent sovereignty,tribes do have legislative jurisdiction within the two montana exceptions.the montana framework is applicable to tribal adjudicative jurisdiction,which extends no further than the montana exceptions.beyond the jurisdiction they enjoy from their inherent sovereignty,tribes may also be granted jurisdiction via treaty or congressional statute.
ii.application of tribal jurisdiction principles 
a.the montana exceptions 
the evolution of the supreme court jurisprudence leaves us with the firm conclusion that we should begin our analysis under montana.while it is unclear whether meeting the montana exceptions is sufficient for tribal court is,whether tribal adjudicative jurisdiction extends to the boundary of tribal legislative have no doubt that it is necessary.
king mountain,however,argues that montana is not applicable to this case,either in its general rule or its exceptions.rather,king mountain takes the position that montana only applies to suits involving the activities of nonmembers,suits with nonmember defendants,whereas king mountain tribal action for declaratory relief effectively involves a tribal member defending the lawfulness of its activities against the claims of a nonmember,de facto plaintiff.it is important to note,however,that the claim the tribal members are defending against arose off the reservation.
in montana,the court cited williams,d,as exemplifying each of the two exceptions to its general rule.importantly,williams involved a suit by a nonmember against a member of the navajo tribe to collect for goods allegedly purchased on credit from the plaintiff shop within the navajo reservation.in other words,williams involved a member defendant and the activities of that member defendant.if,as king mountain suggests,montana does not apply to such cases at all,it is inconceivable that the court would have chosen williams to illustrate montana exceptions.the soundness of this reasoning was confirmed in plains commerce bank,where the court said we cited four cases in explanation of montana first exception including williams.each involved regulation of activities on the reservation that had a discernable effect on the tribe or its members.at.and,as noted earlier,in cases involving nonmembers,the inquiry focuses primarily on whether a nonmember is being haled into tribal court against his will.see,hicks,at.souter,concurring it is the membership status of the unconsenting party that counts as the primary jurisdictional fact.
indeed,this court,sitting en banc,recently explained in smith salish kootenai college that f irst,and most important,is the party status of the nonmember that is,whether the nonmember party is a plaintiff or defendant the court has repeatedly demonstrated its concern that tribal courts not require nonmember defendants to defend themselves against ordinary claims in an unfamiliar court,cir en banc internal quotation marks and original brackets omitted.at the same time,williams makes clear that tribal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over suits against tribal members on claims arising on the reservation,d.
questions of exhaustion and tribal jurisdiction typically,although not always,arise where a tribal member first sues a nonmember in tribal court,the nonmember seeks a stay against the tribal proceedings in federal court,and the federal court must then decide whether to defer to the tribal court out of principles of comity.this case does not follow this pattern.rather,here it was only after being sued in federal court by philip morris,the nonmember plaintiff,that king mountain,the member defendant,filed suit in tribal court and invoked tribal court jurisdiction.
finally,it is significant that we recently invoked the montana analysis in just such a case.see smith,at holding exhaustion required in light of a colorable claim to tribal jurisdiction based on the first montana exception.smith concerned a tort claim by a student against salish kootenai college arising out of a traffic accident on a federal highway within the flathead reservation,a reservation controlled by the confederated salish and kootenai tribes.id.at.smith,the putative plaintiff,was a member of the umatilla tribe and thus was considered a nonmember for jurisdictional purposes.id.at.the college was a tribal entity,and thus was treated as a member for jurisdictional purposes.id.at.notwithstanding the presence of a member defendant and nonmember plaintiff,we applied montana.id.at.thus,in this circuit,the montana analysis is controlling in tribal jurisdiction cases,with party alignment in the tribal court action as the most important factor to be weighed in determining the application of montana rule and exceptions to the case at hand.see id.at.
we turn,then,to the montana exceptions themselves.any initial impression that this case falls within the first montana exception fades quickly upon closer inspection.under that exception,a tribe may regulate,through taxation,licensing,or other means,the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members,through commercial dealing,contracts,leases,or other arrangements.montana,at.philip morris acknowledges that as part of its business,it has consensual relationships with tribal members.stores located on the reservation and operated by tribal members sell marlboro cigarettes.although the stores purchase from distributors rather than from philip morris,they have marketing arrangements with philip morris.the first question,however,is whether there is a contract or consensual relationship between philip morris and king mountain,the tribal member.the answer is undisputably no.philip morris has no consensual commercial relationship with king mountain rather,they are market competitors.nor has philip morris otherwise consented to tribal jurisdiction by voluntarily litigating its infringement claims against king mountain in tribal court.smith,at holding montana first exception was satisfied because the nonmember consented to tribal jurisdiction by choosing to file his claims against a tribal member in tribal court.philip morris filed its claims in federal court and has been haled into tribal court only as an unconsenting,de facto plaintiff in king mountain tribal action for declaratory relief.
so,taking the question one step further,we ask whether there is a nexus between philip morris commercial relationship with various stores operated by tribal members and the events that give rise to this suit for trademark infringement.see atkinson,at.holding that montana requires not only contacts,but contacts related to the events out of which the suit arises.we hold there is not.
the mere fact that a nonmember has some consensual commercial contacts with a tribe does not mean that the tribe has jurisdiction over all suits involving that nonmember,or even over all such suits that arise within the reservation the suit must also arise out of those consensual contacts.in atkinson,the supreme court clarified that a nonmember consensual relationship in one area does not trigger tribal civil authority in is not in for a penny,in for a pound.atkinson,at.citation omitted see also strate,at.holding montana first exception inapplicable despite consensual commercial relationship with the tribe,because the claim was unrelated to that relationship.montana consensual relationship exception requires that the tax or regulation imposed by the indian tribe have a nexus to the consensual relationship itself.atkinson,at.
in atkinson,the navajo tribe sought to collect a hotel tax from all guests at hotels within the reservation boundaries.although the tax would be imposed directly on guests,hotel owners and operators were charged with collecting it.atkinson,a nonmember proprietor of a hotel located within the boundaries of the reservation,brought suit to enjoin the tax.the supreme court noted that atkinson acquisition of a license to transact business within the reservation put him in a consensual commercial relationship with the tribe.nevertheless,this relationship was not enough to support tribal jurisdiction under the first montana exception,because the tribe did not seek to impose the tax on activities arising out of that relationship.id.at.rather,the tribe sought to tax the activities of the guests,namely staying overnight in a hotel.thus,the court held,it is clear that petitioner indian trader status by itself can not support the imposition of the hotel occupancy tax.id.
the court reached a similar conclusion in strate.there,the plaintiff was involved in a traffic accident with a nonmember subcontractor of a tribal corporation who was on the reservation to perform landscaping work for the three affiliated tribes at the time of the accident atkinson,at.the plaintiff sued in tribal court,claiming jurisdiction under the first montana exception,but the court determined the tribal court was without jurisdiction.it held that a lthough the subcontractor was engaged in subcontract work on the fort berthold reservation,and therefore had a consensual relationship with the tribes,the plaintiff was not a party to the subcontract,and the tribes were strangers to the accident.strate,at.internal quotations omitted.
here we face a similar situation.king mountain claims tribal jurisdiction exists over this suit under the first montana exception
