this case involves a federal program for indian tribes and tribally designated housing entities tdhe that lease housing to indians.the program provides payments while the tribe or tdhe is leasing housing units to indians,with a view that each unit eventually be conveyed to the indian lessees.when the tribe or tdhe conveys a unit,or a unit becomes eligible to be conveyed,unless such a conveyance is impractical,the tribe should no longer receive rent subsidy money for the unit.
what happened here the fort belknap housing department fort belknap,a tdhe which received funds through the program,claimed and received rent subsidy payments for units that were no longer leased,but had been conveyed,and for units that were eligible to be conveyed.there were no circumstances which made the conveyance of such units impractical.after investigation,the department of housing and urban development hud demanded the return of the overpayments it had made.
fort belknap petitions this court for review of hud decision to withhold the amount of overpayments from future program payments.fort belknap argues this court has jurisdiction pursuant to d.on the merits,it claims hud actions in procuring repayment of the overpayments were arbitrary and capricious and based on a misinterpretation of various regulations.section d,however,allows an appeal only when hud takes action pursuant to a.because hud has taken no action pursuant to a,we lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal and dismiss fort belknap petition without reaching the merits.
