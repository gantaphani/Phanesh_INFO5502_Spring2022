on october,a jury convicted kerry dean benally of forcibly assaulting a bureau of indian affairs officer with a dangerous weapon,in violation of b.the next day one of the jurors came forward with a charge that the jury deliberations had been tainted by racial bias and other inappropriate considerations.the district court held that federal rule of evidence b general rule against jurors testifying about jury deliberations did not apply and that the evidence of juror misconduct was sufficient to warrant a new trial.we disagree.rule b s prohibition covers juror testimony of racial bias in jury deliberations of the kind alleged in benally trial,and the sixth amendment does not require an exception.the original conviction is reinstated.
background 
benally,a member of the ute mountain ute tribe,was charged with forcibly assaulting a bureau of indian affairs officer with a dangerous weapon.prior to trial,he submitted several voir dire questions aimed at uncovering potential bias against native americans.the judge asked two of those questions at voir dire would the fact that the defendant is a native american affect your evaluation of the case and have you ever had a negative experience with any individuals of native american descent and,if so,would that experience affect your evaluation of the facts of this case no juror answered affirmatively to either question.the case proceeded to trial and the jury found benally guilty.
the day after the jury announced its verdict,one juror approached defense counsel with unsettling information.this juror juror claimed that the jury deliberation had been improperly influenced by racist claims about native americans.the foreman,according to juror,told the other jurors that he used to live on or near an indian reservation,that w hen indians get alcohol,they all get drunk,and that when they get drunk,they get violent.juror said that when she then argued with the foreman that not all native americans get drunk,the foreman insisted,yes,they do.juror claimed that at that point a second juror chimed in to say that she had also lived on or near a reservation.while juror could not hear the rest of this juror statement,it was clear she was agreeing with the foreman statement about indians.juror continued to argue with the foreman,going back and forth several times.
she also told defense counsel about another discussion in which some jurors discussed the need to send a message back to the reservation.during this second discussion,juror.says that one juror told how he had two family members in law enforcement and had heard stories from them about what happens when people mess with police officers and get away with it.
juror signed an affidavit attesting to both of these discussions.a defense investigator then contacted another juror who seems to have corroborated some of juror claims,but this second juror was unwilling to sign an affidavit.the defense investigator did,however,sign an affidavit saying that the second juror indicated that the jury foreman made a statement regarding indians and drinking and said something like he had seen a lot of indians that drink.
the investigator also testified that the juror recalled a statement about sending a message back to the reservation.
armed with these two affidavits,benally moved to vacate the verdict and receive a new trial pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.he argued that the jurors had lied about their racial bias on voir dire and had improperly considered information not in evidence.the government opposed the motion on the ground that benally only evidence of misconduct was inadmissible under rule b.that rule states,in relevant part 
upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment,a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror mental processes in connection therewith.
b.rule b provides three limited exceptions to this general prohibition against jurors testifying about jury deliberations 
but a juror may testify about whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury attention,whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror,or whether there was a mistake in entering the verdict onto the verdict form.
the district court admitted the juror testimony under the exceptions that allow jurors to testify about whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror.dist.relying upon this evidence,the judge found that two jurors had lied on voir dire when they failed to reveal their past experiences with native americans and their preconception that all native americans get drunk and then violent.he also found that the jury had improperly considered extrinsic evidence when the juror whose family was in law enforcement related stories that showed the need to send a message.the judge viewed each of these as sufficient evidence of misconduct and granted a new trial.the government then appealed.
ii.analysis 
when the affidavit of a juror,as to the misconduct of himself or the other members of the jury,is made the basis of a motion for a new trial,the court must choose between redressing the injury of the private litigant and inflicting the public injury which would result if jurors were permitted to testify as to what happened in the jury room.mcdonald pless.this case illustrates the tension between those interests.a juror has offered testimony that the verdict may have been influenced by improper arguments predicated on racial stereotyping and a need to send a message but benally can obtain redress in the form of a new trial only if that juror testimony is admissible.rule b says it is not.
a.the history and purpose of rule b 
the rule against impeachment of a jury verdict by juror testimony as to internal deliberations may be traced back to mansfield rule,originating in the case of vaise delaval,eng.faced with juror testimony that the jury had reached its verdict by drawing lots,lord mansfield established a blanket ban on jurors testifying against their own verdict.the rule was adopted by most american jurisdictions and b y the beginning of the twentieth century,if not earlier,the and firmly established rule in the united states flatly prohibited the admission of juror testimony to impeach a jury verdict.tanner united states,d.this principle,together with exceptions also developed by common law,was eventually codified into federal rule of evidence b.
rule b is a rule of evidence,but its role in the criminal justice process is substantive it insulates the deliberations of the jury from subsequent by the judiciary.jury is designed to be a black box the inputs evidence and argument are carefully regulated by law and the output the verdict is publicly announced,but the inner workings and deliberation of the jury are deliberately insulated from subsequent review.judges instruct the jury as to the law,but have no way of knowing whether the jurors follow those instructions.judges and lawyers speak to the jury about how to evaluate the evidence,but can not tell how the jurors decide among conflicting testimony or facts.juries are told to put aside their prejudices and preconceptions,but no one knows whether they do so.juries provide no reasons,only verdicts.
to treat the jury as a black box may seem to offend the search for perfect justice.the rule makes it difficult and in some cases impossible to ensure that jury verdicts are based on evidence and law rather than bias or caprice.but our legal system is grounded on the conviction,borne out by experience,that decisions by ordinary citizens are likely,over time and in the great majority of cases,to approximate justice more closely than more transparently decisions by professional jurists.indeed,it might even be that the jury ability to be irrational,as when it refuses to apply a law against a defendant who has in fact violated it,is one of its strengths.see john jackson,making juries accountable,am.comp.
if what went on in the jury room were judicially reviewable for reasonableness or fairness,trials would no longer truly be by jury,as the constitution commands.final authority would be exercised by whomever is empowered to decide whether the jury decision was reasonable enough,or based on proper considerations.judicial review of internal jury deliberations would have the result that every jury verdict would either become the court verdict or would be permitted to stand only by the court leave.carson polley,cir.
defendants undoubtedly have a powerful interest in ensuring that the jury carefully and impartially considers the evidence.this case presents that interest to the highest degree.but there are compelling interests for prohibiting testimony about what goes on in the jury room after a verdict has been rendered.the rule protects the finality of verdicts.it protects jurors from harassment by counsel seeking to nullify a verdict.it reduces the incentive for jury tampering.it promotes free and frank jury discussions that would be chilled if threatened by the prospect of later being called to the stand.finally,it preserves the community trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople that would all be undermined by a barrage of postverdict scrutiny.tanner,at.see also resolution trust stone,cir t he rule against jurors impeaching their own verdict is designed to promote the jury freedom of deliberation,the stability and finality of verdicts,and the protection of jurors against annoyance and embarrassment.gov t of the gereau,cir listing these five policies behind the rule.
like other rules of evidence protecting the confidentiality of certain communications,such as the privilege or the privilege,rule b denies the court access to what may be relevant that might,for example,justify a motion for a new trial.but like these other privileges,the rule protects the deliberative process in a broader sense.it is essential that jurors express themselves candidly and vigorously as they discuss the evidence presented in court.the prospect that their words could be subjected to judicial critique and public cross examination would surely give jurors pause before they speak.see tanner,at.if evidence thus secured could be thus used,the result would be to make what was intended to be a private deliberation,the constant subject of public the destruction of all frankness and freedom of discussion and conference.quoting mcdonald pless,at.moreover,part of the urgency that comes from knowing that their decision is the final word may be lost if jurors know that their reasoning is subject to judicial oversight and correction.had she known that the judge would review the jury reasoning process,for instance,juror might not have argued so persistently with the foreman she might have chosen instead to sit back and wait for the judge to correct the foreman unreasonableness.
applicability of rule b to the juror testimony in this case 
against this background,we must consider whether juror testimony,or the defense investigator report of conversations with another juror,is inadmissible under rule b.the rule provides upon inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment,a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury deliberations,with certain exceptions.the rule goes on to say that a juror affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror may not be received on a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying.thus,if juror or the other juror questioned by the defense investigator could not have testified on these matters,it was error for the district court to receive either an affidavit or other evidence of the testimony 
juror testimony along with the affidavit of the investigator reporting the statements of another juror reported statements made by the jury foreman and other jurors in the jury room as part of the jury discussion of the case.this evidence unquestionably falls within the category of testimony as to a statement occurring during the course of the jury deliberations.benally does not argue otherwise.
he does argue,however,that the testimony concerning racial bias falls outside the ambit of the rule because it is not being offered in connection with an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment.b see mcdonald,at.the principle is limited to those instances in which a private party seeks to use a juror as a witness to impeach the verdict.the testimony was offered,he argues,only to show that a juror failed to answer questions honestly during voir dire.the jurors had been asked whether they had any negative experiences with native americans and whether the fact that benally is a native american would affect their evaluation of the case.all jurors answered no.yet the challenged testimony suggests that two jurors allowed preconceptions about native americans to color their evaluation.
we can not accept this argument.although the immediate purpose of introducing the testimony may have been to show that the two jurors failed to answer honestly during voir dire,the sole point of this showing was to support a motion to vacate the verdict,and for a new trial.that is a challenge to the validity of the verdict.
it is true that juror testimony can be used to show dishonesty during voir dire,for purposes of contempt proceedings against the dishonest juror.see clark united states.thus,if the purpose of the proceeding were to charge the jury foreman or the other juror with contempt of court,rule b would not apply.mcdonald,at.however,it does not follow that juror testimony that shows a failure to answer honestly during voir dire can be used to overturn the verdict.
there is a split in the circuits on this point.the ninth circuit has held that s tatements which tend to show deceit during voir dire are not barred by rule b,even when the improper voir dire is the basis of a motion for a new trial.hard burlington no,cir united states henley,cir where,as here,a juror has been asked direct questions about racial bias during voir dire,and has sworn that racial bias would play no part in his deliberations,evidence of that juror alleged racial bias is indisputably admissible for the purpose of determining whether the juror responses were truthful.at least one district court,in addition to the court below,has adopted a similar interpretation of the rule.see tobias smith,citing evidentiary treatise that suggested where comments indicate prejudice or preconceived notions of guilt,statements may be admissible not under b but because they may prove that a juror lied during the voir dire.
the third circuit,by contrast,has held that such an interpretation would be plainly too broad,and that rule b categorically bar s juror testimony as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury deliberations even if the testimony is not offered to explore the jury process in reaching the verdict.williams price,cir alito.alito acknowledged that the ninth circuit had held otherwise in hard but that it appears that hard is inconsistent with federal rule of evidence b.id.at.
the third circuit approach best comports with rule b,and we follow it here.benally seeks to use juror testimony to question the validity of the verdict.the fact that he does so by challenging the voir dire does not change that fact.capps sullivan,cir rejecting defendant attempt to circumvent the rule by collaterally attacking the verdict with an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and asking what jurors would have thought had counsel requested a different jury instruction,noting that defendant actually is probing their mental processes in their deliberations and using the results in an attempt to secure a new trial.we agree with the government that allowing juror testimony through the backdoor of a voir dire challenge risks swallowing the rule.a broad question during voir dire could then justify the admission of any number of jury statements that would now be as challenges to voir dire rather than challenges to the verdict.given the importance that rule b places on protecting jury deliberations from judicial review,we can not read it to justify as large a loophole as benally requests.
whether the juror testimony in this case falls within one of the enumerated exceptions to the rule 
since the contested juror testimony falls under rule b general proscription,we must ask whether benally can take advantage of one of the rule limited exceptions.rule b enumerates three exceptions a juror may testify about whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury attention,whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror,or whether there was a mistake in entering the verdict onto the verdict form.b.
benally argues that the juror statements in this case are about either extraneous prejudicial information or an outside influence,falling under the first or second exception,respectively these exceptions for extraneous influences cover misconduct such as jurors reading news reports about the case,jurors communicating with third parties,bribes,and jury tampering.see tanner,at.citing cases that identified extraneous influences united states davis,cir news reports as extraneous influence united states scisum,cir juror is permitted to testify that she had ex parte contact with judge but can not testify about mental processes in connection therewith mayhue francis hosp.of wichita,cir dictionary as extraneous influence united states dempsey,cir interpreter misbehavior as extraneous influence gereau,at listing situations that have been deemed extraneous influences.the exceptions do not extend to discussions among jurors,intimidation or harassment of one juror by another,and other influences on the verdict.gereau,at.they do not extend to evidence of drug and alcohol use during the deliberations.tanner,at.however severe their effect and improper their use,drugs or alcohol voluntarily ingested by a juror seems no more an outside influence than a virus,poorly prepared food,or a lack of sleep.they do not extend even to questions of a juror sanity.see united states dioguardi,cir denying inquiry into state of mind of juror who claimed during trial to be cursed and able to see the future,because state of mind is internal rather than external.
if a juror were to conduct his own investigation and bring the results into the jury room,as the henry fonda character does in twelve angry men,that behavior would constitute extraneous information,and rule b would allow another juror to expose it.see southern pac.klinge,cir for a example.courts must be careful,however,not to confuse a juror who introduces outside evidence with a juror who brings his personal experiences to bear on the matter at hand.see marquez city of albuquerque,cir a juror personal experience,however,does not constitute extraneous prejudicial information.charles alan wright victor james gold,federal practice and procedure evidence,bias might not qualify as an outside influence since it is imposed as a factor in by the jury itself,not some source extrinsic to the jury.we have said that the inquiry is not whether the jurors became witnesses in the sense that they discussed any matters not of record,but whether they discussed specific facts relating to the defendant,and if they did,whether there was a significant possibility that the defendant was prejudiced thereby.marquez,at quoting united states ex rel.owen mcmann,cir.in marquez,the juror personal experience was quite specific and relevant to the matter at hand she discussed her own experience training police dogs to help the jury determine the issue before it,which was whether the use of a police dog had constituted excessive force.id.nevertheless,we held that this was not extraneous prejudicial information under rule b.id.
none of the statements that benally alleges his jurors made are specific facts relating to the defendant.they are generalized statements,ostensibly based upon the jurors personal experience.the statements might have been relevant to the matter before the jury,but that is not the inquiry.see marquez,at.we instead ask whether the statements concerned specific facts about benally or the incident in which he was charged,and they did not.united states humphrey,cir holding a juror statement about the personal reputation of the defendant to be extraneous information outside the scope of the rule.we do not deny that the jurors alleged statements were entirely improper and inappropriate.the statements about native americans in particular were gross generalizations built upon prejudice and had no place in the jury room.impropriety alone,however,does not make a statement extraneous.that would unravel the distinction and make anything said in jury deliberations extraneous information so long as it was inappropriate.see martinez food city,cir j uror testimony regarding the possible subjective prejudices or improper motives of individual jurors has been held to be within the rule,rather than within the exceptions for extraneous influences.but see tobias.at conflating improper with extraneous by holding that statements in the juror affidavit are sufficient to raise a question as to whether the jury verdict was discolored by improper influences and that they are not merely matters of jury deliberations.it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to admit this testimony under rule b exceptions.
whether this court should imply an exception to rule b for evidence touching on racial bias 
benally then urges us that if the foreman statements are not extraneous and do not fall under one of rule b explicit exceptions,they should fall under an implicit exception for evidence of racial bias.the ninth circuit adopted this approach in united states henley,when it said it would seem consistent with the text of the rule,as well as with the broad goal of eliminating racial prejudice from the judicial system,to hold that evidence of racial bias is generally not subject to rule b prohibitions against juror testimony.at.racial bias,according to henley,is so plainly a mental bias that is unrelated to any specific issue that a juror in a criminal case may legitimately be called upon to determine that any statement indicative of such bias can not be deemed protected by an evidentiary rule.id.other courts have refused to read such an exception into the text of rule b.see,shillcutt gagnon,cir applying rule b to exclude a white juror statement that the defendant black and he sees a seventeen year old white know the type.smith brewer.applying the rule to exclude jurors mimicking of black attorney during deliberations,aff,cir.
to the extent the argument is made as a matter of policy,a court in a particular case is not the proper forum for making or enlarging exceptions to the rules of evidence.our commission is to apply the rules of evidence as written and interpreted to the case at hand.perhaps it would be a good idea to amend rule b to allow testimony revealing racial bias in jury deliberations,but the body entrusted with making the rules is congress advised by the advisory committee,which first considers proposed changes to the rules,takes public comment,and then recommends an appropriate action in a detailed report.
congress deliberately rejected a version of rule b with broader exceptions,which would have admitted the contested testimony in this case.the original house version of the rule would have allowed juror testimony regarding what was said in the jury room,while precluding testimony regarding the effect of those statements or anything else bearing on the subjective reasoning of the jurors.see,sess.upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment,a juror may not testify concerning the effect of anything upon his or any other juror mind or emotions as influencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning his mental processes in connection therewith.this would have adopted the iowa rule,in which jurors may testify about any matter occurring during the trial or in the jury room as long as it does not essentially inhere in the verdict itself.wright illinois,iowa.the senate rejected this ex
