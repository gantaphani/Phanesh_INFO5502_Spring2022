in,a police detective tried to question respondent shatzer,who was incarcerated at a maryland prison pursuant to a prior conviction,about allegations that he had sexually abused his son.shatzer invoked his miranda right to have counsel present during interrogation,so the detective terminated the interview.shatzer was released back into the general prison population,and the investigation was closed.another detective reopened the investigation in and attempted to interrogate shatzer,who was still incarcerated.shatzer waived his miranda rights and made inculpatory statements.the trial court refused to suppress those statements,reasoning that edwards arizona,did not apply because shatzer had experienced a break in miranda custody prior to the interrogation.shatzer was convicted of sexual child abuse.the court of appeals of maryland reversed,holding that the mere passage of time does not end the edwards protections,and that,assuming,arguendo,a exception to edwards existed,shatzer release back into the general prison population did not constitute such a break.
held because shatzer experienced a break in miranda custody lasting more than two weeks between the first and second attempts at interrogation,edwards does not mandate suppression of his statements.
a edwards created a presumption that once a suspect invokes the miranda right to the presence of counsel,any waiver of that right in response to a subsequent police attempt at custodial interrogation is involuntary.edwards fundamental purpose is to p reserv e the integrity of an accused choice to communicate with police only through counsel,patterson illinois,by prevent ing police from badgering him into waiving his previously asserted miranda rights,michigan harvey.it is easy to believe that a suspect later waiver was coerced or badgered when he has been held in uninterrupted miranda custody since his first refusal to waive.he remains cut off from his normal life and isolated in a atmosphere,miranda arizona,where his captors appear to control his fate,illinois perkins.but where a suspect has been released from custody and returned to his normal life for some time before the later attempted interrogation,there is little reason to think that his change of heart has been coerced.because the edwards presumption has been established by opinion of this court,it is appropriate for this court to specify the period of release from custody that will terminate its application.see county of riverside mclaughlin.the court concludes that the appropriate period is days,which provides ample time for the suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life,consult with friends and counsel,and shake off any residual coercive effects of prior custody.
b shatzer release back into the general prison population constitutes a break in miranda custody.lawful imprisonment imposed upon conviction does not create the coercive pressures produced by investigative custody that justify edwards.when previously incarcerated suspects are released back into the general prison population,they return to their accustomed surroundings and daily routine they regain the degree of control they had over their lives before the attempted interrogation.their continued detention is relatively disconnected from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investigation.the inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation ended when shatzer returned to his normal life.

justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether a break in custody ends the presumption of involuntariness established in edwards arizona.
in august,a social worker assigned to the child advocacy center in the criminal investigation division of the hagerstown police department referred to the department allegations that respondent michael shatzer,had sexually abused his son.at that time,shatzer was incarcerated at the maryland correctional,serving a sentence for an unrelated offense.detective shane blankenship was assigned to the investigation and interviewed shatzer at the correctional institution on august.before asking any questions,blankenship reviewed shatzer miranda rights with him,and obtained a written waiver of those rights.when blankenship explained that he was there to question shatzer about sexually abusing his son,shatzer expressed confusion he had thought blankenship was an attorney there to discuss the prior crime for which he was incarcerated.blankenship clarified the purpose of his visit,and shatzer declined to speak without an attorney.accordingly,blankenship ended the interview,and shatzer was released back into the general prison population.shortly thereafter,blankenship closed the investigation.
two years and six months later,the same social worker referred more specific allegations to the department about the same incident involving shatzer.detective paul hoover,from the same division,was assigned to the investigation.he and the social worker interviewed the victim,then eight years old,who described the incident in more detail.with this new information in hand,on march,they went to the roxbury correctional institute,to which shatzer had since been transferred,and interviewed shatzer in a maintenance room outfitted with a desk and three chairs.hoover explained that he wanted to ask shatzer about the alleged incident involving shatzer son.shatzer was surprised because he thought that the investigation had been closed,but hoover explained they had opened a new file.hoover then read shatzer his miranda rights and obtained a written waiver on a standard department form.
hoover interrogated shatzer about the incident for approximately minutes.shatzer denied ordering his son to perform fellatio on him,but admitted to masturbating in front of his son from a distance of less than three feet.before the interview ended,shatzer agreed to hoover request that he submit to a polygraph examination.at no point during the interrogation did shatzer request to speak with an attorney or refer to his prior refusal to answer questions without one.
five days later,on march,hoover and another detective met with shatzer at the correctional facility to administer the polygraph examination.after reading shatzer his miranda rights and obtaining a written waiver,the other detective administered the test and concluded that shatzer had failed.when the detectives then questioned shatzer,he became upset,started to cry,and incriminated himself by saying,i did force him.i did force him.after making this inculpatory statement,shatzer requested an attorney,and hoover promptly ended the interrogation.
the state attorney for washington county charged shatzer with sexual offense,sexual child abuse,assault,and contributing to conditions rendering a child in need of assistance.shatzer moved to suppress his march statements pursuant to edwards.the trial court held a suppression hearing and later denied shatzer motion.the edwards protections did not apply,it reasoned,because shatzer had experienced a break in custody for miranda purposes between the and interrogations.cir.washington,app.shatzer pleaded not guilty,waived his right to a jury trial,and proceeded to a bench trial based on an agreed statement of facts.in accordance with the agreement,the state described the interview with the victim and shatzer statements to the detectives.based on the proffered testimony of the victim and the admission of the defendant as to the act of masturbation,the trial court found shatzer guilty of sexual child abuse of his son cir.washington,at.
over the dissent of two judges,the court of appeals of maryland reversed and remanded.the court held that the passage of time alone is insufficient to end the protections afforded by edwards,and that,assuming,arguendo,a exception to edwards existed,shatzer release back into the general prison population between interrogations did not constitute a break in custody,at,at.we granted certiorari.
the fifth amendment,which applies to the states by virtue of the fourteenth amendment,malloy hogan,provides that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.amdt.in miranda arizona,the court adopted a set of prophylactic measures to protect a suspect fifth amendment right from the inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation,at.the court observed that incommunicado interrogation in an unfamiliar,atmosphere,at,involves psychological pressures which work to undermine the individual will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely,at.consequently,it reasoned,u nless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings,no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice.at.
to counteract the coercive pressure,miranda announced that police officers must warn a suspect prior to questioning that he has a right to remain silent,and a right to the presence of an attorney,at.after the warnings are given,if the suspect indicates that he wishes to remain silent,the interrogation must cease,at.similarly,if the suspect states that he wants an attorney,the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present,at.critically,however,a suspect can waive these rights,at.to establish a valid waiver,the state must show that the waiver was knowing,intelligent,and voluntary under the high standar d of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights set forth in johnson zerbst.at.
in edwards,the court determined that zerbst traditional standard for waiver was not sufficient to protect a suspect right to have counsel present at a subsequent interrogation if he had previously requested counsel additional safeguards were necessary,at.the court therefore superimposed a second layer of prophylaxis,mcneil wisconsin.edwards held 
w hen an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation,a valid waiver of that right can not be established by showing only that he responded to further custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights he is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him,unless the accused himself initiates further communication,exchanges,or conversations with the police.at.
the rationale of edwards is that once a suspect indicates that he is not capable of undergoing custodial questioning without advice of counsel,any subsequent waiver that has come at the authorities behest,and not at the suspect own instigation,is itself the product of the inherently compelling pressures and not the purely voluntary choice of the suspect.arizona roberson.under this rule,a voluntary miranda waiver is sufficient at the time of an initial attempted interrogation to protect a suspect right to have counsel present,but it is not sufficient at the time of subsequent attempts if the suspect initially requested the presence of counsel.the implicit assumption,of course,is that the subsequent requests for interrogation pose a significantly greater risk of coercion.that increased risk results not only from the police persistence in trying to get the suspect to talk,but also from the continued pressure that begins when the individual is taken into custody as a suspect and sought to be interrogated pressure likely to increase as custody is prolonged,minnick mississippi.the edwards presumption of involuntariness ensures that police will not take advantage of the mounting coercive pressures of prolonged police custody,roberson,at,by repeatedly attempting to question a suspect who previously requested counsel until the suspect is badgered into submission,at kennedy,dissenting.
we have frequently emphasized that the edwards rule is not a constitutional mandate,but judicially prescribed prophylaxis.see,montejo louisiana,slip,at michigan harvey,solem stumes.because edwards is our rule,not a constitutional command,it is our obligation to justify its expansion.roberson,supra,at kennedy,dissenting.lower courts have uniformly held that a break in custody ends the edwards presumption,see,people storm,cal,and,and collecting state and federal cases,but we have previously addressed the issue only in dicta,see mcneil,supra,at edwards applies assuming there has been no break in custody 
a judicially crafted rule is justified only by reference to its prophylactic purpose,davis united states,internal quotation marks omitted,and applies only where its benefits outweigh its costs,montejo,supra,at slip,at.we begin with the benefits.edwards presumption of involuntariness has the incidental effect of conserv ing judicial resources which would otherwise be expended in making difficult determinations of voluntariness.minnick,supra,at.its fundamental purpose,however,is to p reserv e the integrity of an accused choice to communicate with police only through counsel,patterson illinois,by prevent ing police from badgering a defendant into waiving his previously asserted miranda rights,harvey,supra,at.thus,the benefits of the rule are measured by the number of coerced confessions it suppresses that otherwise would have been admitted.see montejo,supra,at slip,at.
it is easy to believe that a suspect may be coerced or badgered into abandoning his earlier refusal to be questioned without counsel in the paradigm edwards case.that is a case in which the suspect has been arrested for a particular crime and is held in uninterrupted pretrial custody while that crime is being actively investigated.after the initial interrogation,and up to and including the second one,he remains cut off from his normal life and companions,thrust into and isolated in an unfamiliar,atmosphere,miranda,at,where his captors appear to control his fate,illinois perkins.that was the situation confronted by the suspects in edwards,roberson,and minnick,the three cases in which we have held the edwards rule applicable.edwards was arrested pursuant to a warrant and taken to a police station,where he was interrogated until he requested counsel.edwards,at.the officer ended the interrogation and took him to the county jail but at the next morning,two of the officer colleagues reinterrogated edwards at the jail,at.roberson was arrested at the scene of a burglary and interrogated there until he requested a lawyer.roberson,at.a different officer interrogated him three days later while he was still in custody pursuant to the arrest.ibid.minnick was arrested by local police and taken to the san diego jail,where two fbi agents interrogated him the next morning until he requested counsel.minnick,at.two days later a mississippi deputy sheriff reinterrogated him at the jail,at.none of these suspects regained a sense of control or normalcy after they were initially taken into custody for the crime under investigation.
when,unlike what happened in these three cases,a suspect has been released from his pretrial custody and has returned to his normal life for some time before the later attempted interrogation,there is little reason to think that his change of heart regarding interrogation without counsel has been coerced.he has no longer been isolated.he has likely been able to seek advice from an attorney,family members,and friends and he knows from his earlier experience that he need only demand counsel to bring the interrogation to a halt and that investigative custody does not last indefinitely.in these circumstances,it is far fetched to think that a police officer asking the suspect whether he would like to waive his miranda rights will any more wear down the accused,smith illinois,per curiam,than did the first such request at the original attempted interrogation which is of course not deemed coercive.his change of heart is less likely attributable to badgering than it is to the fact that further deliberation in familiar surroundings has caused him to believe rightly or wrongly that cooperating with the investigation is in his interest.uncritical extension of edwards to this situation would not significantly increase the number of genuinely coerced confessions excluded.the justification for a conclusive presumption disappears when application of the presumption will not reach the correct result most of the time.coleman thompson.
at the same time that extending the edwards rule yields diminished benefits,extending the rule also increases its costs the voluntary confessions it excludes from trial,and the voluntary confessions it deters law enforcement officers from even trying to obtain.voluntary confessions are not merely a proper element in law enforcement,miranda,supra,at,they are an unmitigated good,mcneil,at,essential to society compelling interest in finding,convicting,and punishing those who violate the law,ibid.quoting moran burbine.
the only logical endpoint of edwards disability is termination of miranda custody and any of its lingering effects.without that limitation and barring some purely arbitrary every edwards prohibition of custodial interrogation of a particular suspect would be eternal.the prohibition applies,of course,when the subsequent interrogation pertains to a different crime,roberson,supra,when it is conducted by a different law enforcement authority,minnick,and even when the suspect has met with an attorney after the first interrogation,ibid.and it not only prevents questioning ex ante it would render invalid ex post,confessions invited and obtained from suspects who unbeknownst to the interrogators have acquired edwards immunity previously in connection with any offense in any jurisdiction in a country that harbors a large number of repeat offenders this consequence is disastrous.
we conclude that such an extension of edwards is not justified we have opened its protective umbrella,solem,at,far enough.the protections offered by miranda,which we have deemed sufficient to ensure that the police respect the suspect desire to have an attorney present the first time police interrogate him,adequately ensure that result when a suspect who initially requested counsel is reinterrogated after a break in custody that is of sufficient duration to dissipate its coercive effects.
if shatzer return to the general prison population qualified as a break in custody a question we address in part iii,infra,there is no doubt that it lasted long enough years to meet that durational requirement.but what about a break that has lasted only one year or only one week it is impractical to leave the answer to that question for clarification in future adjudication law enforcement officers need to know,with certainty and beforehand,when renewed interrogation is lawful.and while it is certainly unusual for this court to set forth precise time limits governing police action,it is not.in county of riverside mclaughlin,we specified hours as the time within which the police must comply with the requirement of gerstein pugh,that a person arrested without a warrant be brought before a magistrate to establish probable cause for continued detention.
like mclaughlin,this is a case in which the requisite police action there,presentation to a magistrate here,abstention from further interrogation has not been prescribed by statute but has been established by opinion of this court.we think it appropriate to specify a period of time to avoid the consequence that continuation of the edwards presumption will not reach the correct result most of the time.coleman,supra,at.it seems to us that period is days.that provides plenty of time for the suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life,to consult with friends and counsel,and to shake off any residual coercive effects of his prior custody.
the limitation meets shatzer concern that a rule lends itself to police abuse.he envisions that once a suspect invokes his miranda right to counsel,the police will release the suspect briefly to end the edwards presumption and then promptly bring him back into custody for reinterrogation.but once the suspect has been out of custody long enough days to eliminate its coercive effect,there will be nothing to gain by such gamesmanship nothing,that is,except the entirely appropriate gain of being able to interrogate a suspect who has made a valid waiver of his miranda rights 
shatzer argues that ending the edwards protections at a break in custody will undermine edwards purpose to conserve judicial resources.to be sure,we have said that t he merit of the edwards decision lies in the clarity of its command and the certainty of its application.minnick,at.but clarity and certainty are not goals in themselves.they are valuable only when they reasonably further the achievement of some substantive end here,the exclusion of compelled confessions.confessions obtained after a break in custody and a waiver of miranda rights are most unlikely to be compelled,and hence are unreasonably excluded.in any case,a exception will dim only marginally,if at all,the nature of edwards.in every case involving edwards,the courts must determine whether the suspect was in custody when he requested counsel and when he later made the statements he seeks to suppress.now,in cases where there is an alleged break in custody,they simply have to repeat the inquiry for the time between the initial invocation and reinterrogation.in most cases that determination will be easy.and when it is determined that the defendant pleading edwards has been out of custody for two weeks before the contested interrogation,the court is spared the inquiry into whether he ever,anywhere,asserted his miranda right to counsel.
the facts of this case present an additional issue.no one questions that shatzer was in custody for miranda purposes during the interviews with detective blankenship in and detective hoover in.likewise,no one questions that shatzer triggered the edwards protections when,according to detective blankenship notes of the interview,he stated that he would not talk about this case without having an attorney present,at,at.after the interview,shatzer was released back into the general prison population where he was serving an unrelated sentence.the issue is whether that constitutes a break in miranda custody.
we have never decided whether incarceration constitutes custody for miranda purposes,and have indeed explicitly declined to address the issue.see perkins,at.see also bradley ohio,marshall,dissenting from denial of certiorari.whether it does depends upon whether it exerts the coercive pressure that miranda was designed to guard against the danger of coercion that results from the interaction of custody and official interrogation.perkins,supra,at emphasis added.to determine whether a suspect was in miranda custody we have asked whether there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.new york quarles,see also stansbury california,per curiam.this test,no doubt,is satisfied by all forms of incarceration.our cases make clear,however,that the test identifies only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for miranda custody.we have declined to accord it talismanic power,because miranda is to be enforced only in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are implicated.berkemer mccarty.thus,the temporary and relatively nonthreatening detention involved in a traffic stop or terry stop,see terry ohio,does not constitute miranda custody.mccarty,supra,at.see also perkins,supra,at.
here,we are addressing the interim period during which a suspect was not interrogated,but was subject to a baseline set of restraints imposed pursuant to a prior conviction.without minimizing the harsh realities of incarceration,we think lawful imprisonment imposed upon conviction of a crime does not create the coercive pressures identified in miranda.
interrogated suspects who have previously been convicted of crime live in prison.when they are released back into the general prison population,they return to their accustomed surroundings and daily routine they regain the degree of control they had over their lives prior to the interrogation.sentenced prisoners,in contrast to the miranda paradigm,are not isolated with their accusers.they live among other inmates,guards,and workers,and often can receive visitors and communicate with people on the outside by mail or telephone.
their detention,moreover,is relatively disconnected from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investigation.the former interrogator has no power to increase the duration of incarceration,which was determined at sentencing and even where the possibility of parole exists,the former interrogator has no apparent power to decrease the time served.this is in stark contrast to the circumstances faced by the defendants in edwards,roberson,and minnick,whose continued detention as suspects rested with those controlling their interrogation,and who confronted the uncertainties of what final charges they would face,whether they would be convicted,and what sentence they would receive.
shatzer experience illustrates the vast differences between miranda custody and incarceration pursuant to conviction.at the time of the attempted interrogation,shatzer was already serving a sentence for a prior conviction.after that,he returned to the general prison population in the maryland correctional and was later transferred,for unrelated reasons,down the street to the roxbury correctional institute.both are state correctional facilities.see maryland div.of correction inmate handbook,online at all internet materials as visited,and available in clerk of court case file.inmates in these facilities generally can visit the library each week,at have regular exercise and recreation periods,at can participate in basic adult education and occupational training,at,are able to send and receive mail,at,and are allowed to receive visitors twice a week,see.shtml.his continued detention after the interrogation did not depend on what he said or did not say to detective blankenship,and he has not alleged that he was placed in a higher level of security or faced any continuing restraints as a result of the interrogation.the inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation ended when he returned to his normal life.
a few words in response to justice stevens concurrence it claims we ignore that w hen police tell an indigent suspect that he has the right to an attorney and then reinterrogate him without providing a lawyer,the suspect is likely to feel that the police lied to him and that he really does not have any right to a lawyer.post,at opinion concurring in judgment hereinafter concurrence.see also post,at.the fallacy here is that we are not talking about reinterrogating the suspect we are talking about asking his permission to be interrogated.an officer has in no sense lied to a suspect when,after advising,as miranda requires,you have the right to remain silent,and if you choose to speak you have the right to the presence of an attorney,he promptly ends the attempted interrogation because the suspect declines to speak without counsel present,and then,two weeks later,reapproaches the suspect and asks,are you now willing to speak without a lawyer present 
the concer n that motivated the edwards line of cases,post,at,is that the suspect will be coerced into saying yes.that concern guides our decision today.contrary to the concurrence conclusion,post,at,there is no reason to believe a suspect will view confession as the only way to end his interrogation when,before the interrogation begins,he is told that he can avoid it by simply requesting that he not be interrogated without counsel present an option that worked before.if,as the concurrence argues will often be the case,post,at,a break in custody does not change the suspect mind,he need only say so.
the concurrence also accuses the court of ignor ing that when a suspect asks for counsel,until his request is answered,there are still the same inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation on which the miranda line of cases is based.post,at.we do not ignore these pressures nor do we suggest that they disappear when custody is recommenced after a break,see post,at.but if those pressures are merely the same as before,then miranda provides sufficient protection as it did before.the edwards presumption of involuntariness is justified only in circumstances where the coercive pressures have increased so much that suspects waivers of miranda rights are likely to be involuntary most of the time.contrary to the concurrence suggestion,post,at,it is only in those narrow circumstances when custody is unbroken that the court has concluded a fresh se t of miranda warnings is not sufficient.see roberson,at.
in the last analysis,it turns out that the concurrence accepts our principal points.it agrees that edwards prophylaxis is not perpetual it agrees that a break in custody reduces the inherently compelling pressure upon which edwards was based it agrees that shatzer release back into the general prison population constituted a break in custody and it agrees that in this case the break was long enough to render edwards inapplicable.post,at.we differ in two respects instead of terminating edwards protection when the custodial pressures that were the basis for that protection dissipate,the concurrence would terminate it when the suspect would no longer feel that he has been denied the counsel he has clearly requested,post,at.this is entirely unrelated to the rationale of edwards.if confidence in the police promise to provide counsel were the touchstone,edwards would not have applied in minnick,where the suspect in continuing custody actually met with appointed counsel.the concurrence rule is also entirely unrelated to the existence of a break in custody.while that may relieve the accumulated coercive pressures of custody that are the foundation for edwards,it is hard to see how it bolsters the suspect confidence that if he asks for counsel he will get one.
and secondly,the concurrence differs from us in declining to say how long after a break in custody the termination of edwards protection occurs.two and years,it says,is clearly enough but it gives law enforcement authorities no further guidance.the concurrence criticizes our use of days as arbitrary and unexplained,post,at,and.but in fact that rests upon the same basis as the concurrence own approval of a break in custody how much time will justify treating the second interrogation as no more coercive than the first,post,at.failure to say where the line falls short of years,and leaving that for future determination,is certainly less helpful,but not at all less arbitrary.
because shatzer experienced a break in miranda custody lasting more than two weeks between the first and second attempts at interrogation,edwards does not mandate suppression of his march statements.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals of maryland,and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice thomas,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
i join part iii of the court opinion,which holds that release into the general prison population constitutes a break in custody.i do not join the court decision to extend the presumption of involuntariness established in edwards arizona,for days after custody ends.
it is not apparent to me that the presumption of involuntariness the court recognized in edwards is justifiable even in the custodial setting to which edwards applies it.see,minnick mississippi,scalia,dissenting.accordingly,i would not extend the edwards rule beyond the circumstances present in edwards itself.at.but even if one believes that the court is obliged to apply edwards to any case involving continuing custody,the court opinion today goes well beyond that.it extends the presumption of involuntariness edwards applies in custodial settings to interrogations that occur after custody ends.
the court concedes that this extension,like the edwards presumption itself,is not constitutionally required.the court nevertheless defends the extension as a judicially created prophylaxis against compelled confessions.even if one accepts that such prophylaxis is both permissible generally and advisable for some period following a break in custody the court rule fails to satisfy the criteria our precedents establish for the judicial creation of such a safeguard.
our precedents insist that judicially created prophylactic rules like those in edwards and miranda arizona,maintain the closest possible fit between the rule and the fifth amendment interests they seek to protect.united states patane,plurality opinion see generally montejo louisiana,slip,at chavez martinez,plurality opinion.the court rule does not satisfy this test.the court relates its rule to the fifth amendment simply by asserting that days between release and recapture should provide plenty of time for the suspect to shake off any residual coercive effects of his prior custody,ante,at.
this ipse dixit does not explain why extending the edwards presumption for days following a break in custody as opposed to,or days provides the closest possible fit with the clause,patane,supra,at see ante,at merely stating that i t seems to us that the appropriate period is days nor does it explain how the benefits of a prophylactic rule either on its own terms or compared with other possible rules outweigh its costs which would include the loss of law enforcement information as well as the exclusion of confessions that are in fact voluntary.ante,at citing montejo,supra,at slip,at.
to be sure,the court rule has the benefit of providing a bright line.ante,at.but rules are not necessary to prevent fifth amendment violations,as the court has made clear when refusing to adopt such rules in cases involving other miranda rights.see,michigan mosley.and an otherwise arbitrary rule is not justifiable merely because it gives clear instruction to law enforcement officers 
as the court concedes,clarity and certainty are not goals in themselves.they are valuable only when they reasonably further the achievement of some substantive end here,the exclusion of compelled confessions that the fifth amendment prohibits.ante,at.the court arbitrary rule fails this test,even under the relatively permissive criteria set forth in our precedents.accordingly,i do not join that portion of the court opinion.

on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of maryland 
justice stevens,concurring in the judgment.
while i agree that the presumption from edwards arizona,is not eternal,ante,at,and does not mandate suppression of shatzer statement made after a break in custody,i do not agree with the court newly announced rule that edwards always ceases to apply when there is a break in custody,ante,at.
in conducting its analysis,the court demeans edwards as a second layer of judicially prescribed prophylaxis,ante,at,see also ante,at describing edwards as our rule,not a constitutional command quoting arizona roberson,kennedy,dissenting.the source of the holdings in the long line of cases that includes both edwards and miranda,however,is the fifth amendment protection against compelled applied to the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation,miranda arizona,and the significan ce of the assertion of the right to counsel,edwards,at the court analysis today is insufficiently sensitive to the concerns that motivated the edwards line of cases.
the most troubling aspect of the court rule is that it disregards the compulsion caused by a second or third,or fourth interrogation of an indigent suspect who was told that if he requests a lawyer,one will be provided for him.when police tell an indigent suspect that he has the right to an attorney,that he is not required to speak without an attorney present,and that an attorney will be provided to him at no cost before questioning,the police have made a significant promise.if they cease questioning and then reinterrogate the suspect days later without providing him with a lawyer,the suspect is likely to feel that the police lied to him and that he really does not have any right to a lawyer 
when officers informed shatzer of his rights during the first interrogation,they presumably informed him that if he requested an attorney,one would be appointed for him before he was asked any further questions.but if an indigent suspect requests a lawyer,any further interrogation even days later without counsel having been provided will surely exacerbate whatever compulsion to speak the suspect may be feeling.roberson,at.when police have not honored an earlier commitment to provide a detainee with a lawyer,the detainee likely will understan d his expressed wishes to have been ignored and may well see further objection as futile and confession true or not as the only way to end his interrogation.davis united states,souter,concurring in judgment.cooper dupnik,en banc describing an elaborate police task force plan to ignore a suspect requests for counsel,on the theory that such would induce hopelessness and thereby elicit an admission.simply giving a fresh se t of miranda warnings will not reassure a suspect who has been denied the counsel he has clearly requested that his rights have remained untrammeled.roberson,at.
the court never explains why its rule can not depend on,in addition to a break in custody and passage of time,a concrete event or state of affairs,such as the police having honored their commitment to provide counsel.instead,the court simply decides to create a rule,and in so doing,disregards much of the analysis upon which edwards and subsequent decisions were based.t he assertion of the right to counsel i s a significant event.edwards,at.as the court today acknowledges,the right to counsel,like the right to remain silent,is one that police may coerc e or badge r,ante,at,a suspect into abandoning however,as discussed above,the court ignores the effects not of badgering but of reinterrogating a suspect who took the police at their word that he need not answer questions without an attorney present.see roberson,at.the court,moreover,ignores that when a suspect asks for counsel,until his request is answered,there are still the same inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation on which the miranda line of cases is based,see,at and that the concern about compulsion is especially serious for a detainee who has requested a lawyer,an act that signals his inability to cope with the pressures of custodial interrogation,at 
instead of deferring to these understandings of the edwards rule,the court engages in its own speculation that a break in custody eliminates the compulsion that animated edwards.but its opinion gives no strong basis for believing that this is the case a break in custody does not eliminate the rationale for the initial edwards rule the detainee has been told that he may remain silent and speak only through a lawyer and that if he can not afford an attorney,one will be provided for him.he has asked for a lawyer.he does not have one.he is in custody.and police are still questioning him.a break in custody does not change the fact that custodial interrogation is inherently compelling.it is unlikely to change the fact that a detainee considers himself unable to deal with the pressures of custodial interrogation without legal assistance.roberson,at and in some instances,a break in custody may make matters worse w hen a suspect understands his expressed wishes to have been ignored and thus may well see further objection as futile and confession true or not as the only way to end his interrogation.davis,at souter,concurring in judgment 
the court ignores these understandings from the edwards line of cases and instead speculates that if a suspect is reinterrogated and eventually talks,it must be that further deliberation in familiar surroundings has caused him to believe rightly or wrongly that cooperating with the investigation is in his interest.ante,at.but it is not apparent why that is the case.the answer,we are told,is that once a suspect has been out of miranda custody for days,h e has likely been able to seek advice from an attorney,family members,and friends.ante,at.this speculation,however,is overconfident and only questionably relevant.as a factual matter,we do not know whether the defendant has been able to seek advice first of all,suspects are told that if they can not afford a lawyer,one will be provided for them.yet under the majority rule,an indigent suspect who took the police at their word when he asked for a lawyer will nonetheless be assumed to have been able to seek advice from an attorney.second,even suspects who are not indigent can not necessarily access legal advice or social advice as the court presumes within days.third,suspects may not realize that they need to seek advice from an attorney.unless police warn suspects that the interrogation will resume in days,why contact a lawyer when a suspect is let go,he may assume that the police were satisfied.in any event,it is not apparent why interim advice matters in minnick mississippi,we held that it is not sufficient that a detainee happened to speak at some point with a lawyer.see ibid.noting that consultation with an attorney does not prevent persistent attempts by officials to persuade a suspect to waive his rights or shield against the coercive pressures that accompany custody if the actual interim advice of an attorney is not sufficient,the hypothetical,interim advice of an attorney,family members,and friends,ante,at,is not enough.
the many problems with the court new rule are exacerbated in the very situation in this case a suspect who is in prison.even if,as the court assumes,a trip to one home significantly changes the edwards calculus,a trip to one prison cell is not the same.a prisoner freedom is severely limited,and his entire life remains subject to government control.such an environment is not conducive to shak ing off any residual coercive effects of his prior custody.ante,at nor can a prisoner easily seek advice from an attorney,family members,and friends,ante,at,especially not within days prisoners are frequently subject to restrictions on communications.nor,in most cases,can he live comfortably knowing that he can not be badgered by police prison is not like a normal situation in which a suspect is in control,and need only shut his door or walk away to avoid police badgering.montejo louisiana,slip,at.indeed,for a person whose every move is controlled by the state,it is likely that his sense of dependence on,and trust in,counsel as the guardian of his interests in dealing with government officials intensified.united states green,minnick,at explaining that coercive pressures may increase as custody is prolonged the court ignores these realities of prison,and instead rests its argument on the supposition that a prisoner detention is relatively disconnected from their prior unwillingness to cooperate in an investigation.ante,at.but that is not necessarily the case.prisoners are uniquely vulnerable to the officials who control every aspect of their lives prison guards may not look kindly upon a prisoner who refuses to cooperate with police.and cooperation frequently is relevant to whether the prisoner can obtain parole.see,code of,tit,a.moreover,even if it is true as a factual matter that a prisoner fate is not controlled by the police who come to interrogate him,how is the prisoner supposed to know that as the court itself admits,compulsion is likely when a suspect captors appear to control his fate,ante,at internal quotation marks omitted.but when a guard informs a suspect that he must go speak with police,it will appear to the prisoner that the guard and police are not independent.questioning by captors,who appear to control the suspect fate,may create mutually reinforcing pressures that the court has assumed will weaken the suspect will.illinois perkins,emphasis added 
because,at the very least,we do not know whether shatzer could obtain a lawyer,and thus would have felt that police had lied about providing one,i can not join the court opinion.i concur in today judgment,however,on another ground even if shatzer could not consult a lawyer and the police never provided him one,the break in custody is a basis for treating the second interrogation as no more coercive than the first.neither a break in custody nor the passage of time has an inherent,curative power.but certain things change over time.an indigent suspect who took police at their word that they would provide an attorney probably will feel that he has been denied the counsel he has clearly requested,roberson,at,when police begin to question him,without a lawyer,only days later but,when a suspect has been left alone for a significant period of time,he is not as likely to draw such conclusions when the police interrogate him again it is concededly impossible to determine with precision where to draw such a line.barker wingo.in the case before us,however,the suspect was returned to the general prison population for years.i am convinced that this period of time is sufficient.i therefore concur in the judgment.
the state filed a nolle prosequi to the sexual offense charge,and consented to dismissal of the misdemeanor charges as barred by the statute of limitations.

justice stevens points out,post,at opinion concurring in judgment,that in minnick,actual consultation with an attorney during continued custody did not suffice to avoid application of edwards.that does not mean that the ability to consult freely with attorneys and others does not reduce the level of coercion at all,or that it is only questionably relevant,post,at,to whether termination of custody reduces the coercive pressure that is the basis for edwards rule.
the state alternative argument in the present case is that the substantial lapse in time between the and attempts at interrogation independently ended the edwards presumption.our disposition makes it unnecessary to address that argument.
this assumes that roberson extension of edwards to subsequent interrogation for a different crime,and minnick extension of edwards to subsequent interrogation by a different law enforcement agency would apply even when the place of custody and the identity of the custodial agency are not the same as they were in roberson and minnick as those of the original interrogation.that assumption would seem reasonable if the effect of a termination of custody is rejected.reinterrogation in different custody or by a different interrogating agency would seem,if anything,less likely than termination of custody to reduce coercive pressures.at the original site,and with respect to the original interrogating agency,the suspect has already experienced cessation of interrogation when he demands counsel which he may have no reason to expect elsewhere.
according to a recent study,of prisoners released from states in were rearrested within three years.see of justice,bureau of justice statistics,special report,recidivism of prisoners released in ncj.
a defendant who experiences a break in custody after invoking the miranda right to counsel is not left without protection.edwards establishes a presumption that a suspect waiver of miranda rights is involuntary.see arizona roberson.even without this second layer of prophylaxis,mcneil wisconsin,a defendant is still free to claim the prophylactic protection of miranda arguing that his waiver of miranda rights was in fact involuntary under johnson zerbst.see miranda,at.
we distinguish the duration of incarceration from the duration of what might be termed interrogative custody.when a prisoner is removed from the general prison population and taken to a separate location for questioning,the duration of that separation is assuredly dependent upon his interrogators.for which reason once he has asserted a refusal to speak without assistance of counsel edwards prevents any efforts to get him to change his mind during that interrogative custody.
at a minimum the latter proposition is questionable.i concede that some police officers might badger a suspect during a subsequent interrogation after a break in custody,or might use tactics to suggest they will not ta
