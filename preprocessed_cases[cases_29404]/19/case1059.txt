appellant dario manon challenges his conviction on three drug distribution charges based on ineffective assistance of counsel.he argues,inter alia,that his trial attorney failed to call important witnesses on his behalf,timely arrange for a identification procedure,and object to the admission of prejudicial hearsay evidence.although we ordinarily do not consider ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal,manon claim is fully developed because the district court held a evidentiary hearing to explore his allegations.the court rejected the claim after hearing testimony from manon and his attorney,finding neither constitutionally deficient performance by counsel nor prejudice to manon.see strickland washington.we affirm the district court judgment denying manon a new trial.
trial overview 
manon was charged in a indictment with distributing heroin and cocaine to an undercover police officer in three transactions that took place in manchester,new hampshire,in june and july.the officer,detective shawn mccabe,was one of three witnesses presented by the government at trial.the other two were eddy roa medina,manon supplier,and glenn walichiewicz,a heroin addict who bought drugs from manon,sold drugs to mccabe,and made the connection between manon and mccabe.all three men identified manon in court as the individual who sold the drugs to mccabe.
manon attorney called no witnesses on his client behalf,attempting instead to muster a defense of mistaken identity through of the government witnesses.counsel sought to show that mccabe could not have obtained the drugs from manon because the detective description of the seller with whom he dealt omitted distinctive features of manon appearance,including a facial scar and a scar running the length of his right arm.counsel also attempted to undermine medina and walichiewicz identifications by highlighting their motivation to exchange testimony favorable to the government for sentencing benefits.
to provide the necessary background for an evaluation of appellant claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,we briefly recount the facts surrounding the three charged transactions as the jury could have found them and describe manon complaints about counsel performance at trial.
b.the three undercover sales 
the first transaction 
on june,mccabe made arrangements to purchase heroin from walichiewicz,who had obtained the drug from manon.when the men met for the exchange,walichiewicz had a smaller amount than mccabe wanted.walichiewicz gave the officer manon cellular telephone number,so that mccabe could make direct contact with manon.the next day,june,mccabe called that phone number and spoke to a male with a spanish accent who identified himself as dario.mccabe told dario that he was looking for about ten grams of heroin,and dario told him he could take care of him.they arranged to meet at about at the intersection of granite and barr streets.at trial,mccabe described the hispanic male who met him who identified himself as to tall,weighing approximately pounds,with droopy earlobes and distinct lines around his nose and down his cheeks.about ten minutes later,medina drove up in a brown honda and told mccabe the stuff was coming from massachusetts.the men waited for some time before mccabe left after asking dario to call him when the heroin arrived.
the sale eventually took place on june.mccabe received two voicemail messages that day from dario stating that he had what the detective was looking for.the calls originated from phone number.dario subsequently reached mccabe and asked him to come to his home.the officer went to the area of granite and barr at about,called dario and then saw him exit from granite street.dario got into mccabe vehicle,where he gave the officer a cylinder of heroin for which mccabe paid in cash.
the second transaction 
on june,walichiewicz called mccabe from the same cellular phone number from which mccabe had received the voicemail messages from dario.mccabe then spoke with dario and was told an ounce of crack cocaine would cost.dario transferred the phone to another male who identified himself as dario cousin,eddy,the cocaine price.shortly before,dario called mccabe,again from the same telephone number,and told the detective that eddy was on his way to dario house with the crack cocaine.when mccabe arrived at the granite and barr intersection a few minutes later,he called dario,who again exited from granite street and got into mccabe vehicle.medina arrived soon thereafter,and he and dario went into granite street for a few minutes.when the men emerged from the house,dario returned to mccabe car and,after a drive around the block,he gave the detective a plastic baggie containing crack cocaine.mccabe gave him for the drugs.
the third transaction 
on july,mccabe called dario,again using the phone number originally given him by walichiewicz,and asked the price for two ounces of crack cocaine.dario told him,and he later called the officer back to tell him he could pick up the drugs at his house.a short time later,at about,medina called mccabe asking him to hurry.when mccabe arrived at the intersection of granite and barr,dario and medina were already standing outside.dario got into the car with mccabe and,after they drove around for a bit,dario gave the officer a plastic bag of crack cocaine in exchange for in cash.
c.the complaints about counsel performance 
attorney paul garrity was appointed to represent manon shortly after manon was indicted in september on three charges of heroin and cocaine distribution.during the pretrial period,manon repeatedly requested new counsel,accusing garrity of a variety of shortcomings.the court held a hearing on may,but concluded that new counsel was not warranted.seven months later,garrity filed a motion to withdraw,referencing a letter from manon asking him to do so.the court denied the motion after another hearing on january,but appointed manon eventual appellate counsel,sven wiberg,to provide additional representation and advice to manon.wiberg withdrew before the trial,and garrity represented manon at the jury trial on march and.
following the jury verdict against him,manon submitted three motions for a new trial.in the first,filed pro se on march,he generally criticized garrity performance and said that he had been misrepresented with lies that i never asked my counsel paul garrity to say.when garrity again moved to withdraw as counsel,the court allowed the motion and wiberg was appointed to take over.the second motion for new trial,also filed pro se,challenged the admission of certain photographs at trial and stated that manon regretted not testifying.the court denied the motion and warned manon that further motions should be presented to his new attorney before they were filed with the court.in the third motion,filed by wiberg on manon behalf on december,manon claimed that garrity had provided ineffective assistance by,inter alia,discouraging him from testifying,failing to call other witnesses that manon had requested,and inadequately objecting to hearsay evidence on december,while that motion was pending,the district court sentenced manon to months imprisonment on each of the three counts of conviction,to be served concurrently,and three years of supervised release.
at the sentencing hearing,the court directed manon to file a document specifying the instances of ineffective assistance by garrity in support of his latest motion for new trial.on december,manon submitted a document titled specifications for defendant motion to vacate convictions that contained a list of fourteen items,including garrity failure to call certain allegedly exculpatory witnesses or present any defense,arrange before trial for identification procedures at the trial,probe the destruction of potentially exculpatory evidence,and object to prejudicial hearsay evidence.the document also adopted the specific claims made in his previous filing.
on june,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on manon ineffective assistance claim.garrity and manon were the two witnesses.the court considered the four complaints listed above,as well as his earlier by the court as the most significant potential argument that manon had been denied the opportunity to testify.the court found no mistakes by counsel but also concluded that,even if counsel did err,no prejudice occurred in light of the substantial evidence of appellant guilt and the nature of the asserted deficiencies.the court thus denied manon new trial motion.
on appeal,manon no longer presses the or claims,and we therefore do not address them.we consider the other three alleged failings of counsel explicitly considered by the court the failure to mount a defense case and call potential exculpatory witnesses,the failure to timely arrange for an appropriate identification procedure at trial,and the failure to object to hearsay evidence 
a.the ineffective assistance standard 
to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,a defendant must show not only that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment,but also that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived the defendant of a fair trial.strickland,at see also abrante amand,cir.to satisfy the prong,the defendant must identify the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment,and the court then determines whether,in the particular context,the identified conduct or inaction was outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.strickland,at.
the prejudice factor requires the defendant to show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.a reasonable probability is one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.united states,cir quoting strickland,at.in making the prejudice assessment,we focus on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding.dugas coplan,cir quoting,at quoting strickland,at.
where the district court held an evidentiary hearing on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,we review its factual conclusions for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.peralta united states,cir per curiam dugas,at.b oth the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of fact and law,strickland,at,and the standard of review applied to such questions depends,in the last analysis,on the extent to which a particular question is or,dugas,at.in this instance,we view the claims as primarily,and the district court conclusions are thus subject to clear error review.see dugas,at we would reach the same outcome,however,using a de novo standard.
b.the cronic exception 
manon argues that this is an unusual ineffective assistance case because his difficulties with trial counsel surfaced early,and both he and garrity sought to terminate their relationship before the trial.manon claims his concerns were validated when garrity ignored his wishes about how to proceed at trial and,among other problems,mishandled the misidentification defense.he suggests that the circumstances here would fit within the narrow category of ineffective assistance cases where prejudice is presumed because counsel entirely fail ed to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.united states cronic,see also theodore,at.he also argues that actual prejudice was in any event demonstrated.
to qualify for the cronic exception,the circumstances leading to counsel ineffectiveness must be so egregious that the defendant was in effect denied any meaningful assistance at all.theodore,at quoting united states griffin,cir alteration in original.as we noted in theodore,courts have found that standard satisfied where counsel fell asleep during the presentation of evidence against the defendant,where counsel was silent throughout the trial,and where counsel adopted and acted upon a belief that his client should be convicted.id.citing cases.the circumstances here are a far cry from such scenarios.
the defense theory as developed at trial was that medina and walichiewicz knew manon and were accusing him out of,and that mccabe was mistaken in concluding that the drug seller,who identified himself as dario,was dario manon.although garrity did not put on witnesses of his own,he vigorously each of the government witnesses.
as the government correctly emphasizes,garrity posed numerous questions to mccabe that were designed to show the inadequacy of the officer investigation and to cast doubt on the reliability of his identification of manon.the officer acknowledged,for example,that he took no fingerprints or dna samples from the undercover vehicle where all three of the drug transfers occurred or from the plastic baggies containing the drugs he had no recordings of the undercover buys or the telephone conversations leading up to them he did not save two messages left by the seller in his cellular phone voicemail and he had not included any description of the seller in his incident reports on the sales other than that the individual was an hispanic male.mccabe acknowledged in response to garrity questions that he had not noticed a scar on the seller face during any of the transactions.after garrity directed manon to approach the witness stand,mccabe admitted that manon facial scar was visible.
garrity also probed medina and walichiewicz motivations for testifying,emphasizing that medina had written a letter to the government explicitly offering to testify against manon in exchange for a motion under federal rule of criminal procedure b and similarly eliciting walichiewicz concession that he could obtain early release from prison only if the government filed such a motion on his behalf.he also questioned walichiewicz about his drug and alcohol abuse and mental illnesses,drawing the admission that he was continuously injecting himself with a mixture of cocaine and heroin during the relevant time period.garrity also presented an opening statement and closing argument emphasizing the theme that they have the wrong guy.
in sum,this is simply not a case in which defense counsel performance was tantamount to entitling manon to cronic presumed prejudice standard.theodore,at.rather,as we shall explain,we agree with the district court that most of counsel conduct was well within professional norms and that any flaws had no effect on the outcome.the constitution requires no more.see scarpa dubois,cir t he constitution pledges to an accused an effective defense,not necessarily a perfect defense or a successful defense.
c.the failure to mount a defense case 
manon complains that garrity failed to investigate and call witnesses who could have testified favorably in his defense.the attorney had designated two potential witnesses in advance of trial manon wife,alicia lópez,and his girlfriend son,tito geraldy.manon girlfriend,sara martinez,was neither on the list nor interviewed by garrity,although she and her children lived with manon during the relevant time period.manon complains that garrity was unaware of,or confused about,which woman was living with him.he points out that it made no sense for lópez to be a witness because she lived out of state and could provide no helpful testimony about events transpiring at manon home during the summer of.he argues that,by contrast,martinez and geraldy could have testified about the lack of drug distribution activity in their home and provided other testimony rebutting the accusations made by the cooperating witnesses.at the evidentiary hearing,manon testified that martinez was in the courtroom on the second day of the trial,along with lópez and geraldy,but that garrity told him it was unnecessary to call any witnesses because the case was won without their testimony.
although garrity was confused at the evidentiary hearing about the two,indeed,did not seem to be aware of confusion appears to be attributable to the limited information manon had provided to garrity about his personal life.garrity testified that manon had directed him to speak with lópez,not martinez,and that his notes did not reflect any reference to martinez.the possibility that garrity did not know about martinez because manon had not told him about her is reinforced by manon filings.in his third motion for new trial,filed with wiberg assistance,manon specifically raised the failure to call the two listed witnesses,lópez and geraldy,but made no reference to martinez in his specifications,manon again did not mention martinez and referred only to garrity failure to present testimony by either manon or one of the listed defense witnesses.
garrity explained that he originally had considered calling witnesses who knew manon well to reinforce the mistaken identity defense by highlighting that his distinctive features would be difficult to miss.ultimately,however,garrity concluded that it was inadvisable to put witnesses who lived with manon on the stand because he did want to confirm through a defense witness that in fact this individual,dario manon,lived at granite street because that would,in my mind,link the guy that the agent said was the seller,dario,and my client dario manon.
garrity also had other reasons for concern about what martinez and geraldy would say.although manon told garrity that the boy would confirm that manon had refused to sell drugs to an undercover agent who came to their home,garrity testified that his investigator interview with geraldy was totally inconsistent with manon account of what happened.garrity also testified that manon had changed his story multiple times during their conversations,and at one point had acknowledged involvement in the charged transactions 
the district court concluded that garrity made reasonable efforts to identify potential witnesses whose testimony would be favorable to manon and that his decisions not to call the witnesses available to him were defensible as tactical decisions.in our view,that assessment would be correct even if manon had,as he claimed,told garrity about martinez and asked the attorney to call her and geraldy as witnesses the investigator report showed that geraldy would not have provided the favorable testimony that manon said he could give,and there is no basis for thinking that martinez would have been a better witness.wiberg was unable to contact martinez before the evidentiary hearing and thus could not make a proffer of her likely testimony.given what he knew,garrity could reasonably conclude that the risk of putting martinez and geraldy on the stand would outweigh any possible benefit from their testimony.we therefore agree with the district court that garrity failure to call them as witnesses was not a lapse of professional judgment.see phoenix matesanz,cir noting that defense counsel decision whether to call a particular witness is almost always strategic and observing that strategic choices are virtually unchallengeable quoting strickland,at emphasis omitted.
although we need not reach the prejudice prong of the strickland test on this claim,much the same reasoning leads to the conclusion that manon can not show a probability that,but for counsel chosen strategy,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.indeed,it is more likely that testimony from martinez and geraldy would have harmed,rather than helped,manon defense.
failure to arrange in advance for a identification procedure 
after mccabe had testified,but before the government called walichiewicz and medina to the witness stand,garrity asked the district court to adopt measures to prevent the two remaining witnesses from seeing manon at the defense table as they testified.the court rejected the request,stating that it should have been made earlier and that garrity primary suggestion that a screen be placed in front of manon while the two men testified was impractical and pointless at the evidentiary hearing,wiberg argued that manon could have been seated in the gallery of the courtroom with other individuals to see if mccabe could pick him out of the crowd.
manon contends that garrity acted unreasonably in making the request for a identification procedure for medina and walichiewicz and,more importantly,in failing to make such a request at the proper time with respect to supposed misidentification of manon as the drug seller was a critical component of the defense theory.mccabe testified that he had seen manon for a total of about minutes to an hour in the course of the three sales at issue in this case.manon points to the officer failure to notice his obvious scars and asserts that mccabe identification of him also was challengeable based on identification problems.he insists that the missed opportunity to put mccabe on the spot rendered the misidentification theory wasted,null and void.
the district court,however,observed that it would have been extraordinarily risky in an identification case to use such a procedure with a trained police officer who,according to his testimony,had seen the defendant in daylight on multiple occasions.if he gets it right,the court asked,what does that do to the credibility of the officer testimony the court thus concluded that counsel failure to take such a risk did not amount to deficient performance i do think that kind of tactical judgment is one that can support an ineffective assistance claim.
we agree.a confident identification by mccabe would have been fatal to the defense theory,erasing any doubts about whether the officer had correctly identified the defendant as the dario from whom he had bought drugs.the circumstances strongly indicate that,in fact,the officer would have picked manon from a or other setting.the drug deals themselves,of course,are significant evidence of mccabe familiarity with,involving multiple encounters between the two men during daylight hours.in addition,manon had told garrity that mccabe had been at his home,both casually for a beer and in an attempt to buy drugs.mccabe identified manon in photographs two days after the last of the three charged transactions and the detective also was at the scene when manon was arrested after exiting granite street.indeed,garrity acknowledged at the evidentiary hearing that,based on what manon had told him,he had no reason to believe that any of the three witnesses would be unable to identify his client.mccabe failure to specifically refer to manon scars in describing him at trial does not diminish the force of this evidence,particularly where mccabe testified to other distinct facial features.
we thus discern no error in the district court determination that garrity acted within professional norms in not exposing mccabe to a identification procedure.again,while we need not explicitly address the question of prejudice,our determination on the performance prong effectively disposes of strickland prejudice prong as well.as we have described,had counsel performed with respect to this issue as manon claims he should have,the guilty verdict would have been even more likely.
admission of hearsay evidence 
medina letter to the prosecutor 
medina testified at trial that he offered to cooperate with law enforcement after garrity sent him a letter asking if he would be willing to discuss the acts alleged against manon.instead of responding to garrity,medina wrote to the prosecutor proposing a quid pro quo if the government provides me with a lawyer,and negotiate s a rule with me i will testify against dario manon.medina letter also admitted responsibility for drug trafficking 
i plead guilty to my charges,and i even plead guilty to conduct that was accountable to dario manon.i know the government case was strong against us.
both letters were introduced at trial,with garrity assent.
in his motions and at the evidentiary hearing,manon argued that garrity should have objected to the introduction of medina letter on hearsay grounds.garrity,however,testified that he had made the tactical decision not to object to the letter admission because it was useful to impeach medina by showing his motivation to assist the government.indeed,medina acknowledged during that he knew garrity had nothing to offer in exchange for his testimony,but that the government could ask the court to consider a reduced sentence under rule.
wiberg argued at the hearing that evidence of the proposed deal could have been obtained through testimony,or by means of an excerpt from the letter,and that introduction of the full the references to medina and manon h orribly prejudicial.the district court,however,observed that the letter was an extraordinarily valuable piece of evidence garrity exploited,that it needed to be presented in its entirety,and that the reference it contained to manon involvement in drug dealing was cumulative of medina testimony.the court said it viewed garrity decision to acquiesce in the admission of the letter as an astute tactical choice,not a ground for an ineffective assistance claim.
we have nothing to add to the district court evaluation of this claim,which correctly applied the first prong of the strickland analysis with deference to counsel professional judgment,united states,cir.
walichiewicz testimony 
the district court spent considerable time at the evidentiary hearing probing manon complaint that garrity committed prejudicial error by failing to object on hearsay grounds to testimony by walichiewicz explaining how he met manon.the testimony was as follows 
ausa how many opportunities did you have to see this dario manon back in june 
walichiewicz about five times.
ausa where is it that you saw him 
walichiewicz on the west side of manchester,i believe barr street and granite.
ausa and how is it that you saw him at that address 
walichiewicz i was brought there by a person that was a drug addict like myself.i was a heroin addict.
ausa what was that person name 
walichiewicz george kish.
ausa why did kish bring you to granite and barr 
walichiewicz he said there was a guy there that had drugs and that he offered to exchange for us to do some plumbing and install a bathroom for him,that he give us drugs.
walichiewicz testified that manon was the person for whom the work was to be done,and he identified manon in court.although walichiewicz testified that he and kish subsequently did the work for manon,at an apartment at granite and barr,he did not say whether they received the promised drugs.
wiberg argued at the evidentiary hearing that garrity should have anticipated that the prosecutor question about why kish brought walichiewicz to granite and barr might lead to problematic hearsay,and he thus should have objected to both the question and the resulting testimony.wiberg also argued that garrity should have objected to the testimony based on rule of evidence b,which bars admission of evidence of prior crimes or other acts to prove character.see.b.
the prosecutor explained that the testimony about the origin of the relationship between walichiewicz and manon was designed to reinforce the inference that manon was the dario with whom mccabe arranged drug deals at the cell phone number he got from walichiewicz.the prosecutor said he had not expected walichiewicz to bring up the offer of drugs in exchange for plumbing work garrity,too,indicated that he was surprised by walichiewicz response.garrity did not recall his thought process once he heard walichiewicz testimony,but assumed that he did not object at that point because walichiewicz had not named manon and he did not want to draw attention to the testimony.on by wiberg,however,garrity acknowledged that walichiewicz did identify manon as the individual requesting the work.garrity surmised that,at trial,he originally viewed the questioning as somewhat innocuous in that it was specific to manon,but then i have three people who are coming in to court saying he the guy,so that the statement with kish,i think,went by in the wash,and i do believe the government ever referred to it.
the district court minimized the objectionable aspects of the evidence,noting that it arguably was appropriate background evidence rather than inadmissible hearsay.the court also concluded that there a good argument that the evidence was admissible under rule b on the issue of identity that it would survive scrutiny under federal rule of evidence because its probative value was greater than its prejudicial effect and,hence,that there was no error in garrity failure to object to kish testimony.moreover,the court viewed any such error as harmless i n the face of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant guilt.
like the district court,we see no need to definitively resolve whether garrity failure to object to walichiewicz testimony satisfies the strickland requirement of deficient performance because manon can not make the requisite showing of prejudice.see,sleeper spencer,cir a reviewing court need not address both requirements if the evidence as to either is lacking.even without walichiewicz testimony about kish statements linking manon to drugs and to a residence in the area of granite and barr streets,the jury was confronted with substantial evidence of manon guilt.walichiewicz,medina and mccabe all identified him in court as the individual who sold drugs to mccabe.medina testified that manon introduced him to mccabe and that he saw manon give drugs to mccabe.the cell phone number that mccabe used to arrange the sales was linked to manon through walichiewicz,and the repeated use of that number was evidence of manon involvement in each transaction.the seller identified himself as dario,and manon was arrested in the area where the sales occurred after exiting the same building from which mccabe had seen the seller emerging.
although manon claims that garrity conduct denied him the opportunity to present evidence that would have undermined the credibility of the means of martinez and geraldy testimony and a identification jury was well aware of the cooperators and also knew that mccabe had no physical evidence proving that manon was dario.on this record,we can not conclude that there is a reasonable probability that exclusion of walichiewicz challenged testimony would have altered the outcome of the trial 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court judgment denying manon a new trial.

garrity testified that,initially,manon admitted selling the drugs but could understand that being a conduit could make him as culpable as someone who owned the drugs.over time,he challenged the drug amounts,telling garrity that he knew they were less than the government reported because he was involved in the dealing.later,he told garrity that he had not sold drugs and,in fact,had directed his son presumably referring to geraldy to send the agent away when he came by their home looking to buy some.garrity testified that,initially,manon admitted selling the drugs but could understand that being a conduit could make him as culpable as someone who owned the drugs.over time,he challenged the drug amounts,telling garrity that he knew they were less than the government reported because he was involved in the dealing.later,he told garrity that he had not sold drugs and,in fact,had directed his son presumably referring to geraldy to send the agent away when he came by their home looking to buy some.

procedures are meant,inter alia,to eliminate the risk that an eyewitness to a crime will describe the defendant physical appearance or identify the defendant as the person who committed the crime based on factors other than the witness example,because the witness sees the defendant at the defense table.among other reasons for denying garrity request for a screen,the district court noted that walichiewicz had seen manon in the cellblock where both of them had been held that morning and,as garrity acknowledged,medina apparently had had an extended association with manon.the court in effect concluded that,given the two witnesses prior familiarity with manon,his location at the defense table was not impermissibly suggestive.procedures are meant,inter alia,to eliminate the risk that an eyewitness to a crime will describe the defendant physical appearance or identify the defendant as the person who committed the crime based on factors other than the witness example,because the witness sees the defendant at the defense table.among other reasons for denying garrity request for a screen,the district court noted that walichiewicz had seen manon in the cellblock where both of them had been held that morning and,as garrity acknowledged,medina apparently had had an extended association with manon.the court in effect concluded that,given the two witnesses prior familiarity with manon,his location at the defense table was not impermissibly suggestive.
