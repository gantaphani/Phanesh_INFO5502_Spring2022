as long as human beings rather than computers preside over jury trials,slips of the tongue will occur.but not every such lapsus linguae requires setting aside a jury verdict.in this case,the trial judge slip of the tongue during jury instructions elicited no objection and,when considered in the context of the jury instructions as a whole,was highly unlikely to have muddled the jury understanding of the judge charge.because we find neither reversible error in this respect nor a shortfall in the district court sentencing determinations,we reject the defendant appeal.
background 
this case involves what is colloquially known as a black money scheme.see generally united states gayekpar,cir united states wright,cir.in october of,defendantappellant alvin pennue made the acquaintance of wendell bradford while both men were enjoying the scenery and liquid refreshments at a nightclub in providence,rhode island.the pair later met to discuss a possible business venture.the defendant showed bradford a bundle of black paper wrapped in cellophane and said that it was genuine united states currency,which had been dyed black in order to smuggle it out of africa.the defendant explained that the money could be cleaned by applying a combination of chemicals and sandwiching clean bills between the blackened bills.a demonstration ensued the defendant inserted a bill supplied by bradford between two pieces of black paper,sprinkled the sandwich with chemicals,wrapped it in aluminum foil,and applied pressure.after a short interval,he opened the sandwich and doused the paper with spring water.three clean bills emerged.
bradford was impressed but not convinced.he agreed,however,to meet with the defendant associate,anthony chadheen.the defendant and chadheen came to the service station where bradford worked.they showed him a color photograph of what was purported to be of black money.after witnessing another demonstration,bradford swallowed the bait and agreed to invest in a black money transformation in exchange for a share of the cleaned money.
things that seem too good to be true usually are.on october,bradford withdrew from a massachusetts bank and brought the cash to providence.in a hotel room there,the defendant and chadheen sandwiched bradford money between sheets purported to be black money.the defendant then took the sandwich into the bathroom,doused it with chemicals,wrapped it with foil and tape,and gave the package to bradford to hold telling him that it would take roughly thirty minutes for the cleaning process to run its course.the defendant and chadheen left bradford with the package,which proved to contain nothing but soggy black paper.
in the same time frame,another potential dupe mark falugo contacted the secret service about a similar scam.at the authorities behest,falugo called the defendant and discussed a prospective black money transformation.falugo offered to invest and indicated that he had a friend who might be willing to invest four times that amount.
as the sting evolved,fred mitchell,an undercover secret service agent,assumed the persona of falugo friend.falugo and mitchell met with the defendant and chadheen in warwick,rhode island.chadheen performed a cleaning demonstration for mitchell.as before,the process appeared to work,and chadheen allowed mitchell to keep the cleaned money two bills.mitchell was also shown glossy photographs of stacks of black money and what appeared to be genuine bills.
mitchell subsequently arranged to meet with the defendant and chadheen to clean a large sum of black money.he purported to bring in cash to the meeting.the defendant and chadheen showed him bundles of what they claimed to be blackened currency,which in fact consisted of nothing more than black construction paper.without further ado,the secret service arrested the defendant and chadheen.
a federal grand jury charged the defendant,inter alia,with two counts of passing altered obligations of the united states with intent to defraud,see,and one count of inducing the interstate transportation of currency with intent to defraud,see id.at trial,the government presented a plenitude of evidence,including testimony of bradford and mitchell,recordings of two of mitchell meetings with the scam artists,and tapes of various telephone conversations.the jury found the defendant guilty on all three counts.in due season,the district court sentenced the defendant to a month term of immurement.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the defendant challenges both his convictions and his sentence.we subdivide our analysis accordingly.
a.the convictions.
the defendant challenge to his convictions rests on a claim of instructional error.he argues that the jury charge was rendered infirm by a of the reasonable doubt standard.specifically,he points to the court statement that 
reasonable doubt exists when,after weighing and considering all the evidence using reasonable and common sense,jurors say that they have a settled conviction of the truth of the charge.on the other hand,reasonable doubt does not exist when,after weighing and considering all the evidence using reason and common sense,jurors can say that they have a settled conviction of the truth of the charge.
it is readily apparent that the first sentence is missing a negative it should have read,reasonable doubt exists when,after weighing and considering all the evidence using reasonable and common sense,jurors can not say that they have a settled conviction of the truth of the charge.emphasis supplied.given this bevue,the quoted portion of the court instruction twice defined the absence of reasonable doubt and never defined its presence.in the defendant view,this error impermissibly diluted the government burden of proof.
when as in this case an appellant claim is that the trial court jury instructions misstate the law,appellate review is ordinarily de novo.see united states barnes,cir united states pitrone,cir.here,however,the defendant did not object to the challenged instruction at trial,thus failing to call the slip to the court attention so that it could have been corrected.consequently,appellate review is for plain error.see johnson united states,d united states,cir.
the defendant resists this conclusion.he insists that,even though no objection was interposed below,the error was structural and,thus,demands automatic reversal.see,united states yakobowicz,cir.
this is wishful thinking.although the supreme court has recognized that an incorrect reasonable doubt instruction may constitute a structural error,see sullivan louisiana,d,it has made pellucid that,in the federal system,unpreserved claims of structural error are to be reviewed under the plain error standard,see johnson,at.consistent with this approach,we repeatedly have stated that plain error review is appropriate when a criminal defendant points out a defect in a reasonable doubt instruction for the first time on appeal.see united states jones,cir,at united states colon pagan,cir.that is the situation here.
the contours of plain error review are familiar.the appellant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.the appellant must carry the devoir of persuasion as to each part of this fourpart standard.see united states vega molina,cir.the defendant claim of instructional error stumbles at the third step.
manifestly,the first sentence in the quoted instruction contains an error.but not all errors in jury instructions affect a defendant substantial rights.in evaluating a flawed jury instruction,we look to whether the error was reasonably likely to have misled the jury.see united states troy,cir united states romero,cir.in conducting this tamisage,we do not assess the problematic instruction in isolation but,rather,inspect the jury charge as a whole.see united states van anh,cir united states cintolo,cir.
viewing the challenged instruction within this framework,it is evident that the instruction was unlikely to have clouded the jurors understa
