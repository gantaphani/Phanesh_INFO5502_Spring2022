marshall was indicted in and convicted in as an accessory before the fact to carpenter murder.the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc reversed that conviction in august.it reasoned that although the evidence did establish marshall active participation in,and presence during,the commission of the felony,the conviction could not stand where the conduct that was charged was required to have taken place before the felony was committed.commonwealth rodriguez.
following the sjc decision in rodriguez,the commonwealth then indicted marshall for murder.marshall moved to dismiss this latter indictment,arguing that the sjc earlier reversal had been based on insufficiency of the evidence and,hence,that the double jeopardy clause as incorporated against the states barred a second prosecution.in affirming the denial of his motion to dismiss,the sjc disagreed with marshall,holding that its earlier reversal had been based on a variance between the crime charged and the crime proved at trial under state law.marshall commonwealth.under both state and federal law,it held that a second prosecution following a reversal based on such a variance does not give rise to a double jeopardy problem.id.
marshall filed a petition for habeas relief under seeking to block his pending prosecution.on federal habeas review,the district court granted petitioner request for relief.marshall bristol cnty.superior court,d.the district court accepted petitioner double jeopardy argument.id.at.in addition,the district court held that a newly asserted and hence unexhausted ex post facto law argument did not preclude it from granting relief.id.at.the commonwealth has appealed.the issuance of the writ was stayed pending our review.
we reverse.we hold that,under tibbs florida,this court is bound by the sjc interpretation of its earlier reversal and the requirements of massachusetts law.bound as we are to accept the sjc interpretations of its own state law and its own decision in marshall of what it held in rodriguez,petitioner double jeopardy argument necessarily fails.we also reject petitioner ex post facto claim as patently without merit.
the facts and background of the case are set forth in the two sjc decisions.in the early morning of february,the victim,george carpenter,age,was socializing with friends at the home of donna medeiros,marshall mother.rodriguez,at.petitioner,his girlfriend,and his three friends robert tirado,jonathan torres,and heather lawrence arrived at the house soon after id.at.

the perpetrators left the victim unconscious on the street,and when police arrived they found him bloody and unconscious.id.carpenter died later that day as a result of acute internal hemorrhaging due to blunt force trauma.id.
the prosecution chose to indict marshall as an accessory before the fact to murder in the first degree under.laws ch,whoever aids in the commission of a felony,or is accessory thereto before the fact by counselling,hiring or otherwise procuring such felony to be committed,shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of the principal felon.rodriguez,at.marshall was not indicted for the murder itself.though the indictment charged him with acts before the murder was committed,the commonwealth proceeded at trial under an aiding the murder theory,not under an accessory before the fact theory.id.at.at the close of the state presentation of evidence,marshall counsel moved for a required finding of not guilty,arguing that no evidence had been presented that,before the beating,marshall had in any way counselled,hired,or otherwise procured the commission of the felony.id.the prosecutor agreed,but argued that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict on the aiding theory.id.the trial judge,reasoning that the crime of being an accessory before the fact is largely identical to the joint venture doctrine,denied the motion,and the jury convicted in february,id.at.
first sjc decision commonwealth rodriguez 
a,lionel rodriguez,and marshall appealed to the sjc.marshall argued that the denial of his motion was in error because there was insufficient evidence to convict him of being an accessory before the fact.id.at.the sjc agreed with marshall it reasoned first that the actions of one who aids and accessories before the fact are not the same,and are separate and distinct forms of accomplice liability.id.given this separate and distinct conclusion,the sjc reasoned,the indictment charging marshall improperly defined the offense on which he was tried and the trial court submitted the case to the jury with improper instructions,as it told the jury that they could convict marshall as an accessory before the fact if he aided in the commission of the murder of the victim.id.at.those instructions were in error because they were not consistent with the indictment,which charged conduct that took place before the felony was committed.id.at.
the sjc added that the evidence did establish marshall active participation in,and presence during,the commission of the felony,and noted that the state should have simply added marshall name to that portion of the indictment alleging murder,without reference to marshall acting as an accessory before the fact.id.the sjc concluded that because the evidence presented was legally insufficient to warrant a finding of marshall guilt as an accessory before the fact,marshall motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed.id.in a footnote,the sjc expressly noted that marshall could not be retried as an accessory before the fact.id.at.
second sjc decision marshall commonwealth 
the commonwealth indicted marshall again,this time charging him with murder for his involvement in the killing,pursuant to.laws ch.marshall moved to dismiss the indictment,claiming that the second prosecution was barred by double jeopardy,arguing that murder is a form or a species of lesser included offense to accessory before the fact to murder.marshall,at internal quotation marks omitted.the state trial judge who was not the original trial judge denied the motion,and marshall appealed to a single justice of the sjc pursuant to.laws ch.id.at.the justice reserved judgment and presented the issues to the full sjc.id.
the sjc rejected marshall argument and concluded that the second indictment was not barred by the double jeopardy clause as incorporated.the sjc began from the proposition that m urder,prosecuted on a theory of aiding and abetting,is not a lesser included offense of accessory before the fact to murder.rather,the two are different species of the same crime.marshall,at.the sjc rejected the portion of rodriguez that appeared to read aiding the commission of a felony to be a separate and distinct crime from acting as an accessory before the fact marshall,at.the marshall court reasoned that a lthough grounded in the language and structure of the statute,the rodriguez construction of goes too far,and is an outlier among our recent decisions regarding the scope of accomplice or joint venture liability.id.at.thus,marshall,addressing a question of state legislative interpretation,modified rodriguez interpretation of massachusetts murder statutes.
after interpreting the massachusetts aiding and abetting statute,the s
