petitioner everett connolly seeks the grant of habeas corpus vacating his state court convictions from for drug distribution and trafficking on the grounds that the state proceedings violated his federal confrontation clause rights,as articulated in melendez diaz massachusetts,d.the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc had acknowledged that there was melendez diaz error but found it harmless under a standard equivalent to the federal standard under chapman california,d.
on federal habeas review,the district court denied the petition,reasoning that the state courts had already found that the error was harmless and that the petitioner could not show sufficient injury under the highly deferential standards announced by the supreme court in brecht abrahamson,d,and fry pliler,d.see connolly roden,wl,at.
we affirm.we conclude that under the brecht standard of review,which is even more deferential than the ordinary standard of review under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,d,petitioner has failed to show the substantial and injurious effect or influence required to set aside the sjc affirmance of his conviction.fry,at quoting kotteakos united states.
the vast majority of the key facts of this case are undisputed.massachusetts law enforcement officers began investigating connolly for suspected cocaine distribution in.the investigation included surveillance and observation by police officers,which found connolly making numerous apparent drug sales using his minivan.commonwealth connolly.on two separate occasions in august,an undercover officer made controlled purchases of crack cocaine from connolly.during the first purchase,the undercover officer obtained what was later measured to be grams of crack cocaine for.in the second,the officer obtained grams of crack cocaine for.
in light of the controlled purchases,the police obtained an arrest warrant for connolly and a search warrant to search connolly minivan and its occupants.id.at.the warrants were executed on september.during the search of connolly minivan,the police found a large ball of crack cocaine wrapped in electrical tape and later determined to weigh grams,wedged under the dashboard.id.
connolly was indicted by a state grand jury in december on two counts of cocaine distribution and one count of cocaine trafficking see.laws ch,c distribution,b trafficking.at trial in august,the prosecution introduced several pieces of evidence to prove drug type and,as to the trafficking charge,quantity with respect to the controlled purchases,detective lieutenant john allen,who had years of experience in narcotics,testified that he had personally the substances at the time of each of the two august purchases and concluded that they were cocaine the undercover officer who made the purchases also testified that connolly had said the substances were crack cocaine.connolly,at.with respect to the cocaine found during the minivan search,sergeant john milos,who had investigated hundreds of cocaine distribution cases over seventeen years of experience,testified that field tests showed the ball recovered from the van was cocaine.id.trooper james bazzinotti,who had thirteen years of experience in conducting drug searches,further testified that the substance was cocaine,and that the ball looked like a baked potato,was bigger than a baseball,and was a large ball,hard,and was a very solid piece of cocaine.id.at.the jury also had direct physical access to the actual cocaine,which was sent to the jury room,although the ball was more flaked,more crushed up after the chemical analysis.id.at.
the melendez diaz problem in the case arose because the prosecution also introduced a certificate from the drug analysis laboratory explaining that the powder in the ball was cocaine and weighed grams,without calling the analyst as a witness and so not making the analyst available for confrontation.at the time the certificate was admitted,the judge instructed the jury that under massachusetts law,the prosecution was not required to offer live testimony from the analyst and could introduce the certificate alone without any adverse inferences being drawn due to the analyst absence.connolly objected to the admission of the certificate on fourth amendment grounds but not on confrontation clause grounds.he did not ask to the analyst who prepared the lab certificate,nor did he object to the jury instruction on confrontation clause grounds.the closing jury instructions allowed the jury to consider the laboratory certificate but cautioned that i t for you to determine whether you credit it or not y ou not compelled to accept it.
connolly theory of the case was that the prosecution had not adequately proven that he was the drug possessor.he identified potential weaknesses in the testimony of the government witnesses to argue that there was insufficient evidence that he was actually involved in the two controlled purchases or that he was aware that the ball of crack was in his van.connolly made no challenge to the quantity of crack for purpose of the trafficking charge.in fact,in closing arguments,his attorney appeared to accept the quantity at face value and challenged only identity,arguing t he commonwealth has to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that connolly knew that those grams w ere in his vehicle on the morning in question.i suggest to you there no proof of it.
the jury convicted connolly on all counts.following the conviction,connolly appealed to the massachusetts appeals court.in january,the sjc transferred the case to its own docket sua sponte for direct review.while the case was pending in the sjc,the supreme court decided melendez diaz massachusetts,which held that,absent a showing of unavailability,the introduction of a lab certificate without the opportunity to the technician who created it violates a defendant sixth amendment confrontation clause rights.at.following melendez diaz,connolly presented the narrow argument that his conviction must be reversed because the trial judge had given a contemporaneous jury instruction upon the introduction of the certificates stating that the prosecution was not required to produce the lab analyst,in violation of his confrontation clause rights.he had not raised that argument at any earlier point in the litigation.
the sjc read connolly argument charitably in his favor by considering not only the instruction but also whether admission of the certificates themselves was error.see connolly,at.it decided that there was melendez diaz error in admitting the certificates without presenting the analyst for,but rejected connolly claim that his conviction must be reversed on that account.using a state law standard analogous to the federal standard for harmless error and reading any potential waiver problem in connolly favor,the sjc reasoned that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the jury had ample evidence aside from the lab certificates from which it could have concluded that the quantity of cocaine was between and grams.id.at chapman california,d explaining that federal constitutional error is harmless only if the reviewing court can declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.it likewise rejected connolly other claims of error and affirmed the conviction.
connolly petitioned for habeas review in federal district court under.he argued that the state proceedings had violated,inter alia,his sixth amendment rights under melendez diaz for the first time,he argued that the prejudice came from the actual admission of the certificate without the analyst live testimony rather than from the contemporaneous jury instruction in a thorough opinion,the federal district court denied connolly petition.the court,applying the brecht standard,concluded that the erroneous admission of the chemical analyses did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict with respect to the weight of cocaine charged.connolly,wl,at.the court reasoned that although the jury likely did rely on the certificates,the significant amount of other evidence,including especially the jurors opportunity to directly examine the cocaine itself,meant that any injury from admitting the certificates was not substantial enough to allow habeas relief under brecht.id.
we review the district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo where,as here,the court has taken no evidence and has not made its own factual findings.see,kirwan spencer,cir.
we begin by describing the applicable legal standards regarding habeas and constitutional error.in,the supreme court in chapman california articulated the constitutional harmless error standard,which provides that,on direct appellate review,an error at trial affecting the defendant constitutional rights will be deemed harmless only if it can be shown to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.at.the court has also repeatedly made clear,however,that the standards that apply on collateral review may differ from those that would apply on direct review.see brecht,at.to that end,the court has held that a federal court on collateral review of a state appellate court application of chapman should not apply the same harmless error standard but instead should use an actual prejudice standard.id.at quoting united states lane,d internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,as the court explained in brecht abrahamson,a habeas petitioner in such a case must show that the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.id.quoting kotteakos united states.internal quotation marks omitted that was the law before congress intervened.
in,congress passed aedpa,which provides that a habeas petition may not be granted unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.in mitchell esparza,d per curiam,the court applied the aedpa standard to a state court use of chapman,explaining that when a state court determines that a constitutional violation is harmless under chapman,a federal court may not award habeas relief under unless the harmlessness determination itself was unreasonable.fry,at describing mitchell.
four years later,the court returned to this field in fry pliler.in fry,the state courts had not applied chapman to determine whether a constitutional error at trial was harmless.see id.at.without overruling esparza,the court ruled that the brecht standard still governs,regardless of whether the state court applied chapman.id.at.as the court explained,the combined standard announced in esparza,which requires only that the state court determination be unreasonable,is more liberal than the brecht actual prejudice standard.id.at.as a result,the court held,the brecht standard obviously subsumes the esparza standard,and federal courts need not formally apply both tests the brecht test alone is sufficient.id.at.
the courts of appeals have differed in their interpretations of fry.some have concluded that fry bars the use of the esparza standard entirely.see wood ercole,cir w e conclude that the unreasonable application of chapman standard does not survive fry.others have concluded that the supreme court mandated a test,under which a habeas petitioner must first show that the state court application of chapman was unreasonable under aedpa and then must show that the state proceedings had substantial and injurious effect or influence under brecht.see johnson acevedo,cir if the state court has conducted a analysis,the federal court must decide whether that analysis was a reasonable application of the chapman standard.if the answer is yes,then the federal case is over and no collateral relief issues if the answer is no either because the state court never conducted a analysis,or because it applied chapman unreasonably then d drops out of the picture and the federal court must apply the brecht standard to determine whether the error was harmless.emphasis added see also gongora thaler,cir per curiam contemplating process in dicta,reh g en banc denied,cert.denied,d.
still other circuits have adopted a flexible approach,explaining that a habeas court remains free to apply the esparza test and end the case if the state court decision was reasonable,but emphasizing that the court need not do that and may instead go straight to brecht with full confidence that the aedpa stringent standards will also be satisfied.ruelas wolfenbarger,cir this circuit has not yet weighed in on the issue 
we agree with the sixth circuit flexible approach.as that court noted,esparza has not been overruled consequently,we do not read fry to bar the use of the esparza test entirely.contra wood,at.at the same time,fry does explicitly state that it certainly makes no sense to require formal application of both tests.fry,at first emphasis added.thus,we do not follow those circuits that require a twostep process.instead,we note that fry established that the brecht standard is harder to satisfy than the esparza standard,and that any case where the petitioner can show prejudice under the brecht standard will necessarily meet the esparza aedpa standard.there is clear logic to that position if an error had a substantial and injurious effect on a jury verdict brecht standard,then it is necessarily unreasonable to conclude that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt esparza standard see ruelas,at.
given that logical framework,we conclude that when a state court decides that a constitutional error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under chapman,a federal court on habeas review may choose between two equally valid options.the court may apply esparza and then move on to the brecht test only if the state court decision was an unreasonable application of chapman.alternatively,the court may begin with the brecht test directly 
with this framework in mind,we turn to the facts of this case.this case lends itself to the first approach,because the petitioner has not met his burden to make the threshold showing that the sjc conclusion that any error was harmless under was unreasonable.
the error asserted,to be clear,is not that the lab reports contained factual inaccuracies or were unfairly prejudicial to the petitioner.rather,connolly asserts that the constitutional error was in denying him the opportunity to the lab technician who prepared the drug certificates.in fact,connolly brief to the sjc did not argue that the melendez diaz error prejudiced him as to the strength of the evidence of the weight of cocaine.instead,he focused on the instruction given with the admission of the certificates explaining that,under a state statute,an analyst was not needed to appear in person.this,he argued,prejudiced his ability to argue that the absence of the analyst was a weakness in the prosecution case.he did not argue to the sjc,nor does he now argue to us,that had he been able to confront the chemist,the outcome would have been different.
nonetheless,the sjc did consider whether the admission of the drug certificates themselves,not just the improper jury instruction,prejudiced connolly case.the sjc explained its reasoning as follows 
w e conclude that the melendez diaz error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.we consider first the sales the defendant made to the undercover agent and then the substance that was found in his minivan.an undercover officer testified that she bought from the defendant,in two controlled purchases shortly before his arrest,a substance that the defendant called crack cocaine.detective lieutenant john allen,an officer with years of experience in narcotics investigations,testified that he field tested the substances at the time of each purchase and each tested positive for cocaine.he was,of course,available for.moreover,the quantity sold was not essential for distribution purposes.see commonwealth terrelonge.
with respect to the cocaine found in the search of the defendant minivan,sergeant john milos,a police officer with approximately seventeen years of experience in narcotics investigations who had investigated high hundreds of cocaine distribution cases,was one of the officers who found the cocaine in that vehicle.he testified that he field tested chunks of the white substance recovered from the vehicle immediately aft
