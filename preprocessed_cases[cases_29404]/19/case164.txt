on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
we address in this case a procedural issue arising in a civil rights action brought under by michelle ortiz,a former inmate at the ohio reformatory for women.plaintiff below,petitioner here,ortiz filed a complaint in federal court stating key facts on which she based claims for damages against superintending prison officers.on two consecutive nights during her incarceration,ortiz stated,she was sexually assaulted by a corrections officer.although she promptly reported the first incident,she further alleged,prison authorities took no measures to protect her against the second assault.after that assault,ortiz charged,and in retaliation for accounts she gave of the two episodes,prison officials placed her,shackled and handcuffed,in solitary confinement in a cell without adequate heat,clothing,bedding,or blankets.the treatment to which she was exposed,ortiz claimed,violated her right,safeguarded by the eighth and fourteenth amendments,to reasonable protection from violence while in custody.
principal defendants in the suit,paula jordan,a case manager at ortiz living unit,and rebecca bright,a prison investigator,moved for summary judgment on their pleas of qualified immunity,a defense that shields officials from suit if their conduct d id not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald.finding that the qualified immunity defense turned on material facts genuinely in dispute,see fed.rule civ.proc.a,the district judge denied summary judgment.ortiz voinovich,supp,sd ohio.
the case then proceeded to trial,and the jury returned verdicts for ortiz against both jordan and bright.the two officers appealed to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit,targeting,inter alia,the denial of their pretrial motion for summary judgment.c ourts normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment motion after a trial on the merits,the court of appeals recognized.fed.appx.nevertheless,the court continued,denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an exception to this rule.ibid.reversing the judgment entered on the jury verdict,the appeals court held that both defendants were sheltered from ortiz suit by qualified immunity.
we granted review,to decide a threshold question on which the circuits are split may a party,as the sixth circuit believed,appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits our answer is no.the order retains its interlocutory character as simply a step along the route to final judgment.see cohen beneficial industrial loan.once the case proceeds to trial,the full record developed in court supersedes the record existing at the time of the summary judgment motion.a qualified immunity defense,of course,does not vanish when a district court declines to rule on the plea summarily.the plea remains available to the defending officials at trial but at that stage,the defense must be evaluated in light of the character and quality of the evidence received in court.
when summary judgment is sought on a qualified immunity defense,the court inquires whether the party opposing the motion has raised any triable issue barring summary adjudication.o nce trial has been had,however,the availability of official immunity should be determined by the trial record,not the pleadings nor the summary judgment record.wright,miller,cooper,federal practice procedure,ed.and supp.after trial,if defendants continue to urge qualified immunity,the decisive question,ordinarily,is whether the evidence favoring the party seeking relief is legally sufficient to overcome the defense.see fed.rule civ.proc.a,b stating conditions on which judgment may be granted as a matter of law.

the day of her conversation with ortiz,jordan wrote an incident report describing her version of the encounter.in that account,jordan stated that ortiz had refused to name her assailant or provide any other information about the assault.jordan did not immediately notify her superiors of the assault ortiz reported and ortiz consequent fears about her safety.taking the incident report home in her workbag,jordan submitted it upon her return to work two days later.
ortiz endeavored to follow jordan advice about staying in the company of friends.but later in the day,feeling ill,she returned to her room and fell asleep.three other inmates were in the room when ortiz went to sleep.they were gone when she awoke to find schultz standing over her,one hand fondling her left breast,the fingers of the other hand inside her underwear penetrating her vagina.
bright investigation began two days after the second assault.during its course,bright placed ortiz in solitary confinement.ortiz maintained that bright isolated her in retaliation for her accusations against schultz.bright,however,testified that she segregated ortiz because ortiz continued to discuss the investigation with other inmates,disobeying bright repeated instructions to refrain from speaking about it.
in her action,ortiz claimed that jordan did nothing to ward off schultz second sexual assault,despite jordan awareness of the substantial risk of that occurrence.bright,ortiz charged,retaliated against her because she resisted bright efforts to induce her to retract her accounts of schultz assaults.schultz,having resigned from state employment,could not be found and served with process.the district court,noting multiple factual disputes material to ortiz claims and the officers defense of qualified immunity,denied summary judgment to jordan and bright,supp,at neither defendant appealed the district court denial of summary judgment.

we clarified in johnson jones,that immediate appeal from the denial of summary judgment on a qualified immunity plea is available when the appeal presents a purely legal issue,illustratively,the determination of what law was clearly established at the time the defendant acted,at.however,instant appeal is not available,johnson held,when the district court determines that factual issues genuinely in dispute preclude summary adjudication.ibid.
