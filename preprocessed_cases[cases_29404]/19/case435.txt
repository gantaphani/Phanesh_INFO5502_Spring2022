appellant alejandro figueroa lugo figueroa appeals from his conviction for knowing possession of child pornography in violation of a b.we affirm.
on march,figueroa was charged with one count of knowingly possess ing one or more matters which contained visual depictions of one or more minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct,in violation of a b.pursuant to,the indictment also sought criminal forfeiture of the compaq presario computer that had been seized from figueroa bedroom.on july,following a trial,the jury found figueroa guilty as charged in the indictment.at a subsequent sentencing hearing,the district court sentenced him to months of imprisonment,to be followed by eight years of supervised release.
figueroa appeals the court denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure.united states figueroa lugo,d.he contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convict him of a violation of a b because the government failed to prove that the people in the images and videos were actual children,and that figueroa possession of any child pornography was knowing additionally,figueroa appeals three of the district court jury instruction rulings the decision to give a willful blindness instruction,the decision not to instruct the jury as to the affirmative defense provided in c that the defendant promptly and in good faith took steps to destroy the child pornography that he possessed,and the refusal to give his proposed inconsistent mental state jury instruction.
in analyzing a claim that the district court erred in denying a motion for judgment of acquittal,we must affirm the conviction if after de novo review of the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the government,we conclude that a rational factfinder could find that the government proved the essential elements of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.united states.marin,cir see also united states.chiaradio,cir applying the standard in a child pornography case.such a standard of review is formidable,and a defendant who challenges a conviction on the basis of insufficient evidence confronts an uphill battle on appeal.united states rodríguez,cir.r aising a plausible theory of innocence does the defendant no good,because the issue is not whether a jury rationally could have acquitted but whether it rationally could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states seng tan,cir.
a.the government 
locating the defendant 
on january,at the request of law enforcement in puerto rico,lieutenant glenn lang lang,supervisor of the maine state police computer crimes unit,conducted a networking investigation to determine whether child pornography was being transmitted to puerto rico over the internet.lang,an expert in computer forensics and networking,checked limewire,a program that allows users who install it on their computers to set up folders and share files with other limewire users.in order to find consumers of child pornography,lang accessed a number of databases containing lists of files that police officers had identified as child pornography.using global unique identifiers,lang was able to obtain a list of the top offenders in san juan,puerto rico by identifying the internet protocol ip addresses of the limewire users who had accessed the greatest number of files tagged as child pornography in the police databases.at the top of that list was ip address,which police databases indicated was sharing files of child pornography through limewire by the time lang conducted his investigation in january.from november,through early,the only user of ip address was the household of fernando figueroa,the father of appellant alejandro figueroa.caribe net,an internet service provider in puerto rico,assigned that ip address to fernando figueroa account.it was caribe net practice to assign only one ip address to a single residential address,even if several individuals used multiple computers within the residence.
in the names for the files associated with ip address,lang identified several terms commonly used in child pornography files,including pthc for preteen hard core,pedophilia,pedo,hussyfan,and child porn.for example,lang testified that on january,a video file with the title porn pthc vicki stripping and sucking kiddie pedo illegal underage preteen.mpg was shared with ip address.lang indicated that the file was a fairly large video file in what called the vicki series and shows a girl stripping down who gets down on her knees and performs oral sex on an adult male.
lang mailed the results of his child pornography database search to the homeland security investigations hsi directorate of immigration and customs enforcement ice in puerto rico.agent harold simmons julsrud,iii,a criminal investigator and forensics agent in the cyber crimes group of hsi,received the information,and,through caribe net,learned the physical address associated with ip address.he then obtained a search warrant for the residence.
the fruits of the search 
at on may,agent julsrud and other hsi cyber crimes unit agents executed the search warrant at the figueroa residence.appellant and his parents,fernando figueroa and bárbara lugo,were present.the agents seized nine computers and eight loose hard drives,as well as thumb drives,dvds,cds,and videotapes.they found one of the computers,a compaq presario desktop computer,on a desk in the appellant bedroom,turned on with several sessions of mozilla firefox internet browser open.
special agent luis manuel colón of ice,an in computer forensics,performed a forensic examination of all the computers and media devices seized from the home.he found child pornography on the compaq presario desktop computer seized from the appellant bedroom,but not on any of the other devices taken from the residence.on that computer,agent colón discovered eighteen still images and seven videos that contained minors in lasciv i ous exhibition of the genitalia.limewire software had been installed on the computer on september,and updated on march.the only user name on the computer was the alejandro account.
all of the still images of child pornography on that computer were stored in the alejandro my documents limewire saved folder.the images had not been deleted,and all were accessible to the computer user.the images were identified by file names such as jenny nude with legs spread wide apart showing lolita r pthc ptsc ddogprn pedo young child sex preteen hussyfan kiddie kiddy porn and old yo underage child daughter childsex childfugga childlover ptsc pthc lsm lsn pedo rape torture cum ass pussy hussyfan mafiasex dick sandra teen model bd.
similarly,all seven child pornography videos had not been deleted and were accessible to the computer user.those videos were saved on figueroa computer in limewire folders,including c drive documents and settings alejandro my documents limewire incomplete and c drive documents and settings alejandro my documents my chat logs limewire incomplete new folder.the videos saved in a folder with the word incomplete in its title were accessible to the user through both limewire and windows.
anner bonilla rivera 
bonilla,a software engineer for hewlett packard,was the first to testify for figueroa.he sought to establish that various programs found on figueroa computer could have been responsible for opening the child pornography files,rather than figueroa himself.specifically,bonilla testified that the anti virus software avira accesses every file on the computer to determine whether it is infected with a virus.he stated that t here no way to know if the last access date was changed by an or by a user or by any other windows application that opened it.he similarly testified that t here no way to know if pc health virus,also found on figueroa computer,modified any of the files containing child pornography.bonilla testified that a user does not have to open files on limewire to be able to download them.
figueroa testified that he downloaded child pornography from limewire inadvertently,stating that,when i would observe it and would see child pornography,i would erase it.figueroa estimated that he might have downloaded and viewed more than videos of child pornography and more than still images of child pornography,but he could not provide an exact number.he insisted that if he thought an image or video was child pornography,he would erase it.he also maintained that not all of the images and videos shown at trial look like child pornography.although he admitted that he had searched on his computer for the terms young and sex together,he believed that google would filter out any images of girls younger than.
figueroa further testified that he used limewire to create his own youtube videos,typing in search terms to retrieve movies,photographs,and music.when he conducted those limewire searches,he would sometimes see child pornography,but he would erase it because he was interested in it.figueroa recounted an instance in which he looked for a soccer video by searching for the terms best goal ever,but instead received a video of a girl taking off her clothes and dancing nude.he deleted the video.
figueroa recounted a time when he was playing an online video game and met a person online who was trying to pass for being a girl.the girl asked figueroa if he wanted her to send him pictures of her naked,to which he allegedly responded,how old are you when the girl answered,i over,figueroa said,okay,that fine.the girl then sent him photographs of her breasts,her vagina and her buttocks.subsequently,the girl had a conversation with another player in the online video game,which figueroa saw,and told the player that she was only figueroa acknowledged that he kept the photographs the girl had sent him in his email account until federal agents seized his computer on may,at which time figueroa used a university computer to delete the pictures from his email account.
figueroa challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence 
to support his claim that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he knowingly possessed the child pornography found on his computer,figueroa makes the following arguments none of the witnesses at trial could scientifically establish that he purposely intended to download any pornography,and any child pornography he did download was inadvertent,the seven videos and eighteen images were only partially downloaded and were therefore inaccessible to him,whenever he inadvertently downloaded child pornography he deleted it,software on his computer could have accessed and modified any child pornography on his computer,he afforded access to his computer to a number of other people,any of whom could have downloaded the child pornography,and finally the government failed to establish that the images depicted actual children.we address each of these arguments in turn.
intent to download child pornography 
figueroa contends that if his searches on limewire yielded child pornography results that were in turn downloaded onto his computer,it was inadvertent.the record suggests otherwise.
agent colón,the computer forensics expert who examined figueroa computer,testified that the seven videos and eighteen images of child pornography were all contained in limewire folders on figueroa computer.files obtained through limewire can not automatically download onto a computer.a user would have to actively search for files and then select them by clicking to download those files.lieutenant lang an expert in computer forensics and networking,explained that a limewire user employs the program search tab to type in words such as preteen hard core,or pthc,which the user hopes will appear in a file name.consistent with agent colón testimony,lang testified that when limewire search results show a file that contains the desired search term,the user must click on the file before it will download.
based on this testimony,a rational jury could have found that,in order to retrieve files with names such as porn pthc vicki stripping and sucking kiddie pedo illegal underage preteen or naked penis preteen vagina little girls ass year old panties gay hussyfan lolitaguy pussy pedo kiddie porn,figueroa used search terms associated with child pornography.he then intentionally downloaded the files that the limewire network had shared with him in response to those search requests before any child pornography would be downloaded to the limewire folders on his computer.see united states breton,cir a defendant use of search terms associated with child pornography can support a finding that the defendant knew the images he retrieved contained child pornography.
inaccessible partially downloaded files 
figueroa asserts that files on his computer that were not fully downloaded were inaccessible.such a contention is rebutted by lieutenant lang and agent colón trial testimony.lang testified that under limewire default settings a file will initially go to the incomplete folder and remain there until the file is complete ly downloaded,at which point it will move over to a saved folder.videos and still images can be viewed by a computer user when they are located in a limewire incomplete folder.in fact,lang noted,an illicit file could remain in an incomplete folder for a long time,possibly even for years,and be viewed there.
agent colón testified that a file that has not been fully downloaded on limewire has a t preceding its file name.once the file is completely downloaded,the t notation is removed and the file is automatically transferred to the saved folder.if someone attempts to view a partially downloaded file through limewire,the word preview is added to the t notation in the file name.noting this testimony,figueroa argues that,because none of the video files had preview in their titles,he could not have accessed them.
such an assertion is plainly contradicted by the trial record.colón testified that the files could have been accessed via windows explorer,and no preview notation would be added to the file name furthermore,colón testified that a particular child pornography image had been accessed via windows explorer.accordingly,a jury could have found that at all times the partially downloaded files were accessible to figueroa.
deletion of child pornography 
figueroa insists that whenever any unwanted child pornography was downloaded to his computer,he immediately deleted the same.the trial testimony rebuts this claim.
at the time of the trial,seven videos and eighteen still images of child pornography were on figueroa computer.agent colón explained that one of the child pornography files in question,year old jenny nude with legs spread wide apart,was created on march,had been saved in a computer folder with figueroa name and profile,and was still available to the computer user when the computer was seized on may.in addition,on april,the windowsxp operating system on figueroa computer created a file just minutes after another child pornography file was downloaded onto the computer.agent colón testified that the file was located in the same limewire folder where the child pornography videos were found,which showed that the user accessed the file using windows explorer.the child pornography video had not been deleted rather,the windows operating system created a little icon that would allow the images to be accessed more quickly in the future.the images of child pornography remained on figueroa computer when it was seized.moreover,bonilla,figueroa own expert,acknowledged in cross examination that eighteen still images and seven videos containing child pornography were found on figueroa computer and that none of the files had been deleted,scrubbed or sanitized by software.
furthermore,figueroa admitted at trial to having downloaded child pornography and failing to delete it from his computer.when asked by the government attorney,you admit that you had child pornography downloaded and you have seen it,correct figueroa responded,when i know it has been downloaded,yes.the prosecutor then asked,the truth is that this image of child pornography,you did not delete,correct to which figueroa responded,yes.figueroa deletion claim is groundless.
anti virus software 
figueroa asserts that other software such as an antivirus program could have been responsible for accessing or modifying the files on his computer that contained child pornography.however,he does not contend that software was responsible for downloading child pornography onto his computer in the first place.agent colón did find an avira software program on figueroa computer,but testified that an program would not change the date on which a file was created,nor would it be capable of downloading child pornography.figueroa own computer networking expert,bonilla,admitted that software can not download child pornography onto a computer.
other users access to figueroa computer 
figueroa argues that the child pornography found on his computer could have been downloaded by a number of people to whom he afforded access or even by an unknown party capable of breaking into his home router signal.figueroa testified,however,that he was the primary user of the computer located in his bedroom and that he downloaded limewire.figueroa acknowledged that he likely downloaded and viewed more than videos and images of child pornography after he installed limewire on his computer 
hernandez so how many other child pornography images or videos did you download into your computer that you had to erase 
figueroa well,when i would check them and see that i had downloaded child pornography,i would erase them.it was a good amount.
hernandez so how many videos would you say that you downloaded 
figueroa i do know a specific number,but it was a good amount.
hernandez and you admit,then,that you have downloaded child pornography through limewire 
figueroa admitting in the sense that i did know what i was downloading,and then i would observe it and would see child pornography,i would erase it.
hernandez so how many other videos of child pornography have you seen,other than the ones that we found in your computer now,that you deleted more than one hundred 
figueroa yes,but that does mean that i would see the entire video.
in addition,all of the child pornography videos found on figueroa computer were saved to the computer c drive in a file titled documents and settings alejandro my documents limewire incomplete and all of the still images were saved to the folder alejandro my documents limewire saved folder.from this evidence a rational jury could conclude that it was figueroa,not one of his friends or an unknown user,who downloaded the files.see united states koch,cir stating that a conviction was supported by the fact that user names on both the computer and flash drive on which child pornography were found were variations on the defendant first name.moreover,agent colón testified that figueroa used his personal email address to chat on the computer within minutes of the creation of child pornography files.
furthermore,multiple child pornography files were created on the computer at times between and,suggesting that figueroa himself downloaded the files.see united states salva morales,cir per curiam asserting that because downloaded child pornography files were accessed between and,it is a reasonable inference that the defendant was the one accessing the files at these times.figueroa admitted that the room in which the compaq presario desktop computer was found was his bedroom.there was no evidence that anyone else slept in the room or was present during the early morning hours.
figueroa argues that the time at which the files were downloaded is irrelevant because when files are selected as part of a bulk download,limewire can not begin all the downloads simultaneously.he contends that files that were downloaded at could have been selected early during the day but downloaded at a later time.figueroa presented no evidence at trial to suggest that limewire files selected for download do not begin to download immediately.in fact,agent colón testified that a limewire file begins to download the moment the user selects the file for download.the jury was permitted to accept as true agent colón testimony.
images of actual children 
finally,figueroa claims that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the still images and videos contained depictions of actual children engaged in sexually explicit activity.in a child pornography case,t he prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the image is of an actual child in order to establish guilt.united states rodriguez pacheco,cir.however,t here is no per se rule that the prosecution is required to produce expert testimony in every case to establish that the depicted child is real,for either guilt or sentencing purposes.united states hoey,cir.rather,juries are capable of distinguishing between real and virtual images,without expert assistance.rodriguez pacheco,at.
in the instant case,the prosecutors showed the jury eighteen still images and seven videos of alleged child pornography found on figueroa computer.despite the fact that it was not required to do so,the government also presented expert testimony that the images and videos contained actual minors.agent colón,who had performed computer forensics work in dozens of child pornography cases,testified that he found images and videos that contained minors in lasciv i ous exhibition of the genitalia on figueroa computer.lieutenant lang,who had investigated hundreds of child pornography cases,examined the files associated with figueroa ip address and stated,yes,that definitely child pornography.he testified that he recognized one of the videos associated with figueroa ip address because he had previously seen the video in another child pornography case,which had an identified victim and was a bad piece of child pornography.the images and videos introduced into evidence,in conjunction with the testimony of two experts,were sufficient for a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the files on figueroa computer depicted images of actual children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
for all of the reasons stated above,figueroa sufficiency of the evidence argument fails 
when the defendant preserves an objection to a jury instruction,we generally review the form and wording of the instruction for an abuse of discretion,while reviewing de novo any claim of legal error embodied in the instruction.united states gonzalez,cir see also united states díaz arias,cir properly preserved challenges to jury instructions are reviewed de novo,taking into account the charge as a whole and the body of evidence presented at trial.internal quotation marks omitted.a district court decision to give a particular instruction,over a party objection,constitutes reversible error only if the instruction was misleading,unduly complicating,or incorrect as a matter of law and adversely affected the objecting party substantial rights.united states stark,cir quoting faigin kelly,cir.even an incorrect instruction will not warrant reversal if it was harmless.united states mcdonough,cir.
a district court refusal to give a requested instruction is reviewed de novo.united states baird,cir.to succeed with a claim of error,a defendant must have presented sufficient evidence that he was entitled to the instruction.id.the initial threshold determination we must make is whether the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the defense,can plausibly support the theory of the defense.united states gamache,cir emphasis omitted.accordingly,if the evidence in the record does not support a requested affirmative defense,a district court is not required to include it.see,united states guevara,cir holding that the district court did not err in declining to give the defendant proposed entrapment instruction because the record lacked evidence to support that affirmative defense.
assuming that the defendant satisfies this initial burden,we will reverse a district court decision to deny the instruction only if the instruction was substantively correct as a matter of law,not substantially covered by the charge as rendered,and integral to an important point in the case so that the omission of the instruction seriously impaired the defendant ability to present his defense.baird,at.we decide each step in that analysis de novo.id.
willful blindness instruction 
a willful blindness instruction is appropriate if a defendant claims a lack of knowledge,the facts suggest a conscious course of deliberate ignorance,and the instruction,taken as a whole,can not be misunderstood as mandating an inference of knowledge.united states azubike,cir.
figueroa argues that the district court willful blindness instruction unduly influenced and confused the jury by allowing them to convict him of a violation of a b with a mens rea of less than knowingly.the court instructed the jury 
in deciding whether a defendant acted knowingly,you may infer that the defendant had knowledge of a fact if you find that he deliberately closed his eyes to a fact that otherwise would have been obvious to him.
the court decision to give a willful blindness instruction,and the text of that instruction,satisfy each of the three elements of the test articulated in united states azubike.first,figueroa primary defense in this case was that he did not knowingly download child pornography.throughout the trial,figueroa denied knowing that the child pornography specified in the indictment was on his computer.figueroa attorney asked him at trial,when was the first time that you ever saw any of these videos or photographs to which figueroa replied,now,here.
second,the facts presented at trial suggest at times a conscious course of deliberate ignorance.id.for example,figueroa asserted that fellow university students and fellow neighbors used his computer,insinuating that someone else downloaded child pornography onto his computer.in fact,if other people downloaded some files with these explicit file names onto figueroa computer,and saved them in a limewire folder bearing his name,one that figueroa used frequently,a jury could reasonably conclude that figueroa closed his eyes to a fact that otherwise would have been obvious to him.similarly,figueroa asserted that his innocuous limewire searches for music yielded child pornography results.figueroa testified that when he downloaded the bambina child pornography file found on his computer he had intended to download photographs,music and videos of el bambino,a recording artist.the bambina file was saved to the folder entitled c documents and settings alejandro mydocuments my chat logs limewire incomplete new folder.to the extent that figueroa inadvertently downloaded child pornography when he searched for el bambino,and that he subsequently saved that file in a folder bearing his name,and did so numerous times,suggests a deliberate ignorance of the child pornography on his computer.
third,taken as a whole,the instruction can not be misunderstood as mandating an inference of knowledge.id.the district court instructed the jury that,in determining whether figueroa acted knowingly,they may infer that he had knowledge if they found he deliberately closed his eyes.emphasis added.such an instruction gave the jury discretion to decide whether figueroa acted knowingly.see united states anthony,cir rejecting a defendant argument that the willful blindness instruction given at his trial would lead a jury to convict based on reckless ignorance rather than deliberate ignorance.
finally,contrary to figueroa contention that the instruction allowed the jury to convict him of a violation of a b by a less stringent requirement than knowingly,a willful blindness instruction is one way in which a jury can permissibly find that a defendant acted knowingly.see nancy torresen,revisions to pattern criminal jury instructions for the district courts of the first circuit,available at http instruction willful blindness as a way of satisfying knowingly in deciding whether defendant acted knowingly,you may infer that defendant had knowledge of a fact if you find that deliberately closed eyes to a fact that otherwise would have been obvious to.the district court did not err in providing the willful blindness jury instruction.
b.the affirmative defense set forth in c 
figueroa contends that the district court erred when it failed to address the c affirmative defense in its jury instructions.the affirmative defense states in relevant part 
c it shall be an affirmative defense to a charge of violating paragraph of subsection a that the defendant 
possessed less than three matters containing any visual depiction proscribed by that paragraph and 
promptly and in good faith,and without retaining or allowing any person,other than a law enforcement agency,to access any visual depiction or copy thereof 
a took reasonable steps to destroy each such visual depiction 
after the jury instructions were read,figueroa objected to the district court failure to include the affirmative defense instruction.the district court declined to give the instruction because there are more than three images of child pornography in this case.in his brief on appeal,figueroa insists that this ruling of the district court took from the jury its duty to determine whether each alleged image depicted a minor and whether this particular minor was engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
figueroa suggestion that the failure to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense meant that the government no longer had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly possessed images of actual children engaged in pornographic acts is simply not accurate.the district court instructed the jury that to find figueroa guilty of knowing possession of child pornography 
y ou must be convinced that the government had proven each of these things beyond a reasonable doubt first,that the defendant knowingly possessed one or more matters which the defendant knew contained a visual depiction of one or more minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct that one or more of the visual depictions is of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct a minor is a person under the age of years.child pornography is any photograph,film,video,picture,computer image or computer generated image of sexually explicit conduct that was produced using an actual person under the age of engaging in sexually explicit conduct the word knowingly as that term has been used from time to time in these instructions,means that the act was done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident.
as these instructions make clear,the court instructed the jury that in order to find figueroa guilty,the government had to prove each element of a b including that the possession was done knowingly and that the images depicted actual minors beyond a reasonable doubt.
to the extent that figueroa is arguing,however inartfully,that the jury could have found that he possessed fewer than three depictions of child pornography and is entitled to the affirmative defense on that basis an argument that the district court seemed to impute to him,the evidence simply does not support the instruction.in our de novo review of whether figueroa was entitled to the affirmative defense,we must ask whether the evidence,taken in the light most favorable to figueroa,plausibly supported his requested affirmative defense instruction.see gamache,at stating that a criminal defendant is entitled to an instruction on his theory of defense so long as the theory is a valid one and there is evidence in the record to support it.as already noted in our discussion of other users access to figueroa computer as part of our sufficiency of the evidence analysis,supra,figueroa acknowledged on that,prior to the seizure of his computer,he had downloaded and viewed a good amount of child pornography.when the prosecutor asked him if he had seen and deleted m ore than one hundred videos,figueroa replied,yes,but that does mean that i would see the entire video.the prosecutor then asked if he downloaded and viewed more than still images of child pornography to which figueroa responded,i t may be,because i do know an exact number.when the prosecutor showed figueroa the eighteen still images of child pornography found on his computer,figueroa admitted that he had not deleted any of them.
on this record,if a jury found that figueroa knowingly possessed child pornography,it would have to find that he possessed more than two such images.the district court therefore did not err when it decline
