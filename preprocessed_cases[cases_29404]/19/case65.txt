a part of the federal bank fraud statute,makes it a crime to knowingly execut e a scheme to obtain property owned by,or under the custody of,a bank by means of false or fraudulent pretenses.petitioner kevin loughrin was charged with bank fraud after he was caught forging stolen checks,using them to buy goods at a target store,and then returning the goods for cash.the district court declined to give loughrin proposed jury instruction that a conviction under required proof of intent to defraud a financial institution.the jury convicted loughrin,and the tenth circuit affirmed.
held section does not require the government to prove that a defendant intended to defraud a financial institution.
a section requires only that the defendant intend to obtain bank property and that this end is accomplished by means of a false statement.no additional requirement of intent to defraud a bank appears in the statute text.and imposing that requirement would prevent from applying to cases falling within the statute clear terms,such as frauds directed against a custodian of property.loughrin construction would also make a mere subset of,which prohibits any scheme to defraud a financial institution.that view is untenable because those clauses are separated by the disjunctive or,signaling that each is intended to have separate meaning.and to read clause as fully encompassing clause contravenes two related interpretive canons that different language signals different meaning,and that no part of a statute should be superfluous.
b loughrin claims that his view is supported by similar language in the federal mail fraud statute and by federalism principles,but his arguments are unpersuasive.
in mcnally united states,this court interpreted similar language in the mail fraud statute,which served as a model for to set forth just one offense,despite the use of the word or.but the two statutes have notable textual differences.the mail fraud law contains two phrases strung together in a single,unbroken sentence,whereas two clauses have separate numbering,line breaks,and equivalent indentation all indications of separate meaning.moreover,congress likely did not intend to adopt mcnally interpretation when it enacted,because at that time three years before mcnally every court of appeals had interpreted the word or in the mail fraud statute in its usual,disjunctive sense.and while mcnally found that unique features of the mail fraud statute history supported its view,the legislative history surrounding the adoption of points the other way.
loughrin also contends that without an element of intent to defraud a bank,would apply to every minor fraud in which the victim happens to pay by check.this,he says,would unduly expand the reach of federal criminal law into an area traditionally left to the states.but this argument ignores a significant textual limit on reach the criminal must acquire or attempt to acquire the bank property by means of the misrepresentation.that language limits application to cases like this one in which the misrepresentation has some real connection to a federally insured bank,and thus to the pertinent federal interest.

kevin loughrin,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
a provision of the federal bank fraud statute,makes criminal a knowing scheme to obtain property owned by,or in the custody of,a bank by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.the question presented is whether the government must prove that a defendant charged with violating that provision intended to defraud a bank.we hold that the government need not make that showing.
petitioner kevin loughrin executed a scheme to convert altered or forged checks into cash.pretending to be a mormon missionary going in a neighborhood in salt lake city,he rifled through residential mailboxes and stole any checks he found.sometimes,he washed,bleached,ironed,and dried the checks to remove the existing writing,and then filled them out as he wanted other times,he did nothing more than cross out the name of the original payee and add another.and when he was lucky enough to stumble upon a blank check,he completed it and forged the accountholder signature.over several months,loughrin made out six of these checks to the retailer target,for amounts of up to.his modus operandi was to go to a local store and,posing as the accountholder,present an altered check to a cashier to purchase merchandise.after the cashier accepted the check which,remarkably enough,happened time after time,loughrin would leave the store,then turn around and walk back inside to return the goods for cash.
each of the six checks that loughrin presented to target was drawn on an account at a federally insured bank,including bank of america and wells fargo.employees in target back office identified three of the checks as fraudulent,and so declined to submit them for payment.target deposited the other three checks.the bank refused payment on one,after the accountholder notified the bank that she had seen a man steal her mail.target appears to have received payment for the other two checks,though the record does not conclusively establish that fact.see brief for united states.
the federal government eventually caught up with loughrin and charged him with six counts of committing bank fraud one for each of the altered checks presented to target.the federal bank fraud statute,provides as follows 
whoever knowingly executes,or attempts to execute,a scheme or artifice 
to defraud a financial institution or 
to obtain any of the moneys,funds,credits,assets,securities,or other property owned by,or under the custody or control of,a financial institution,by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises 
shall be fined not more than or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
ruling for a reason not material here that circuit precedent precluded convicting loughrin under the statute first clause,the district court allowed the case to go to the jury on the statute second.
the court instructed the jury that it could convict loughrin under that clause if,in offering the fraudulent checks to target,he had knowingly executed or to execute a scheme or artifice to obtain money or property from the banks on which the checks were drawn by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.app.loughrin asked as well for another instruction the jury,he argued,must also find that he acted with intent to defraud a financial institution.app.to pet.for cert.the court,however,declined to give that charge,and the jury convicted loughrin on all six counts.
the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit affirmed.see.as relevant here,it rejected loughrin argument that a conviction under requires proof that he intended to defraud the banks on which the altered checks had been drawn.at.that intent,the court reasoned,is necessary only under the bank fraud law first clause.the court acknowledged that under its interpretation,cast s a wide net for bank fraud liability,but concluded that such a result is dictated by the plain language of the statute.at.
we granted certiorari,to resolve a circuit split on whether requires the government to show that a defendant intended to defraud a federally insured bank or other financial institution we now affirm the tenth circuit decision.
we begin with common ground.all parties agree,as do we and the courts of appeals,that requires that a defendant knowingly execute,or attempt to execute,a scheme or artifice with at least two elements.first,the clause requires that the defendant intend to obtain any of the moneys or other property owned by,or under the custody or control of,a financial institution.we refer to that element,more briefly,as intent to obtain bank property.brief for united states,brief for petitioner.and second,the clause requires that the envisioned result,the obtaining of bank property occur by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.see brief for united states reply brief.loughrin does not contest the jury instructions on either of those two elements.nor does he properly challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting them here 
the single question presented is whether the government must prove yet another element that the defendant intended to defraud a bank.as loughrin describes it,that element would compel the government to show not just that a defendant intended to obtain bank property as the jury here found,but also that he specifically intended to deceive a bank.see reply brief.and that difference,loughrin claims,would have mattered in this case,because his intent to deceive ran only to target,and not to any of the banks on which his altered checks were drawn.
but the text of precludes loughrin argument.that clause focuses,first,on the scheme goal obtaining bank property and,second,on the scheme means a false representation.we will later address how the means component of imposes certain inherent limits on its reach.see infra,at.but nothing in the clause additionally demands that a defendant have a specific intent to deceive a bank.and indeed,imposing that requirement would prevent from applying to a host of cases falling within its clear terms.in particular,the clause covers property owned by the bank but in someone else custody and control say,a home that the bank entrusted to a real estate company after foreclosure thus,a person violates plain text by deceiving a custodian into giving up bank property that it holds.yet under loughrin view,the clause would not apply to such a case except in the presumably rare circumstance in which the fraudster intent to deceive extended beyond the custodian to the bank itself.his proposed inquiry would thus function as an limit on the clause compass.
and loughrin construction of becomes yet more untenable in light of the rest of the bank fraud statute.that is because the first clause of,as all agree,includes the requirement that a defendant intend to defraud a financial institution indeed,that is whole sum and substance.see brief for united states brief for petitioner.to read the next clause,following the word or,as somehow repeating that requirement,even while using different words,is to disregard what or customarily means.as we have recognized,that term ordinary use is almost always disjunctive,that is,the words it connects are to be given separate meanings.united states woods,slip,at.yet loughrin would have us construe the two entirely distinct statutory phrases that the word or joins as containing an identical element.and in doing so,his interpretation would make second clause a mere subset of its first if,that is,implicitly required intent to defraud a bank,it would apply only to conduct already falling within.loughrin construction thus effectively reads or to mean including a definition foreign to any dictionary we know of.
as that account suggests,loughrin view collides as well with more general canons of statutory interpretation.we have often noted that when congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another let alone in the very next provision this court presume s that congress intended a difference in meaning.russello united states,citation omitted.and here,as just stated,overriding that presumption would render second clause superfluous.loughrin view thus runs afoul of the cardinal principle of interpretation that courts must give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.williams taylor,citation omitted 
loughrin makes two principal arguments to avoid the import of the statute plain text.first,he relies on this court construction of comparable language in the federal mail fraud statute to assert that congress intended merely to explicate the scope of prohibition on scheming to defraud a bank,rather than to cover any additional conduct.and second,he contends that unless we read the second clause in that duplicative way,its coverage would extend to a vast range of fraudulent schemes,thus intruding on the historic criminal jurisdiction of the states.neither argument is without force,but in the end,neither carries the day.
d espite appearances,loughrin avers,has no independent meaning it merely specifies part of what already encompasses.brief for petitioner.to support that concededly counterintuitive argument,loughrin invokes our decision in mcnally united states,interpreting similar language in the mail fraud statute.that law,which served as a model for,see neder united states,prohibits using the mail to further any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.loughrin rightly explains that,despite the word or,mcnally understood that provision as setting forth just one offense using the mails to advance a scheme to defraud.the provision back half,we held,merely codified a prior judicial decision applying the front half in other words,the back clarified that the front included certain conduct,rather than doing independent work,at.according to loughrin,we should read the bank fraud statute in the same way.
but the two statutes,as an initial matter,have notable textual differences.the mail fraud law contains two phrases strung together in a single,unbroken sentence.by contrast,two clauses have separate numbers,line breaks before,between,and after them,and equivalent indentation thus placing the clauses visually on an equal footing and indicating that they have separate meanings.the legislative structure thus reinforces the usual even if not mcnally understanding of the word or as meaning well,or rather than,as loughrin would have it,including.
moreover,loughrin reliance on mcnally encounters a serious chronological problem.congress passed the bank fraud statute in,three years before we decided that case.and at that time,every court of appeals to have addressed the issue had concluded that the two relevant phrases of the mail fraud law must be read in the disjunctive and construed independently.at citing,united states clapps,united states states.mcnally disagreed,eschewing the most natural reading of the text in favor of evidence it found in the drafting history of the statute clause.but the congress that passed the bank fraud statute could hardly have predicted that mcnally would overturn the lower courts uniform reading.we thus see no reason to doubt that in enacting,congress said what it meant and meant what it said,see connecticut nat.bank germain,that it both said or and meant or in the usual sense.
and a peek at history,of the kind mcnally found decisive,only cuts against loughrin reading of the bank fraud statute.according to mcnally,congress added the mail fraud statute second,clause merely to affirm a decision of ours interpreting the ban on schemes to defraud the second clause,mcnally reasoned,thus worked no substantive change in the law.see,at discussing congress codification of durland united states.by contrast,congress passed the bank fraud statute to disapprove prior judicial rulings and thereby expand federal criminal law scope and indeed,partly to cover cases like loughrin.one of the decisions prompting enactment of the bank fraud law,united states maze,involved a defendant who used a stolen credit card to obtain food and lodging.substitute a check for a credit card and maze becomes loughrin.the government brought charges of mail fraud,relying on mailings between the merchants and issuing bank to satisfy the statute mailing element.but the court held those mailings insufficiently integral to the fraudulent scheme to support the conviction.see,at.hence,maze created a serious gap in federal jurisdiction over frauds against banks.congress passed to fill that gap,enabling the federal government to prosecute fraudsters like maze and loughrin.we will not deprive that enactment of its full effect because mcnally relied on different history to adopt a reading of a similar provision.
loughrin also appeals to principles of federalism to support his proffered construction.unless we read as requiring intent to defraud a bank,loughrin contends,the provision will extend to every fraud,no matter how prosaic,happening to involve payment with a check even when that check is perfectly valid.consider,for example,a con a fraudster sells something to a customer,misrepresenting its value.there are countless variations,but let say the fraudster passes off a cheap as a louis vuitton handbag.the victim pays for the bag with a good check,which the criminal cashes.voila,loughrin says,bank fraud has just happened unless we adopt his narrowing construction.after all,the criminal has intended to obtain property under the custody or control of the bank the money in the victim checking account,and has made false or fraudulent representations the lies to the victim about the handbag but if the bank fraud statute were to encompass all such schemes,loughrin continues,it would interfere with matters squarely within the traditional criminal jurisdiction of the state courts.brief for petitioner.we should avoid such a sweeping expansion of federal criminal law,he concludes,by reading,just like,as requiring intent to defraud a bank.reply brief quoting cleveland united states.
we agree with this much of what loughrin argues unless the text requires us to do so,we should not construe as a plenary ban on fraud,contingent only on use of a check rather than cash.as we have often and recently repeated,we will not be quick to assume that congress has meant to effect a significant change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction.bond united states,slip,at quoting united states bass,see cleveland,at we resist the government reading because it invites us to approve a sweeping expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction in the absence of a clear statement by congress jones united states,similar.just such a rebalancing of criminal jurisdiction would follow from interpreting to cover every pedestrian swindle happening to involve payment by check,but in no other way affecting financial institutions.indeed,even the government expresses some mild discomfort with federalizing frauds that are only tangentially related to the banking system.brief for united states.
but in claiming that we must therefore recognize an invisible element,loughrin fails to take account of a significant textual limitation on reach.under that clause,it is not enough that a fraudster scheme to obtain money from a bank and that he make a false statement.the provision as well includes a relational component the criminal must acquire or attempt to acquire bank property by means of the misrepresentation.that phrase typically indicates that the given result the end is achieved,at least in part,through the specified action,instrument,or method the means such that the connection between the two is something more than oblique,indirect,and incidental.see,webster third new international dictionary defining by means of as through the instrumentality of by the use of as a means oxford english dictionary ed.defining means as a n instrument,agency,method,or course of action,by the employment of which some object is or may be attained,or which is concerned in bringing about some result in other words,not every cause will do.if,to pick an example out of a hat,jane traded in her car for money to take a bike trip,no one would say she crossed the rockies by means of a car,even though her sale of the car somehow figured in the trip she took.the relation between those things would be as the government puts it too tangential to make use of the phrase at all appropriate.brief for united states.
section by means of language is satisfied when,as here,the defendant false statement is the mechanism naturally inducing a bank or custodian of bank property to part with money in its control.that occurs,most clearly,when a defendant makes a misrepresentation to the bank itself say,when he attempts to cash,at the teller window,a forged or altered check.in that event,the defendant seeks to obtain bank property by means of presenting the forgery directly to a bank.but no less is the counterfeit check the means of obtaining bank funds when a defendant like loughrin offers it as payment to a third party like target after all,a merchant accepts a check only to pass it along to a bank for payment and upon receipt from the merchant,that check triggers the disbursement of bank funds just as if presented by the fraudster himself.so in either case,the forged or altered check,the false statement serves in the ordinary course as the means or to use other words,the mechanism or instrumentality of obtaining bank property.to be sure,a merchant might detect the fraud as target sometimes did and decline to submit the forged or altered check to the bank.but that is to say only that the defendant scheme to obtain bank property by means of a false statement may not succeed.and we have long made clear that such failure is irrelevant in a bank fraud case,because punishes not completed frauds,but instead fraudulent scheme s.neder,at.
by contrast,the cases loughrin hopes will unnerve us exemplified by the handbag swindle do not satisfy means requirement recall that in such a case the check is perfectly valid so the check itself is not as it was here a false or fraudulent means of obtaining bank money.and the false pretense that has led,say,the handbag buyer to give a check to the fraudster has nothing to do with the bank that will cash it no one would dream of passing on to the bank as target would forward a forged check the lie that a is a louis vuitton.the bank involvement in the scheme is,indeed,wholly fortuitous a function of the victim paying the fraudster by valid check rather than cash.of course,the bank would not have disbursed funds had the misrepresentation never occurred,and in that sense,the lie counts as a cause of the bank payment.but as we have said,by means of language requires more,see supra,at it demands that the defendant false statement is the mechanism naturally inducing a bank or custodian to part with its money.and in cases like the handbag swindle,where no false statement will ever go to a financial institution,the fraud is not the means of obtaining bank property 
the premise of loughrin federalism argument thus collapses.he claims that we must import an unstated element into to avoid covering frauds,properly of concern only to states.but in fact,the text of already limits its scope to deceptions that have some real connection to a federally insured bank,and thus implicate the pertinent federal interest.see,at noting that federal jurisdiction is based on the fact that the victim of the offense is a federally controlled or insured institution and loughrin own crime,as we have explained,is one such scheme,because he made false statements,in the form of forged and altered checks,that a merchant would,in the ordinary course of business,forward to a bank for payment.see supra,at.we therefore reject loughrin reading of and his challenge to his conviction 
for the reasons stated,we affirm the judgment of the tenth circuit.
it is so ordered.
