enacted in,the sex offender registration and notification act sorna makes it a federal crime for,inter alia,any person who is required to register under sorna,and who travels in interstate or foreign commerce,to knowingly fai l to register or update a registration,a.before sorna enactment,petitioner carr,a registered sex offender in alabama,relocated to indiana without complying with the latter state registration requirements.carr was indicted under.the federal district court denied carr motion to dismiss,which asserted that the prosecution would violate the constitution ex post facto clause because he had traveled to indiana before sorna effective date.carr then pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison.affirming the conviction,the seventh circuit held that does not require that a defendant travel postdate sorna and that reliance on a defendant travel poses no ex post facto problem so long as the defendant had a reasonable time to register but failed to do so,as had carr.
held section does not apply to sex offenders whose interstate travel occurred before sorna effective date.
a the court rejects the government view that a requires a conviction,subsequent interstate travel,and then a failure to register,and that only the last of these events must occur after sorna took effect.the court instead accepts carr interpretation that the statute does not impose liability unless a person,after becoming subject to sorna registration requirements,travels across state lines and then fails to register.that interpretation better accords with a text,the first element of which can only be satisfied when a person is required to register under sorna.a.that sets forth the travel requirement in the present tense travels rather than in the past or present perfect traveled or has traveled reinforces this conclusion.see,united states wilson.and because the dictionary act provision that statutory words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present,implies that the present tense generally does not include the past,regulating a person who travels is not readily understood to encompass a person whose only travel occurred before the statute took effect.indeed,there appears to be no instance in which this court has construed a verb in a criminal law to reach preenactment conduct.the statutory context also supports a construction of travels.first,the word travels is followed in a b by a series of other present tense verbs enters or leaves,or resides.a statute undeviating use of the present tense is a striking indic ator of its prospective orientation.gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay foundation.second,the other elements of a violation are similarly set forth in the present tense sections a and a refer,respectively,to any person who is required to register under sorna and who knowingly fails to register or update a registration.emphasis added.had congress intended preenactment conduct to satisfy first two requirements but not the third,it presumably would have varied the verb tenses,as it has in numerous other federal statutes.
b the government two principal arguments for construing the statute to cover travel are unpersuasive.
the claim that such a reading avoids an anomaly in the statute coverage of federal versus state sex offenders is rejected.section imposes criminal liability on two categories of persons who fail to adhere to sorna registration requirements any person who is a sex offender by reason of a conviction under federal law,a a,and any other person required to register under sorna who travels in interstate or foreign commerce,a b.the government assertion that a jurisdictional reach should have comparable breadth as applied to both federal and state sex offenders is little more than ipse dixit.it is entirely reasonable for congress to have assigned the federal government a special role in ensuring compliance with sorna registration requirements by federal sex offenders,who typically would have spent time under federal criminal supervision.it is similarly reasonable for congress to have given the states primary responsibility for supervising and ensuring compliance among state sex offenders and to have subjected such offenders to federal criminal liability only when,after sorna enactment,they use interstate commerce channels to evade a state reach.the seventh circuit erred in analogizing to g,which prohibits convicted felons from possess ing in commerc e any firearm or ammunition.according to the lower court,a,like g,uses movement in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element to establish a constitutional predicate for the statute,not to create a temporal requirement.however,the proper analogy here is not between the travel of a sex offender and the movement of a firearm,but between the sex offender who travels and the convicted felon who possesses.the act of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a jurisdictional predicate for,but it is also,like the act of possession,the very conduct at which congress took aim.
also unavailing is the government invocation of one of sorna purposes,to locate sex offenders who failed to abide by their registration obligations.the government argument confuses sorna general goal with specific purpose.section is not a response to the problem of missing sex offenders it is embedded in a broader statutory scheme enacted to address deficiencies in prior law that had enabled sex offenders to slip through the cracks.by facilitating the collection of information and its dissemination among jurisdictions,these other provisions,not,stand at the center of congress effort to account for missing sex offenders.while subjecting travelers to punishment under may well be consistent with the aim of finding missing sex offenders,a contrary construction in no way frustrates that broad goal.taking account of sorna overall structure,there is little reason to doubt that congress intended to do exactly what it says to subject to federal prosecution sex offenders who elude sorna registration requirements by traveling in interstate commerce.
none of the legislative materials the government cites as evidence of sorna purpose calls this reading into question.to the contrary,the house judiciary committee report suggests not only that a prohibition on postenactment travel is consonant with congress goals,but also that it is the rule congress in fact chose to adopt.
c because liability can not be predicated on travel,the court need not address whether the statute violates the ex post facto clause.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
since,federal law has required states,as a condition for the receipt of certain law enforcement funds,to maintain federally compliant systems for registration and community notification.in an effort to make these state schemes more comprehensive,uniform,and effective,congress in enacted the sex offender registration and notification act sorna or act as part of the adam walsh child protection and safety act,pub,tit.i,stat.among its provisions,the act established a federal criminal offense covering,inter alia,any person who is required to register under sorna,travels in interstate or foreign commerce,and knowingly fails to register or update a registration.a.at issue in this case is whether applies to sex offenders whose interstate travel occurred prior to sorna effective date and,if so,whether the statute runs afoul of the constitution prohibition on ex post facto laws.see art.i,cl.liability under,we hold,can not be predicated on travel.we therefore do not address the ex post facto question.
in may,petitioner thomas carr pleaded guilty in alabama state court to sexual abuse.he was sentenced to years imprisonment,with all but two years suspended.receiving credit for time previously served,carr was released on probation on july,and he registered as a sex offender as required by alabama law.
in late or early,prior to sorna enactment,carr relocated from alabama to indiana.he did not comply with indiana registration requirements.in july,carr came to the attention of law enforcement in fort wayne,indiana,following his involvement in a fight.
on august,federal prosecutors filed an indictment in the united states district court for the northern district of indiana charging carr with failing to register in violation of.carr moved to dismiss the indictment,asserting that because he traveled to indiana prior to sorna effective date,it would violate the ex post facto clause to prosecute him under.the district court denied carr motion,and carr entered a conditional guilty plea,preserving his right to appeal.he received a prison sentence.
the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit consolidated carr appeal with that of a similarly situated defendant,who,in addition to raising an ex post facto claim,asserted that,by its terms,does not apply to persons whose interstate travel preceded sorna enactment.beginning with the statutory argument,the court of appeals held that does not require that the defendant travel postdate the act.united states dixon.the court relied principally on its understanding of sorna underlying purpose 
the evil at which the act is aimed is that convicted sex offenders registered in one state might move to another state,fail to register there,and thus leave the public unprotected.the concern is as acute in a case in which the offender moved before the act was passed as in one in which he moved afterward.ibid.citation omitted.
the court drew an analogy to g,which prohibits convicted felons from possess ing in or affecting commerc e any firearm or ammunition.the danger posed by such a felon is unaffected by when the gun crossed state lines,and so it need not have crossed after the statute was passed.at citing scarborough united states.according to the court,a,like g,uses movement in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element to establish a constitutional predicate for the statute rather than to create a temporal requirement.at.
reading to encompass travel,the seventh circuit recognized,created a conflict with the tenth circuit decision in united states husted.in holding that coverage is limited to those individuals who travel in interstate commerce after the act effective date,the tenth circuit emphasized congress use of the present tense form of the verb to travel,which according to ordinary english grammar,does not refer to travel that has already occurred.at.rejecting this analysis,the seventh circuit characterized congress choice of tenses as not very revealing.at quoting scarborough,at.
having dispensed with the statutory question,the seventh circuit considered the claim of carr and his that predicating a prosecution on travel violates the ex post facto clause.reliance on a defendant travel,the court concluded,poses no ex post facto problem so long as the defendant had reasonable time to register after sorna took effect but failed to do so,at.noting that carr remained unregistered five months after sorna became applicable to him,the seventh circuit affirmed his conviction,at.the court reversed the conviction of carr,finding that he had not been given a sufficient grace period to register.
in view of the division among the circuits as to the meaning of travel requirement we granted certiorari,to decide the statute applicability to travel and,if necessary,to consider the statute compliance with the ex post facto clause 
as relevant here,provides 
a in general.whoever is required to register under the sex offender registration and notification act a is a sex offender as defined for the purposes of the sex offender registration and notification act by reason of a conviction under federal law including the uniform code of military justice,the law of the district of columbia,indian tribal law,or the law of any territory or possession of the united states or b travels in interstate or foreign commerce,or enters or leaves,or resides in,indian country and knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by the sex offender registration and notification act shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
for a defendant to violate this provision,carr and the government agree,the statute three elements must be satisfied in sequence,culminating in a failure to register.brief for united states see also reply brief for petitioner.a sequential reading,the parties recognize,helps to assure a nexus between a defendant interstate travel and his failure to register as a sex offender.persons convicted of sex offenses under state law who fail to register in their state of conviction would otherwise be subject to federal prosecution under even if they had not left the state after being convicted an illogical result given the absence of any obvious federal interest in punishing such state offenders 
while both parties accept that the elements of should be read sequentially,they disagree on the event that sets the sequence in motion.in the government view,the statute is triggered by a conviction,which must be followed by interstate travel,and then a failure to register under sorna.only the last of these events,the government maintains,must occur after sorna took effect the predicate conviction and the travel may both have predated the statute enactment.carr,in contrast,asserts that the statutory sequence begins when a person becomes subject to sorna registration requirements.the person must then travel in interstate commerce and thereafter fail to register.all of these events,carr avers,necessarily postdate sorna enactment because a sex offender could not have been required to register under sorna until sorna became the law.
carr interpretation better accords with the statutory text.by its terms,the first element of a can only be satisfied when a person is required to register under the sex offender registration and notification act.a emphasis added.in an attempt to reconcile its preferred construction with the words of the statute,the government insists that this language is merely a shorthand way of identifying those persons who have a conviction in the classes identified by sorna.brief for united states.to reach this conclusion,the government observes that another provision of sorna,a,states that the act registration requirements apply to sex offender s.a sex offender is elsewhere defined as an individual who was convicted of a sex offense.thus,as the government would have it,congress used words and two implied to establish that the first element of a is that a person has been convicted of a sex offense.such contortions can scarcely be called shorthand.it is far more sensible to conclude that congress meant the first precondition to liability to be the one it listed first a require ment to register under sorna.once a person becomes subject to sorna registration requirements,which can occur only after the statute effective date,that person can be convicted under if he thereafter travels and then fails to register 
that sets forth the travel requirement in the present tense travels rather than in the past or present perfect traveled or has traveled reinforces the conclusion that preenactment travel falls outside the statute compass.consistent with normal usage,we have frequently looked to congress choice of verb tense to ascertain a statute temporal reach.see,united states wilson,congress use of a verb tense is significant in construing statutes gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay foundation,congress could have phrased its requirement in language that looked to the past,but it did not choose this readily available option barrett united states,observing that congress used the present perfect tense to denot e an act that has been completed the dictionary act also ascribes significance to verb tense.it provides that,i n determining the meaning of any act of congress,unless the context indicates otherwise,words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present.by implication,then,the dictionary act instructs that the present tense generally does not include the past.accordingly,a statute that regulates a person who travels is not readily understood to encompass a person whose only travel occurred before the statute took effect.indeed,neither the government nor the dissent identifies any instance in which this court has construed a verb in a criminal law to reach preenactment conduct 
in this instance,the statutory context strongly supports a construction of travels.first,the word travels is followed in a b by a series of other present tense verbs enters or leaves,or resides in,indian country.emphasis added.this court has previously described a statute undeviating use of the present tense as a striking indic ator of its prospective orientation.gwaltney,at.the seventh circuit thought otherwise,reasoning that it would mak e no sense for a sex offender who has resided in indian country since long before the act was passed to be subject to the act but not someone who crossed state lines before the act was passed.at.as a textual matter,however,it is the seventh circuit approach that makes little sense if travels means traveled a person travels if he crossed state lines before sorna enactment,then the only way to avoid an incongruity among neighboring verbs would be to construe the phrase resides i n indian country to encompass persons who once resided in indian country but who left before sorna enactment and have not since returned an implausible reading that neither the seventh circuit,nor the government,nor the dissent endorses.
second,the other elements of a violation are similarly set forth in the present tense.sections a and a refer,respectively,to any person who is required to register under sorna and who knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by sorna.emphasis added.the government accepts that this last element a knowing failure to register or update a registration must postdate sorna enactment.had congress intended preenactment conduct to satisfy the first two requirements of but not the third,it presumably would have varied the verb tenses to convey this meaning.indeed,numerous federal statutes use the tense to describe one or more elements of a criminal offense when coverage of preenactment events is intended.see,a b iii supp.proscribing hate crimes in which the defendant employs a firearm,dangerous weapon,explosive or incendiary device,or other weapon that has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce emphasis added g ed.proscribing firearm possession or transport by any person who has been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence emphasis added a,supp.ii making it unlawful for any person to receive or distribute a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct that has been mailed,or has been shipped or transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce emphasis added.the absence of similar phrasing here provides powerful evidence that targets only postenactment travel 
echoing the seventh circuit assessment that congress use of verbs in is not very revealing,brief for united states,the government offers two principal arguments for construing the statute to cover travel first,such a reading avoids an anomaly in the statute coverage of federal versus state sex offenders and second,it better effectuates the statutory purpose.at capitalization omitted.neither argument persuades us to adopt the government strained reading of the statutory text.
section imposes criminal liability on two categories of persons who fail to adhere to sorna registration requirements any person who is a sex offender by reason of a conviction under federal law,the law of the district of columbia,indian tribal law,or the law of any territory or possession of the united states,a a,and any other person required to register under sorna who travels in interstate or foreign commerce,or enters or leaves,or resides in,indian country,a b.according to the government,these categories correspond to two alternate sources of power to achieve congress aim of broadly registering sex offenders.at.placing travelers within the statute coverage,the government maintains,ensures that the jurisdictional reach of section a has a comparable breadth as applied to both federal and state sex offenders.at.
the government pronouncement that should have an equally broad sweep with respect to federal and state offenders,at,is little more than ipse dixit.had congress intended to subject any unregistered state sex offender who has ever traveled in interstate commerce to federal prosecution under,it easily could have adopted language to that effect.that it declined to do so indicates that congress instead chose to handle federal and state sex offenders differently.there is nothing anomal ous about such a choice.to the contrary,it is entirely reasonable for congress to have assigned the federal government a special role in ensuring compliance with sorna registration requirements by federal sex offenders persons who typically would have spent time under federal criminal supervision.it is similarly reasonable for congress to have given the states primary responsibility for supervising and ensuring compliance among state sex offenders and to have subjected such offenders to federal criminal liability only when,after sorna enactment,they use the channels of interstate commerce in evading a state reach.
in this regard,it is notable that the federal registration laws have,from their inception,expressly relied on enforcement.indeed,when it initially set national standards for state registration programs in,congress did not include any federal criminal liability.congress instead conditioned certain federal funds on states adoption of criminal penalties on any person required to register under a state program who knowingly fails to so register and keep such registration current.jacob wetterling crimes against children and sexually violent offender registration act,pub,tit.xvii,c,stat,d.two years later,congress supplemented state enforcement mechanisms by subjecting to federal prosecution any covered sex offender who changes address to a state other than the state in which the person resided at the time of the immediately preceding registration and knowingly fails to register as required.pam lychner sexual offender tracking and identification act of,pub,stat,g,i the prospective orientation of this provision is apparent.no statutory gap necessitated coverage of unregistered offenders who change d address before the statute enactment the prosecution of such persons remained the province of the states.
in enacting sorna,congress preserved this basic allocation of enforcement responsibilities.to strengthen state enforcement of registration requirements,congress established,as a funding condition,that e ach jurisdiction,other than a federally recognized indian tribe,shall provide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term of imprisonment that is greater than year for the failure of a sex offender to comply with the requirements of this subchapter.e meanwhile,congress in exposed to federal criminal liability,with penalties of up to years imprisonment,persons required to register under sorna over whom the federal government has a direct supervisory interest or who threaten the efficacy of the statutory scheme by traveling in interstate commerce.
understanding the act of travel as an aspect of the harm congress sought to punish serves to distinguish from the statute to which the seventh circuit analogized.see,at.in scarborough,this court held that a prior version of the statute,which imposed criminal liability on any convicted felon who possesses in commerce or affecting commerce any firearm,at quoting app.a ed,did not require the government to prove postenactment movement of the firearm across state lines.according to the court,congress had given no indication of any concern with either the movement of the gun or the possessor or with the time of acquisition.at.its aim was simply to keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons,and,by using the phrase in commerce or affecting commerce,it invoked the full breadth of its commerce clause authority to achieve that end.no one in scarborough disputed,however,that the act of possession had to occur postenactment a felon who possess ed a firearm only preenactment was plainly outside the statute sweep.in this case,the proper analogy is not,as the seventh circuit suggested,between the travel of a sex offender and the movement of a firearm it is between the sex offender who travels and the convicted felon who possesses.the act of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a jurisdictional predicate for,but it is also,like the act of possession,the very conduct at which congress took aim.
in a final effort to justify its position,the government invokes one of sorna underlying purposes to locate sex offenders who had failed to abide by their registration obligations.sorna,the government observes,was motivated at least in part by congress concern about these missing sex offenders a problem the house committee on the judiciary expressly linked to interstate travel the most significant enforcement issue in the sex offender program is that over sex offenders,or nearly in the nation,are missing,meaning they have not complied with sex offender registration requirements.this typically occurs when the sex offender moves from one state to another.pt.the goal of tracking down missing sex offenders,the government maintains,is surely better served by making section applicable to them in their new states of residence immediately than by waiting for them to travel in interstate commerce and fail to register yet again.brief for united states.the court of appeals expressed a similar view.see,at 
the government argument confuses a general goal of sorna with the specific purpose of.section is not a response to the problem of missing sex offenders it is embedded in a broader statutory scheme enacted to address the deficiencies in prior law that had enabled sex offenders to slip through the cracks.see congress in this chapter establishes a comprehensive national system for the registration of sex offenders among its many provisions,sorna instructs states to maintain registries that compile an array of information about sex offenders,to make this information publicly available online,to share the information with other jurisdictions and with the attorney general for inclusion in a comprehensive national registry,and to provide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term of imprisonment that is greater than year for the failure of a sex offender to comply with the requirements of this subchapter,e.sex offenders,in turn,are required to register,and keep the registration current,in each jurisdiction where the offender resides,where the offender is an employee,and where the offender is a student,a,and to appear in person periodically to allow the jurisdiction to take a current photograph,and verify the information in each registry in which that offender is required to be registered,by facilitating the collection of information and its dissemination among jurisdictions,these provisions,not,stand at the center of congress effort to account for missing sex offenders.
knowing that congress aimed to reduce the number of noncompliant sex offenders thus tells us little about the specific policy choice congress made in enacting.while subjecting travelers to punishment under may well be consistent with the aim of finding missing sex offenders,a contrary construction in no way frustrates that broad goal.taking account of sorna overall structure,we have little reason to doubt that congress intended to do exactly what it says to subject to federal prosecution sex offenders who elude sorna registration requirements by traveling in interstate commerce.mertens hewitt associates,v ague notions of a statute basic purpose are inadequate to overcome the words of its text regarding the specific issue under consideration 
none of the legislative materials the government cites as evidence of sorna purpose calls this reading into question.to the contrary,the report of the house judiciary committee suggests not only that a prohibition on postenactment travel is consonant with congress goals,but also that it is the rule congress in fact chose to adopt.as the government acknowledges,the bill under consideration by the committee contained a version of that would not have reached interstate travel.brief for united states.this earlier version imposed federal criminal penalties on any person who receives a notice from an official that such person is required to register under sorna and thereafter travels in interstate or foreign commerce,or enters or leaves indian country.pt,at see also,at s ex offenders will now face federal prosecution if they cross a state line and fail to comply with the sex offender registration and notification requirements contained in the legislation yet this did not stop the committee from describing its legislation as a solution to the problem of missing sex offenders.see,at.the government identifies nothing in the legislative record to suggest that,in modifying this language during the course of the legislative process,congress intended to alter the statute temporal sweep at the very least,the close correspondence between the committee discussion of missing sex offenders and its recognition of the travel element prospective application would seem to confirm that reading to reach only postenactment travel does not contravene sorna underlying purposes,let alone result in an absurdity that would compel us to disregard the statutory text.arlington central school dist.bd.of ed.murphy,we have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.when the statutory language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
having concluded that does not extend to preenactment travel,we need not consider whether such a construction would present difficulties under the constitution ex post facto clause.the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

thomas carr,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice alito,with whom justice thomas and justice ginsburg join,dissenting.
the court decision misinterprets and hobbles a,a provision of the sex offender registration and notification act sorna or act that is designed to prevent dangerous sex offenders from evading registration requirements.sorna requires convicted sex offenders to register,and to keep their registrations current,in each jurisdiction where they live,work,and go to school,and the provision at issue here,a,makes it a crime for a convicted sex offender who moves in interstate to fail to abide by the act registration requirements.the question that we must decide is whether a applies only to those sex offenders who travel in interstate commerce after sorna became law or whether the statute also reaches sex offenders,like petitioner,who were and traveled before sorna took effect but violated the registration requirement after that date.
the court answer is that a applies only to sex offenders who moved from state to state after sorna became law.the court reaches this conclusion for two reasons the verb tense used in a b and the sequence in which the elements of the offense are listed.
as i will attempt to show,the court textual arguments are thoroughly unsound.and the conclusion that the court reaches makes no sense.to appreciate the folly of the court interpretation,consider the following two cases.
the first involves a situation in which,for present purposes,i assume that a applies a man convicted in state a for sexual abuse is released from custody in that state and then,after the enactment of sorna,moves to state b and fails to register as required by state b law.section a makes this offender failure to register in state b a federal crime because his interstate movement frustrates sorna registration requirements.because this offender is convicted and then released from custody in state a,the state a authorities know of his presence in their state and are thus in a position to try to ensure that he remains registered.at the time of his release,they can ascertain where he intends to live,and they can make sure that he registers as required by state law.thereafter,they can periodically check the address at which he is registered to confirm that he still resides there.and even if he moves without warning to some other address in the state,they can try to track him down.once this offender leaves state a,however,the authorities in that state are severely limited in their ability to monitor his movements.and because the state b authorities have no notice of his entry into their state,they are at a great disadvantage in trying to enforce state b registration law.congress enacted a in order to punish and deter interstate movement that seriously undermines the enforcement of laws.
the second case is the same as the first in all respects except that the sex offender travels from state a to state b before sorna enactment.in other words,the sex offender is convicted and later released in state a prior to sorna enactment,he moves to state b and then,after sorna takes effects,he fails to register in state b,as sorna requires.
is there any reason why congress might have wanted to treat the second case any differently from the first in both cases,a sex offender interstate movement frustrates enforcement of sorna registration requirements.in both cases,as a result of that interstate travel,the sex offender new neighbors in state b are unaware of the presence of a potentially dangerous person in their community,and the state b law enforcement authorities are hampered in their ability to protect the public.the second case is the case now before the court,and the court offers no plausible explanation why congress might have wanted to treat this case any differently from the first.
if the text of a commanded this result,we would,of course,be obligated to heed that command.but the text of a dictates no such thing.on the contrary,when properly read,it reaches both cases.
section a provides in pertinent part as follows 
whoever is required to register under the sex offender registration and notification act b travels in interstate or foreign commerce and knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by the sex offender registration and notification act shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.emphasis added.
as i read this language,neither the use of the present tense in paragraph b nor the sequence in which the elements are listed provides any basis for limiting the provision to those sex offenders who move from one state to another after sorna enactment.
the dominant theme of petitioner argument is that the use of the present tense in a b travels in interstate commerce indisputably means that an offender interstate travel must occur after sorna took effect.there is no mystery about the meaning of the word travels,petitioner tells us.brief for petitioner.i n ordinary usage it refers to present or future travel.ibid.according to petitioner,our inquiry in this case should go no further than the plain language of a b,which applies to a person who travels in interstate commerce.congress use of the present tense is unambiguous,and the statutory language accordingly should be the end of the matter.at see also,at use of the present tense travels is dispositive at t he use of the present tense in the statute should be decisive at use of the present tense is enough to dispose of this case 
a bad argument does not improve with repetition.and petitioner argument fails because it begs the relevant question.petitioner belabors the obvious that the present tense is not used to refer to events that occurred in the past but studiously avoids the critical question at what point in time does a speak does it speak as of the time when sorna took effect or does it speak as of the time when the proscribed conduct occurs without knowing the point in time at which the law speaks,it is impossible to tell what is past and what is present or future.
the unspoken premise of petitioner argument is that a speaks as of the time when it became law.and if that premise is accepted,it follows that the use of the present tense in a b means that the requisite interstate travel must occur after,not before,sorna took effect.petitioner premise,however,flies in the face of the widely accepted modern legislative drafting convention that a law should not be read to speak as of the date of enactment.the united states senate legislative drafting manual directly addresses this point a legislative provision speaks as of any date on which it is read rather than as of when drafted,enacted,or put into effect.senate office of the legislative counsel,legislative drafting manual a,emphasis added.the house manual makes the same point 
your draft should be a movable feast that is,it speaks as of whatever time it is being read rather than as of when drafted,enacted,or put into effect.house legislative counsel manual on drafting style,hlc,c.
in accordance with this convention,modern legislative drafting manuals teach that,except in unusual circumstances,all laws,including penal statutes,should be written in the present tense.the senate manual,supra,a,at,states a lways use the present tense unless the provision addresses only the past,the future,or a sequence of events that requires use of a different tense.similarly,the house manual,supra,c,at,advises stay in the present.whenever possible,use the present tense rather than the past or future.numerous state legislative drafting manuals and other similar handbooks hammer home this same point.see,colorado legislative drafting manual,online at all internet materials as visited may,and available in clerk of court case file provisions should generally be stated in the present tense hawaii legislative drafting manual takayama ed.reprint,online at use the present tense and indicative mood legislative research comm n,bill drafting manual for the kentucky general assembly,ed.use the present tense and the indacative mood maine legislative drafting manual ed.laws are meant to be of continuing application and should be written in the present tense massachusetts general courts,legislative research and drafting manual ed.use the present tense and the indicative mood new mexico legislative counsel service,legislative drafting manual update statutes are written in the present tense,not the future tense texas legislative council drafting manual use present tense whenever possible west virginia legislature bill drafting manual,online at avoid future tense will be paid and future perfect tense will have been paid.use present tense is paid see also ohio legislative service commission,rule drafting manual ed,use present tense.the majority of rules have a continuing effect in that they apply over time.they speak at the time of reading,not merely at the time of their adoption.the present tense therefore includes the future tense 
once it is recognized that a should not be read as speaking as of the date when sorna went into effect,petitioner argument about the use of the present tense collapses.in accordance with current drafting conventions,a speaks,not as of the time when the law went into effect,but as of the time when the first act necessary for conviction is committed.in the case of a,that occurs when an individual is convicted of a qualifying sex offense,for it is that act that triggers the requirement to register under sorna for present purposes,we must proceed on the assumption that this event may have occurred before sorna was enacted.viewed as of the time when such a conviction takes place,every subsequent act,including movement from state to state,occurs in the future and is thus properly described using the present tense.accordingly,a b use of the present tense travels supports the application of the statute to a sex offender,like petitioner,who moved from state to state after conviction but before sorna went into effect 
petitioner argument is particularly perverse in light of the context in which a was adopted.when sorna was enacted,congress elected not to decide for itself whether the act registration requirements and thus a criminal penalties would apply to persons who had been convicted of qualifying sex offenses before sorna took effect.instead,congress delegated to the attorney general the authority to decide that question.see d,stat,d the attorney general shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of title i of sorna to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this act pursuant to this delegation,the attorney general in issued an interim rule providing that sorna applies to convictions.fed.reg.codified at cfr 
petitioner contends that,if congress had wanted to make a applicable to sex offenders who traveled in interstate commerce before sorna took effect,congress could have referred in a b to a person who traveled,has traveled,or,at the time of the statute enactment,had traveled in interstate commerce.brief for petitioner internal quotation marks omitted.any such phrasing,however,would have strongly suggested that a reaches persons with convictions the very question that congress chose not to decide but instead to leave for the attorney general.
a brief explanation is needed to make clear why wording a b in the past tense or the present perfect or past perfect tense would have had such an effect.the court and i agree that a applies only to persons who travel in interstate commerce after they are convicted of a qualifying sex offense.see ante,at infra,at.therefore,if a had been phrased in the past tense or the present perfect or past perfect tense,it would seem necessarily to follow that the provision reaches convictions.by using the present tense,congress remained neutral on the question whether the act reaches those with convictions and left that question open for the attorney general.
the conclusion that a b embraces travel is reinforced by the presence of quite a few other sorna provisions that plainly use the present tense to refer to events that,as a result of the attorney general regulation,may have occurred before sorna took effect.for example,an individual may qualify as a tier ii sex offender under the act if,among other things,his sex offense involves i use of a minor in sexual performance ii solicitation of a minor to practice prostitution or iii production or distribution of child pornography.b emphasis added see also b offense involves kidnapping a minor emphasis added offense involves certain specified conduct.similarly,a sex offender can qualify as a tier ii sex offender if his sex offense occurs after the offender becomes a tier i sex offender.c emphasis added see also c offense occurs after the offender becomes a tier ii sex offender emphasis added.a juvenile adjudication,moreover,may qualify as a conviction for purposes of the act only if,among other things,the offender is years of age or older at the time of the offense.emphasis added 
congress cast all of these provisions in the present tense,but now that the attorney general has made sorna applicable to individuals with convictions,all of these provisions must necessarily be interpreted as embracing conduct.
the court second reason for holding that a reaches only travel is based on the sequence in which the elements of a are listed.the court concludes and i agree that the first listed element subsection a is required to register under the sex offender registration and notification act can not have been violated until the act took effect.the court then reasons that the third listed element subsection a b travels in interstate commerce must be violated after the first.see ante,at.the court explains persons convicted of sex offenses under state law who fail to register in their state of conviction would otherwise be subject to federal prosecution under even if they had not left the state after being convicted an illogical result given the absence of any obvious federal interest in punishing such state offenders.ibid.in other words,the court reasons that it would be illogical to interpret the statute as reaching a person who first moves from state a to state b,then commits and is convicted of a qualifying sex offense in state b,and subsequently,upon release from custody in state b,fails to register as required under the law of that state.
i agree with the court that there is a good argument that a should not be read to apply to such a case,where there is little if any connection between the offender prior interstate movement and his subsequent failure to register.in the two hypothetical cases discussed at the beginning of this opinion,the offender interstate movement seriously frustrated the ability of the law enforcement authorities in his new state state b to enforce its registration requirements.by contrast,where an offender interstate movement predates his sex offense and conviction,his interstate movement has little if any effect on the ability of the law enforcement authorities in state b to enforce that state laws.when a sex offender is released from custody in state b,the ability of the state b authorities to enforce that state registration laws would appear to be the same regardless of whether that offender had lived his entire life in that state or had moved to the state prior to committing the offense for which he was convicted.accordingly,it can be argued that congress can not have meant to reach this situation.as the seventh circuit put it,s ince the statutory aim is to prevent a convicted sex offender from circumventing registration by leaving the state in which he is registered,it can be argued that the travel must postdate the conviction.united states dixon.it can also be argued that a broader construction would mean that congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause.see brief for national association of criminal defense lawyers as amicus curiae.
what the court argument shows,however,is not that the interstate travel required by a must come after sorna enactment.rather,what the court argument suggests is that the interstate travel must come after the conviction.and because,under the regulation promulgated by the attorney general,a reaches convictions,this argument does not support the court conclusion that the interstate travel needed under a must have occurred after sorna was enacted.
when an interpretation of a statutory text leads to a result that makes no sense,a court should at a minimum go back and verify that the textual analysis is correct.here,not only are the court textual arguments unsound for the reasons explained above,but the indefensible results produced by the court interpretation should have led the court to doublecheck its textual analysis.
sorna was a response to a dangerous gap in the laws.in the years prior to sorna enactment,the nation had been shocked by cases in which children had been raped and murdered by persons who,
