on appeal,we review de novo a district court legal determination that an employee acted outside the scope of his employment and that it lacks jurisdiction under the ftca.mcintyre united states,cir aversa,at.
the united states as a sovereign can be haled into court only if it consents to be sued.it is elementary that t he united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued,and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.united states mitchell,quoting united states sherwood,see also mccloskey mueller,cir.to expose the united states to suit,congress must unequivocally waive sovereign immunity.mitchell,at quoting united states king.by enacting the ftca,congress waived the immunity of the united states to suit for the tortious actions of federal employees.
nevertheless,the united states waiver of sovereign immunity under the ftca has limits.the waiver is effective only for the acts or omissions of a federal employee within the scope of his employment.under b,district courts have jurisdiction over tort claims against the united states for personal injury caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee while acting within the scope of his employment,under circumstances where the united states would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.consequ
