this case,of first impression for this circuit,involves the interpretation of a sentencing guideline that is frequently used to enhance sentences for those convicted of crimes,see b e,and is potentially applicable to a wide range of other offenses,see id.
on july,marco gordon pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute,and possession with intent to distribute,more than grams of cocaine base,see,a,and b b,for his role in a organization that operated primarily in portland,maine from october to january.he does not dispute that he held a leadership role in the illicit organization,which was responsible for trafficking approximately grams of cocaine base during a period.
gordon appeals only his sentence of months of imprisonment,arguing that the district court improperly applied a enhancement for offenses committed as part of a pattern of criminal conduct engaged in as a livelihood,b e,both by misinterpreting the guideline and by making erroneous predicate findings of fact.
in order to apply that criminal livelihood enhancement,the court needed to find that over a period,gordon derived income in excess of from drug trafficking and engaged in as his primary occupation.id.app.we affirm gordon sentence because the district court did not commit legal error when it used gordon gross,rather than net,income derived from drug trafficking to determine that his income surpassed the threshold,nor did the court commit factual error when it concluded that drug trafficking was gordon primary occupation.
on january,gordon was arrested in an apartment in portland,maine in connection with a federal investigation into a organization that had operated in michigan,connecticut,and portland,maine,though the primary location was in portland.during a search incident to gordon arrest,officers found and grams of cocaine base in his pockets,and they found an additional and grams of cocaine base in the apartment.gordon was indicted on january,along with four,for his role in an interstate drug conspiracy.
gordon pled guilty on july,to possessing with the intent to distribute in excess of grams of cocaine base,a,b b,and conspiring to do the same,id.gordon does not dispute that the money and drugs seized during his arrest with a street value of roughly belonged to him and that the conspiracy to which he belonged trafficked at least grams of cocaine base with a street value of roughly during the twelve months preceding his arrest.
at a november,sentencing hearing,the district court calculated gordon guidelines sentencing range gsr to be to months.that gsr included a enhancement,sought by the government,which applies when t he defendant committed the relevant offense as part of a pattern of criminal conduct engaged in as a livelihood.b e.the court applied that enhancement over gordon objection but ultimately sentenced him to months of imprisonment,which represented a month downward variance from the low end of the resulting gsr.on november,gordon appealed his sentence to this court,limiting his challenge to whether the district court erred in applying the criminal livelihood enhancement.
the criminal livelihood enhancement applies where the government proves,by a preponderance of the evidence,that two conditions have been met the defendant committed the relevant offense as part of a pattern of criminal conduct and the defendant was engaged in that conduct as a livelihood.id.b e.on appeal,gordon argued only that the government had failed to meet its burden as to the second condition.
the guidelines further divide that second condition into two prongs.a defendant was engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct as a livelihood only if 
a the defendant derived income from the pattern of criminal conduct that in any period exceeded times the then existing hourly minimum wage under federal law,meaning in the instant case and 
b the totality of circumstances shows that such criminal conduct was the defendant primary occupation in that period,the defendant engaged in criminal conduct rather than regular,legitimate employment or the defendant legitimate employment was merely a front for the defendant criminal conduct.
id.app.gordon argued on appeal,as he had before the district court,that the government had failed to meet its burden as to both prongs.
as to the first prong,gordon argued that the court had erred in finding that he had derived income in excess of from drug trafficking during the relevant time period because the court had considered his gross,rather than net,income,and that if the court had properly deducted the expenses related to his drug trafficking,it would have found that his earnings fell short of the threshold.gordon also argued that the court had overestimated his income by twenty percent because it had not identified a period to consider and had thus implicitly treated all of the income he had earned over the life of the conspiracy as if he had earned it in a year.as to the second prong,gordon argued that the court had erred in finding that drug trafficking had been his primary occupation because his primary occupation had actually been his legitimate as a barber.
the premise of gordon first argument that in order to apply the criminal livelihood enhancement,a district court must,as a matter of law,find that a defendant net,rather than gross,income from criminal activity exceeded raised an issue of first impression in this circuit.gordon made that argument,albeit for the first time,during the sentencing hearing.but the prosecution did not take a position on that argument.and the district court determined that gordon income met the threshold without explicitly stating whether its finding was based on the net or gross approach.as a result,we were unable to address a key issue on appeal,and so we sought clarification from the district court as to what exactly it had decided.on december,this court issued an order remanding the case,requesting that the district court clarify its findings relevant to gordon first argument on appeal.we invited the district court to take further evidence and make further findings if necessary.
on january,the district court issued an order in response to the remand clarifying that it had utilized the approach and reiterating its conclusion that,under that approach,the criminal livelihood enhancement applied see united states gordon,cr gzs,wl,at me.the court explained that the derived income language in app.a allows a district court to use a defendant gross income.it reasoned that if the guidelines had meant to require a court to consider a defendant net income,then they would have provided specific guidance regarding how to calculate net income for the many offenses covered by the enhancement.id.
the court also noted that the parties disagreed as to what constituted a deductible expense and as to what should be viewed more properly as a distribution of profits.id.for example,the government argued that gross income should be used,but that if net income were used,only the amount gordon had paid to acquire the cocaine base he sold could be netted out against his gross earnings.id.gordon,in contrast,argued that the court should also deduct compensation he had purportedly paid subordinate dealers to move product on his behalf,as well as the cost of two televisions and a futon that he had purportedly purchased for an associate in exchange for allowing gordon to store cocaine base at the associate apartment.id.at.
the court also pointed out that it is the government burden to prove the application of a sentencing enhancement,united states alphas,cir,but that the government will frequently have little evidence to offer regarding the precise,idiosyncratic and potentially numerous expenses attendant to a criminal enterprise,especially when those expenses are cash payments or cash purchases made with drug proceeds,gordon,wl,at.thus,the court concluded,assuming a district court were required to make a net income finding,it is not clear who would bear the burden of production for any deductible amounts.id.
finally,the court held that even if it had not applied the criminal livelihood enhancement,and gordon gsr had been to months as a result,the court still would have varied downward and imposed the same month sentence on gordon.id.
on january,gordon filed a notice of his intent to continue his appeal with this court in light of the district court january order.in his supplemental appellate brief,filed on february,gordon renewed his claim that the district court had erred,as a matter of law,in calculating his derived income on a gross,rather than net,basis for purposes of the criminal livelihood enhancement.of the other claims raised in gordon original appellate brief,which all pertained to purported factual errors underlying the court application of the same enhancement,only gordon claim that the court had erred by finding that drug trafficking,rather than barbering,was his primary occupation during the relevant time period remains a live issue in this appeal 
appeal from the district court use of the gross income approach under app.a 
gordon appeals from the district court thoughtful holding that it was proper to apply app.a of the guidelines based on evidence of gordon gross income alone.gordon argues that this was error,alleging that app.a required the court to consider his net income the government denies that this was error but says that,if any error occurred,it was harmless in light of the district court statement that it would have imposed the same month sentence regardless of whether the criminal livelihood enhancement applied.see gordon,wl,at.
we address first the question of whether there was any error at all in the district court use of the approach,a recurring and logically antecedent question.then we turn to the government argument that,if there was any error,that error was harmless.for the reasons that follow,we hold that there was no error.
the proper interpretation of a sentencing guideline is a question of law that we review de novo.united states damon,cir.we interpret a guideline by applying familiar principles of statutory construction,id.at,meaning we look to its text,structure,context,and purpose,id.at.
the guideline at issue provides that a court applying the criminal livelihood enhancement must find that,in any twelvemonth period,the defendant derived income from his criminal acts in excess of times the then existing hourly minimum wage under federal law.app.a.the plain meaning of income does not resolve the question of whether a defendant earnings should be measured on a gross or net basis,as the term is susceptible to both readings.compare income,black law dictionary ed.defining income as t he money that one receives,with income,merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.defining income as the money that one gain s.
however,looking at the text of the guideline as a whole,we find a sufficient basis for the district court decision to rely exclusively on evidence of gordon gross income in applying app.a.by its terms,the guideline income threshold is designed to approximate the annual income of an employee earning the federal minimum wage,which is a gross figure see id.it is reasonable to infer from this deliberate linking of the income threshold to a specific level of gross income that the guideline intends for a defendant income to be measured on a gross basis.
that interpretation is reinforced by the lack of discussion in the guideline of issues that would be key if courts were required to use a approach.
first,the guideline does not discuss how net income should be measured.as the district court observed,app.a can be applied to a wide range of offenses,and the types of expenses potentially associated with committing those offenses can vary greatly based on the particular circumstances of a given case and the level of generality at which expenses are viewed.see gordon,wl,at.yet the guideline provides no information to guide a court in determining,with any degree of consistency and precision,what qualifies as a deductible expense for purposes of calculating a defendant net income from criminal activity id.likewise,it provides no guidance as to how a court should treat taxes paid on illegal income or how it should distinguish between a defendant expenses and the manner in which he chooses to distribute,spend,or reinvest his profits.see id.
the guideline also makes no mention of how to allocate the burden of proving a defendant net income.the burden of establishing the applicability of an enhancement is generally on the government.see alphas,at.but,like the district court,we doubt that the sentencing commission intended to put on the government the burden of providing evidence of a defendant expenses,which the government would often be unable to access.see gordon,wl,at.
given that the purpose of the sentencing guidelines is to provide a framework to guide the exercise of the court discretion,which promotes uniformity and fairness in sentencing,united states hurley,cir.quoting united states marchena silvestre,cir,this lack of guidance indicates that the commission did not intend for app.a to mandate the type of accounting that gordon envisions.
we hold that absent greater clarity in the guidelines which we urge the commission to provide the district court permissibly considered only gordon gross income from drug trafficking in applying app.a.this holding is consistent with opinions from several other circuits.see,united states cryer,cir.united states quertermous,cir.united states reed,cir.united states morse,cir.united states kellams,cir.united states nastri,cir.unpublished opinion,cert.denied.while none of those courts were presented with the precise argument that the term income in app.a requires a finding as to net income,they each affirmed the application of that guideline based on evidence of gross income alone.and against the backdrop of this apparent majority approach,the commission amended in without modifying the term income or altering the operative language of the provision in any way,see manual app.c,amend,an issue we discuss further below.
the only circuit case to have decided that the criminal livelihood enhancement requires a court to calculate a defendant net income dealt with a materially different version of,in effect between and,which at that time required a court to find that a defendant derived a substantial portion of his income from criminal activity.see lee united states,cir.the court reasoned that a sentencing court applying that guideline needed to consider a defendant criminal profits because it would be absurd to say that an individual who earn ed in his lawful day job and net ted on thefts of million in merchandise had engaged in crime as a livelihood id.
but lee does not help gordon.the guideline at issue in that case has been significantly amended,and the version applicable here includes two prongs a court must first find that the defendant derived income from criminal activity in excess of a specified sum equal to at present,app.a,and then separately find that the criminal activity was the defendant primary occupation,id.app.b.
the proper way of measuring the relative predominance of a defendant criminal and legitimate income the issue on which lee ruled has no bearing on the question of whether the defendant criminal income exceeded the threshold,the question at issue here.it is relevant,if at all,only to the question of whether criminal activity was the defendant primary occupation united states luster,cir.a determination of whether a pattern of criminal activity provides a substantial portion of one income is a means of determining whether or not criminal conduct is one primary occupation.kellams,at.moreover,commentary on the reason why was amended in to include two prongs supports our reading of the guideline.see fed.sent g prac.cmt.explaining that the amendment intended to simplif y the analysis of a defendant income.
it is also telling that the commission amended again in,when,as we have noted,the majority approach to the income issue was the approach.at that time,the commission chose to leave the term income,and therefore the precedents we cite,entirely undisturbed.see manual app.c,amend.explaining that the commission made merely cosmetic changes to the guideline in such as,inter alia,striking and inserting a striking and inserting b and striking his and inserting the defendant.this amendment further supports our reading,and at a minimum,there is certainly no reason to view it as having adopted lee,which addressed a meaningfully different version of the guideline.
finally,the cases cited by gordon that interpret the term loss in and the as requiring a court to consider a crime victim net losses do not bear on the meaning of the term income in app.a.see united states schneider,cir.united states smith,cir.united states moore,cir.nothing in the text or history of suggests that the magnitude of the harm caused by a defendant criminal activity is in any way related to the question of whether he engaged in that activity as a livelihood.and no authority supports the proposition that the meaning of a term in a guideline controls the definition of a different term in an unrelated guideline.
we find no error in the district court interpretation of app.a,absent further clarification by the commission.even if we are wrong in reaching that conclusion,we affirm anyway,as the government harmless error argument is correct.see,united states tavares,cir.
appeal from the district court finding as to gordon primary occupation under app.b 
we review a district court application of a sentencing guideline to the facts before it only for clear error.united states martin,cir.a sentencing enhancement must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.united states burgos figueroa,cir.citation omitted.gordon claim that the court erred in finding that drug trafficking,rather than some legitimate endeavor,was his primary occupation during the relevant period,app.b,easily fails on this record.
the uncontested evidence presented by the government established that gordon held a leadership role in a substantial organization while living in maine during the year preceding his arrest.the operation was sufficiently large to sell in cocaine base over twelve months.gordon actively participated in it,regularly communicating with his about the scheme and frequently executing transactions in furtherance of it.additionally,in statements introduced by the government,an associate of gordon recounted that gordon had told the associate that gordon had come to maine specifically to make money selling drugs in order to support himself and family members still living in detroit,michigan.see quertermous,at holding that an investigator testimony that the defendant had admitted that he had resorted to a criminal activity in order to provide for himself,along with testimony regarding a statement that the defendant was making his living from that activity,supported the conclusion that the defendant primary occupation was that activity.
in rebuttal,gordon offered little more than his own attestations to support his contention that he had worked primarily as a barber.gordon claimed that he had made between and per week cutting hair,but he conceded that he had no documentation of any sort to verify either that work or those earnings.see,luster,at rejecting a defendant claim of legitimate employment at various jobs because he was unable to provide supporting documentation quertermous,at same,where the defendant claimed he had been legitimately as a roofer but was unable to provide any records of employment.
the only evidence of legitimate employment that gordon could muster were statements taken from a few of the letters submitted to the court in support of gordon character,which mentioned that gordon had engaged in barbering at some point,sometimes for money,back when he had lived in detroit.these statements did not indicate that gordon had worked as a barber at all,let alone primarily,during the relevant time period.meanwhile,an associate of gordon who had hosted gordon at her residence in maine overnight from time to time stated that she did not know what,if anything,he had done for legitimate work there.
in light of the abundant evidence that gordon had actively participated in,lucrative activities during the twelve months at issue and the dearth of evidence that he had performed any alternative work of comparable frequency or profitability over that period,the district court was well justified in concluding that the prong of the criminal livelihood enhancement was satisfied.see nastri.at affirming the district court conclusion that the prong was satisfied where the evidence showed that the defendant had received between and in proceeds from drug sales five to seven times and no facts before the court showed that he had held a primary occupation or employment other than his criminal drug enterprise.there was no error on these facts.
gordon sentence is affirmed.we direct the clerk to send a copy of this opinion to the sentencing commission.
the facts of this case do not require us to decide whether the word income in the criminal livelihood sentencing enhancement refers to the gross or to the net receipts of a defendant criminal activity.for,as the majority well explains,however one construes the guideline,it would not affect the outcome in this case.nevertheless,because the majority has weighed in on the issue of what income means,i wish to explain why i come out the other way.
the majority reading of that word may be what the sentencing commission had in mind.it also might not be.i can see that there is room for debate about just how unclear the guideline is.in my view,though,the ambiguity is not superficial,but grievous.and because the rule of lenity dictates that enhancements in the united states sentencing guidelines may not be read broadly when they are this unclear,see muscarello united states,to invoke the rule of lenity,we must conclude that there is a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute.citation omitted see also united states luna díaz,cir.noting that the rule of lenity applies to the interpretation of sentencing guidelines i believe we have no choice but to opt for the narrower net reading here 
to start,there is no doubt that the word income could refer to either the gross or the net receipts of a defendant criminal activity.as the majority acknowledges,no dictionary legal or otherwise indicates to the contrary.
the guideline itself is of no help in resolving the ambiguity.it does not set forth a definition of income of its own.nor does the guideline application note make any direct reference to the word that might settle the matter.
i have looked at how the word income is used elsewhere in the guidelines in hopes that such usage might clear things up.it does not.and it certainly does not show that income clearly means gross income.the guidelines mention the word income only a handful of times.in only one instance is the word modified.and,in that instance,the modifier is the word gross.referring specifically to the underreporting of gross income.that another guideline specifies gross income suggests,if anything,that the unmodified word income in this guideline means something else.
in consequence,the case for leaning on the rule of lenity seems to me to be quite strong.and,adding strength to that case is a supreme court precedent,united states santos,that,though not controlling,is at least instructive.
the word in question in santos was not income but proceeds.and the relevant provision was a criminal statute one that punishes money laundering,not a sentencing guideline.but the issue was otherwise virtually identical whether proceeds referred to the gross receipts that a defendant derived from criminal activity or only to the net receipts.id.at.
five justices in that case agreed that the word proceeds did not clearly refer to gross receipts.the plurality opinion that justice scalia wrote for four justices relied on the rule of lenity in opting for a net reading of the term id.at.justice scalia logic has resonance here.
justice scalia explained that dictionaries provided no clarity as to whether the word proceeds referred to net or gross proceeds.id.at.he then explained that the word had not acquired a common meaning in the provisions of the federal criminal code.id.at.and,finally,he explained that context shed no light on the matter,because u nder either of the word ordinary definitions,all provisions of the federal statute are coherent no provisions are redundant and the statute is not rendered utterly absurd.id.at.he thus concluded that the statute was ambiguous,and that the rule of lenity must therefore control.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,justice scalia was well aware that the net receipts definition would be tough to administer much tougher,that is,than a gross receipts definition.id.at.how,after all,would one decide which expenses counted and how would the government be in a position to know what the true expenses of the criminal activity were would the defendant assertions in this regard just have to be credited 
but while these were points that the government pressed hard,they were not points that moved the plurality,even though congress had offered no guidance as to how net receipts were to be determined.in rejecting the notion that such practical concerns justified a broad reading of proceeds,justice scalia pointed out that there is no principle that counsels judges to construe unclear statutes in the manner that best facilitates the imposition of criminal punishment.rather,he pointed out that the longstanding interpretive presumption is just the opposite that ambiguous criminal measures are to be construed narrowly to protect defendants.id.we interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of defendants,not prosecutors.
of course,even ambiguous words,in context,may acquire a meaning that it would be improper to apply the rule of lenity.but we know that the plurality in santos thought it appropriate to use this longstanding interpretive tool to determine whether proceeds referred to net or gross receipts.to me,therefore,the question is simply whether there is any good reason to proceed differently here.in my view,there is not,especially considering this guideline history.
an earlier version of the criminal livelihood guideline imposed an enhanced sentence if the defendant derived a substantial portion of his income from his criminal conduct.amended.the seventh circuit,per judge posner,read the word income in that iteration of the guideline to refer to net rather than gross receipts.lee united states,cir.
judge posner reasons for doing so are persuasive to me.judge posner explained that the word income in that version of the guideline s urely had to be read to refer to net income,else the following absurd consequence would arise.he posited a defendant who grossed million in sales a year from a legitimate business,but netted only,and who burgled by night with no expenses.judge posner noted that such a defendant would not be thought to have derived a substantial portion of his income from his crimes if measured by comparing his gross legal income million against his gross illegal income.id.quoting the version of in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.in addition,judge posner pointed out,if the defendant earned from a lawful day job and netted only on thefts of goods worth million in retail value,his sentence would be enhanced again,incongruously if his income were measured by comparing his gross legal income to his gross illegal income million.id.no such strange results would follow,however,if income were simply read to refer to net receipts.
judge posner also emphasized that,although a defendant gross criminal income may be the more relevant figure for purposes of measuring the amount of harm that the defendant criminal activity caused,there are other provisions in the guidelines that are intended to respond to the magnitude of the harm caused by the offense.id.as the criminal livelihood enhancement,however,section has the narrower office of separating professionals from amateurs on the basis of the extent to which a defendant derives his livelihood from his criminal as distinct from his legal activities.id.and,as judge posner concluded,livelihood is a matter of net rather than gross income.id 
the majority does not take issue with judge posner explanation of why income had to mean net income in the first iteration of this guideline.the question is thus whether the guideline has been changed in a way that indicates with sufficient clarity that this word now must be understood to refer to gross income.i do not believe it has.
in coming to this conclusion,i recognize,as the majority notes,that,in,the sentencing commission did amend the version of the guideline that judge posner was construing.and the first set of those amendments was extensive.
the guideline no longer defines criminal activity as a livelihood simply because the defendant derived a substantial portion of his income from a pattern of conduct of which crime was a part.rather,the guideline definition of livelihood now has two distinct parts.the first part requires that the defendant derived income from his criminal conduct that in any period exceeded times the then existing hourly minimum wage under federal law.app.a.the second part requires that the totality of circumstances shows that such criminal conduct was the defendant primary occupation in that period,the defendant engaged in criminal conduct rather than regular,legitimate employment or the defendant legitimate employment was merely a front for the defendant criminal conduct.id.app.b.
but i do not see how these changes significant though they are make it clear that income now refers to gross income,given that it is most unlikely that this word did so before.i note in this regard that judge posner was well aware of these amendments when he wrote his decision in lee,in which he construed income to mean net income.he,too,did not conclude that the amendments reflected a shift in the commission view.rather,he concluded that these amendments dispelled a ny doubts about whether the commission intended income to refer to net rather than gross earnings.id.at.
judge posner based that conclusion on the fact that the amendments keyed the amount that a professional criminal must make in a period to the annual income of a minimum wage worker,rather than to some other amount.see id.at.presumably,judge posner thought such a choice by the commission by analogizing the criminal defendant to a lawful earner who makes a minimum wage only served to underscore his basic point that the focus of this guideline is on whether the defendant makes a livelihood from criminal activities,and not on whether those activities cause great harm.thus,a reading of the word income that ensures that the inquiry focuses on what a criminal defendant takes home,rather than on merely what he takes in,makes the most sense.
that said,i would not go so far as judge posner and conclude that the new guideline by referencing the annual income of a minimum wage worker demonstrates beyond all doubt that the commission is focused on net rather than gross income.i am confident,however,that the amended guideline,by choosing to key income to the annual earnings of a minimum wage worker,can not be said to have adopted in any clear way a gross view of income that the earlier iteration of the guideline had declined to embrace.
the new guideline,after all,uses the same word income as did the previous version of the guideline.and the amendments added no modifier to clarify that otherwise ambiguous word meaning.nor does the application note to the amended guideline provide any clarification.
in addition,because minimum wage workers,unlike many criminals,usually incur few expenses,it seems quite plausible that,in amending the guideline,the commission still had in mind the criminal profit from his work rather than his gross income.after all,a drug dealer who buys drugs and then sells them at,say,a,may surpass the guideline threshold income amount in gross earnings even if he will never succeed in earning an actual livelihood from his net profits.why,then,does it make sense to apply a livelihood enhancement to a defendant simply because of the amount of his gross unlawful earnings 
moreover,it would hardly be unthinkable for the commission to have chosen to target only those criminals who actually succeed at making a living through crime.deterrence is specially needed for that class of criminals,due to their special propensity to persist in a life of crime.and there is no doubt that the guideline raison was to deter professional criminals,given that this was the rationale of the dangerous special offender statutes from which the guideline was derived.see united states kerr,supp,noting that congress adopted from the dangerous special offender statutes,and that those statutes were intended to impos e enhanced punishment to incapacitate professional criminals who may lack the prior convictions necessary to bring them within recidivist statutes id.at the requirement that defendants derive a substantial portion of their income from this pattern furthers the legitimate purpose of incapacitating professional criminals the defendant who has an income to which crime does not contribute a substantial portion does not depend on crime his prospects for returning to a legitimate lifestyle may be better.
finally,i note that the commission in actually amended the guideline yet again.and this time the commission did so with the benefit of the analysis of the word income that judge posner had offered in his decision in lee.amended.at that time,lee was the only court of appeals decision to have definitively construed the word income in connection with the criminal livelihood guideline though,as the majority points out,a number of circuits had applied the gross income approach without having any need to consider whether the gross or the net definition of income was intended in either the earlier or the amended version of the guideline.and,as i have explained,lee had not only construed the word income in the first iteration of the guideline to mean net income but also had concluded that the amendments made crystal clear the correctness of that narrow construction.yet,in making the amendments,the commission saw fit to retain the same word income that had been there all along,and to do so without adding any clarifying modifier.
in light of this history,i do not see how we could have any confidence that the word income in the guideline,as it now stands,refers to gross income.to so conclude,we would have to be confident that the commission retained a word that is facially ambiguous,but that the commission nonetheless impliedly intended to give that word a new meaning that is the opposite of what the only circuit court ever to have definitively construed that word had read it to mean.
a key idea behind the rule of lenity is that judges should be wary of mistakenly imposing punishment on the basis of rules that have been drawn up by others but that were never intended to reach so far as judges may be asked to extend them.and,in this context,that idea seems to me to have particular force.
the commission has already proved itself to be more than capable of revising the guideline.the commission is free to do so again.it might even do what congress did in response to santos expressly state that it had in mind the gross amount.see c clarifying that the term proceeds means any property derived from or obtained or retained,directly or indirectly,through some form of unlawful activity,including the gross receipts of such activity.and it might take that step in response to the practical concerns that the majority quite reasonably raises.
it may also be,however,that the commission is not troubled by such concerns.in many cases,after all,a criminal expenses will not be hard to figure,if there are even any to be calculated.and courts have accepted that the commission requires them to make similar calculations under other guidelines namely the guidelines that key sentences for crimes of theft,fraud,and deceit to the amount of the victim loss.see,united states smith,cir.united states schneider,cir.moreover,but unsuccessful criminals hardly receive lenient treatment under the other guidelines that would apply to them.thus,it is not obvious that the commission intends for this particular guideline to apply to such criminals.it seems quite possible the commission focus here was on a distinct group namely,those defendants for whom a life of crime pays.and thus it seems quite possible that the commission did not intend to impose this additional enhancement upon a defendant who made no living off of crime at all.
but whatever the commission view actually is,the basic point is this the commission has failed to speak with the clarity that we demand before we construe legal texts in a manner that would subject persons to additional criminal punishment.as a result,i would not apply the guideline as broadly as the majority would.i would instead leave the task of clarifying its breadth to the commission.
this figure is equal to times the hourly federal minimum wage in effect during the time period relevant to this case,per the total called for in the guideline.see app.
the court concluded,and gordon does not contest,that during the period measured from january,to the date of gordon arrest on january,gordon personally derived gross income in excess of from drug trafficking.united states gordon,cr gzs,wl,at me.as to gordon net income,the court concluded that,on the limited evidence before it,given the amount of money gordon had paid to procure the cocaine base,his net income from drug trafficking during that period was less than.id.at.
gordon challenges to the district court factfinding regarding his income have been mooted.in its january,order,the district court clarified that its application of the criminal livelihood enhancement was based on its finding that gordon derived gross income in excess of from drug trafficking between january,and january,see gordon,wl,at a finding that gordon does not contest.
at no time,here or in the district court,has gordon able counsel argued that the rule of lenity should be applied to this guidelines interpretation question.as such,the government has not had the occasion to respond to any such argument,and it has been waived.see united states zannino,cir.that alone distinguishes this case from united states santos,where the parties explicitly addressed the applicability vel non of the rule of lenity in the distinct context of statutory interpretation.further,as is now clear from beckles united states,wl,concerns about statutory vagueness,which underlie the rule of lenity,do not give rise to similar concerns regarding the guidelines.id.at.
indeed,the threshold is not designed to approximate the annual profits of a minimum wage worker after deducting the potentially numerous expenses associated with his employment,such as the taxes withheld from his paycheck,the gasoline or fare expended on his commute,the clothing required by his workplace dress code,and the child care he might need during working hours.
for example,in united states kellams,the criminal livelihood enhancement was applied to a defendant who had committed mail fraud by sending invoices to local governments demanding payment for products that he had never provided,cir.if the court had been required to calculate the defendant net income from the he obtained,it is not clear whether it would have needed to treat as deductible expenses the postage he purchased,the paper and ink he used to print the fraudulent invoices,the post office box he rented to receive payments,and the gasoline he expended driving to and from that post office box.see id.
we reject gordon suggestion that the court in united states manuel,cir,which also applied the old version of,implied a requirement.there,unlike here,the government concede d the point and admit ted there was no evidence to suggest that the defendant profited enough to justify the enhancement,and so the court did not state one way or another whether the guideline required a finding as to a defendant profits.id.at.in any event,a subsequent eighth circuit case applying the current version of the guideline suggests that no such requirement exists.see morse,at.in united states taylor,which applied the current version of the guideline,the court did cite lee in passing for the proposition that livelihood is a matter of net rather than gross income,but the court then proceeded to determine that the defendant had met the income threshold based on in direct evidence of his recei
