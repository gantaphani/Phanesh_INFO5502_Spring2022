after the state of michigan rested its case at petitioner evans arson trial,the court granted evans motion for a directed verdict of acquittal,concluding that the state had failed to prove that the burned building was not a dwelling,a fact the court mistakenly believed was an element of the statutory offense.the state court of appeals reversed and remanded for retrial.in affirming,the state supreme court held that a directed verdict based on an error of law that did not resolve a factual element of the charged offense was not an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes.
held the double jeopardy clause bars retrial for evans offense.
a retrial following a acquittal is barred,even if the acquittal is based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,fong foo united states,such as an erroneous decision to exclude evidence,sanabria united states,a mistaken understanding of what evidence would suffice to sustain a conviction,smith massachusetts,or a misconstruction of the statute defining the requirements to convict,arizona rumsey.most relevant here,an acquittal encompasses any ruling that the prosecution proof is insufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.see,united states scott,burks united states.in contrast to procedural rulings,which lead to dismissals or mistrials on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence,acquittals are substantive rulings that conclude proceedings absolutely,and thus raise significant double jeopardy concerns.scott,at.here,the trial court clearly evaluated the state evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.united states martin linen supply.evans acquittal was the product of an erroneous interpretation of governing legal principles,but that error affects only the accuracy of the determination to acquit,not its essential character.see scott,at.
b the state supreme court attempted to distinguish this court cases on the ground that they involved the sufficiency of the factual elements of the charged offense,while evans case concerned an error of law unrelated to his guilt or innocence,but this court perceives no such difference.this case,like the court previous ones,involves an antecedent legal error that led to an acquittal because the state failed to prove a fact it was not actually required to prove.the state and the united states claim that only when an actual element of the offense is resolved can there be an acquittal of the offense,but evans verdict was based on something that was concededly not an element.their argument reads martin linen too narrowly and is inconsistent with this court decisions since then.martin linen focused on the significance of the district court acquittal based on a nonculpability determination,and its result did not depend on defining the elements of the offense.culpability is the touchstone,not whether any particular elements were resolved or whether the nonculpability determination was legally correct.scott,at.
c additional arguments the state and the united states raise in support of the lower court distinction are unpersuasive.the state claims that unless an actual element of the offense is resolved by the trial court,the only way to know whether the court ruling was an acquittal is to rely upon the court label,which would wrongly allow the form of the trial court action to control.however,the instant decision turns not on the form of the trial court action but on whether that action serves substantive or procedural purposes.the state and the united states argue that if the grounds for an acquittal are untethered from the actual elements of the offense,a trial court could issue an unreviewable order finding insufficient evidence to convict for any reason at all.but this court presumes that courts exercise their duties in good faith.the state also suggests that evans should not be heard to complain when a error that he induced is corrected and the state wishes to retry him,but most midtrial acquittals result from defense motions.the united states claims that,under lee united states,evans was required to ask the court to resolve whether nondwelling status was an element of the offense before jeopardy attached.however,lee involved a midtrial dismissal that was akin to a mistrial,while this case involves a ruling on the sufficiency of the state proof.
d this court declines to revisit decisions such as fong foo,smith,rumsey,and smalis pennsylvania.there is no reason to believe that the existing rules have become so unworkable as to justify overruling precedent.payne tennessee.and the logic of those cases still holds.as for the objection that the rule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity to present its evidence to the jury while the defendant reaps a windfall from the trial court unreviewable error,sovereigns have power to prevent such situations by disallowing the practice of midtrial acquittals,encouraging courts to defer consideration of a motion to acquit until after the jury renders a verdict,or providing for mandatory continuances or expedited interlocutory appeals.

lamar evans,petitioner michigan 
on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of michigan 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
when the state of michigan rested its case at petitioner lamar evans arson trial,the court entered a directed verdict of acquittal,based upon its view that the state had not provided sufficient evidence of a particular element of the offense.it turns out that the unproven element was not actually a required element at all.we must decide whether an erroneous acquittal such as this nevertheless constitutes an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes,which would mean that evans could not be retried.this court has previously held that a judicial acquittal premised upon a misconstruction of a criminal statute is an acquittal on the merits that bars retrial.arizona rumsey.seeing no meaningful constitutional distinction between a trial court misconstruction of a statute and its erroneous addition of a statutory element,we hold that a midtrial acquittal in these circumstances is an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes as well.
the state charged evans with burning other real property,a violation of.comp.laws.the state evidence at trial suggested that evans had burned down an unoccupied house.at the close of the state case,however,evans moved for a directed verdict of acquittal.he pointed the court to the applicable michigan criminal jury instructions,which listed as the fourth element of the offense that the building was not a dwelling house.crim.jury instr,supp.and the commentary to the instructions emphasized,an essential element is that the structure burned is not a dwelling house.at.evans argued that.comp.laws criminalizes arson,which requires that the structure burned be a dwelling,while the provision under which he was charged,covers all other real property persuaded,the trial court granted the motion.the court explained that the testimony of the homeowner was this was a dwelling house,so the nondwelling requirement of was not met.ibid.
on the state appeal,the michigan court of appeals reversed and remanded.app.evans had conceded,and the court held,that under controlling precedent,burning other real property is a lesser included offense under michigan law,and disproving the greater offense is not required,at,at citing people antonelli.app,on rehearing the court thus explained it was undisputed that the trial court misperceived the elements of the offense with which evans was charged and erred by directing a verdict.at,at.but the court rejected evans argument that the double jeopardy clause barred retrial,at,at.
in a divided decision,the supreme court of michigan affirmed.it held that when a trial court grants a defendant motion for a directed verdict on the basis of an error of law that did not resolve any factual element of the charged offense,the trial court ruling does not constitute an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy and retrial is therefore not barred.at,at.
we granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement among state and federal courts on the question whether retrial is barred when a trial court grants an acquittal because the prosecution had failed to prove an element of the offense that,in actuality,it did not have to prove.we now reverse.
in answering this question,we do not write on a clean slate.quite the opposite.it has been half a century since we first recognized that the double jeopardy clause bars retrial following a acquittal,even if the acquittal is based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.fong foo united states,per curiam.a mistaken acquittal is an acquittal nonetheless,and we have long held that a verdict of acquittal could not be reviewed,on error or otherwise,without putting a defendant twice in jeopardy,and thereby violating the constitution.united states ball.
our cases have applied fong foo principle broadly.an acquittal is unreviewable whether a judge directs a jury to return a verdict of acquittal,fong foo,at,or forgoes that formality by entering a judgment of acquittal herself.see smith massachusetts,collecting cases.and an acquittal precludes retrial even if it is premised upon an erroneous decision to exclude evidence,sanabria united states,a mistaken understanding of what evidence would suffice to sustain a conviction,smith,at or a misconstruction of the statute defining the requirements to convict,rumsey,at,smalis pennsylvania.in all these circumstances,the fact that the acquittal may result from erroneous evidentiary rulings or erroneous interpretations of governing legal principles affects the accuracy of that determination,but it does not alter its essential character.united states scott,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
most relevant here,our cases have defined an acquittal to encompass any ruling that the prosecution proof is insufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.see,and burks united states,united states martin linen supply.thus an acquittal includes a ruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to convict,a factual finding that necessarily establish es the criminal defendant lack of criminal culpability,and any other rulin g which relate s to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence.scott,at,and internal quotation marks omitted.these sorts of substantive rulings stand apart from procedural rulings that may also terminate a case midtrial,which we generally refer to as dismissals or mistrials.procedural dismissals include rulings on questions that are unrelated to factual guilt or innocence,but which serve other purposes,including a legal judgment that a defendant,although criminally culpable,may not be punished because of some problem like an error with the indictment,at,and.
both procedural dismissals and substantive rulings result in an early end to trial,but we explained in scott that the double jeopardy consequences of each differ.t he law attaches particular significance to an acquittal,so a ruling concludes proceedings absolutely,at.this is because t o permit a second trial after an acquittal,however mistaken the acquittal may have been,would present an unacceptably high risk that the government,with its vastly superior resources,might wear down the defendant so that even though innocent he may be found guilty,ibid.quoting green united states.and retrial following an acquittal would upset a defendant expectation of repose,for it would subject him to additional embarrassment,expense and ordeal while compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.at.in contrast,a termination of the proceedings against a defendant on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which he is accused,at,some procedural ground,does not pose the same concerns,because no expectation of finality attaches to a properly granted mistrial.
here,it is plain that the trial court evaluated the state evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.martin linen,at.the trial court granted evans motion under a rule that requires the court to direct a verdict of acquittal on any charged offense as to which the evidence is insufficient to support conviction.rule crim.proc.a.and the court oral ruling leaves no doubt that it made its determination on the basis of t he testimony that the state had presented,at,at.this ruling was not a dismissal on a procedural ground unrelated to factual guilt or innocence,like the question of preindictment delay in scott,but rather a determination that the state had failed to prove its case,at.under our precedents,then,evans was acquitted.
there is no question the trial court ruling was wrong it was predicated upon a clear misunderstanding of what facts the state needed to prove under state law.but that is of no moment.martin linen,sanabria,rumsey,smalis,and smith all instruct that an acquittal due to insufficient evidence precludes retrial,whether the court evaluation of the evidence was correct or not,martin linen,at,and regardless of whether the court decision flowed from an incorrect antecedent ruling of law.here evans acquittal was the product of an erroneous interpretatio n of governing legal principles,but as in our other cases,that error affects only the accuracy of the determination to acquit,not its essential character.scott,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the court below saw things differently.it identified a constitutionally meaningful difference between this case and our previous decisions.those cases,the court found,involve d evidentiary errors regarding the proof needed to establish a factual element of the crimes at issue,but still ultimately involved a resolution regarding the sufficiency of the factual elements of the charged offense.at,at.when a court mistakenly identifie s an extraneous element and dismisse s the case solely on that basis,however,it has not resolve d or even address ed any factual element necessary to establish the offense,at,at.as a result,the court below reasoned,the case terminates based on an error of law unrelated to the defendant guilt or innocence on the of the charged offense,and thus falls outside the definition of an acquittal,at,at.
we fail to perceive the difference.this case,like our previous ones,involves an antecedent legal error that led to an acquittal because the state failed to prove some fact it was not actually required to prove.consider rumsey.there the trial court,sitting as sentencer in a capital case involving a murder committed during a robbery,mistakenly held that arizona statutory aggravating factor describing killings for pecuniary gain was limited to murders for hire.accordingly,it found the state had failed to prove the killing was for pecuniary gain and sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment.after the state successfully appealed and obtained a death sentence on remand,we held that retrial on the penalty phase question was a double jeopardy violation 
the only relevant difference between that situation and this one is that in rumsey the trial court error was called a misinterpretation and a misconstruction of the statute,at,whereas here the error has been designated the erroneous addition of an extraneous element to the charged offense.at,at.but we have emphasized that labels do not control our analysis in this context rather,the substance of a court decision does.see smalis,at,scott,at martin linen,at.the error in rumsey could just as easily have been characterized as the erroneous addition of an element of the statutory aggravating circumstance that the homicide be a.conversely,the error here could be viewed as a misinterpretation of the statute phrase building or other real property to exclude dwellings this is far too fine a distinction to be meaningful,and we reject the notion that a defendant constitutional rights would turn on the happenstance of how an appellate court chooses to describe a trial court error.
echoing the michigan supreme court,the state and the united states,as well as the dissent,emphasize martin linen description of an acquittal as the resolution,correct or not,of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.at emphasis added see brief for respondent see brief for united states as amicus curiae hereinafter brief see post,at.they observe that the double jeopardy clause protects against being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offence,amdt,cl,and they note that an offense comprises constituent parts called elements,which are facts that must be proved to sustain a conviction.see,united states dixon.consequently,they argue,only if an actual element of the offense is resolved can it be said that there has been an acquittal of the offense,because innocence of the charged offense can not turn on something that is concededly not an element of the offense.brief.because evans trial ended without resolution of even one actual element,they conclude,there was no acquittal.
this argument reads martin linen too narrowly,and it is inconsistent with our decisions since then.our focus in martin linen was on the significance of a judicial acquittal under fed.rule crim.proc.the district court in that case had evaluated the government evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a.at.that determination of nonculpability was enough to make the acquittal akin to a jury verdict our holding did not depend upon defining the elements of the offense.as we have explained,supra,at,scott confirms that the relevant distinction is between judicial determinations that go to the criminal defendant lack of criminal culpability,and those that hold that a defendant,although criminally culpable,may not be punished because of a supposed procedural error,at.culpability,the ultimate question of guilt or innocence is the touchstone,not whether any particular elements were resolved or whether the determination of nonculpability was legally correct,at,internal quotation marks omitted.
perhaps most inconsistent with the state and united states argument is burks.there we held that when a defendant raises insanity as a defense,and a court decides the government ha s failed to come forward with sufficient proof of the defendant capacity to be responsible for criminal acts,the defendant has been acquitted because the court decided that criminal culpability ha s not been established.at.lack of insanity was not an element of burks offense,bank robbery by use of a dangerous weapon.see d ed.rather,insanity was an affirmative defense to criminal liability.our conclusion thus depended upon equating a judicial acquittal with an order finding insufficient evidence of culpability,not insufficient evidence of any particular element of the offense 
in the end,this case follows those that have come before it.the trial court judgment of acquittal resolved the question of evans guilt or innocence as a matter of the sufficiency of the evidence,not on unrelated procedural grounds.that judgment,however erroneous it was,precludes reprosecution on this charge,and so should have barred the state appeal as well.sanabria,at.
the state,supported by the united states,offers three other reasons why the distinction drawn by the court below should be maintained.none persuades us.
to start,the state argues that unless an actual element of the offense is resolved by the trial court,the only way to know whether the court ruling was an acquittal is to rely upon the label used by the court,which would wrongly allow the form of the trial court action to control.brief for respondent.we disagree.our decision turns not on the form of the trial court action,but rather whether it serve s substantive purposes or procedural ones.scott,at.if a trial court were to announce,midtrial,the defendant shall be acquitted because he was prejudiced by preindictment delay,the double jeopardy clause would pose no barrier to reprosecution,notwithstanding the acquittal label.scott.here we know the trial court acquitted evans,not because it incanted the word acquit which it did not,but because it acted on its view that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.
next,the state and the united states fear that if the grounds for an acquittal are untethered from the actual elements of the offense,a trial court could issue an unreviewable order finding insufficient evidence to convict for any reason at all,such as that the prosecution failed to prove that the structure burned was blue.brief for respondent brief.if the concern is that there is no limit to the magnitude of the error that could yield an acquittal,the response is that we have long held as much.see supra,at.if the concern is instead that our holding will make it easier for courts to insulate from review acquittals that are granted as a form of nullification,see brief for respondent,we reject the premise.we presume here,as in other contexts,that courts exercise their duties in good faith.harrington richter,slip,at.
finally,the state suggests that because evans induced the trial court error,he should not be heard to complain when that error is corrected and the state wishes to retry him.brief for respondent,at.but we have recognized that most judgments of acquittal result from defense motions,so t o hold that a defendant waives his double jeopardy protection whenever a trial court error in his favor on a midtrial motion leads to an acquittal would undercut the adversary assumption on which our system of criminal justice rests,and would vitiate one of the fundamental rights established by the fifth amendment.sanabria,at citation omitted it is true that when a defendant persuades the court to declare a mistrial,jeopardy continues and retrial is generally allowed.see united states dinitz.but in such circumstances the defendant consents to a disposition that contemplates reprosecution,whereas when a defendant moves for acquittal he does not.see sanabria,at.
the united states makes a related argument.it contends that evans could have asked the court to resolve whether nondwelling status is an element of the offense before jeopardy attached,so having elected to wait until trial was underway to raise the point,he can not now claim a double jeopardy violation.brief.the government relies upon lee united states,in which the district court dismissed an indictment midtrial because it had failed to allege the required intent element of the offense.we held that retrial on a corrected indictment was not barred,because the dismissal was akin to a mistrial,not an acquittal.this was clear because the district court had separately denied the defendant motion for judgment of acquittal,explaining that the defendant has been proven guilty beyond any reasonable doubt in the world,while acknowledging that the error in the indictment required dismissal,at.because the defendant invited the court to interrupt the proceedings before formalizing a finding on the merits by raising the indictment issue so late,we held the principles governing a defendant consent to mistrial should apply,at citing dinitz.
the government suggests the situation here is functionally similar,because identifying the elements of an offense is a necessary step in determining the sufficiency of a charging document.brief.but we can not ignore the fact that what the trial court actually did here was rule on the sufficiency of the state proof,not the sufficiency of the information filed against him.lee demonstrates that the two need not rise or fall together.and even if the government is correct that evans could have challenged the charging document on the same legal theory he used to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence,it matters that he made only the latter motion,a motion that necessarily may not be made until trial is underway.evans can not be penalized for requesting from the court a ruling on the merits of the state case,as the michigan rules entitled him to do whether he could have also brought a distinct procedural objection earlier on is beside the point.
in the alternative,the state and the united states ask us to reconsider our past decisions.brief for respondent suggesting overruling our cases since at least fong foo brief suggesting overruling smith,rumsey,and smalis we declined to revisit our cases when the united states made a similar request in smalis,at see brief for united states as amicus curiae in smalis pennsylvania.and we decline to do so here.
first,we have no reason to believe the existing rules have become so unworkable as to justify overruling precedent.payne tennessee.the distinction drawn in scott has stood the test of time,and we expect courts will continue to have little difficulty in distinguishing between those rulings which relate to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence and those which serve other purposes.at,internal quotation marks omitted.see,united states dionisio,collecting cases lafave,israel,king,kerr,criminal procedure a,ed.same.
second,the logic of these cases still holds.there is no question that a jury verdict of acquittal precludes retrial,and thus bars appeal of any legal error that may have led to that acquittal.see ball,at.so,had the trial court here instructed the jury that it must find the burned structure was not a dwelling in order to convict,the jury would have acquitted evans accordingly a jury is presumed to follow its instructions.blueford arkansas,slip,at quoting weeks angelone.and that would have been the end of the matter.from that premise,fong foo holding follows if a trial court instead exercises its discretion to direct a jury to return a verdict of acquittal,jeopardy also terminates notwithstanding any legal error,because there too it is the jury that returns an acquittal.and from there,martin linen conclusion is unavoidable it should make no difference whether the court employs the formality of directing the jury to return an acquittal or whether the court enters an acquittal itself.sanabria,rumsey,smalis,and smith merely apply fong foo and martin linen in tandem if a trial court makes an antecedent legal error as in fong foo,and then grants a judgment of acquittal rather than directing the jury to acquit as in martin linen,the result is an acquittal all the same.
in other words,there is no way for antecedent legal errors to be reviewable in the context of judicial acquittals unless those errors are also reviewable when they give rise to jury acquittals contrary to the settled understanding that a jury verdict of acquittal is unreviewable,or unless we distinguish between juries that acquit pursuant to their instructions and judicial acquittals notwithstanding that this is a purely formal distinction.neither option has become more attractive with time.we therefore reiterate any contention that the double jeopardy clause must itself leave open a way of correcting legal errors is at odds with the rule that the bar will attach to a preverdict acquittal that is patently wrong in law.smith,at.
finally,the state and the united states object that this rule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity to present its evidence to the jury,while the defendant reaps a windfall from the trial court unreviewable error.brief for respondent brief.but sovereigns are hardly powerless to prevent this sort of situation,as we observed in smith,at.nothing obligates a jurisdiction to afford its trial courts the power to grant a midtrial acquittal,and at least two states disallow the practice.see.stat.state parfait.app.cir,so.many jurisdictions,including the federal system,allow or encourage their courts to defer consideration of a motion to acquit until after the jury returns a verdict,which mitigates double jeopardy concerns see fed.rule crim.proc.b.and for cases such as this,in which a trial court interpretation of the relevant criminal statute is likely to prove dispositive,we see no reason why jurisdictions could not provide for mandatory continuances or expedited interlocutory appeals if they wished to prevent misguided acquittals from being entered but having chosen to vest its courts with the power to grant midtrial acquittals,the state must bear the corresponding risk that some acquittals will be granted in error.
we hold that evans trial ended in an acquittal when the trial court ruled the state had failed to produce sufficient evidence of his guilt.the double jeopardy clause thus bars retrial for his offense and should have barred the state appeal.the judgment of the supreme court of michigan is 
alito,dissenting

on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of michigan 
justice alito,dissenting.
the court holds that the double jeopardy clause bars petitioner retrial for arson because his attorney managed to convince a judge to terminate petitioner first trial prior to verdict on the specious ground that the offense with which he was charged contains an imaginary element that the prosecution could not prove.the court decision makes no sense.it is not consistent with the original meaning of the double jeopardy clause it does not serve the purposes of the prohibition against double jeopardy and contrary to the court reasoning,the trial judge ruling was not an acquittal,which our cases have consistently defined as a decision that actually represents a resolution,correct or not,of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.smith massachusetts,quoting united states martin linen supply,emphasis added.for no good reason,the court deprives the state of michigan of its right to have one fair opportunity to convict petitioner,and i therefore respectfully dissent.
after detroit police officers heard an explosion at a burning house,they observed petitioner running away from the building with a gasoline can.the officers pursued and ultimately apprehended petitioner,who admitted that he had burned down the house.no one was living in the house at the time of the fire.
if the house in question had been a dwelling house,petitioner could have been charged under.comp.laws for burning a dwelling,an offense punishable by imprisonment for up to years.but petitioner was instead charged with b urning other real property in violation of.comp.laws.this offense,which carries a maximum penalty of years imprisonment,applies to a ny person who wilfully or maliciously burns any building or other real property other than those specified in.this crime is a lesser included offense of the crime of burning a dwelling house.the necessary elements to prove either offense are the same,except to prove the greater offense it must be shown that the building is a dwelling.internal quotation marks omitted.to prove the lesser offense,however,it is not necessary to prove that the building is not a dwelling.at,at emphasis added.
at the close of the prosecution case,petitioner attorney moved for a directed verdict on the ground that the prosecution was required to prove,as an element of the charged offense,that the building was not a dwelling and the prosecution had failed to prove that the burned building was not a dwelling house.at,at.the prosecutor responded by arguing that nothing in the charged offense requires proof that the building was not a dwelling,and the prosecutor requested a moment to pull the statute and consult with her supervisors.at,at.the trial judge denied the prosecutor requests and erroneously concluded that the prosecution was required to prove that the burned building was not a dwelling.after determining that the state had not proved this nonexistent element,the trial judge granted petitioner motion for a directed verdict and entered an order that it labeled an a cquittal.app.to pet.for cert.
the trial judge ruling was plainly wrong,and on appeal,defense counsel did not even attempt to defend its correctness,conceding that the judge had wrongly added an extraneous element to the statute under which his client was charged,at,at see also.app,and,and.the michigan court of appeals agreed with this concession and went on to hold that the trial judge ruling did not constitute an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes because the ruling did not represent a resolution in the defendant favor of a factual element necessary for a criminal conviction.at,at internal quotation marks omitted.the michigan supreme court affirmed,holding that when,as here,a trial judge erroneously adds an extra element to a charged offense and subsequently determines that the prosecution did not prove that extra element,the trial judge decision is not based on the defendant guilt or innocence of the elements of the charged offense,at,at.accordingly,the michigan supreme court concluded that the judge ruling in this case does not constitute an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy and retrial is not barred.at,at.
this court now reverses the decision of the state supreme court,but the court holding is supported by neither the original understanding of the prohibition against double jeopardy nor any of the reasons for that prohibition.
the prohibition against double jeopardy had its origin in the three pleas of autrefois acquit,autrefois convict,and pardon,which prevented the retrial of a person who had previously been acquitted,convicted,or pardoned for the same offense.united states scott,see crist bretz.as the court has previously explained,the protection against double jeopardy historically applied only to charges on which a jury had rendered a verdict.smith,at emphasis added as a result,the original understanding of the clause,which is hardly a matter of dispute,scott,supra,at,does not compel the court conclusion that a defendant is acquitted for double jeopardy purposes whenever a judge issues a preverdict ruling that the prosecution has failed to prove a nonexistent element of the charged offense.
although our decisions have expanded double jeopardy protection beyond its origins,see,smith,supra,at acknowledging the court expansion of the protection against double jeopardy crist,supra,at,i nonetheless count it significant that the result the court reaches today finds no support in the relevant analogues that lie at the core of the area protected by the double jeopardy clause,see scott,at.and given how far we have departed from the principles that applied at the time of the founding,we should at least ensure that our decisions in this area serve the underlying purposes of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.see,at.yet today decision fails to advance the purposes of the double jeopardy clause.
the double jeopardy clause is largely based on the deeply ingrained principle that the state with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense,thereby subjecting him to embarrassment,expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity,as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.yeager united states,internal quotation marks omitted see also blueford arkansas,slip,at martin linen,at.allowing retrial in the circumstances of the present case would not result in any such abuse.the prosecution would not be afforded a second opportunity to persuade the factfinder that its evidence satisfies the actual elements of the offense.instead,because the trial judge ruling in the first trial was not based on an actual element of the charged offense,retrial would simply give the prosecution one fair opportunity to prove its case.
allowing retrial in this case would not permit prosecutors to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense,yeager,supra,at.it was petitioner,not the prosecutor,who sought to terminate the trial prior to verdict.thus,contrary to the court unexplained suggestion,see ante,at,t his case hardly presents the specter of an state relentlessly pursuing a defendant who had either been found not guilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of guilt submitted to the first trier of fact.sattazahn pennsylvania,quoting scott,supra,at.on the contrary,this is a case in which defense counsel fooled the judge into committing an error that provided his client with an undeserved benefit,the termination of a trial that the defense obviously did not want to run to completion.the double jeopardy clause does not require that the defense receive an even greater benefit,the protection provided by an acquittal.as this court has repeatedly emphasized in double jeopardy cases,a state has an interest in receiving one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws,sattazahn,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted scott,supra,at,but today decision deprives the state of michigan of this valuable right.
the court decision also flies in the face of our established understanding of the meaning of an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes.the double jeopardy clause provides that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.amdt.emphasis added.thus,d analysis focuses on the individual offence charged.smith,at.and to determine what constitutes the individual offence charged,the court homes in on the elements of the offense.see united states dixon,in both the multiple punishment and multiple prosecution contexts,this court has concluded that where the two offenses for which the defendant is punished or tried can not survive the test,the double jeopardy bar applies consistent with the constitutional text focus on the offence and thus the elements with which a defendant is charged,the court cases have consistently defined an acquittal as a decision that actually represents a resolution,correct or not,of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.smith,supra,at quoting martin linen,supra,at see also scott,supra,at a defendant is acquitted only when the ruling of the judge,whatever its label,actually represents a resolution in the defendant favor,correct or not,of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
today,the court effectively abandons the definition of an acquittal.indeed,in the face of our repeated holdings that an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes requires a resolution,correct or not,of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,smith,supra,at martin linen,supra,at see also scott,supra,at,the court now declares that the touchstone is not whether any particular elements were resolved,ante,at emphasis added.instead,the court proclaims that the dispositive question is whether a midtrial termination represented a procedural dismissa l or a substantive rulin g,ante,at.this reformulation of double jeopardy law is not faithful to our precedents or to the double jeopardy clause itself.the key question is not whether a ruling is procedural or substantive whatever those terms mean in this context,but whether a ruling relates to the defendant factual guilt or innocence with respect to the offence,see,amdt.and thus the elements with which he is charged.see scott,supra,at,and.
when a judge evaluates the evidence and determines that the prosecution has not proved facts that are legally sufficient to satisfy the actual elements of the charged offense,the ruling,however labeled,represents an acquittal because it is founded on the defendant factual innocence.see martin linen,at.but when a judge manufactures an additional element of an offense and then holds that there is insufficient evidence to prove that extra element,the judge has not resolved the defendant factual guilt or innocence as to any of the actual elements of the offense thus,the ruling,no matter what the judge calls it,does not acquit the defendant of the offense with which he is charged.no acquittal occurs when a criminal trial is terminated on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which a defendant is accused.scott,at.i n a case such as this the defendant,by deliberately choosing to seek termination of the proceedings against him on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which he is accused,suffers no injury cognizable under the double jeopardy clause if the government is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial court in favor of the defendant.at reasoning that,in such a case,the defe
