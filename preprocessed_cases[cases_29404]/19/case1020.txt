antonio correia sued,sergeant detective william feeney,for violating his civil rights by means of false arrest and the use of excessive force.following a trial,the jury returned a verdict for feeney.correia appeals,claiming that the trial court committed reversible error in denying his motion for a new trial,in its answer to a question from the jury,and in allowing certain.after careful review of the trial record we find no error in the district court denial of correia motion or its handling of the case.accordingly,we affirm.
on june,correia filed this suit against three boston police officers,including sergeant detective william feeney,and the city of boston.his claims relate to the events of july.on that day,officer feeney was working a routine road construction detail at the intersection of brook avenue and west cottage street in boston.at some point during the course of feeney detail duty,correia drove up brook avenue to the intersection with west cottage street.correia was in a hurry to deliver insulin to his diabetic mother,who was at a house he owned on the far side of the intersection of brook avenue and west cottage street.feeney turned correia away from the intersection,which meant that correia could not get to his driveway.upon being denied access to his driveway,correia pulled across the street and parked in one of two spaces that were empty on the left side of the street.feeney went over to the car and he and correia had a physical altercation that ended in correia arrest.correia amended complaint alleged that three police officers assaulted,battered,and falsely arrested him without provocation or justification in violation of his federal and state constitutional rights.
on august,a motion for summary judgment was filed on behalf of all defendants except feeney.the district court granted summary judgment for those defendants the suit against feeney proceeded to trial.after a four day trial that concluded on may,and slightly over three hours of deliberation,the jury found for feeney on all claims.correia then filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.the district court denied the motion on june.correia now appeals.
as noted,correia argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the weight of the evidence at trial was in his favor responding to a question posed by the jury in an unfair,confusing,and misleading fashion and permitting a prejudicial line of questioning on over correia objection.we consider these issues in turn.
denial of correia motion for a new trial 
the district court should grant a motion for a new trial only if the outcome is against the clear weight of the evidence such that upholding the verdict will result in a miscarriage of justice.goulet new penn motor express,cir quoting ramos davis geck,cir.on appeal,we owe much deference to the trial court determination.see jennings jones,cir circuit judges,reading the dry pages of the record,do not experience the tenor of the testimony at trial.quoting united states alston,cir.unlike our review of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,we do not engage in de novo review and we do not take the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner.id.at.we reverse only if we find that the trial court has abused its discretion in making its assessment of the weight of the evidence.id.at.
in arguing that the jury verdict for feeney was so against the weight of the evidence that he was entitled to a new trial,correia cites testimony at trial corroborating his version of events and purported contradictions in feeney testimony.in addition,he argues that the length of the jury deliberations supports the conclusion that the verdict was out of sync with the evidence presented.we disagree.
the material dispute at the core of correia excessive force and unlawful arrest claims involves feeney interaction with correia when he first spoke to and then confronted him in his car after he had parked.in order to prevail on his excessive force claim,correia had to show that the defendant employed force that was unreasonable under all the circumstances.morelli webster,cir.his unlawful arrest claim required a showing that feeney lacked probable cause to arrest him.see id.at.in essence,both claims required the jury to find that feeney behavior during the confrontation with correia was unwarranted and unreasonable.
only correia and feeney were able to give accounts at trial of what they said and did during their confrontation.correia testified that after he refused to give feeney his car keys,feeney,without warning and without asking correia to produce his license,grabbed and twisted correia arm through the car window,opened the car door,and started punching him.correia insisted that he did not punch or hit feeney.at some point during the ensuing scuffle,however,when feeney had correia in a grip that impeded his breathing,he bit feeney to get him to let go.
feeney testified that correia refused to produce his license when asked.feeney then tried to remove correia from the car,prompting correia to bite him.to get correia to release his bite,feeney hit him.no other witnesses at trial gave accounts of that part of the altercation.thus,the jury had to decide whether to accept correia account of the altercation or feeney.that they exercised their judgment in favor of feeney is not grounds for a new trial.it is axiomatic that,absent exceptional circumstances,issues of witness credibility are to be decided by the jury.united states garcia,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
correia argues that his witnesses corroborated his version of events,while feeney witnesses gave contradictory accounts of what transpired,harming feeney credibility.that argument overlooks inconsistencies in the evidence presented by correia witnesses.for example,correia and one of his witnesses asserted that two other officers who had been working the detail with feeney came to the scene to assist him,helped him remove correia from the car,and then were stomping him with their feet once he was on the ground.correia other four witnesses testified that he was not beaten once he was removed from the car.
those inconsistencies were damaging to correia case.it was reasonable for the district court to conclude,in assessing correia motion for a new trial,that the verdict was not clearly against the weight of the evidence.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion for a new trial 
b.the answer to the jury question 
at the close of arguments,the district court instructed the jury,inter alia,on the fourth amendment issues implicated by feeney entry into correia vehicle.after a period of deliberation,the court received a written question from the jury can detective feeney enter the car without violating the fourth amendment after refusing to produce license and registration prior to summoning the jury to respond to their question,the judge told counsel that he planned to answer as follows the short answer to the question is yes,but you should consider all of my instructions,and,particularly,those that related to unlawful arrest and excessive force hearing this proposal,counsel for correia suggested that the judge simply reply,that is for the jury to decide.if the court gave its answer as proposed,correia counsel asked that the court note our objection.correia did not renew his objection when the final answer was read to the jury,which was as follows t he short answer to your question is yes,but you should consider all of my instructions on the law in deciding the issues before you.
on appeal,correia argues that the court answer was flawed for three reasons it assumed the validity of a disputed fact,namely that correia refused to produce his license and registration it emphasized the unlawful arrest claim over the excessive force claim and it decided correia unlawful arrest claim when combined with the inference that correia refused to produce his license and registration.
a case could be made that correia did not properly preserve these objections for
