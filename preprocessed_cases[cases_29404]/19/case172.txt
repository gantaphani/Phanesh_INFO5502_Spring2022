respondent martin was convicted of murder and robbery,and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.after the california supreme court denied martin first state habeas petition,he filed a federal habeas petition.the district court ordered a stay to permit martin to return to state court to raise claims he had not previously aired.martin raised those claims in his second habeas petition in the california supreme court,but gave no reason for his failure to assert the additional claims until nearly five years after his sentence and conviction became final.the california supreme court denied the petition,citing clark and robbins.having exhausted his remedies,martin filed an amended federal habeas petition.the district court dismissed his belatedly asserted claims as untimely under california law.the ninth circuit vacated that order and directed the district court to determine the adequacy of the state time bar.again rejecting martin petition,the district court found california bar an adequate state ground for denying martin new pleas.concluding that the time bar was not firmly defined or consistently applied,the ninth circuit remanded for a determination of the merits of martin claims.

a absent showings of cause and prejudice,see wainwright sykes,federal habeas relief will be unavailable when a state court has declined to address a prisoner federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement,and the state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds,coleman thompson.
b a rule can be firmly established and regularly followed,and therefore adequate,even if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not others.beard kindler.california time rule,although discretionary,meets this firmly established criterion.the california supreme court framed the requirement in a trilogy of cases,instructing habeas petitioners to alleg e with specificity the absence of substantial delay,good cause for delay,or eligibility for one of four exceptions to the time bar.gallego,cal,at,at.and california case law made it plain that martin nearly delay was substantial.see,at,and,at,and.the court finds unpersuasive martin argument that the terms reasonable time period and substantial delay make california rule too vague to be regarded as firmly established.while indeterminate language is typical of discretionary rules,application of those rules in particular circumstances can supply the requisite clarity.congressional statutes and this court decisions have employed time limitations that are not stated in precise,numerical terms.for example,current federal habeas prescriptions limit the time for filing a petition to one year.the clock runs from the date on which the supporting facts could have been discovered through due diligence.f.although due diligence is an inexact measure of how much delay is too much,johnson united states,use of an imprecise standard is no justification for depriving a rule language of any meaning,ibid.nor is california time rule vulnerable on the ground that it is not regularly followed.each year,the california state supreme court summarily denies hundreds of habeas petitions by citing clark and robbins.contrary to martin argument,california time bar is not infirm simply because a court may opt to bypass the assessment and summarily dismiss a petition on the merits,if that is the easier path.nor should a discretionary rule be disregarded automatically upon a showing that outcomes under the rule vary from case to case.discretion enables a court to home in on considerations and to avoid the harsh results that may attend consistent application of an unyielding rule.a state ground may be found inadequate when a court has exercised its discretion in a surprising or unfair manner,but martin makes no such contention here.
c this decision leaves unaltered the court repeated recognition that federal courts must carefully examine state procedural requirements to ensure that they do not operate to discriminate against claims of federal rights.see,brown western of.on the record here,however,there is no basis for concluding that california rule operates in such a discriminatory manner.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns california time limitation on applications for postconviction habeas corpus relief.the question presented does california timeliness requirement qualify as an independent state ground adequate to bar habeas corpus relief in federal court 
california does not employ fixed statutory deadlines to determine the timeliness of a state prisoner petition for habeas corpus.instead,california directs petitioners to file known claims as promptly as the circumstances allow.in re clark,cal.petitioners are further instructed to state when they first learned of the asserted claims and to explain why they did not seek postconviction relief sooner.in re robbins,cal.claims substantially delayed without justification may be denied as untimely.clark,cal,at,at.
california courts signal that a habeas petition is denied as untimely by citing the controlling decisions,clark and robbins.a spare order denying a petition without explanation or citation ordinarily ranks as a disposition on the merits.tr.of oral arg.see harrington richter,ante,at.california courts may elect to pretermit the question whether a petition is timely and simply deny the petition,thereby signaling that the petition lacks merit.
petitioner below,respondent here,charles martin,presented the claims at issue all alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in a habeas petition filed in the california supreme court nearly five years after his conviction became final.he stated no reason for the long delay.citing clark and robbins,the court denied martin petition.in turn,the district court for the eastern district of california dismissed martin federal habeas petition raising the same ineffective assistance claims.denial of martin petition as untimely,the district court held,rested on an adequate and independent state ground,martin failure to seek relief in state court without substantial delay.see robbins,cal,at,at.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed the district court decision.contrasting the precision of fixed statutory deadlines with california proscription of substantial delay,the appeals court held that california standard lacked the clarity and certainty necessary to constitute an adequate state bar.fed.appx,relying on townsend knowles.
in a recent decision,beard kindler,this court clarified that a state procedural bar may count as an adequate and independent ground for denying a federal habeas petition even if the state court had discretion to reach the merits despite the default.guided by that decision,we hold that california is not put to the choice of imposing a specific deadline for habeas petitions which would almost certainly rule out martin nearly delay or preserving the flexibility of current practice,but only at the cost of undermining the finality of state court judgments.at slip,at.in so ruling,we stress that martin has not alleged that california time bar,either by design or in operation,discriminates against federal claims or claimants.
while most states set determinate time limits for collateral relief applications,in california,neither statute nor rule of court does so.instead,california courts appl y a general reasonableness standard to judge whether a habeas petition is timely filed.carey saffold.the basic instruction provided by the california supreme court is simply that a habeas petition should be filed as promptly as the circumstances allow.clark,cal,at,at.
three leading decisions describe california timeliness requirement robbins,clark,and in re gallego,cal.a prisoner must seek habeas relief without substantial delay,robbins,cal,at,at gallego,cal,at,at clark,cal,at,at,as measured from the time the petitioner or counsel knew,or reasonably should have known,of the information offered in support of the claim and the legal basis for the claim,robbins,cal,at,at.petitioners in noncapital cases have the burden of establishing i absence of substantial delay,ii good cause for the delay,or iii that the claim falls within an exception to the bar of untimeliness.at,at 
california collateral review regime differs from that of other states in a second notable respect all california courts have original jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings,cal,art.vi,thus no appeal lies from the denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus,clark,cal,at,at.a prisoner whose petition has been denied by the superior court can obtain review of his claims only by the filing of a new petition in the court of appeal.ibid.the new petition,however,must be confined to claims raised in the initial petition.see in re martinez,cal.
because a habeas petitioner may skip over the lower courts and file directly in the california supreme court,in re kler,cal.app,cal.rptr,that court rules on a staggering number of habeas petitions each year the court issues generally unelaborated summary denials of petitions that d o not state a prima facie case for relief or that contain claims that are all procedurally barred.people romero,cal,internal quotation marks omitted.a summary denial citing clark and robbins means that the petition is rejected as untimely.see,brief for habeas corpus resource center as amicus curiae,and.california courts have discretion,however,to bypass a timeliness issue and,instead,summarily reject the petition for want of merit.see robbins,cal,at,at.see also saffold,at.
in december,charles martin participated in a robbery and murder in california.martin fled the state,but eight years later he was extradited to california to stand trial.convicted in state court of murder and robbery,martin was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.in,the california court of appeal affirmed his conviction and sentence,and the california supreme court denied review.
martin initiated his first round of state habeas proceedings in,and the next year,the california supreme court denied his petition.he then filed a habeas petition in the appropriate district court.finding that martin federal petition included claims he had not aired in state court,the district court stayed the federal proceedings pending martin return to state court to exhaust his remedies there 
in march,martin filed his second habeas petition in the california supreme court,raising the federal ineffective assistance claims his earlier filing omitted.he gave no reason for his failure to assert the additional claims until nearly five years after his sentence and conviction became final.tr.of oral arg.in september,the california supreme court denied martin petition in an order typical of that court summary dispositions for failure to file as promptly as the circumstances allow.clark,cal,at,at.the order read in its entirety petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.see in re clark cal,in re robbins cal.see app.to pet.for cert.
having exhausted state postconviction remedies,martin returned to federal court and filed an amended petition.based upon the california supreme court disposition,the district court dismissed martin belatedly asserted claims as procedurally precluded,at.the ninth circuit vacated the dismissal order and remanded the case,directing the district court to determine the adequacy of the state time bar.martin hubbard,fed.appx.the district court again rejected martin petition,stating that t he california timeliness bar as set forth in is clearly defined,well established and consistently applied.app.to pet.for cert.
the ninth circuit again disagreed.controlled by its prior decision in townsend,at,the court of appeals held that california time bar has yet to be firmly defined and was not shown by the state to be consistently applied.fed,at.the remand order directed the district court to determine the merits of the claims martin asserted in his second petition to the california supreme court.
we granted certiorari,to determine the adequacy of california practice under which a prisoner may be barred from collaterally attacking his conviction when he has substantially delayed filing his habeas petition.martin does not here dispute that the time limitation is an independent state ground.see brief in opposition.see also bennett mueller.nor does he contend that he established cause and prejudice,cause for the delay in asserting his claims and actual prejudice resulting from the state alleged violation of his constitutional rights.see wainwright sykes.
a federal habeas court will not review a claim rejected by a state court if the decision of the state court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.at slip,at quoting coleman thompson.the ground may be a substantive rule dispositive of the case,or a procedural barrier to adjudication of the claim on the merits.see sykes,at.
ordinarily,a state prisoner seeking federal habeas relief must first exhaus t the remedies available in the courts of the state,b a,thereby affording those courts the first opportunity to address and correct alleged violations of the prisoner federal rights,coleman,at.the adequate and independent state ground doctrine furthers that objective,for without it,habeas petitioners would be able to avoid the exhaustion requirement by defaulting their federal claims in state court.at.accordingly,absent showings of cause and prejudice,see sykes,at,federal habeas relief will be unavailable when a state court has declined to address a prisoner federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement,and the state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.coleman,at.
to qualify as an adequate procedural ground,a state rule must be firmly established and regularly followed.kindler,at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted a discretionary state procedural rule,we held in kindler,can serve as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review.ibid.a rule can be firmly established and regularly followed,kindler observed,even if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not others.ibid.
california time rule,although discretionary,meets the firmly established criterion,as kindler comprehended that requirement.the california supreme court,as earlier noted,framed the timeliness requirement for habeas petitioners in a trilogy of cases.see supra,at.those decisions instruct habeas petitioners to alleg e with specificity the absence of substantial delay,good cause for delay,or eligibility for one of four exceptions to the time bar.gallego,cal,at,at see robbins,cal,at,at and california case law
