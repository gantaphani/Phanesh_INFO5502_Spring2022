per curiam.
from beginning to end,judicial proceedings conducted for the purpose of deciding whether a defendant shall be put to death must be conducted with dignity and respect.the disturbing facts of this case raise serious questions concerning the conduct of the trial,and this petition raises a serious question about whether the court of appeals carefully reviewed those facts before addressing petitioner constitutional claims.we know that the court of appeals committed the same procedural error that we corrected in cone bell,slip,at.we do not know how the court would have ruled if it had the benefit of our decision in that case.
petitioner marcus wellons was convicted in georgia state court of rape and murder and sentenced to death.although the trial looked typical,there were unusual events going on behind the scenes.only after the trial did defense counsel learn that there had been unreported ex parte contacts between the jury and the judge,that jurors and a bailiff had planned a reunion,and that either during or immediately following the penalty phase,some jury members gave the trial judge chocolate shaped as male genitalia and the bailiff chocolate shaped as female breasts,the judge had not reported any of this to the defense.
neither wellons nor any court has ascertained exactly what went on at this capital trial or what prompted such gifts.wellons has repeatedly tried,in both state and federal court,to find out what occurred,but he has found himself caught in a procedural morass he raised the issue on direct appeal but was constrained by the nonexistent record,and the state supreme court affirmed his conviction and sentence.wellons state.he sought state habeas relief and moved to develop evidence.but the court held that the matter had been decided on appeal and thus was res judicata.see,at.he raised the issue again in his federal habeas petition,seeking discovery and an evidentiary hearing.but the district court concluded that wellons claims were procedurally barred,and accordingly denied his motion for an evidentiary hearing on these claims.at before the eleventh circuit,wellons argue d that the district court erred in denying his motions for discovery and an evidentiary hearing to develop his judge,juror,and bailiff misconduct claims because they are not procedurally barred.at.the court disagreed,holding that wellons claims were procedurally barred.ibid.
as our dissenting colleagues acknowledge,post,at opinion of scalia,post,at opinion of alito,the eleventh circuit holding was an error under cone,at slip,at.when a state court declines to review the merits of a petitioner claim on the ground that it has done so already,it creates no bar to federal habeas review.at slip,at.both dissenting opinions assume that the issue on which cone throws light does not affect the outcome because the eleventh circuit also decided that petitioner was not entitled to habeas relief on the merits.post,at opinion of scalia.having found a procedural bar,however,the eleventh circuit had no need to address whether petitioner was otherwise entitled to an evidentiary hearing and gave this question,at most,perfunctory consideration that may well have turned on the district court finding of a procedural bar.
although wellons appealed the denial of his motions for discovery and an evidentiary hearing,at,the eleventh circuit did not purport to address the merits of that issue at all the court stated only that e ven if we assume that wellons misconduct claims are not procedurally barred,they do not entitle wellons to habeas relief.at emphasis added.this opaque statement appears to address only whether petitioner was entitled to ultimate relief in the form of a new trial,not whether petitioner allegations,combined with the facts he had learned,entitled him to the discovery and evidentiary hearing that he sought.
the eleventh circuit reasoning does not suggest otherwise.the court observed that wellons claims of misconduct were grounded in his speculation as to the meaning underlying the jurors chocolate gifts and the surmise attached to their passive receipt of these gifts.ibid.this statement likewise indicates only that on the existing record,habeas relief was inappropriate,not that an evidentiary hearing should be denied.after all,had there been discovery or an evidentiary hearing,wellons may have been able to present more than speculation and surmise.the eleventh circuit also pointed to the state court decision on direct appeal,see,at,and reviewed that decision i n light of the evidence presented before the georgia supreme court,ibid.this,too,is typical of a court reviewing the denial of habeas relief,not the denial of discovery or an evidentiary hearing.
moreover,even assuming that the eleventh circuit intended to address wellons motions for discovery and an evidentiary hearing,we can not be sure that its reasoning really was independent of the cone error.the fact that his claims rested on speculation and surmise was due to the absence of a record,which was in part based on the cone error.and as the eleventh circuit reasoning turned on the evidence presented before the georgia supreme court,at,there is serious doubt about whether it necessarily relied on the very holes in the record that wellons was trying to fill.
our dissenting colleagues allege that the court is degrad ing our traditional requirements for a gvr.post,at opinion of scalia,see post,at opinion of alito.but the standard for an order granting certiorari,vacating the judgment below,and remanding the case gvr remains as it always has been a gvr is appropriate when intervening developments reveal a reasonable probability that the decision below rests upon a premise that the lower court would reject if given the opportunity for further consideration,and where it appears that such a redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome of the matter.lawrence chater,per curiam.as already discussed,there is,at least,a reasonable probability,that the denial of discovery and an evidentiary hearing rested in part on the cone error.and in light of the unusual facts of the case,a redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome,at williams taylor,holding that several omissions as a whole disclose the need for an evidentiary hearing smith phillips,this court has long held that the remedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has an opportunity to prove actual bias the eleventh circuit opinion is ambiguous in significant respects.it would be highly inappropriate to assume away that ambiguity in respondent favor.that is especially so in a case in which petitioner allegations and the unusual facts raise a serious question about the fairness of a capital trial.
both dissenting opinions suggest that if there is a strong case for discovery and an evidentiary hearing,then the court should summarily reverse or set the case for argument.post,at opinion of scalia,see also post,at opinion of alito.but as we have explained,a gvr order conserves the scarce resources of this court,assists the court below by flagging a particular issue that it does not appear to have fully considered,and assists this court by procuring the benefit of the lower court insight before we rule on the merits.lawrence,supra,at.
unlike justice scalia,post,at,we do not believe that a court of appeals would or should respond to our remand order with a summary reissuance of essentially the same opinion,absent the procedural default discussion.to the contrary,in light of our decision in cone,we assume the court will consider,on the merits,whether petitioner allegations,together with the undisputed facts,warrant discovery and an evidentiary hearing.

petitioner marcus wellons was convicted in georgia state court of capital murder and sentenced to death.after exhausting direct appeal and state postconviction review,he filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal court under.wellons claims,among other things,that misconduct on the part of the trial judge,jurors,and court bailiff deprived him of a fair trial.the district court denied relief,and the eleventh circuit affirmed.
today the court grants wellons petition for certiorari,vacates the judgment of the eleventh circuit,and remands gvrs in light of cone bell.the eleventh circuit concluded that wellons claims were procedurally barred because the state postconviction court,noting that the state supreme court had rejected them on direct appeal,held the claims were res judicata.see,and.this was error under cone,see,at slip,at,as respondent recognizes indeed,the eleventh circuit has already recognized the abrogation of the opinion below on this point,see owen secretary for of corrections.but,as justice alito dissent demonstrates,post,the eleventh circuit like the district court also decided that petitioner was not entitled to habeas relief on the merits,at.thus the court gvrs in light of cone even though the issue on which cone throws light does not affect the outcome.
the court has previously asserted a power to gvr whenever there is a reasonable probability that the decision below rests upon a premise that the lower court would reject if given the opportunity for further consideration,and where it appears that such a redetermination may determine the ultimate outcome of the litigation.lawrence chater,per curiam.i have protested even that flabby standard,see,at scalia,dissenting,but today the court outdoes itself.it gvrs where the decision below does not rest upon the objectionable faulty premise,but is independently supported by other grounds so that redetermination of the faulty ground will assuredly not determine the ultimate outcome of the litigation.the power to revise and correct for error,which the court has already turned into a power to void for suspicion,at same internal quotation marks and alteration omitted,has now become the power to send back for a.we have no authority to decree that.if the court thinks that the eleventh circuit merits holding is wrong,then it should summarily reverse or set the case for argument otherwise,the judgment below must stand.the same is true if as the court evidently believes the court of appeals should have required an evidentiary hearing before resolving the merits question.if they erred in that regard their judgment should be reversed rather than remanded in light of cone bell a disposition providing no hint that what we really want them to do as the court believes is to consider an evidentiary hearing.
the systematic degradation of our traditional requirements for a gvr has spawned a series of unusual dispositions,including the gvr so the government can try a less extravagant argument on remand,see department of interior south dakota,scalia,dissenting,the gvr in light of nothing,see youngblood west virginia,same,and the summary remand for more extensive opinion than petitioner requested srmeopr,see webster cooper,slip,at.today the court adds another beast to our growing menagerie the srie,summary remand for inconsequential error or,as the court would have it,the srtaeh,summary remand to think about an evidentiary hearing.
it disrespects the judges of the courts of appeals,who are appointed and confirmed as we are,to vacate and send back their authorized judgments for inconsequential imperfection of opinion as though we were schoolmasters grading their homework.an appropriately response to today summary vacatur would be summary reissuance of the same opinion,minus the discussion of cone.that would also serve the purpose of minimizing the delay of justice that today gvr achieves wellons has already outlived his victim by years he committed his murder in.

decided january,
justice alito,with whom the chief justice joins,dissenting.
the court disposition of this case represents a misuse of our authority to grant,vacate,and remand gvr.the decision of the court of appeals plainly rests on two independent grounds first,that petitioner procedurally defaulted his claim that the judge,bailiff,and jurors had an inappropriate relationship that impaired his right to a fair trial and,second,that petitioner claim failed on the merits.see.while it is true that the first of these grounds is inconsistent with cone bell,slip,at,there is no basis for vacating the decision below unless some recent authority or development provides a basis for reconsideration of the second ground as well.but the per curiam identifies no such authority.instead,the per curiam uses cone as a vehicle for suggesting that the court of appeals should reconsider its decision on the merits of petitioner claim.
in order to defend this disposition,the per curiam refuses to credit the court of appeals explanation of the basis of its decision.the court of appeals twice stated in unequivocal terms that its holding on the merits of petitioner claim was independent of its holding on the question of procedural default.see,at e ven if these claims were properly before us on habeas review,we would not disturb the georgia supreme court conclusion on the merits of these claims at even if we assume that wellons misconduct claims are not procedurally barred,they do not entitle wellons to habeas relief but the per curiam states that the court of appeals consideration of the merits may well have turned on the district court finding of a procedural bar and that we can not be sure that the panel reasoning really was independent of the cone error.ante,at.
even worse,the per curiam unjustifiably suggests that the court of appeals gave at most only perfunctory consideration to petitioner claim that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing and may not have carefully reviewed the relevant facts.ante,at.the majority may not be satisfied with the court of appeals discussion,but the majority has no good reason for suggesting that the lower court did not give the issue careful consideration.
the district court refused petitioner discovery request on the ground that petitioner did not make a sufficient showing to warrant interrogation of the jurors.as the detailed opinion of the district court reveals,the state habeas judge allowed petitioner attorneys to contact all of the jurors and relevant court personnel the attorneys succeeded in contacting all but of the jurors of the jurors who were contacted,as well as the bailiffs and court reporter,were interviewed and the attorneys made a proffer of the information provided by these interviewees there is no suggestion that the attorneys were restricted in the questions that they were permitted to ask the interviewees,and it appears that the jurors who were interviewed spoke freely,even discussing their understanding of the judge instructions on the law and the jury deliberations fed.rule evid.b.interestingly,the proffer does not reflect that the attorneys asked any of the jurors what would appear to be the most critical question,namely,why the strange gifts were given to the judge or the bailiff see app.c to pet.for cert.if any such questions had been asked and answers favorable to petitioner position had been provided,one would expect that information to appear in the proffer.
after examining the proffer made by petitioner attorneys,the district court concluded that this submission did not justify formal discovery.with respect to what the per curiam describes as the unreported ex parte contacts between the jury and the judge,ante,at which apparently consisted of a brief exchange of words that occurred when the judge entered the room in a restaurant where the jurors were dining the district court concluded that nothing that petitioner has presented provides even the slightest indication that anything more than a simple greeting occurred,app.c to
