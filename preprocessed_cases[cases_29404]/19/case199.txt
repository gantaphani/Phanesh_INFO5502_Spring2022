petitioner johnson pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition by a convicted felon.g.the government sought sentencing under the armed career criminal act,which authorizes an enhanced penalty for a person who violates g and who has three previous convictions for a violent felony,e,defined as,inter alia,an offense that has as an element the use of physical force against the person of another,e b i.among the three prior felony convictions the government proffered was johnson florida conviction for simple battery,which ordinarily is a misdemeanor.stat.b,but was a felony conviction for johnson because he had previously been convicted of another battery.stat.under florida law,a battery occurs when a person either a ctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against his will,or i ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.a.nothing in the record permitted the district court to conclude that johnson conviction rested upon the strik ing or i ntentionally caus ing bodily harm elements of the offense.accordingly,his conviction was a predicate conviction for a violent felony under the armed career criminal act only if a ctually and intentionally touch ing another constitutes the use of physical force under e b i.concluding it does,the district court enhanced johnson sentence under e,sentencing him to a term of years and months.the eleventh circuit affirmed.
held the florida felony offense of battery by a ctually and intentionally touch ing another person does not have as an element the use of physical force against the person of another,e b i,and thus does not constitute a violent felony under e.
a in interpreting the phrase physical force in e b i,the court is not bound by the florida supreme court conclusion in state hearns,so,that,under florida statutory equivalent to the armed career criminal act.stat,the offense of battery does not involve the use of physical force or violence against any individual,stat.the meaning of physical force in e b i is a question of federal law,not state law.the court is bound,however,by the florida supreme court interpretation of the elements of the state law offense,including the florida supreme court holding that a element of a ctually and intentionally touching another person is satisfied by any intentional physical contact,no matter how slight.
b because e b i does not define physical force,the court gives the phrase its ordinary meaning.bailey united states.the adjective physical is clear.the noun force,however,has a number of meanings.its ordinary meaning refers to the application of strength,power,and violence in this context,against another person.
c the government suggests that force in e b i definition of violent felony is a legal term of art describing one of the elements of the crime of battery.at common law,that element was satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.although a term of art should be given its established meaning,the court does not ascribe to a statutory term a meaning where that meaning does not fit.here physical force is used in defining not the crime of battery,but rather the statutory category of violent felony.e b i.in that context,physical force means violent force,force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.leocal ashcroft.moreover,it is significant that the meaning the government seeks to impute to the term force derives from the elements of a misdemeanor.nothing in the text of e b i suggests that force in the definition of a violent felony should be regarded as a term of art used to define the contours of a misdemeanor.nor can any negative inference about the amount of force required by e b i be drawn from e b ii and g c ii.
d there is no force to the government prediction that this decision will undermine its ability to enforce g firearm disability against a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence that has as an element the use of physical force,a a ii.the court interprets the phrase physical force only in the context of a statutory definition of violent felony,and does not decide whether the same meaning applies in the context of defining the scope of misdemeanor offenses.similarly misplaced is the government assertion that it will now be more difficult to obtain sentencing enhancements for individuals convicted under generic statutes that cover both violent force and unwanted physical contact,and to remove an alien convicted of a nonviolent battery conviction under the statutory provision for an alien convicted of a crime of domestic violence,a e.see,chambers united states,shepard united states.
e before the district court the government disclaimed any reliance upon the residual clause of the definition of violent felony in e b ii,which covers an offense that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.accordingly,the court declines to remand for consideration whether johnson battery conviction qualifies as a violent felony under that provision.
reversed and remanded.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we decide whether the florida felony offense of battery by a ctually and intentionally touch ing another person.stat.a,has as an element the use of physical force against the person of another,e b i,and thus constitutes a violent felony under the armed career criminal act,e.
curtis johnson pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing ammunition after having been convicted of a felony,in violation of g.the government sought an enhanced penalty under e,which provides that a person who violates g and who has three previous convictions for a violent felony committed on occasions different from one another shall be imprisoned for a minimum of years and a maximum of life.a violent felony is defined as any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that 
i has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or ii is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.e b.
johnson indictment specified five prior felony convictions.the government contended that three of those convictions for aggravated battery and for burglary of a dwelling in october,and for battery in may rendered johnson eligible for sentencing under e.at the sentencing hearing,johnson did not dispute that the two convictions were for violent felon ies,but he objected to counting his battery conviction.that conviction was for simple battery under florida law,which ordinarily is a misdemeanor.stat.b,but is a felony for a defendant who like johnson has been convicted of battery even simple battery before.
under a,a battery occurs when a person either a ctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other,or i ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.because the elements of the offense are disjunctive,the prosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways.state hearns,so.it can prove that the defendant i ntentionally caus ed bodily harm,that he intentionally str uck the victim,or that he merely a ctually and intentionally touche d the victim.
since nothing in the record of johnson battery conviction permitted the district court to conclude that it rested upon anything more than the least of these acts,see shepard united states,plurality opinion,his conviction was a predicate conviction for a violent felony under the armed career criminal act only if a ctually and intentionally touch ing another person constitutes the use of physical force within the meaning of e b i.the district court concluded that it does,and accordingly sentenced johnson under e to a prison term of years and months.
the eleventh circuit affirmed.we granted certiorari.
florida has a statute similar to the armed career criminal act that imposes sentences upon violent career criminal s,stat.d,defined to mean persons who have three convictions for certain felonies,including any forcible felony,d a.f orcible felony is defined to include a list of enumerated felonies including murder,manslaughter,sexual battery,carjacking,aggravated assault,and aggravated battery and also any other felony which involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.in hearns,the florida supreme court held that the felony offense of battery on a law enforcement officer,b which requires the same conduct directed against a law enforcement officer as misdemeanor battery under a was not a forcible felony.see so,at.it said that since a requires proof of only the slightest unwanted physical touch,the use of physical force was not an element of the offense,at.
johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted physical touching constitutes physical force under e b i,we are bound by the florida supreme court conclusion in hearns that it does not constitute physical force.that is not so.the meaning of physical force in e b i is a question of federal law,not state law.and in answering that question we are not bound by a state court interpretation of a similar or even identical state statute.
we are,however,bound by the florida supreme court interpretation of state law,including its determination of the elements of.stat.see johnson fankell.the florida supreme court has held that the element of actually and intentionally touching under florida battery law is satisfied by any intentional physical contact,no matter how slight.hearns,so,at.the most nominal contact,such as a ta p on the shoulder without consent,at,establishes a violation.we apply th is substantive elemen t of the criminal offense,jackson virginia,in determining whether a felony conviction for battery under.stat.meets the definition of violent felony in e b i.
section e b i does not define physical force,and we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning.bailey united states.the adjective physical is clear in meaning but not of much help to our inquiry.it plainly refers to force exerted by and through concrete bodies distinguishing physical force from,for example,intellectual force or emotional force.it is the noun that poses the difficulty force has a number of meanings.for present purposes we can exclude its specialized meaning in the field of physics a cause of the acceleration of mass.webster new international dictionary ed.hereinafter webster second.in more general usage it means s trength or energy active power vigor often an unusual degree of strength or energy,p ower to affect strongly in physical relations,or p ower,violence,compulsion,or constraint exerted upon a person.at.black law dictionary ed.hereinafter black defines force as p ower,violence,or pressure directed against a person or thing.and it defines physical force as f orce consisting in a physical act,esp.a violent act directed against a robbery victim.ibid.all of these definitions suggest a degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest touching.
there is,however,a more specialized legal usage of the word force its use in describing one of the elements of the crime of battery,which consisted of the intentional application of unlawful force against the person of another.see lafave scott,substantive criminal law a,and supp.accord,black.the common law held this element of force to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.see blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england hereinafter blackstone lynch commonwealth,see also lafave scott,supra,a.the question is whether the term force in e b i has the specialized meaning that it bore in the definition of battery.the government asserts that it does.we disagree.
although a term of art should be given its established meaning,united states turley,we do not assume that a statutory word is used as a term of art where that meaning does not fit.ultimately,context determines meaning,jarecki searle,and we do not force definitions into contexts where they plainly do not fit and produce nonsense,gonzales oregon,scalia,dissenting.here we are interpreting the phrase physical force as used in defining not the crime of battery,but rather the statutory category of violent felon ies,e b.in leocal ashcroft,we interpreted the statutory definition of crime of violence in.that provision is very similar to e b i,in that it includes any felony offense which has as an element the use of physical force against the person or property of another,a.we stated 
in construing both parts of,we can not forget that we ultimately are determining the meaning of the term crime of violence.the ordinary meaning of this term,combined with emphasis on the use of physical force against another person or the risk of having to use such force in committing a crime,suggests a category of violent,active crimes at.
just so here.we think it clear that in the context of a statutory definition of violent felony,the phrase physical force means violent force that is,force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.see flores ashcroft,easterbrook.even by itself,the word violent in e b connotes a substantial degree of force.webster second defining violent as m oving,acting,or characterized,by physical force,esp.by extreme and sudden or by unjust or improper force furious severe vehement oxford english dictionary ed.c haracterized by the exertion of great physical force or strength black o f,relating to,or characterized by strong physical force when the adjective violent is attached to the noun felony,its connotation of strong physical force is even clearer.see,at defining violent felony as a crime characterized by extreme physical force,such as murder,forcible rape,and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon see also united states doe,breyer,t he term to be defined,violent felony,calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the possibility of more closely related,active violence 
it is significant,moreover,that the meaning of physical force the government would seek to import into this definition of violent felony is a meaning derived from a misdemeanor.at common law,battery all battery,and not merely battery by the merest touching was a misdemeanor,not a felony.see blackstone see also lafave scott,supra,b,at ali,model penal code,comment.as the dissent points out,post,at opinion of alito,the dividing line between misdemeanors and felonies has shifted over time.but even today a simple battery whether of the or variety generally is punishable as a misdemeanor see,lafave,substantive criminal law b ed.and supp.cal.penal code ann.and west.stat.b.comp,ch,b west.penal code ann.b west supp.it is unlikely that congress would select as a term of art defining violent felony a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor.of course physical force can be given its misdemeanor meaning by artful language,but here the only text that can be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase physical force itself.since,as we have seen,that is as readily indeed,much more readily taken to describe violent force,there is no reason to define violent felony by reference to a nonviolent misdemeanor.
the government argues that we can not construe e b i to reach only offenses that have as an element the use of violent force,because there is no modifier in e b i that specifies the degree of physical force required.as we have discussed,however,the term physical force itself normally connotes force strong enough to constitute power and all the more so when it is contained in a definition of violent felony.nor is there any merit to the dissent contention,post,at,that the term force in e b i can not be read to require violent force,because congress specifically named burglary and extortion as violent felon ies in e b ii notwithstanding that those offenses can be committed without violence.the point would have force so to speak if burglary and extortion were listed in e b i,as felonies that have as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force.in fact,however,they are listed in e b ii,as examples of felonies that presen t a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.the government has not argued that intentional,unwanted touching qualifies under this latter provision.what the dissent argument comes down to,then,is the contention that,since felonies that create a serious risk of physical injury qualify as violent felonies under subparagraph b ii,felonies that involve a mere unwanted touching must involve the use of physical force and qualify as violent felonies under subparagraph b i.that obviously does not follow.
the government also asks us to draw a negative inference from the presence of the bodily injury specification added to the phrase physical force in g c ii.that provision forbids the possession of firearms by a person subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against an intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.ibid.the absence of such language in e b i,the government contends,proves that the merest touch suffices.even as a matter of logic that does not follow.specifying that physical force must rise to the level of bodily injury does not suggest that without the qualification physical force would consist of the merest touch.it might consist,for example,of only that degree of force necessary to inflict pain a slap in the face,for example.moreover,this is not a case where congress has include d particular language in one section of a statute but omit ted it in another section of the same act,russello united states,internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.section g c ii was enacted into law in eight years after enactment of the language in e b i.compare pub,stat,with pub,stat.
the government contends that interpreting e b i to require violent force will undermine its ability to enforce the firearm disability in g for persons who previously have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,which is defined to include certain misdemeanor offenses that have,as an element,the use or attempted use of physical force,a a ii.the prediction is unfounded.we have interpreted the phrase physical force only in the context of a statutory definition of violent felony.we do not decide that the phrase has the same meaning in the context of defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.the issue is not before us,so we do not decide it.
in a similar vein,the government asserts that our interpretation will make it more difficult to remove,pursuant to a e,an alien convicted of a crime of domestic violence.that phrase is defined to mean any crime of violence as defined in committed by certain persons,including spouses,former spouses,and parents.a e i.the government contends it will be harder to obtain removal based upon battery convictions that,like those in florida,do not require the use of violent physical force.the dissent likewise anticipates that in the states it has identified,post,at,and,as having generic statutes that cover both violent force and unwanted physical contact,our decision will render convictions under those statutes outside the scope of the armed career criminal act,post,at.
this exaggerates the practical effect of our decision.when the law under which the defendant has been convicted contains statutory phrases that cover several different generic crimes,some of which require violent force and some of which do not,the modified categorical approach that we have approved,nijhawan holder,slip,at,permits a court to determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by consulting the trial record including charging documents,plea agreements,transcripts of plea colloquies,findings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial,and jury instructions and verdict forms.see chambers united states,slip,at shepard,at plurality opinion taylor united states.indeed,the government has in the past obtained convictions under the armed career criminal act in precisely this manner.see,united states simms,maryland battery united states,fed.appx,florida battery,cert.denied,united states,fed.appx,same.
it may well be true,as the government contends,that in many cases state and local records from battery convictions will be incomplete.but absence of records will often frustrate application of the modified categorical approach not just to battery but to many other crimes as well.see,shepard,supra,at burglary.it is implausible that avoiding that consequence with respect to the single crime of battery,under the single statute that is the armed career criminal act,caused congress to import a term of art that is a comical misfit with the defined term violent felony.
the government asks us to remand to the eleventh circuit for its consideration of whether johnson battery conviction is a violent felony within the meaning of the residual clause in e b ii.we decline to do so.the government did not keep this option alive because it disclaimed at sentencing any reliance upon the residual clause.app.moreover,the parties briefed the e b ii issue to the eleventh circuit,which nonetheless reasoned that if johnson conviction under.stat.satisfied e b i,then it was a predicate violent felony under e but if not,then not.at.
we reverse the judgment of the eleventh circuit,set aside johnson sentence,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

the armed career criminal act acca defines a violent felony to mean,among other things,any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.e b i emphasis added.the classic definition of the crime of battery is the intentional application of unlawful force against the person of another.ante,at citing lafave scott,substantive criminal law,and supp.black law dictionary ed.thus,the crime of battery,as traditionally defined,falls squarely within the plain language of acca.because i believe that acca was meant to incorporate this traditional definition,i would affirm the decision of the court of appeals.
the court starts out in the right direction by noting that the critical statutory language the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,e b i may mean either a the use of violent force or b the use of force that is sufficient to satisfy the traditional definition of a battery.see ante,at.the court veers off course,however,by concluding that the statutory language reaches only violent force.
the term force,as the court correctly notes,had a meaning at common law that included even the slightest offensive touching.ante,at.see also respublica de longchamps,dall,phila.t hough no great bodily pain is suffered by a blow on the palm of the hand,or the skirt of the coat,yet these are clearly within the legal d e finition of assault and battery blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england,hereinafter blackstone.this approach recognized that an offensive but nonviolent touching for example,unwanted sexual contact may be even more injurious than the use of force that is sufficient to inflict physical pain or injury for example,a sharp slap in the face.
when congress selects statutory language with a meaning,we generally presume that congress intended to adopt that meaning.see,united states turley,we recognize that where a federal criminal statute uses a term of established meaning without otherwise defining it,the general practice is to give that term its meaning morissette united states,united states carll.and here,i see nothing to suggest that congress meant the phrase use of physical force in acca to depart from that phrase meaning at common law.
on the contrary,other standard canons of statutory interpretation point to the same conclusion.w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in
