wayne vargas de jes√∫s vargas was convicted on two counts charging violations of a and possession with intent to distribute illegal drugs within one thousand feet of a school.he was also convicted of one count of conspiracy to violate those provisions.see.on appeal,vargas challenges the substantive convictions based on lack of jurisdiction under the federal juvenile delinquency act fjda,on the ground that he was a minor when the offenses were committed.because the district court lacked jurisdiction over the substantive drug charges,we vacate vargas convictions with respect to those counts.with respect to the conspiracy count,vargas argues that the district court committed plain error by failing to instruct the jury that it could only find him guilty if he ratified and participated in the conspiracy after he turned.we affirm the conviction as to the conspiracy count because there was sufficient evidence of postmajority conduct to convict,and it was not plain error for the district court to fail to give the instruction.
the fjda provides 
a juvenile alleged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency shall not be proceeded against in any court of the united states unless the attorney general,after investigation,certifies to the appropriate district court of the united states that the offense charged is an offense described in section of the controlled substances act and that there is a substantial federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of federal jurisdiction.
if the attorney general does not so certify,such juvenile shall be surrendered to the appropriate legal authorities of such state.
emphasis added.the statute defines a juvenile as a person who has not attained his eighteenth birthday,or for the purpose of proceedings and disposition under this chapter for an alleged act of juvenile delinquency,a person who has not attained his birthday,and juvenile delinquency as the violation of a law of the united states committed by a person prior to his eighteenth birthday which would have been a crime if committed by an adult.id.in other words,the statute provides that unless the attorney general certifies to the district court that the case satisfies one of certain enumerated conditions,the district court may not proceed against an individual under the age of for acts committed before reaching the age of see united states welch,cir t he fjda does not apply to a defendant who is not a juvenile and who has not committed an act of juvenile delinquency.quoting united states doerr,cir see also united states thomas,a person who has reached can be criminally indicted for the acts committed under eighteen because it is assumed he can no longer benefit from fjda protections.it is undisputed that in this case,the government did not present the district court with such a certification,and that the proceedings commenced before the defendant reached the age of.
the issues in this case arise out of alleged acts committed both before and after the defendant reached the age of.it is undisputed that vargas was born on july,and reached years of age on july.on may,a grand jury returned a seven count indictment charging vargas and numerous codefendants with various narcotics offenses.six of those counts are pertinent here.count charged vargas with conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute in excess of one kilogram of heroin,fifty grams of cocaine base,five kilograms of cocaine,one hundred kilograms of marijuana within one thousand feet of a public or private school,in violation of a,and.we refer to this count as the drug conspiracy count.counts through charged him with the substantive offenses of aiding and abetting in the possession of heroin,cocaine base,cocaine,and marijuana,respectively,within one thousand feet of a school with intent to distribute,in violation of a and,and.we refer to these as the substantive drug counts.count charged vargas with conspiracy to possess firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense in violation of c a.we refer to this as the firearms conspiracy count.according to the indictment,each of the charges against vargas arose out of alleged activities b eginning on a date unknown,but no later than in or about the year,and continuing up to and until the return of the instant indictment may.
at trial,the government presented testimony regarding the defendant activities from local police officers,cooperating drug traffickers,and a paid confidential informant.much of this testimony related to conduct prior to vargas eighteenth birthday.the defendant did not request,and the district court did not issue,an instruction to the jury regarding the findings of postmajority conduct necessary to convict vargas.the jury found vargas guilty of substantive drug counts and,and the drug conspiracy count the jury acquitted on substantive drug counts three and five,and the firearms conspiracy count.although the trial testimony made no reference to the defendant age,his date of birth and age were noted in the presentence report.the district court sentenced vargas to months imprisonment as to each count for which he was convicted,to be served concurrently,and ten years of supervised release.vargas timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
on appeal,vargas argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the substantive drug counts as to which he was convicted.see.we review the jurisdictional issue de novo.miller nichols,cir.although vargas failed to raise this issue with the district court,an objection to subject matter jurisdiction is not waivable and may be raised for the first time on appeal,cooperativa de seguros de vida de,cir see.b b providing that lack of jurisdiction may be noticed by court at any time united states disanto,cir.
vargas argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the government failed to provide the required certification even though he was less than years old when he committed the substantive drug offenses,and still under when indicted.the government concedes that the age of a defendant is jurisdictional under the statute.if the defendant had committed the offense prior to his birthday and he did not continue committing the offense beyond his eighteenth birthday,that conviction would have to be reversed.that is the position of the united states.
on its face,the language of the statute providing that a juvenile shall not be proceeded against in any court of the united states appears jurisdictional.such mandatory language is generally held to be jurisdictional.see lexecon milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach,d t he mandatory shall normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion.california grace brethren church,d statute providing that district courts shall not enjoin,suspend or restrain the collection of any tax under state law divests the district court of jurisdiction mohasco silver,d holding that action was jurisdictionally barred for failure to comply with statutory provision that such charge shall be filed within specified time limits.
other courts of appeals have uniformly held that the certification requirement of is a prerequisite to a district court subject matter jurisdiction.see united states sealed juvenile,cir the need certification under is a jurisdictional requirement in re sealed case,certification must be a jurisdictional requirement that go es to the jurisdiction of the court united states wong,cir p roper certification confers jurisdiction upon the district court united states chambers,cir t he certification requirement is a prerequisite to the district court jurisdiction in cases where the government proceeds against juveniles accused of performing acts which would be federal crimes if committed by adults.united states juvenile male,cir to establish jurisdiction for such an adjudication,the juvenile delinquency procedures require the government to file a special certification regarding the juvenile before it can proceed against that juvenile.
although not directly deciding the question,this court has recognized as well that the certification requirement of is jurisdictional.see united states female juvenile,cir noting that provides that a district court has jurisdiction over a juvenile if the certification requirement is met united states smith,cir stating that provides that a district court has jurisdiction over a juvenile if the certification requirement is satisfied,and that o nce federal jurisdiction has attached,juvenile delinquency proceedings ensue unless the court transfers the juvenile for prosecution as an adult.we agree that the certification requirement is jurisdictional,and that absent a certification,a conviction must be set aside,even absent a timely objection,if the record establishes that a defendant was under the age of when the offense was committed and under the age of when criminal proceedings were commenced.
the remaining question is whether the evidence here on the two substantive drug counts was limited to acts occurring before the defendant reached the age of.vargas argues that it was.the government failed to defend the convictions on these two counts in its brief,but at oral argument urged for the first time that there was sufficient postmajority evidence to convict.while we would be justified in treating the failure to brief the issue as a waiver,we choose to address the issue on the merits.
the government admits that vargas was born on july,and that he reached majority on july.it also acknowledges that much of the evidence presented against vargas at trial on the substantive drug counts involved activities that occurred when he was under the age of.at oral argument,the government accurately asserted that the indictment did not provide a specific date for the substantive drug offense counts instead,as with the conspiracy count,the indictment stated that the alleged crimes b eg an on a date unknown,but no later than in or about the year,and continu ed up to and until the return of the instant indictment,past the date of vargas majority.but while the indictment may have charged postmajority conduct,the record is clear that the only evidence to support vargas convictions on the substantive drug offenses related to the period before he reached age.
the only evidence that potentially supports the substantive drug offense convictions is the testimony of paid confidential informant ulises mart√≠nez camacho mart√≠nez.mart√≠nez role as an informant was to insert himself within a local drug organization and purchase narcotics.mart√≠nez first met vargas around april.mart√≠nez described occasions in which he purchased illegal drugs from vargas.first,on april,mart√≠nez called vargas to purchase two packages of crack cocaine for.mart√≠nez made the buy,but vargas was not present at the actual exchange.on may,mart√≠nez arranged with vargas to buy an eighth of a kilogram of crack for or.again,vargas was not present at the exchange,and in this instance mart√≠nez was swindled with a sweet confection made of sugar and coconut known as dulce de coco,rather than drugs.during the same conversation,however,vargas and mart√≠nez also discussed the sale of ten kilograms of cocaine for per kilogram.
mart√≠nez thus testified to deals involving only crack cocaine base and cocaine the same drugs for which vargas was found guilty on the substantive charges.however,that testimony related to events which occurred before vargas reached the age of.because the government failed to provide the necessary certification under the fjda,vargas convictions on the substantive drug offenses must be vacated for lack of jurisdiction.see,united states male juvenile,cir vacating adjudication of juvenile delinquency for lack of jurisdiction due to failure to provide proper fjda certification united states doe,cir same.
as to the conspiracy charge,we hold that the district court had jurisdiction.here,the indictment charged vargas with the drug conspiracy b eginning on a date unknown,but no later than in or about the year,and continuing up to and until the return of the instant indictment namely,may.although vargas was under at the beginning of this charged period,he had reached the age of majority by the end of the period.in united states welch,cir,we held that such an indictment was not defective simply because the period includes premajority conduct.
this court has also held that the jury may properly hear evidence regarding a defendant premajority conduct to establish the existence of a conspiracy.in welch,this court considered whether evidence of premajority conduct should be withheld from the jury,and rejected that argument 
we think the better view is that once the government ha s established that certain acts of the offense occurred after the defendant eighteenth birthday,the entire case may be tried in accordance with the adult rules of procedure and evidence.we therefore hold that a criminal defendant conduct is admissible on the same bases as other evidence,and does not alone compel severance of a youthful defendant trial.
id.at quoting united states cruz,cir.however,where a case involves conduct both before and after the age of,there can be no conviction unless the jury found that appellant in some manner ratified his participation in the conspiracy after attaining majority.id.
there was ample evidence here that the defendant continued his participation in the conspiracy after he reached the age of majority.three officers from the puerto rico police department testified that they continued to observe vargas at the local drug point after he had turned.in addition,ricardo madera b√°ez madera,a member of a rival drug gang,testified that vargas attended a meeting between rival drug gangs in november,four months after vargas eighteenth birthday,where vargas declared that he was the owner of cocaine for his group.therefore,it was proper for the jury to consider vargas premajority conduct as well in finding him guilty of the drug conspiracy.
the defendant does not contend here that the evidence is insufficient to convict on the drug conspiracy count under the governing standard,with one exception.the defendant argues that we must assume that the jury did not credit the testimony of madera because the jury acquitted vargas on count of the indictment.that count charged a conspiracy to possess firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense.at trial,the only evidence of vargas postmajority conduct relating to firearms was the testimony by madera that vargas showed off his caliber handgun at the november meeting.vargas argues that his acquittal on the firearms conspiracy charge means that the jury discredited madera testimony.he therefore contends that madera testimony thus can not support a conviction on the drug conspiracy charge,and without that testimony there is insufficient evidence to convict.
even if we were to assume that madera testimony was essential to the conviction on the drug conspiracy count and that the verdicts were inconsistent defendant argument is meritless.in united states powell,d,the supreme court held that an acquittal on one charge in a criminal case does not create collateral estoppel as to other charges.that decision reaffirmed the rule established in dunn united states,that a criminal defendant convicted by a jury on one count can not attack that conviction because it was inconsistent with the jury verdict of acquittal on another count.powell,at.in powell,a jury acquitted the defendant of drug conspiracy and possession counts,but found the defendant guilty of compound offenses involving the use of a telephone in committing and in causing and facilitating the alleged conspiracy and possession.id.at.the court of appeals reversed the convictions,holding that a defendant can not be found guilty of facilitating a felony for which he has been acquitted.id.at.the supreme court reversed.because inconsistent verdicts may be the result of juror mistake or lenity,and because the government can not appeal an acquittal,the court held that the best course to take is simply to insulate jury verdicts from review on this ground.see id.at.under these circumstances,the potential inconsistency in the verdicts is not a ground for setting aside the drug conspiracy conviction.
the defendant also contends that the district court should have cha
