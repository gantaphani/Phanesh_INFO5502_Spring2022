a jury convicted luz vega of criminal counts stemming from her participation in a medicare fraud scheme.vega now appeals her convictions from the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,alleging several procedural defects.additionally,although vega does not challenge her medicare fraud convictions,she argues the government did not present sufficient evidence to convict her of identity theft and money laundering.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
vega was the director of preferred medical equipment preferred,a supplier of durable medical equipment dme located in arecibo.dme are items used by individuals with certain medical conditions outside of a hospital on regular basis,such as wheelchairs,walkers,orthotics,and electric hospital beds.typically,a patient obtains dme through a dme supplier upon the presentation of a physician order.if the patient is a medicare beneficiary,the dme supplier can submit a claim to medicare for partial reimbursement 
dme suppliers seeking reimbursement from medicare must submit documentation with their claim,including proof that the dme ordered was medically necessary and prescribed by a physician.due to the volume of claims received,medicare does not verify every claim it receives beyond checking for paperwork showing that the dme recipient was a medicare beneficiary and the dme was medically necessary.
preferred defrauded medicare by submitting claims for dme orders that were not medically necessary.rather than waiting for beneficiaries to come with physician orders to fulfill,equipment coordinators at preferred would seek out medicare beneficiaries and persuade them to receive dme,often under the pretense that the equipment was free.the absence of documentation showing the dme ordered was medically necessary would normally prevent medicare reimbursement.preferred equipment coordinators circumvented this rule by paying a doctor,francisco garrastegui bigas garrastegui,to provide the required documentation.garrastegui would either create documentation for dme already ordered,or accompany the equipment coordinators on patient visits and prescribe dme on the spot.
the government jointly indicted vega garrastegui preferred secretary,maría elisa pérez and two of preferred equipment coordinators,lissette acevedo rodríguez acevedo and luisa nieves,alleging that preferred submitted false claims totaling to medicare between april and march.for her role in this scheme,the government charged vega with one count of conspiracy to commit medicare fraud in violation of and and counts of aiding and abetting the commission of health care fraud in violation of and 
vega also faced several other criminal charges in connection with her participation in preferred fraud scheme.for payments made to preferred equipment coordinators and garrastegui,vega was charged with counts of aiding and abetting the solicitation and receipt of kickbacks in relation to the medicare program,in violation of and b b.vega paid commissions to preferred equipment coordinators based on the type and quantity of dme they sold.additionally,vega paid garrastegui to visit preferred office in late to create medical documentation for dme that preferred had sold without physician orders 
the government also charged vega with three counts of aiding and abetting aggravated identify theft in violation of a and.these aggravated identity theft charges were in relation to preferred obtaining the identification information of three medicare quiles medina quiles,josé figueroa class figueroa,and efraín toro morales toro and continuing to bill medicare on their behalf even after they told preferred they did not want the equipment.
finally,vega was charged with two counts of transacting in criminally derived property of a value greater than,money laundering because she used funds from preferred bank account to pay for personal expenses an auto loan and the purchase of an official check.
garrastegui and acevedo both pled guilty and testified against vega at trial.the jury found vega guilty of all counts.the district court sentenced vega to two years and one day of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.this timely appeal followed.
ii.napue claims 
vega first argues that the government violated napue illinois,d,and her right to due process by allowing two of its witnesses to provide false testimony to the jury.napue prohibits prosecutors from knowingly presenting false evidence,including false testimony,to the jury.id.at see also united states flores rivera,cir.this prohibition applies even if the government does not solicit the false testimony and merely fails to correct it.napue,at.
according to vega,two of preferred equipment coordinators who testified against her at trial,acevedo and marcos sárraga montañez sárraga,underrepresented the benefits they received from their plea agreements this in turn,vega argues,prevented the jury from fully assessing their bias and credibility.we reject vega napue claims for two reasons.
first,we note that vega did not object to acevedo or sárraga testimony,even though the government entered their plea agreements into evidence at trial and,as discussed in further detail below,the plea agreements contained all of the information vega needed to impeach their testimony.if a defendant has actual knowledge of the false testimony and fails to correct it,absent unusual circumstances,we assume the defendant did so for strategic reasons and consider the napue claim waived.united states mangual garcía,cir.given the availability of the plea agreements,we do not think vega has reason to complain about either witness testimony on appeal.
second,even if vega claims are reviewable,they are meritless.
acevedo testimony 
vega contests a portion of acevedo testimony elicited on.following acevedo statement that she was repentant,vega asked acevedo if she ha d to return the money that she received from her crimes acevedo,who had yet to be sentenced,stated that she did not know.the district court then told the jury that acevedo plea agreement,whatever its terms,was not binding and that the court c ould order full restitution and it was up to the court,the amount of restitution.
vega argues that the prosecutors and district court with its comment left the jury with an impression that acevedo did not receive a benefit from the government by pleading guilty because restitution was still up to the district court discretion.this impression is false,according to vega,because discretionary restitution is a benefit.
vega premises her argument on the mandatory victim restitution act mvra,which requires defendants to pay restitution in fraud cases.see id.c ii united states cheal,cir.vega argues that acevedo plea agreements must have exempted her from the mvra if the prosecutors and district court viewed her restitution as a matter of court discretion.
the problem with vega argument is that acevedo plea agreements did not exempt her from the mvra in fact,her plea agreements explicitly state that the mvra applied.the benefit vega argues acevedo lied about receiving simply does not exist 
we also find no falsity in acevedo statement that she did not know the amount of restitution she would have to pay.restitution has a precise legal definition.it is not unreasonable that acevedo would not know this definition and thus how the district court would calculate restitution or how much it would order her to pay.finally,we fail to see how any problems with acevedo testimony could not have been impeached by vega when vega had a copy of acevedo plea agreement and the plea agreement stated the terms of acevedo restitution and monetary penalties.based on this review of the record,we conclude that acevedo testimony was not false and therefore did not violate napue.
sárraga testimony 
our review of the record also leads us to conclude that sárraga testimony did not violate napue.sárraga contested testimony came during his redirect examination when the prosecution attempted to bolster his credibility following vega attacks on 
prosecutor and you have already been sentenced is that correct 
sárraga yes.
prosecutor so what do you have to lose or win by coming here to testify 
sárraga from the very first time that i had contact with an agent,i decided that i was going to tell the truth and made a commitment to tell the truth and help them out.
prosecutor are you getting anything in return or do you fear something will happen to you by coming here and testifying today 
sárraga no.
vega argues that sárraga statement that he was not receiving anything in return for his testimony was false because he was still on probation and was required to pay restitution and thus had an incentive to please the government with his testimony.
like acevedo testimony,we do not see any obvious falsity in sárraga statement.sárraga had already been sentenced such that the main source of his bias wanting to receive a favorable recommended sentence from the prosecution was mitigated.the prosecution ability to influence sárraga probation and restitution seems attenuated at best.moreover,even if sárraga statement that he was receiving nothing in return for his testimony was misleading,vega could easily his in fact did so.see united states clark,d,stating conflicting testimony between witnesses did not create napue claim because even if a witness testimony contains falsehoods,and jury instructions regarding witness credibility will normally purge the taint of false testimony quoting united states joyner,cir.thus,even if sárraga testimony could be construed as misleading,we do not find any reasonable likelihood that the testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury mangual garcía,at quoting giglio united states,d.as a result,we proceed to vega evidentiary claims.
iii.evidentiary issues 
vega next argues that the government improperly introduced expert testimony without qualifying the witnesses as experts.vega claim relates to the testimony of two government witnesses jean stone stone and special agent michael ayala ayala.we are dubious about the propriety of portions of their testimony,but ultimately find vega alleged errors harmless given her theory of defense.
stone held a management position with the united states department of health and human services,where she helped oversee medicare fraud prevention activities in new york,new jersey,puerto rico,and the virgin islands.stone did not assist with the investigation of vega or preferred rather,the government gave stone a copy of the indictment against vega and asked stone to testify about the medicare program generally.during the course of her testimony,stone described the structure of the medicare program how dme was prescribed and could be obtained by patients how dme suppliers received reimbursement and how preferred medicare reimbursement claims showed conflicting dme prescriptions 
on appeal,vega contests the portion of stone testimony in which she described the statute.stone testified that a dme supplier could not pay an equipment coordinator commissions because the statute made it illegal to offer or receive anything of value for referrals of medicare or medicaid patient sic to receive medicare service or equipment.
vega contests a similar statement made by ayala,a secret service agent who executed a search warrant of preferred office in april.at trial,ayala testified he found a chart during the search that listed different dme,the price preferred paid for dme,the amount medicare reimbursed for that dme,and a column called payment.ayala testified that he believed that the chart showed preferred paid its equipment coordinators based on the equipment they sold these payments were kickbacks and kickbacks were prohibited by medicare law.
vega argues that the government needed to qualify stone and ayala as expert witnesses pursuant to federal rule of evidence in order for them to testify about whether preferred paid its equipment coordinators commissions and whether such commissions were prohibited by b b federal rule of evidence limits opinion testimony by lay witnesses to opinions that are not based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge within the scope of rule.c.vega argues stone and ayala testimony was based on technical or specialized knowledge.the government counters it was not.
in support of its view,the government notes we have allowed police officers to offer opinions based on the particularized knowledge the officers had by virtue of their position s without being qualified as experts.united states ayala pizarro,cir quoting,advisory committee note on amendment.the government argues that stone and ayala gained familiarity with the statute through their jobs and thus their testimony fit within the ambit of particularized knowledge gained by virtue of their positions.
the government reads too much into our precedent.we acknowledge that we have previously stated that rule is meant to admit testimony based on the lay expertise a witness personally acquires through experience,often on the job.united states maher,cir.we have not stated,however,that all knowledge is nontechnical or nonspecialized.rather,we have stated that lay experiential expertise refers to those processes that are well founded on personal knowledge and susceptible to.ayala pizarro,at quoting united states vega figueroa,cir.such lay expertise is the product of reasoning processes familiar to the average person in everyday life.united states garcía,cir.for example,a police officer noticing patterns of behavior across criminal operations uses straightforward logic to conclude a defendant behavior fits within that pattern and thus,does not need to be qualified as an expert.see united states santiago,cir holding that officer could testify about meaning of code words used during drug transactions based on hearing same language in other drug investigation as lay witness ayala pizarro,at finding officer could testify as lay witness that defendant was at drug point based on observation that location was heavily guarded because no specialized expertise was required for officer to reach the conclusion that places which sell drugs are often protected by people with weapons.
the testimony in this case helps illustrate this distinction between experiential knowledge that relies on reasoning processes familiar to the average person and more specialized expertise.on the one hand,ayala testimony about his interpretation of the chart he found at preferred could be properly admitted as lay testimony.a jury could follow the reasoning process ayala used and understand why he interpreted a chart listing medical equipment and containing a column reading payment as evidence that preferred equipment coordinators were paid based on the equipment they sold.such testimony relying upon logic and pattern recognition falls within rule parameters for lay testimony.
in contrast,we find that stone testimony and ayala final conclusion that preferred commissions violated medicare law fell outside the boundaries of lay expertise.their opinions were not based on the product of applying familiar reasoning processes to their job experience rather,they could form their opinions only by understanding technical medicare laws and regulations.contrary to the government arguments,the fact that stone and ayala had knowledge of medicare law through their occupations does not make it personal knowledge qualifying as lay expertise under rule.as stated above,our use of the term personal knowledge refers,generally,to the product of a witness process of observing patterns and drawing logical conclusions.an understanding of what medicare law allows and forbids can not be developed through this process.when condemning commission payments as illegal kickbacks,stone and ayala were not relaying their personal observations for the jury to assess rather,they were lending the jury their knowledge of medicare law to provide definitive commentary on the matter.other circuits have reached similar conclusions concerning witnesses testimony about best practices and legal regulations in fraud cases.united states white,cir finding medicare auditors could not testify about meaning of certain medicare terms when testifying as lay witnesses united states riddle,cir finding bank auditor needed to be qualified as expert in order to testify that defendant conduct fell outside of sound banking practices because witness functioned not as a witness relaying his own observations so much as a knowledgeable bank examiner who could provide the jury with an overview of banking regulations and practices and who could authoritatively condemn the defendant actions.we thus conclude it was error to admit stone and ayala testimony that the payment of commissions to equipment coordinators violated medicare law without qualifying them as expert witnesses.
nonetheless,we find any error in the admission of this testimony harmless,meaning that we find it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.united states amador huggins,cir quoting united states varoudakis,cir.vega theory of defense at trial was that she was not aware of the fraud or commission payments occurring at preferred.vega closing argument focused on developing the theory that acevedo,who had participated in a separate medicare fraud scheme prior to preferred,was the ringleader of the entire scheme.vega did not contest at trial that preferred paid commissions to its equipment coordinators or that such actions were illegal.instead,the crux of her argument was that acevedo made the payments herself or had pérez whom acevedo knew prior to working at preferred prepare checks for vega,who then signed the checks without knowing their purpose.given vega trial strategy,we think it is highly probable that stone and ayala statements that commission payments violated b b did not contribute to the verdict.the issue that vega posed to the jury was whether it believed vega was knowingly involved with preferred commissions,not whether preferred scheme violated the law.finding no reversible error,we move to another of vega claims.
iv.jury instructions 
vega next argues that the district court jury instructions regarding charges for aiding and abetting the receipt of kickbacks were incomplete.we reject these claims as well.
a.the anti kickback instruction 
the government charged vega with violating the statute pursuant to b b.that statute makes it a crime to 
knowingly and willfully solicit or receive any remuneration including any kickback,bribe,or rebate directly or indirectly,overtly or covertly,in cash or in kind in return for purchasing,leasing,ordering,or arranging for or recommending purchasing,leasing,or ordering any good,facility,service,or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program 
b b.the district court instructed the jury that b b makes it a crime to ask for or receive or pay or offer to pay any remuneration in connection with referring patients or arranging for which sic payments may be made under the federal healthcare program.it went on to state that in order to convict vega 
t he government must prove each of the following beyond a reasonable doubt 
one,referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of an item or service that could be paid for,in whole or in part,by a federal healthcare program.or,two,purchasing,leasing,ordering,or arranging for or recommending purchasing,leasing,or ordering any good,facility,service,or item that could be paid for,in whole or in part,by a federal healthcare program.and,third,that vega did so knowingly and willfully.
vega argues for the first time on appeal that these instructions were incomplete because they did not state that the jury needed to find that vega aided or abetted in the solicit ation or recei pt of any remuneration and did not define remuneration.when a defendant makes no objection to a jury instruction at trial,this court reviews the instruction for plain error.united states meadows,cir.in order to establish plain error,a criminal defendant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states gonzález vélez,cir quoting united states duarte,cir.t he plain error hurdle nowhere looms larger than in the context of alleged instructional errors.united states paniagua ramos,cir.
the district court instructions in this case do not clear this hurdle.while the district court instruction may not have been letter perfect,we think that,read against the backdrop of the charge as a whole,the district court instruction was sufficient.id.at.the district court mentioned that vega needed to aid or abet in the receipt of remunerations before describing the elements the government needed to prove.we think that this was sufficient for the jury to understand that the charge also required evidence of a remuneration and,thus,that absent a contemporaneous objection,it did not constitute plain error.
we also think the backdrop of the charge as a whole did not necessitate a definition of the term remuneration.the government charges were not based on a novel conception of the word remuneration.they were in reference to preferred paying garrastegui and its equipment coordinators according to the amount of dme they prescribed and ordered.the term remuneration referred to these payments.given this straightforward use of the term,we do not think it was plain error for the district court to leave it undefined.
safe harbor instruction 
vega has one preserved jury instruction claim.while discussing the jury instructions with the district court,vega requested that the court instruct the jury about the safe harbor provisions promulgated by the department of health and human services.the district court denied this request.when a criminal defendant seasonably requests an instruction on a particular theory of the case and the trial court flatly refuses to submit that theory to the jury,our review is plenary.united states ramos paulino,cir.
the department of health and human services has promulgated regulations stating that certain payments are not remunerations in violation of b b.vega claims she should have been allowed to argue to the jury that preferred payments to its equipment coordinators fit within the safe harbor described in d.this regulation allows principals,such as dme suppliers,to pay agents,such as equipment coordinators,for their services if several provisions are met,including that the payment agreement is in writing,the contractual relationship is for more than one year,and the agent payment is at a set salary.id.d.
t o warrant a jury instruction on a specific theory of defense,the evidence adduced at trial,taken in the light most flattering to the accused,must plausibly support the theory.ramos paulino,at emphasis in original.the burden is on the defendant,as the proponent of the theory,to identify evidence adduced during the trial that suffices to satisfy this standard.id.at.
vega has not pointed us to any evidence showing that the safe harbor provisions could have plausibly applied to her case.simply put,vega did not even argue that preferred met the basic requirement that its payment agreements with its equipment coordinators were in writing let alone that these agreements were for a period longer than one year and had a set salary.on this final point,vega did not argue to the jury that preferred paid its equipment coordinators salaries.as discussed in the previous section,vega theory of defense was that she had no knowledge of the commissions.given this trial record,we find no error with the district court denial of vega request for a safe harbor instruction.
identity theft 
vega also raises two sufficiency challenges on appeal.the first challenge regards her convictions for identity theft for using the personal information of medicare beneficiaries figueroa,quiles,and toro to order equipment and submit claims to medicare without their permission.a person commits aggravated identity theft when that person knowingly transfers,possesses,or uses,without lawful authority,a means of identification of another person during and in relation to any felony violation enumerated in subsection c,which includes any fraud crime enumerated in chapter of the.a,c.
vega contests this final fraud element.she notes that,as charged in the indictment,she used the beneficiaries identities some time prior to december the timing,vega argues,is significant because in that month she according to garrastegui testimony asked garrastegui to visit preferred office and fill out medical documentation that was missing from preferred medical claim files vega acknowledges that a reasonable jury could conclude she knew of preferred fraud based on this testimony,but argues this was the only evidence proffered sufficient to prove her guilt.if true,tying these threads together would mean that vega did not know preferred claims were fraudulent prior to december and thus,could not have used the beneficiaries personal information in connection with fraud as required by the identity theft statute.
we,however,reject vega premise that garrastegui visit to preferred was the only evidence proving her knowledge of preferred fraud.when reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim,we must take the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution.united states rosado pérez,cir.if a reasonable jury could find the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all elements of the charged offense,we must affirm the conviction.id 
a reasonable jury could conclude that vega knew of the fraud occurring at preferred prior to garrastegui visit.the government presented several strands of circumstantial evidence through which a reasonable jury could infer knowledge,and a jury is entitled to rely on plausible inferences.united states matthews,cir.
first,a reasonable jury could infer that vega knew the claims preferred submitted on behalf of figueroa,quiles,and toro were fraudulent at the time of submission or soon thereafter.each of the beneficiaries or a spouse or a relative testified that he or she told preferred the beneficiaries did not want the dme,one of whom stated she spoke with vega directly moreover,multiple witnesses testified that vega had a large degree of control over preferred operations.vega told an fbi agent investigating her that nothing at preferred was done without her consent.additionally,as described by acevedo,the dme orders and medicare claims did not go exclusively through the equipment coordinators.rather,once an equipment coordinator obtained a patient information,either vega or her secretary would verify that the patient was a medicare beneficiary.given vega role at preferred,a jury could rationally find that vega must have known that the beneficiaries complained to preferred they did not want dme delivered to their houses and therefore any claims filed after their complaints were fraudulent.
second,the testimony of preferred equipment coordinators suggested that vega not only knew of the fraud,but actively played a role in directing it.acevedo testified that at vega instruction,preferred did not fulfill dme orders that came from individuals who were not medicare beneficiaries or that did not contain a motorized wheelchair a item.a reasonable jury could infer that vega was interested in fulfilling orders only from medicare beneficiaries because medicare honor system made it easy to defraud.similarly,vega insistence on orders containing a motorized wheelchair creates a strong inference that she did not care about whether the dme orders fulfilled served a legitimate medical purpose.vega indifference towards the medical legitimacy of preferred orders is further bolstered by acevedo testifying that she told vega when she started working at preferred,march that garrastegui would prescribe dme for patients he did not see.sárraga also testified that he knew vega was aware of this fact.the fact that vega allowed equipment coordinators to submit claims with garrastegui as the prescribing doctor also supports an inference that she condoned preferred fraud.
we also note that a reasonable jury could view preferred commission payments to the equipment coordinators which vega set and paid,taken with this record,as further evidence that vega had a role in directing the fraud.standing alone,this would not be sufficient to prove vega knew of the fraud,but it is further evidence that vega was motivated to submit as many claims as possible to medicare,regardless of their legitimacy.
all of this evidence combined convinces us that a reasonable jury could conclude vega had knowledge of preferred fraud beyond a reasonable doubt.we therefore reject vega sufficiency challenge.
vi.money laundering 
in addition,vega contests the sufficiency of the government evidence proving her involvement with money laundering.in order to commit money laundering,a defendant must engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than that is in or affects interstate or foreign commerce.a,f.the government charged vega with money laundering based on her using money in preferred bank account to make two transactions to pay off an automobile loan in late december and to purchase an official check in the amount of in january.vega contests the sufficiency of the government evidence regarding several elements of this crime.
first,vega argues that the government did not present sufficient evidence proving that she knew the property she transacted in,the money she used to pay her loan and purchase a certified criminally derived.this argument hinges on the point we rejected in considering her identity theft the government did not provide sufficient evidence to prove she knew of the theft at preferred prior to december.we also note that vega money laundering charges correspond to transactions that occurred after the date she concedes the government proved she knew of the fraud late december and.
second,vega argues that the government failed to prove that the value of each transaction was greater than.this argument is also contingent on vega view that the government did not prove she knew of preferred fraud until december.according to vega,medicare paid only to preferred following december and we should assume vega used only clean funds to pay her loans.our finding that the government presented sufficient evidence that vega knew of the fraud prior to december compels us to reject her argument.
finally,vega argues that the government failed to prove that her transactions affected interstate commerce.vega points to the fact that preferred bank account was with banco popular and both of her transactions went to other banco popular accounts.she argues that transferring money within the same bank can not affect interstate commerce.this claim was considered sua sponte by the district court and then rejected based on the government arguments that a witness who worked for cigna,the processor that paid out medicare claims,stated cigna was located in tennessee and was the subsidiary of a south carolina company.vega now argues this ruling was erroneous because there was no testimony that cigna was based in tennessee and the location of cigna parent company was irrelevant.
we reject vega argument.section requires only a de minimus effect on interstate commerce.united states benjamin,cir.we have previously stated that a bank deposit affects interstate commerce if the source of that deposit actually affected interstate commerce to any degree.id.at.the crux of the government cases against vega was that she defrauded a federal health care program.we think it is uncontroversial to conclude the source of vega funds affected interstate commerce,thereby satisfying the interstate commerce element.see united states girod,cir rejecting defendant argument government failed to prove interstate commerce affect for healthcare fraud charges because medicaid is a federally funded program that indisputably affects interstate commerce.we thus find the government presented sufficient evidence to convict vega of money laundering.
vii.conclusion 
finding that the government presented sufficient evidence and any procedural defects were harmless,we affirm.
in the medicare claim,the dme supplier states how much the beneficiary was billed for the equipment.up to a set price point,medicare will fully reimburse a dme supplier,factoring in an expected
