on may,officer melvin martínez,a veteran of the puerto rico police department,was on motorcycle patrol in caguas,puerto rico.while meeting up with another police officer in front of the plaza del carmen shopping center,martínez saw that the driver of a nearby black jeep cherokee was not wearing a seatbelt,a violation of puerto rico law.martínez and his fellow officer followed the jeep and initiated a traffic stop.inside were the driver,cardona in the front passenger seat,and a minor in the back seat.
martínez obtained the vehicle registration from the driver,who told martínez that he did not have his driver license.martínez then went around the back of the jeep to check its registration sticker,known as a marbete and located at the front of the vehicle,which he did in a tactical manner so that the occupants of the vehicle would not have a good visibility regarding as to where he was.
as he rounded the jeep,martínez saw cardona in the passenger seat grabbing a fanny pack wrapped around cardona waist in such a way that,based on martínez experience,led him to believe that there was a gun in the fanny pack.cardona appeared to him to be nervous.martínez then asked cardona if he had a license to carry a firearm.according to martínez,cardona gestured to him that he did not.this testimony was supported by the driver of the jeep.according to special agent gabriel ortiz of homeland security investigations who later interviewed both cardona and the driver,and testified during the suppression hearing the driver told him that cardona remained silent and looked down and acknowledged that he did not have a license to carry a firearm.
martínez,who was fearful for his life at this point,told cardona to get out of the vehicle.martínez opened the jeep door in a tactical manner to prevent cardona from fleeing.after cardona stepped out of the vehicle,martínez touched the fanny pack and felt a gun.
martínez said to cardona,you have a weapon there,to which cardona responded,yes.martínez then verified that there was a firearm in the fanny pack the driver told ortiz that cardona unzipped the fanny pack to reveal the weapon.at that point,martínez read cardona his rights and placed him under arrest.
the fanny pack contained a caliber glock pistol with one round of ammunition in the chamber,eleven additional rounds in the magazine,in cash,and fourteen baggies of cocaine.after martínez confirmed that there was a gun in the fanny pack,he asked cardona if there was anything else illegal in the car.cardona told him there were more items under the rear seat of the vehicle.martínez fellow officer looked under the seat and found a cigar box with marijuana cigars and baggies of marijuana.
cardona was then taken to the caguas police precinct.martínez read cardona his rights,in spanish,and also gave them to him in writing.cardona signed the statement of rights and indicated on the form that he understood his rights and that he wished to give a statement.he then gave a written statement in which he said,in spanish,what they took,well,is mine.later,another officer again read cardona his rights and provided them to him in spanish.after acknowledging that he understood his rights,cardona signed a waiver of rights.cardona was then interviewed by ortiz.
on may,cardona was indicted on two counts of possession of a controlled substance cocaine and marijuana with intent to distribute,a,and one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,c.the indictment also included a firearms and ammunition forfeiture allegation.d c.
on september,cardona filed a motion to suppress all materials seized from him by the police as well as statements he made to the police as fruit of the traffic stop,illegal search,and seizure.cardona argued that b ased on the totality of the circumstances known to the puerto rico police department at the time of the traffic stop they had no basis to suspect an ongoing criminal activity,that martínez was operating on a mere hunch,and that cardona detention consequently did not fall within the reasonable investigatory stop of terry ohio,d.
a suppression hearing was held before a magistrate judge on november.both martínez and ortiz testified at the hearing,and the government submitted seven documents into evidence without objection.cardona did not take the stand or submit any evidence in support of his motion.in a report and recommendation issued on november,the magistrate judge recommended denial of cardona motion,concluding that under the totality of the circumstances,there was reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle in which defendant cardona was an occupant,that cardona warrantless arrest was based on probable cause,that the subsequent search of the car was legal,and that cardona statements were admissible.
cardona filed an objection to the magistrate judge report and recommendation on december,arguing,inter alia,that an officer speculation resulting from the way a person holds a fanny pack is insufficient to justify a search.the government opposed cardona objection.
on february,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation and denied cardona motion to suppress.united states cardona vicente,cr,wl.though the magistrate judge had not done so,the district court engaged in an independent fourth amendment analysis of the of the fanny pack.id.at.the court recognized that a must be supported by reasonable suspicion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and dangerous,id.at quoting arizona johnson,d,and it explained that there were at least three factors here alerting agent martinez cardona nervousness,the type of fanny pack around cardona waist,the manner in which cardona grabbed the fanny pack,id.at.the court concluded that these factors were sufficient to give agent martinez reasonable suspicion that cardona was armed and dangerous,and that once the was conducted,the arrest was justified.id.
after plea bargaining broke down,a jury trial was held on july and.cardona was convicted on all three counts and sentenced to a total of sixty months of imprisonment.this appeal followed.
on appeal,cardona argues that a lthough he does not challenge the validity of the original terry stop,it is his contention that the district court erred in finding that factors utilized as justification for the subsequent frisk gave rise to the sort of particularized suspicion necessary to support a under terry.he argues that the items seized from him,as well as statements he later gave to the police,should be suppressed as fruits of the unconstitutional.see united states camacho,cir explaining fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.
when reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress,we review the district court legal determinations de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states collins,cir.
i n determining whether a search is an appropriate step following a valid terry stop,the key is whether,under the circumstances,the officer is justified in believing that the person is armed and dangerous to the officer or others.romain,at quoting united states schiavo,cir.it is insufficient that the s
