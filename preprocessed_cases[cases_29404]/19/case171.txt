petitioners abbott and gould,defendants in unrelated prosecutions,were charged with drug and firearm offenses,including violation of c,which prohibits using,carrying,or possessing a deadly weapon in connection with any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,c.the minimum prison term for a c offense is five years,c a i,in addition to any other term of imprisonment imposed on the offender,c d ii.abbott was convicted on the c count,on two predicate counts,and of being a felon in possession of a firearm.he received a mandatory minimum sentence for his conviction and an additional five years for his c violation.gould predicate crime carried a mandatory minimum sentence he received an additional five years for his c violation.on appeal,abbott and gould challenged their c sentences,resting their objections on the except clause prefacing c a.that clause provides for imposition of a minimum term as a consecutive sentence e xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by c itself or by any other provision of law.abbott urged that the except clause was triggered by his sentence gould said the same of the ten years commanded by his predicate trafficking crime.the third circuit affirmed abbott sentence,concluding that the except clause refers only to other minimum sentences that may be imposed for c violations.gould fared no better before the fifth circuit.
held a defendant is subject to the highest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in c,unless another provision of law directed to conduct proscribed by c imposes an even greater mandatory minimum.
a section c was enacted as part of the gun control act of,but the except clause was not added until.under the text,it is undisputed,separate counts of conviction did not preempt c sentences,and abbott and gould would have been correctly sentenced under c.the question here is whether congress reformulation of c rendered their sentences excessive.the alteration responded primarily to bailey united states,which held that c ban on use of a firearm did not reach mere possession of a weapon,at.in addition to bringing possession within the statute compass,congress increased the severity of c sentences by changing once mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences,united states,and by elevating the sentences for brandishing and discharging a firearm and for repeat offenses.congress also restructured the provision,divid ing what was once a lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs,at,and it added the except clause at issue.
b the leading portion of the except clause now prefacing c a refers to a greater minimum sentence otherwise provided by c itself the second segment of the clause refers to a greater minimum provided outside c by any other provision of law.to determine whether a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by any other provision of law,the key question is otherwise provided for what most courts have answered for the conduct c proscribes,possessing a firearm in connection with a predicate crime.
abbott and gould disagree.gould would apply the except clause whenever any count of conviction at sentencing requires a greater minimum sentence.abbott argues that the minimum sentence otherwise provided must be one imposed for the criminal transaction that triggered c or,in the alternative,for a firearm offense involving the same firearm that triggered c.these three interpretations share a common,but implausible,premise that congress in adopted a less aggressive mode of applying c,one that significantly reduced the severity of the provision impact on defendants.the version of c prescribed a discrete sentence to be imposed on top of the sentence received for the predicate crime or any separate firearm conviction.it is unlikely that congress meant a prefatory clause,added in a bill dubbed an act t o throttle criminal use of guns,to effect a departure so great from c original insistence that sentencing judges impose additional punishment for c violations.abbott and gould readings would undercut that same bill primary objective to expand c coverage to reach firearm possession.their readings would also result in sentencing anomalies congress surely did not intend.section c,as they construe it,would often impose no penalty at all for the conduct that provision makes independently criminal.stranger still,the worst offenders would often secure shorter sentences than less grave offenders,because the highest sentences on other counts of conviction would be most likely to preempt c sentences.abbott and gould respond that sentencing judges may take account of any anomalies and order appropriate adjustments.while a judge exercising discretion under a would not be required to sentence a more culpable defendant to a lesser term,this court doubts that congress had such a cure in mind in,seven years before united states booker,held that district courts have discretion to depart from the sentencing guidelines based on a.abbott and gould alternatively contend that congress could have anticipated that the guidelines would resolve disparities by prescribing a firearm enhancement to the predicate sentence.but congress expressly rejected an analogous scheme in,when it amended c to impose a penalty even when the predicate crime itself prescribed a firearm enhancement.between and,congress expanded the reach or increased the severity of c four times,never suggesting that a guidelines firearm enhancement might suffice to accomplish c objective.nor is there any indication that congress was contemplating the guidelines relationship to c when it added the except clause.
c the government reading that the except clause is triggered only when another provision commands a longer term for conduct violating c makes far more sense.it gives effect to statutory language commanding that all c offenders shall receive additional punishment for their violation of that provision,a command reiterated three times first,the statute states that the c punishment shall be imposed in addition to the penalty for the predicate offense,c a second,c demands a discrete punishment even if the predicate crime itself provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device,third,c d ii rules out the possibility that a c sentence might run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment.interpreting the except clause to train on conduct offending c also makes sense as a matter of syntax.the clause is a proviso,most naturally read to refer to the conduct c proscribes.see united states morrow.there is strong contextual support for the view that the except clause was intended simply to clarify c.at the same time congress added the clause,it made the rest of c more complex,dividing its existing sentencing prescriptions into four paragraphs,and adding new penalties for brandishing and discharging a firearm.congress thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing judges it added the except clause initial part,which covers greater minimums provided by this subsection,to instruct judges not to stack ten years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing the same weapon.in referencing greater minimums provided by any other provision of law,the second portion of the clause simply furnishes the same instruction for cases in which c and a different statute both punish conduct offending c.congress likely anticipated such cases when framing the except clause,for the bill that reformulated c text also amended c to command a life sentence for certain repeat felons convicted of firearms possession as described in c.this interpretation does not render the except clause second part effectively meaningless.though c is the only existing statute,outside of c itself,that the government places within the except clause,the any other provision of law portion installs a safety valve for additional sentences that congress may codify outside c in the future.neither united states gonzales,nor republic of iraq beaty,warrants a different conclusion.

justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
as one of several measures to punish gun possession by persons engaged in crime,congress made it a discrete offense to use,carry,or possess a deadly weapon in connection with any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.c.the minimum prison term for the offense described in c is five years,c a i,in addition to any other term of imprisonment imposed on the offender,c d ii.the two consolidated cases before us call for interpretation of c as that provision was reformulated in.
kevin abbott and carlos rashad gould,petitioners here,defendants below,were charged with multiple drug and firearm offenses charges on which they were convicted included violation of c.each objected to the imposition of any additional prison time for his c conviction.their objections rested on the except clause now prefacing c a.under that clause,a minimum term of five years shall be imposed as a consecutive sentence e xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by c itself or by any other provision of law.
abbott and gould read c except clause to secure them against prison time for their c convictions.they claim exemption from punishment under c because they were sentenced to greater mandatory minimum prison terms for convictions on other counts charging different offenses.the except clause,they urge,ensures that c offenders will serve at least five years in prison.if conviction on a different count yields a mandatory sentence exceeding five years,they maintain,the statutory requirement is satisfied and the penalty specified for the c violation becomes inoperative.
the courts below,agreeing with the government construction of the statute,read c as independently requiring a sentence of at least five years,tacked onto any other sentence the defendant receives.the except clause refers to a greater minimum sentence otherwise provided.o therwise provided for what,the courts below asked their answer,for conduct offending c,possessing a firearm in connection with a crime of violence or crime.
a defendant is not spared from a separate,consecutive sentence for a c conviction,the lower courts determined,whenever he faces a higher mandatory minimum for a different count of conviction.instead,according to the courts below and the government here,the except clause applies only when another provision whether contained within or placed outside c commands a longer term for conduct violating c.for example,the mandatory minimum sentence for a c offense is five years,but if the firearm is brandished,the minimum rises to seven years,and if the firearm is discharged,to ten years.c a i,ii,iii.a defendant who possessed,brandished,and discharged a firearm in violation of c would thus face a mandatory minimum term of ten years.
we hold,in accord with the courts below,and in line with the majority of the courts of appeals,that a defendant is subject to a mandatory,consecutive sentence for a c conviction,and is not spared from that sentence by virtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a different count of conviction.under the except clause as we comprehend it,a c offender is not subject to stacked sentences for violating c.if he possessed,brandished,and discharged a gun,the mandatory penalty would be years,not.he is,however,subject to the highest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in c,unless another provision of law directed to conduct proscribed by c imposes an even greater mandatory minimum.
abbott and gould,defendants in unrelated prosecutions,were each charged with violating c a i by possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime.abbott case was tried to a jury in the eastern district of pennsylvania,which convicted him on the c count and three others two predicate trafficking counts,and being a felon in possession of a firearm,g.given abbott extensive criminal history,his conviction triggered a mandatory minimum under the armed career criminal act acca,e.the district court sentenced abbott to the years mandated by acca,and to an additional five years for the c violation,yielding a total prison term of years 
gould indictment listed seven separate drug and firearm charges.in return for gould agreement to plead guilty,the government dropped all but two one c offense and one predicate crime.the latter,for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base,carried a mandatory minimum under b a.firearm involvement was not an element of that offense.the united states district court for the northern district of texas imposed a sentence of years and months for the trafficking offense and an additional five years for the c violation,for a total of years and months.
on appeal,abbott and gould challenged the consecutive sentence each received under c.abbott urged that acca mandatory minimum triggered c except clause,because acca qualified as an other provision of law that provided a greater minimum sentence.gould said the same of the ten years commanded by his predicate trafficking crime.
the united states court of appeals for the third circuit affirmed abbott sentence,concluding that the except clause refers only to other minimum sentences that may be imposed for violations of c.united states abbott.gould fared no better before the fifth circuit.united states gould,fed.appx,per curiam.that court precedent already confined the exception to conduct offending c.united states london.to resolve the division among the circuits on the proper construction of c except clause we granted certiorari in both cases and consolidated them for argument.
congress enacted c as part of the gun control act of,stat.the except clause,which did not appear in c as originally composed,was introduced by statutory amendment in.see an act t o throttle criminal use of guns,stat.we begin by setting out c,first as it read before,then as amended that year.
the earlier version read in relevant part 
whoever,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime which provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device,uses or carries a firearm,shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,be sentenced to imprisonment for five years,and if the firearm is a rifle,shotgun,or semiautomatic assault weapon,to imprisonment for ten years,and if the firearm is a machinegun,or a destructive device,or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler,to imprisonment for thirty years.in the case of his second or subsequent conviction under this subsection,such person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for twenty years,and if the firearm is a machinegun,or a destructive device,or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler,to life imprisonment without release.notwithstanding any other provision of law,the term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection shall not run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment including that imposed for the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime in which the firearm was used or carried.c ed.
if this text governed,all agree,separate counts of conviction would have no preemptive force,and abbott and gould would have been correctly sentenced under c.the question we confront is whether congress reformulation of c rendered the sentences imposed on abbott and gould excessive.
the alteration responded primarily to our decision in bailey united states.in proscribing use of a firearm,bailey held,c did not reach mere possession of the weapon,at.congress legislated a different result in the revision,colloquially known as the bailey fix act,the legislature brought possession within the statute compass.united states,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in addition to the change prompted by bailey,congress increased the severity of c sentences in two other respects the revision changed what were once mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences,at slip,at and it elevated the sentences for brandishing and discharging a firearm and for repeat offenses.congress also restructured the provision,divid ing what was once a lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs.at slip,at.and it added the prefatory except clause at issue in the cases now before us.as amended,c a prescribes 
except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law,any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the united states,uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm,shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime i be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years ii if the firearm is brandished,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years and iii if the firearm is discharged,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years.
the reformulation,furthermore,removed to separate paragraphs the provisions commanding higher penalties for especially destructive weapons and second or subsequent offenses.see c b,c while leaving the penalties for highly destructive weapons unchanged,the revision raised the base punishment for second or subsequent offenses from years to.ibid.the reformulation also transferred the bar on concurrent sentences to c d ii 
n o term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person,including any term of imprisonment imposed for the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime during which the firearm was used,carried,or possessed.
the leading portion of the except clause,which now prefaces c a,refers to a greater minimum sentence otherwise provided by this subsection,by c itself the second segment of the clause refers to a greater minimum provided outside c by any other provision of law.beyond debate,the latter instruction does not relieve a c offender of additional punishment simply because a higher mandatory minimum sentence exists in the united states code.brief for petitioner in,hereinafter abbott brief.were it otherwise,the statute ascending series of minimums,set out in c a c,would have no work to do the only possible c sentence would be the code highest life.the except clause,it is therefore undisputed,has to have some understood referent to be intelligible.united states parker.what should that referent be as we comprehend the clause,to determine whether a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by any other provision of law,the key question one must ask is otherwise provided for what as earlier noted,see supra,at,most courts,in line with the courts below and the government,have answered for the conduct c proscribes,possessing a firearm in connection with a predicate crime.
abbott and gould disagree and offer diverse readings.gould principally would apply the except clause to preclude a c sentence whenever any of a defendant counts of convictio n at sentencing require a greater minimum sentence.brief for petitioner in,hereinafter gould brief.
in lieu of gould position that any greater minimum sentence on a different count of conviction will do,abbott advances a somewhat narrower transactional approach.any sentence imposed on the defendant fits the bill,he urges,so long as the sentence was imposed because of the criminal transaction that triggered c in the first place.abbott brief.accord united states williams.
abbott also tenders an alternative construction the minimum sentence otherwise provided must be for a firearm offense for example,abbott charge involving the same firearm that triggered c conceding that this reading is not commanded by the statute plain language,tr.of oral arg,abbott asserts that it advances c goal to discourage bearing arms in furtherance of crime while avoiding the imposition of two consecutive mandatory minimum sentences for the single use of a single firearm,abbott brief emphasis omitted.
the three interpretations just described share a common premise.in adding the except clause in,all three posit,congress adopted a less aggressive mode of applying c,one that significantly reduced the severity of the provision impact on defendants.like the courts below,we regard this premise as implausible.as earlier observed,see supra,at,the version of c prescribed a discrete sentence punishment to be imposed regardless of the sentence received for the predicate crime or any separate firearm conviction.abbott and gould think the except clause installed,instead,a modest scheme designed simply to ensure that all c offenders serve at least years in prison.gould brief see abbott brief.we doubt that congress meant a prefatory clause,added in a bill dubbed an act t o throttle criminal use of guns,to effect a departure so great from c longstanding thrust,its insistence that sentencing judges impose additional punishment for c violations.
were we to accept any of the readings proposed by abbott or gould,it bears emphasis,we would undercut that same bill primary objective to expand c coverage to reach firearm possession.in,more than half of those who violated c in connection with a offense received a mandatory minimum of ten years or more for that trafficking offense.letter from glenn schmitt,united states sentencing commission,to supreme court library,available in clerk of court case file.congress,however,imposed only a minimum for firearm possession in furtherance of a drug offense.as construed by abbott and gould,the amendment to include firearm possession as a c offense would spare the most serious drug offenders from any discrete punishment for the very firearm activity the amendment targeted.we are disinclined to say that what congress imposed with one hand it withdrew with the other.logan united states.
abbott and gould proposed readings,moreover,would result in sentencing anomalies congress surely did not intend.we note first that c,as they construe it,would often impose no penalty at all for the conduct that provision makes independently criminal.tr.of oral arg.for example,an individual who sold enough drugs to receive a minimum sentence under b a could,so far as c is concerned,possess or even brandish a gun without incurring any additional punishment.
stranger still,under the abbott and gould readings,the worst offenders would often secure the shortest sentences.consider two defendants convicted of trafficking in cocaine.the first possesses grams and is subject to a mandatory minimum of five years,b b the second possesses five kilograms and is subject to a mandatory minimum of ten years,b a.both brandish firearms,calling for a sentence of seven years under c a ii.the first defendant,under all readings,will spend at least years in prison.the second defendant drug minimum,according to abbott and gould,triggers the except clause and wipes out that defendant c penalty though the more culpable of the two,the second defendant minimum term would be just ten years.brief for united states.like the third circuit below,w e are confident that congress did not intend such a bizarre result.at.
abbott alternative construction,which homes in on other firearm offenses,gives rise to similar oddities.on this reading,abbott acca sentence for being a would preempt his c sentence,and his minimum term would be years,rather than but if acca were not at issue,abbott minimum term would be the same years his fiveyear c sentence on top of his drug sentence.qualification as a career criminal would carry no consequence.
nor does abbott second construction necessarily promote more equitable outcomes.suppose,for example,that a career criminal sold drugs together with a offender,and both brandished firearms i
