john wenor bresil was convicted of illegally reentering the united states after he was found in the middle of the night by coast guard and border patrol officials in an open boat with seventeen others nautical miles off the coast of puerto rico.on appeal he argues that he was wrongly prevented from showing at trial that he did not intend to enter the united states but instead was passing puerto rico on his way to the island of maarten.specifically,he argues that the district court wrongly denied him a continuance after the government announced its intention to call an expert witness only five days before trial the government violated his due process rights by sinking his boat after it took him into custody,preventing a conclusive determination of whether it contained enough fuel to make it to maarten,and by deporting others found in the boat with him who would have testified that the boat was traveling to maarten and there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction.though we find that the government plainly violated federal rule of criminal procedure,we affirm because that violation did not prejudice bresil,and his other claims are without merit.
background 
the basic facts leading to bresil conviction are not disputed.on the evening of march,a border patrol aircraft was patrolling the mona passage,the body of water that lies between the islands of hispaniola which contains haiti and the dominican republic,to the west,and puerto rico,to the east.at around,the aircraft detected a vessel about miles southwest of puerto rico traveling toward that island.border patrol agents tracked the vessel as it traveled northeast toward puerto rico until it came to a stop nautical miles off the coast at approximately 
only then did a coast guard vessel intercept the boat,which was feet long and six feet wide with a forty horsepower outboard engine and eighteen people aboard.the boat had taken on two feet of water by the time the coast guard reached it.from their vessel,the coast guard officials reported seeing in the bottom of the boat a number of empty fuel containers and one fifteen gallon container that was percent full.the boat outboard engine did not have an internal fuel tank,instead drawing fuel from a container.after the passengers were taken onto a coast guard vessel,the coast guard set fire to the boat in order to sink it because,government witnesses testified,it was a hazard to navigation if it remained where it was and they were unable to safely tow it somewhere else.when interviewed,all eighteen passengers on the boat said that they had departed from miches in the dominican republic.
bresil was indicted on one count of illegally attempting to return to the united states after being deported for commission of an aggravated felony.a,b.bresil was convicted on the sole count of the indictment and sentenced to months imprisonment and months supervised release.this appeal of his conviction followed.
ii.discussion 
timing of the government rule disclosure 
the government first informed bresil of its intention to call an expert witness who could testify about the boat fuel consumption five days before trial.the expert proposed to testify,and eventually testified,that,based on the type of boat,the number of people in it,and the weight of fuel,it would have traveled at most two and a half to three nautical miles per gallon of gasoline.maarten is approximately nautical miles from the eastern coast of puerto rico.
federal rule of criminal procedure a g provides that a t the defendant request,the government must give to the defendant a written summary of any expert testimony that the government intends to use during its at trial.bresil had timely requested such a disclosure over a month previously.in response to the government disclosure,bresil filed an emergency motion seeking a continuance to obtain his own expert and to further investigate other facts included in the government disclosure which he claimed were new to him.the district court denied bresil motion the same day he filed it on the grounds that a ll the facts movant claims as requiring additional investigative efforts were easily discernible from day one.
the government claims that bresil waived any objection to its late notice under rule by not mentioning the rule by name in his motion seeking a continuance based on the government notice that itself referred to rule a g explicitly.not surprisingly,the government cites no precedent for this contention that a party need expressly cite a rule when that rule application is obviously the point of the motion.bresil made clear that he was seeking a continuance because he need ed,at least,the services of an expert in to analyze the evidence and inform us about the capacity of this boat to travel to maarten.one reason he needed such testimony,his motion explained,was that the government intended to address this question with its expert.in sum,bresil clearly raised and preserved his argument that the government designation was filed at a time that warranted a remedy to avoid prejudice to bresil.because bresil raised the issue before the district court we review for abuse of discretion.see united states espinal almeida,cir 
rule a g is intended to minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony,to reduce the need for continuances,and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert testimony through focused.advisory committee note amendment.the fact that bresil knew that the boat fuel usage would be at issue at trial does not excuse the government of its duty under rule a g to give timely notice of its intent to call an expert who would marshal evidence on that issue in service of the government case.it is one thing to be prepared to argue about a fact at trial,but quite another to prepare to rebut an expert who can testify about implications of that fact in a way different from a lay witness.prior to the government notice,the government gave no indication that it would be presenting evidence to the jury that,if the government witnesses were right about the amount of fuel on board,the boat had only a fraction of the fuel it needed to make it to maarten.
the government notice was plainly untimely because it is unreasonable to expect a defense attorney in the midst of trial preparation to drop everything and try to obtain an expert five days before trial.see united states martinez,cir government disclosure of expert five days before trial not timely but district court was within its discretion to deny a continuance where expert testimony was a month away united states hoffecker,cir defendant disclosure of expert three business days before jury selection untimely united states johnson,cir government disclosure of expert six days before trial in violation of district court order untimely.not knowing when to fold a losing hand,the government nevertheless suggested at oral argument that because puerto rico is an island and it surrounded by ocean and one of the island largest marinas was located minutes away from the courthouse,presumably it would have been easy for bresil counsel to obtain an expert on short notice.the government provides no evidence for its claim that this would be easy,however,and,having no experience trawling marinas for experts on outboard motorboat fuel efficiency,we can hardly presume it to be so.more to the point,the government should not be able to send defense counsel on such a hunt when defense counsel is trying to get ready for trial.
the government also suggested at oral argument that denying the motion for a continuance was appropriate because,by the time the motion was filed,the government had already flown in its witnesses,so granting a continuance would have caused inconvenience for the government and the agencies for which its witnesses work.in other words,the government claims that it can create a last minute exigency by violating a rule,and then block a remedy for the defendant merely because a remedy would be inconvenient for the government.this argument falls of its own weight and suggests that the government does not take its obligations under rule serious
