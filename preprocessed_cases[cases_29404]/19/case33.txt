petitioner avondale lockhart pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography in violation of a.because lockhart had a prior conviction for sexual abuse involving his adult girlfriend,his presentence report concluded that he was subject to the mandatory minimum sentence enhancement provided in b,which is triggered by,inter alia,prior state convictions for crimes relating to aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.lockhart argued that the limiting phrase involving a minor or ward applied to all three state crimes,so his prior conviction did not trigger the enhancement.disagreeing,the district court applied the mandatory minimum.the second circuit affirmed.
held lockhart prior conviction is encompassed by b.
a a natural reading of the text supports that conclusion.the rule of the last antecedent,a canon of statutory interpretation stating that a limiting clause or phrase should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows,barnhart thomas,clarifies that the phrase involving a minor or ward modifies only the immediately preceding noun phrase abusive sexual conduct and that the phrases aggravated sexual abuse and sexual abuse are not so restricted.the rule can be overcome by other indicia of meaning,but b context reinforces its application in this case.
b section b enhancement can also be triggered by,inter alia,a prior federal sexual abuse offense enumerated in chapter of the federal criminal code.interpreting b using the rule of the last antecedent,the headings in chapter mirror precisely the order,precisely the divisions,and nearly precisely the words used to describe the state predicates.applying the modifier involving a minor or ward to all three items in b list,by contrast,would require this court to interpret the state predicates in a way that departs from the federal template.if congress had intended that result,it is doubtful that congress would have followed so closely the structure and language of chapter.
c lockhart counterarguments are rejected.
porto rico railway,light power mor,united states bass,and jama immigration and customs enforcement,do not require this court to apply lockhart countervailing principle.in those cases,the court simply observed that the rule may be overcome by contextual indicia of meaning.lockhart attempts to identify such indicia are unavailing.he claims that the state predicates are so similar that a limiting phrase could apply equally to all three.but by transforming a list of separate predicates into a set of,lockhart reading results in too much redundancy and risks running headlong into the rule against superfluity.
lockhart contends that the existence of other disparities between b state and federal predicates indicate that parity was not congress concern.however,this court construction relies on contextual cues particular to the predicates,not on a general assumption that congress sought full parity between all state and federal predicates.
the provision legislative history hardly speaks with a clarity of purpose,universal camera nlrb,and does nothing to explain why congress would have wanted to structure b to treat state and federal predicates differently.
finally,lockhart suggests the rule of lenity is triggered here,where applying his principle would lead to an alternative construction of b.the rule of lenity is used to resolve ambiguity only when the ordinary canons have revealed no satisfactory construction.here,however,the rule of the last antecedent is well supported by context,and lockhart alternative is not.

avondale lockhart,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
defendants convicted of possessing child pornography in violation of a are subject to a mandatory minimum sentence and an increased maximum sentence if they have a prior conviction under the laws of any state relating to aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.b.
the question before us is whether the phrase involving a minor or ward modifies all items in the list of predicate crimes aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,and abusive sexual conduct or only the one item that immediately precedes it abusive sexual conduct below,the court of appeals for the second circuit joined several other courts of appeals in holding that it modifies only abusive sexual conduct.the eighth circuit has reached the contrary result.we granted certiorari to resolve that split.we affirm the second circuit holding that the phrase involving a minor or ward in b modifies only abusive sexual conduct.
in april,avondale lockhart was convicted of sexual abuse in the first degree under penal law ann.west cum.supp.the crime involved his girlfriend.presentence investigation report psr,in.eleven years later,lockhart was indicted in the eastern district of new york for attempting to receive child pornography in violation of a and for possessing child pornography in violation of a b.lockhart pleaded guilty to the possession offense and the government dismissed the receipt offense.
lockhart presentence report calculated a guidelines range of to months for the possession offense.but the report also concluded that lockhart was subject to b mandatory minimum because his prior new york abuse conviction related to aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.psr.
lockhart objected,arguing that the statutory phrase involving a minor or ward applies to all three listed crimes aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,and abusive sexual conduct.he therefore contended that his prior conviction for sexual abuse involving an adult fell outside the enhancement ambit.the district court rejected lockhart argument and applied the mandatory minimum.the second circuit affirmed his sentence.
section b reads in full 
whoever violates,or attempts or conspires to violate a shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both,but if such person has a prior conviction under this chapter,chapter,chapter,or chapter,or under section of title article of the uniform code of military justice,or under the laws of any state relating to aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward,or the production,possession,receipt,mailing,sale,distribution,shipment,or transportation of child pornography,such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned for not less than years nor more than years.
this case concerns that provision list of state offenses.the issue before us is whether the limiting phrase that appears at the end of that list involving a minor or ward applies to all three predicate crimes preceding it in the list or only the final predicate crime.we hold that involving a minor or ward modifies only abusive sexual conduct,the antecedent immediately preceding it.although b list of state predicates is awkwardly phrased to put it charitably,the provision text and context together reveal a straightforward reading.a timeworn textual canon is confirmed by the structure and internal logic of the statutory scheme.
consider the text.when this court has interpreted statutes that include a list of terms or phrases followed by a limiting clause,we have typically applied an interpretive strategy called the rule of the last antecedent.see barnhart thomas.the rule provides that a limiting clause or phrase should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.see also black law dictionary ed.q ualifying words or phrases modify the words or phrases immediately preceding them and not words or phrases more remote,unless the extension is necessary from the context or the spirit of the entire writing scalia garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts.
this court has applied the rule from our earliest decisions to our more recent.see,sims lessee irvine,dall,ftc mandel brothers,barnhart,at.
the rule reflects the basic intuition that when a modifier appears at the end of a list,it is easier to apply that modifier only to the item directly before it.that is particularly true where it takes more than a little mental energy to process the individual entries in the list,making it a heavy lift to carry the modifier across them all.for example,imagine you are the general manager of the yankees and you are rounding out your roster.you tell your scouts to find a defensive catcher,a shortstop,or a pitcher from last year world champion kansas city royals.it would be natural for your scouts to confine their search for a pitcher to last year championship team,but to look more broadly for catchers and shortstops.
applied here,the last antecedent principle suggests that the phrase involving a minor or ward modifies only the phrase that it immediately follows abusive sexual conduct.as a corollary,it also suggests that the phrases aggravated sexual abuse and sexual abuse are not so constrained.
of course,as with any canon of statutory interpretation,the rule of the last antecedent is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.barnhart,at see also davis michigan of treasury,it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme for instance,take the laws,the treaties,and the constitution of the united states.post,at,kagan,dissenting.a reader intuitively applies of the united states to the laws,the treaties and the constitution because among other things laws,treaties,and the constitution are often cited together,because readers are used to seeing of the united states modify each of them,and because the listed items are simple and parallel without unexpected internal modifiers or structure.section b,by contrast,does not contain items that readers are used to seeing listed together or a concluding modifier that readers are accustomed to applying to each of them.and the varied syntax of each item in the list makes it hard for the reader to carry the final modifying clause across all three.
more importantly,here the interpretation urged by the rule of the last antecedent is not overcome by other indicia of meaning.to the contrary,b context fortifies the meaning that principle commands.
our inquiry into b context begins with the internal logic of that provision.section b establishes sentencing minimums and maximums for three categories of offenders.the first third of the section imposes a maximum sentence on offenders with no prior convictions.the second third imposes a minimum and maximum on offenders who have previously violated a federal offense listed within various chapters of the federal criminal code.and the last third imposes the same minimum and maximum on offenders who have previously committed state sexual abuse,aggravated sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward as well as a number of state crimes related to the possession and distribution of child pornography.
among the chapters of the federal criminal code that can trigger b recidivist enhancement are crimes under chapter.chapter criminal 
izes a range of offenses involving adults or minors and wards and it places those federal crimes under headings that use language nearly identical to the language b uses to enumerate the three categories of state predicates.the first section in chapter is titled aggravated sexual abuse.the second is titled sexual abuse.and the third is titled sexual abuse of a minor or ward.applying the rule of the last antecedent,those sections mirror precisely the order,precisely the divisions,and nearly precisely the words used to describe the three state predicate crimes in b aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,and abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.
this similarity appears to be more than a coincidence.we can not state with certainty that congress used chapter as a template for the list of state predicates set out in b,but we can not ignore the parallel,particularly because the headings in chapter were in place when congress amended the statute to add b state predicates 
if congress had intended to limit each of the state predicates to conduct involving a minor or ward,we doubt it would have followed,or thought it needed to follow,so closely the structure and language of chapter the conclusion that congress followed the federal template is supported by the fact that congress did nothing to indicate that offenders with prior federal convictions are more culpable,harmful,or worthy of enhanced punishment than offenders with nearly identical state priors.we therefore see no reason to interpret b so that s exual abuse that occurs in the second circuit courthouse triggers the sentence enhancement,but sexual abuse that occurs next door in the manhattan municipal building does not.
lockhart argues,to the contrary,that the phrase involving a minor or ward should be interpreted to modify all three state predicates.he first contends,as does our dissenting colleague,that the principle supports his reading.this principle,lockhart says,requires a modifier to apply to all items in a series when such an application would represent a natural construction.brief for petitioner post,at.
this court has long acknowledged that structural or contextual evidence may rebut the last antecedent inference.jama immigration and customs enforcement.for instance,in porto rico 
railway,light power mor,on which lockhart relies,this court declined to apply the rule of the last antecedent where n o reason appears why a modifying clause is not applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last and where special reasons exist for so construing the clause in question.at.in united states bass,this court declined to apply the rule of the last antecedent where there is no reason consistent with any discernable purpose of the statute to apply the limiting phrase to the last antecedent alone,at.likewise,in jama,the court suggested that the rule would not be appropriate where the modifying clause appear s at the end of a single,integrated list.at.and,most recently,in paroline united states,the court noted that the rule need not be applied in a mechanical way where it would require accepting unlikely premises.at slip,at.
but in none of those cases did the court describe,much less apply,a countervailing grammatical mandate that could bear the weight that either lockhart or the dissent places on the series qualifier principle.instead,the court simply observed that sometimes context weighs against the application of the rule of the last antecedent.barnhart,at.whether a modifier is applicable as much to the first as to the last words in a list,whether a set of items form a single,integrated list,and whether the application of the rule would require acceptance of an unlikely premise are fundamentally contextual questions.
lockhart attempts to identify contextual indicia that he says rebut the rule of the last antecedent,but those indicia hurt rather than help his prospects.he points out that the final two state predicates,sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct,are nearly synonymous as a matter of everyday speech.brief for petitioner.and,of course,anyone who commits aggravated sexual abuse has also necessarily committed sexual abuse.so,he posits,the items in the list are sufficiently similar that a limiting phrase could apply equally to all three of them.
but lockhart effort to demonstrate some similarity among the items in the list of state predicates reveals far too much similarity.the three state predicate crimes are not just related on lockhart reading they are hopelessly redundant.any conduct that would qualify as aggravated sexual abuse involving a minor or ward or sexual abuse involving a minor or ward would also qualify as abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.we take no position today on the meaning of the terms aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,and abusive sexual conduct,including their similarities and differences.but it is clear that applying the limiting phrase to all three items would risk running headlong into the rule against superfluity by transforming a list of separate predicates into a set of synonyms describing the same predicate.see bailey united states,we assume that congress used two terms because it intended each term to have a particular,nonsuperfluous meaning 
applying the limiting phrase involving a minor or ward more sparingly,by contrast,preserves some distinction between the categories of state predicates by limiting only the third category to conduct involving a minor or ward.we recognize that this interpretation does not eliminate all superfluity between aggravated sexual abuse and sexual abuse.see united states atlantic research,o ur hesitancy to construe statutes to render language superfluous does not require us to avoid surplusage at all costs.it is appropriate to tolerate a degree of surplusage but there is a ready explanation for the redundancy that remains it follows the categories in chapter federal template.see supra,at.we see no similar explanation for lockhart complete collapse of the list.
the dissent offers a suggestion rooted in its impressions about how people ordinarily speak and write.post,at.the problem is that,as even the dissent acknowledges,b list of state predicates is hardly intuitive.no one would mistake its odd repetition and inelegant phrasing for a reflection of the accumulated wisdom of everyday speech patterns.it would be as if a friend asked you to get her tart lemons,sour lemons,or sour fruit from mexico.if you brought back lemons from california,but your friend insisted that she was using customary speech and obviously asked for mexican fruit only,you would be forgiven for disagreeing on both counts.
faced with b inartful drafting,then,do we interpret the provision by viewing it as a clear,commonsense list best construed as if conversational english or do we look around to see if there might be some provenance to its peculiarity with chapter so readily at hand,we are unpersuaded by our dissenting colleague invocation of basic examples from life.whatever the validity of the dissent broader point,this simply is not a case in which colloquial practice is of much use.section b list is hardly the way an average person,or even an average lawyer,would set about to describe the relevant conduct if they had started from scratch.
lockhart next takes aim at our construction of b to avoid disparity between the state and federal predicates.he contends that other disparities between state and federal predicates in b indicate that parity was not congress concern.for example,b imposes the recidivist enhancement on offenders with prior federal convictions under chapter of title,which governs obscenity.see.yet b does not impose a similar enhancement for offenses under state obscenity laws.similarly,b neighbor provision,b,creates a mandatory minimum for sex trafficking involving children,but not sex trafficking involving adults.
however,our construction of b predicates does not rely on a general assumption that congress sought full parity between all of the federal and state predicates in b.it relies instead on contextual cues particular to the predicates.to enumerate the state predicates,congress used language similar to that in chapter of the federal criminal code,which describes crimes involving both adults and children.see supra,at.we therefore assume that the same language used to describe the state predicates also describes conduct involving both adults and children.
lockhart,joined by the dissent,see post,at,next says that the provision legislative history supports the view that congress deliberately structured b to treat state and federal predicates differently.they rely on two sources.the first is a reference in a report from the senate judiciary committee on the child pornography prevention act of,stat.that act was the first to add the language at issue here aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward to the code.it was initially added to b,then added two years later to b.
the report noted that the enhancement applies to persons with prior convictions under any state child abuse law or law relating to the production,receipt or distribution of child pornography.see.but that reference incompletely describes the state pornography production and distribution predicates,which cover not only production,receipt,or distributing of child pornography,as the report indicates,but also production,possession,receipt,mailing,sale,distribution,shipment,or transportation of child pornography,b.for the reasons discussed,we have no trouble concluding that the report also incompletely describes the state predicates.
lockhart and the dissent also rely on a letter sent from the department of justice doj to the house of representative committee on the judiciary commenting on the proposed child protection and sexual predator punishment act of.in the letter,doj provides commentary on the state of b and b,noting that although there is a mandatory minimum sentence for individuals charged with receipt or distribution of child pornography and who have prior state convictions for child molestation pursuant to b,there is no enhanced provision for those individuals charged with possession of child pornography who have prior convictions for child abuse pursuant to b,at.that letter,they say,demonstrates that doj understood the language at issue here to impose a sentencing enhancement only for prior state convictions involving children.
we doubt that doj was trying to describe the full reach of the language in b,as the dissent suggests.to the contrary,there are several clues that the letter was relaying on just one of the provision many salient features.for instance,the letter references to child molestation and child abuse do not encompass a large number of state crimes that are unambiguously covered by abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward namely,crimes involving wards.wards can be minors,but they can also be adults.see,b defining wards as persons who are in official detention and under custodial,supervisory,or disciplinary authority moreover,we doubt that doj intended to express a belief that the potentially broad scope of serious crimes encompassed by aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,and abusive sexual conduct reaches no further than state crimes that would traditionally be characterized as child molestation or child abuse.
thus,congress amendment to the provision did give doj just what it wanted,post,at.but the amendment also did more than that.we therefore think it unnecessary to restrict our interpretation of the provision to the parts of it that doj chose to highlight in its letter.just as importantly,the terse descriptions of the provision in the senate report and doj letter do nothing to explain why congress would have wanted to apply the mandatory minimum to individuals convicted in federal court of sexual abuse or aggravated sexual abuse involving an adult,but not to individuals convicted in state court of the same.the legislative history,in short,hardly speaks with a clarity of purpose through which we can discern congress statutory objective.universal camera nlrb.
the best explanation lockhart can muster is a basic administrability concern congress knew what conduct it was capturing under federal law and could be confident that all covered federal offenses were proper predicates.but congress did not have the same familiarity with the varied and mutable laws of all fifty states.brief for petitioner.perhaps congress worried that state laws punishing relatively minor offenses like public lewdness or indecent exposure involving an adult would be swept into b,at.but the risk lockhart identifies is minimal.whether the terms in b are given their generic meaning,see descamps united states,taylor united states,or are defined in light of their federal counterparts which we do not decide they are unlikely to sweep in the bizarre or unexpected state offenses that worry lockhart.
finally,lockhart asks us to apply the rule of lenity.we have used the lenity principle to resolve ambiguity in favor of the defendant only at the end of the process of construing what congress has expressed when the ordinary canons of statutory construction have revealed no satisfactory construction.callanan united states.that is not the case here.to be sure,lockhart contends that if we applied a different principle of statutory construction namely,his principle we would arrive at an alternative construction of b.but the arguable availability of multiple,divergent principles of statutory construction can not automatically trigger the rule of lenity.llewellyn,remarks on the theory of appellate decision and the rules or canons about how statutes are to be construed,vand,t here are two opposing canons on almost every point here,the rule of the last antecedent is well supported by context and lockhart alternative is not.we will not apply the rule of lenity to override a sensible grammatical principle buttressed by the statute text and structure.
we conclude that the text and structure of b confirm that the provision applies to prior state convictions for sexual abuse and aggravated sexual abuse,whether or not the convictions involved a minor or ward.we therefore hold that lockhart prior conviction for sexual abuse of an adult is encompassed by b.the judgment of the court of appeals,accordingly,is affirmed.

imagine a friend told you that she hoped to meet an actor,director,or producer involved with the new star wars movie.you would know immediately that she wanted to meet an actor from the star wars cast not an actor in,for example,the latest zoolander.suppose a real estate agent promised to find a client a house,condo,or apartment in new york.would the potential buyer be annoyed if the agent sent him information about condos in maryland or california and consider a law imposing a penalty for the violation of any statute,rule,or regulation relating to insider trading.surely a person would have cause to protest if punished under that provision for violating a traffic statute.the reason in all three cases is the same everyone understands that the modifying phrase involved with the new star wars movie,in new york,relating to insider trading applies to each term in the preceding list,not just the last.
that ordinary understanding of how english works,in speech and writing alike,should decide this case.avondale lockhart is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence for possessing child pornography if,but only if,he has a prior conviction for aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.b.the court today,relying on what is called the rule of the last antecedent,reads the phrase involving a minor or ward as modifying only the final term in that list.but properly read,the modifier applies to each of the terms just as in the examples above.that normal construction finds support in uncommonly legislative history,which states in so many words that the three predicate crimes all involve abuse of children.and if any doubt remained,the rule of lenity would command the same result lockhart prior conviction for sexual abuse of an adult does not trigger b mandatory minimum penalty.i respectfully dissent.
begin where the majority does with the rule of the last antecedent.see ante,at.this court most fully discussed that principle in barnhart thomas,which considered a statute providing that an individual qualifies as disabled if he is not only unable to do his previous work but can not,considering his age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.at quoting d a emphasis added.the court held,invoking the rule,that the italicized phrase modifies only the term substantial gainful work,and not the term previous work occurring earlier in the sentence.two points are of especial note.first,barnhart contained a significant caveat the rule can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.at see,nobelman american savings bank,refusing to apply the rule when a contrary interpretation was the more reasonable one second,the grammatical structure of the provision in barnhart is nothing like that of the statute in this case the modifying phrase does not,as here,immediately follow a list of multiple,parallel terms.that is true as well in the other instances in which this court has followed the rule.see,jama immigration and customs enforcement,batchelor united states,sims lessee irvine,dall.
indeed,this court has made clear that the rule does not generally apply to the grammatical construction present here when t he modifying clause appear s at the end of a single,integrated list.jama,at.then,the exact opposite is usually true as in the examples beginning this opinion,the modifying phrase refers alike to each of the list terms.a leading treatise puts the point as follows when there is a straightforward,parallel construction that involves all nouns or verbs in a series,a modifier at the end of the list normally applies to the entire series.scalia garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts compare,at when the syntax involves something other than such a parallel series of nouns or verbs,the modifier normally applies only to the nearest reasonable referent that interpretive practice of applying the modifier to the whole list boasts a fancy name the canon,see black law dictionary ed.but,as my opening examples show,it reflects the completely ordinary way that people speak and listen,write and read 
even the exception to the principle is intuitive,emphasizing both its basis and its customary usage.when the nouns in a list are so disparate that the modifying clause does not make sense when applied to them all,then the rule takes over.suppose your friend told you not that she wants to meet an actor,director,or producer involved with star wars,but instead that she hopes someday to meet a president,supreme court justice,or actor involved with star wars.presumably,you would know that she wants to meet a president or justice even if that person has no connection to the famed film franchise.but so long as the modifying clause is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last,this court has stated,the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.paroline united states,slip,at quoting porto rico railway,light power mor.in other words,the modifier then qualifies not just the last antecedent but the whole series.
as the majority itself must acknowledge,see ante,at,this court has repeatedly applied the rule in just that manner.in paroline,for example,this court considered a statute requiring possessors of child pornography to pay restitution to the individuals whose abuse is recorded in those materials.the law defines such a victim losses to include medical services relating to physical,psychiatric,or psychological care physical and occupational therapy or rehabilitation necessary transportation,temporary housing,and child care expenses lost income attorneys fees,as well as other costs incurred and any other losses suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense.b a f lettering omitted.the victim bringing the lawsuit invoked the rule to argue that the modifier at the end of the provision as a proximate result of the offense pertained only to the last item in the preceding list,and not to any of the others.see,at slip,at.but the court rejected that view it recited the canon of statutory construction,derived from the natural use of language,that w hen several words are followed by a clause that can sensibly modify them all,it should be understood to do so.ibid.thus,the court read the requirement to cover each and every term in the list.
united states bass,to take just one other example,followed the same rule.there,the court confronted a statute making it a crime for a convicted felon to receive,possess,or transport in commerce or affecting commerce any firearm.app.a ed.current version at g.the government contended that the modifying clause in commerce or affecting commerce applied only to transport and not to receive or possess.but the court rebuffed that argument.t he natural construction of the language,the court recognized,suggests that the clause in commerce or affecting commerce qualifies all three antecedents in the list.at some internal quotation marks omitted.relying on longstanding precedents endorsing such a construction,the court explained since in commerce or affecting commerce undeniably applies to at least one antecedent,and since it makes sense with all three,the more plausible construction here is that it in fact applies to all three.at citing united states standard brewery,porto rico railway,at see also,jones united states,similarly treating the interstate commerce element in the phrase any building,vehicle,or other real or personal property used in interstate or foreign commerce as applying to buildings and vehicles.
that analysis holds equally for b,the sentencing provision at issue here.the relevant language aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward contains a single,integrated list of parallel terms,sex crimes followed by a modifying clause.jama,at.given the close relation among the terms in the series,the modifier makes sense as much to the first and other words as to the last.paroline,at slip,at.in other words,the reference to a minor or ward applies as well to sexual abuse and aggravated sexual abuse as to abusive sexual conduct.the case would be different if,for example,the statute established a mandatory minimum for any person previously convicted of arson,receipt of stolen property,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.so interpreting the modifier as applicable to all the preceding terms is what the natural construction of the language requires.bass,at.
the majority responds to all this by claiming that the inelegant phrasing of b renders it somehow exempt from a grammatical rule reflecting how people ordinarily use the english language.ante,at.but to begin with,the majority is wrong to suggest that the canon is only about colloquial or conversational english.ibid.in fact,it applies to both speech and writing,in both their informal and their formal varieties.here is a way to test my point pick up a journal,or a book,or for that matter a supreme court opinion most of which keep everyday colloquialisms at a far distance.ibid.you come across many sentences having the structure of the statutory provision at issue here a few nouns followed by a modifying clause.and you discover,again and yet again,that the clause modifies every noun in the series,not just the last in other words,that even especially in formal writing,the principle works and the majority is wrong too in suggesting that the odd repetition in b list of state predicates causes the principle to lose its force.ibid.the majority own sentence proves that much.if a friend asked you to get her tart lemons,sour lemons,or sour fruit from mexico,you might well think her list of terms perplexing you might puzzle over the difference between tart and sour lemons,and wonder why she had specifically mentioned lemons when she apparently would be happy with sour fruit of any kind.but of one thing,you would have no doubt your friend wants some produce from mexico it would not do to get her,say,sour lemons from vietnam.however weird the way she listed fruits or the way b lists offenses the modifying clause still refers to them all.
the majority as well seeks refuge in the idea that applying the canon to b would violate the rule against superfluity.see ante,at.says the majority any conduct that would qualify as aggravated sexual abuse involving a minor or ward or sexual abuse involving a minor or ward would also qualify as abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.ante,at.but that rejoinder does work.t he canon against superfluity,this court has often stated,assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a statute.microsoft.partnership,internal quotation marks omitted see,bruesewitz wyeth llc.and the majority approach as it admits,see ante,at produces superfluity too and in equal measure.now to rearrange the majority sentence any conduct that would qualify as abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward or aggravated sexual abuse would also qualify as sexual abuse.in other words,on the majority reading as well,two listed crimes become subsets of a third,so that the three could have been written as one.and indeed,the majority superfluity has an especially odd quality,because it relates to the modifying clause itself the majority,that is,makes the term involving a minor or ward wholly unnecessary.remember the old adage about the pot and the kettle that is why the rule against superfluity can not excuse the majority from reading b modifier,as ordinary usage demands,to pertain to all the terms in the preceding series 
legislative history confirms what the natural construction of language shows each of the three predicate offenses at issue here must involve a minor.the list of those crimes appears in two places in b both in b,which contains a sentencing enhancement for those convicted of distributing or receiving child pornography,and in b,which includes a similar enhancement for those like lockhart convicted of possessing such material.descriptions of that list of offenses,made at the time congress added it to those provisions,belie the majority position.
the relevant language again,providing for a minimum sentence if a person has a prior conviction for aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward first made its appearance in,when congress inserted it into b.see child pornography prevention act of,stat,note.at that time,the senate report on the legislation explained what the new language meant the mandatory minimum would apply to an offender with a prior conviction under any state child abuse law.emphasis added.it is hard to imagine saying any more directly that the state predicates all involve minors,and minors only 
two years later,in urging congress to include the same predicate offenses in b,the department of justice doj itself read the list that way.in a formal bill comment,doj noted that proposed legislation on child pornography failed to fix a statutory oddity only b,and not b,then contained the state predicates at issue here.doj described that discrepancy as follows whereas b provided a penalty enhancement for individuals charged with receipt or distribution of child pornography and who have prior state convictions for child molestation,the adjacent b contained no such enhancement for those charged with possession of child pornography who have prior convictions for child abuse.emphasis added.that should change,doj wrote a possessor of child pornography should also be subject to a mandatory minimum if he had a prior conviction for sexual abuse of a minor.ibid.emphasis added.doj thus made clear that the predicate offenses it adding to b like those already in b related not to all sexual abuse but only to sexual abuse of children.and congress gave doj just what it wanted soon after receiving the letter,congress added the language at issue to b,resulting in the requested minimum sentence.see protection of children from sexual predators act of,a,stat,note.so every indication,in no less than in,was that all the predicate crimes relate to children alone.
the majority response to this history fails to blunt its force.according to the majority,the reference to any state child abuse law in the senate report is simply an incomplete descri ption of the state predicates.ante,at.and similarly,the majority ventures,the doj letter was merely noting one of the provision man
