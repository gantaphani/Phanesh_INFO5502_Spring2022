adolfo verdugo and rafael challenge their convictions for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine.they argue,among other things,that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress certain physical evidence and admissions,allowing testimony from a government agent interpreting wiretapped communications,declining to admit a videotape of a statement that verdugo gave to government agents,and failing to properly instruct the jury concerning the inferences that can be drawn from a defendant presence at the scene of a crime.we affirm both convictions.
in november,drug enforcement agency dea agents learned that a drug distribution operation based in california was importing cocaine into rhode island.the agents identified omar,also known as juan carlos diaz delgadillo,as the lead target of their investigation in the rhode island area,and obtained a court order authorizing them to intercept altamirano telephone calls on a land line and two cell phones.on march,agents began monitoring altamirano calls.
a.the intercepted phone calls 
on may,altamirano received a call in spanish from a man later identified as verdugo.in that call,placed from a california cell phone number,verdugo told altamirano to get ready as he would have a little dinner for altamirano by monday.verdugo indicated that he planned to drop off some things and instructed altamirano to come this way some fifty or sixty miles from where is by nine one.agents interpreted this to mean that verdugo planned to deliver drugs to altamirano on monday,may,in the hartford,connecticut area,near the intersection of interstate and interstate.
over the next several days,agents intercepted a number of additional coded conversations detailing the planned drug transaction.the day after verdugo call,an unidentified man phoned altamirano from mexico and stated,m y mom is going over there,to which altamirano responded that he would be waiting for her.the unidentified caller also told altamirano that the month of february brings,and that he would leave altamirano in charge to get the medicine and give it to these people.agents interpreted this to mean that a drug delivery of kilograms was to take place as verdugo call had indicated.subsequent calls revealed that the transaction had been delayed but was expected to occur on tuesday,may.
on tuesday evening,altamirano called verdugo and verdugo assured altamirano that he was almost arriving and that altamirano should come over to the side where the simpsons live.agents understood this to be a reference to the simpsons,a television show set in a town called springfield,and inferred that the drug transaction would occur near springfield,massachusetts,which is approximately miles north of hartford along interstate.altamirano told verdugo that he would set out to meet him when verdugo arrived at the actual rendezvous site,and instructed verdugo to call him with a nearby exit number upon arrival.verdugo estimated that he would arrive between and 
b.the surveillance 
later that evening,agents conducting surveillance followed altamirano as he left his providence residence in a honda minivan and drove to two other residences in the area where he picked up fernández and a man later identified as idelfonso.agents then followed the three men in the minivan to another providence residence and watched as fernández and betancourt got out of the minivan and into a jeep cherokee.agents continued to monitor the suspects phone calls,and followed the two vehicles as they drove in tandem west on interstate toward springfield.
shortly after midnight,betancourt called altamirano.altamarino noted that the three men were set to arrive ahead of schedule,and decided that they should take a ride and at the next exit come back to see how things are.a few minutes later,they agreed to meet at a nearby econo lodge motel to get together and wait for the guy to call.agents then followed the vehicles to the motel and watched as the three men went inside.
verdugo called altamirano while he was waiting at the motel and informed him that verdugo was heading north on interstate.altamirano told verdugo that he was at the location that they had previously discussed,and the two agreed that verdugo would look for a good spot for them to meet.altamarino,fernández,and betancourt then left the motel and returned to their respective vehicles.agents followed them as they proceeded first along interstate and then north on interstate.
verdugo later informed altamarino that he had reversed direction and begun heading south on interstate after he had been unable to find a place to stop.agents then tracked the jeep and the minivan as they turned around and began heading south on interstate.at,verdugo called altamarino to inform him that he had stopped at a rest area.a few minutes later,he called again and instructed altamirano to go as if he was getting off,and get in between me and the other one,which agents interpreted as an indication that two trucks were parked at the rest area.he assured altamirano that the area was clean,and altamirano told verdugo that his guy was bringing one of those cherokees.verdugo told altamirano to instruct the driver of the cherokee to get in front and right away.altamirano then called betancourt and relayed verdugo instructions.altamirano told betancourt to get in between the two trucks,there two,the black one and you know which one is the guy and then to t urn everything off.
c.the drug transfer 
shortly after altamirano ended his call to betancourt,dea agent michael naylor,one of the agents conducting the surveillance,saw the jeep turn into a rest area while the minivan continued south on interstate.naylor watched as the jeep pulled in between two trucks and shut its lights off for between thirty seconds and a minute.immediately thereafter,the jeep turned its lights back on and left the rest area.
at,fernández called altamirano and told him,i ready,to which altamirano responded,g o ahead.i driving slowly,pass me by.after this conversation occurred,naylor and other agents following the jeep saw the minivan and the jeep meet and continue together down interstate.in a final call at a,verdugo assured altamirano that e verything was fine it done.
arrests of fernández,betancourt,and altamarino 
agents stopped the jeep at approximately and discovered a duffel bag lying on the back seat of the vehicle that contained what was later determined to be kilograms of cocaine.fernández and betancourt were arrested,and a silver cell phone was seized from fernández person.the two men were then transported to the charlton,massachusetts state police barracks where they were advised of their miranda rights in spanish by special agent ryan arnold of the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement.after acknowledging that he understood his miranda rights,fernández stated that he was unsure of his address in providence,he worked for a man named juan carlos at a garage,and he was a mexican national who was illegally living in the united states.fernández also raised his hand when he and betancourt were shown the silver cell phone and asked whose is this 
naylor,along with other dea agents and law enforcement officers,stopped the minivan and arrested altamirano at approximately naylor seized two cell phones from the minivan and confirmed that the phones had the same two cell phone numbers that the agents had been monitoring.
e.the rest area encounter 
as law enforcement officers stopped and arrested fernández,betancourt,and altamarino,other massachusetts state troopers and dea agents secured the rest area.officer thomas nartowicz,who was working with the dea team,observed two trucks parked near the exit of the rest area.one of the trucks had california license plates,a sign that read verdugo trucking,and an engine that was still warm.the other had license plates from a southern state,a cold engine,and was driven by a man who needed to be awakened from sleep and did not speak with a spanish accent.on the basis of these observations and additional information obtained from members of the dea team,nartowicz and trooper robert wycoff focused their attention on the truck with the california plates,shined a flashlight on the cab area of the suspected truck,and,with guns drawn,directed the occupants to come out.verdugo and a second man,later identified as esteban,emerged from the cab moments later and were handcuffed.nartowicz then inspected the cab for additional occupants and readily available weapons but found nothing of significance.
prior to being advised of his miranda rights,verdugo told nartowicz that he owned the truck and was shipping produce to a company in hatfield,massachusetts.nartowicz then asked verdugo and arias whether there were any illegal substances in the cab area,and both men said no.another trooper joined the officers at the scene with a dog,and obtained verdugo consent to search the truck cab area.the search did not reveal any contraband materials.
agent daniel macisaac,another member of the dea team,later obtained verdugo consent to search the cab area a second time,and this time he found four cell phones.through radio communications with naylor,macisaac learned that naylor had seized altamirano cell phones,and planned to call the california phone number that verdugo had been using to communicate with altamirano.when naylor dialed the phone number,one of the four phones that macisaac had just seized from the cab area rang.macisaac then asked verdugo and arias to whom the ringing phone belonged,and verdugo replied that the phone was his.
following the seizure of the four cell phones,nartowicz advised verdugo of his miranda rights in english by reading from a card.verdugo agreed to waive his miranda rights,and consented to a search of the truck cargo compartment.because it was dark,nartowicz and macisaac asked verdugo and arias to accompany them to a nearby police barracks for fingerprinting and a more thorough search of the truck,and assured them that they were not under arrest.both men agreed to proceed with the officers to the barracks,and the group departed.
verdugo and arias arrived between and at the northampton,massachusetts state police barracks,where they were fingerprinted and photographed as agents conducted a search of the truck cargo compartment.the suspects were then asked to identify the four cell phones that had been seized during the search at the rest area.verdugo again admitted that he owned the ringing cell phone and asserted that he also owned one of the three remaining phones.verdugo then signed a prisoner property inventory form stating that he owned both phones.verdugo and arias were released later that morning.
verdugo arrest 
on july,a rhode island grand jury charged altamirano,betancourt,fernández,and verdugo with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute over five kilograms of cocaine.a warrant was issued for verdugo arrest,and naylor and dea agent anthony cardello later traveled to pomona,california to execute the warrant.at naylor direction,local authorities stopped and arrested verdugo on july,as he was driving near his home in pomona.verdugo was handcuffed and placed in the back of a patrol car.naylor and cardello,who had observed the traffic stop,approached verdugo as he sat in the patrol car.verdugo confirmed that he understood english,and naylor read verdugo his miranda rights from a card as he crouched near the open door of the patrol car.verdugo indicated that he understood his rights and agreed to speak with naylor.
verdugo initially denied having any involvement in the drug transaction.naylor then confronted verdugo with evidence of his intercepted remarks to altamirano regarding their planned meeting near springfield,and verdugo admitted that he had delivered the kilograms of cocaine to massachusetts two months earlier,but denied that he had received any money.naylor also showed verdugo a photograph of altamirano,whom he identified as juan carlos.verdugo agreed to cooperate,but told the agents that he had nothing to offer.
agents then brought verdugo to an interview room at the pomona police station.there,naylor presented verdugo with a form explaining his miranda rights and read the form to him.verdugo signed the form,and the agents began questioning him.verdugo immediately invoked his right to counsel and refused to acknowledge his earlier confession.the interview,which lasted approximately eight minutes,was recorded on videotape.
g.the suppression hearing and trial 
verdugo and fernández each filed motions to suppress the physical evidence obtained from the search of their vehicles and the statements that they made to government agents.after conducting a hearing that extended over several days,the court,ruling from the bench,denied verdugo motion to suppress in full,denied fernández motion to the extent that it challenged the lawfulness of his arrest,and reserved judgment as to whether arnold had obtained a valid waiver of fernández miranda rights before questioning him.the court indicated that it would address fernández unresolved claim in a written order after it had considered filings.fernández and the government each filed a supplemental memorandum addressing the issue a few days later,but the court did not rule on the motion until the third day of trial,when it denied the motion in a text order.
at trial,the government established that the ringing cell phone seized from the cab of verdugo truck and silver cell phone seized from fernández person had been used to make and receive intercepted communications with altamirano.naylor testified that he could identify both verdugo and fernández voices on the intercepted communications.the court also allowed naylor to interpret altamarino wiretapped conversations with verdugo,fernández,betancourt,and other alleged conspirators.naylor testified concerning the statement that verdugo made when he was arrested,but the court barred verdugo from introducing the videotape of the statement he made at the pomona police station.finally,the court refused to give fernández proposed mere presence jury instruction and instead gave the jury its own instruction on the subject.
on april,fernández and verdugo were convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine following a jury trial.after trial,the district court,sua sponte,issued a written decision concluding that it had mistakenly denied fernández motion to suppress his statement to arnold because the government failed to establish during the suppression hearing that fernández had voluntarily waived his miranda rights.united states,cr,wl,at may.approximately two months later,in response to motions,the court reconsidered its ruling and reinstated its initial order denying fernández motion to suppress.united states,cr,wl july.this time,the court relied on arnold testimony at trial that fernández had affirmatively waived his miranda rights.id.at.
verdugo and fernández attack their convictions on multiple grounds.we begin with their challenges to the district court suppression rulings.
suppression issues 
verdugoa.the search of verdugo truck 
verdugo first argues that the district court erred in refusing to suppress the cell phones seized from his truck because the agents lacked probable cause and searched the truck without a warrant.this argument is a nonstarter.
before macisaac searched verdugo truck,the agents working with him had intercepted multiple incriminating cell phone calls and corroborated those calls with surveillance.these investigative efforts provided compelling evidence of what the agents reasonably believed was a drug deal in progress.further,while the agents no longer had reason to believe that drugs would be found inside verdugo truck,they had ample grounds to expect that a search of the truck would uncover the cell phone that altamarino had been calling to coordinate the drug transfer.because the collective knowledge of the agents working with macisaac on the investigation is attributable to him when determining whether the search was justified,see united states pardue,cir,macisaac clearly had probable cause to believe that his search would be productive.accordingly,his warrantless search was justified under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.see united states bucci,cir automobile exception authorizes warrantless search when agents have probable cause to believe that evidence will be discovered in the place to be searched.
verdugo rest area admission 
verdugo next argues that his statement to macisaac,in which he admitted that he owned the ringing cell phone,should have been suppressed because it was obtained in violation of his miranda rights.this argument has some bite because verdugo made the statement without the benefit of miranda warnings,in response to interrogation,after being forcibly removed from the cab of his truck by multiple officers with drawn guns,and while in handcuffs that had been left on for several minutes.see united states mccarthy,cir defendant was in custody because he made statement while in handcuffs but see united states,cir neither the use of handcuffs nor the drawing of a weapon necessarily transforms a valid terry stop into a de facto arrest.nevertheless,we have no need to evaluate the merits of verdugo argument because the claimed error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states carl,cir,cert.denied.s tatements induced in violation of miranda safeguards are appropriate for analysis under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt test.
as the district court noted,verdugo repeated his admission that he owned the ringing cell phone when he signed the property inventory form at the northampton barracks after he had previously waived his miranda rights at the rest area.since verdugo admission was and substantially the same as his admission,the court refusal to suppress the statement was at most harmless error unless the court should also have suppressed the statement.see tankleff senkowski,cir feltrop bowersox,cir bryant vose,cir dictum.
verdugo seeks to overcome this problem by arguing that his statement was tainted by macisaac failure to issue miranda warnings before he obtained verdugo initial admission.the difficulty with this argument is that it can not be squared with supreme court and first circuit precedent.
in united states jackson,we explained that,
an earlier,simple failure to administer the miranda warnings,unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect ability to exercise his free will does not so taint the later investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period.
cir quoting oregon elstad.thus,where law enforcement officers have not engaged in coercive or improper tactics in obtaining an initial statement,but merely failed to advise a defendant of his miranda rights,determining the admissibility of a subsequent statement is relatively straightforward.such a statement is admissible if it was obtained after the defendant was advised of his or her miranda rights and,knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights.united states marenghi,cir.
verdugo cites missouri seibert,in support of his argument that his second statement was tainted by the first because the circumstances surrounding both statements undermined the effectiveness of the warnings that were given before the second statement was made.seibert involved the deliberate use of a interrogation technique in which the suspect was questioned first without the benefit of miranda warnings and then was advised of his rights and questioned again after a confession was obtained.id.at.in determining that both statements should have been suppressed,a plurality of the court focused on the circumstances under which the statements were made and identified the threshold issue as whether it would be reasonable to find that in these circumstances the warnings could function effectively as miranda requires.id.at.justice kennedy supplied the fifth vote for the result in a more narrowly reasoned opinion that hinged on the admitted fact that the police had used the interrogation technique in a calculated way to undermine the miranda warning.id.at kennedy,concurring.when we recently considered jackson again following the district court ruling on remand,we declined to determine whether seibert reach is limited to cases in which the police set out to subvert a suspect miranda rights because the statement at issue in jackson was admissible even under the seibert plurality more test.united states jackson,cir.we follow the same path here.
in the present case,the district court correctly concluded that verdugo interrogation at the rest area differed substantially from the interrogation technique that the supreme court condemned in seibert.in seibert,the defendant was awakened in the middle of the night,arrested,transported to a police station,and questioned for to minutes until she confessed.officers then gave the defendant a break,administered miranda warnings,and immediately confronted her with her statements.see seibert,at.here,in contrast,verdugo was asked only a limited number of questions before he was read his miranda rights,the bulk of the questioning occurred at a different location than the questioning,and verdugo made his second statement and signed the property inventory form over an hour after he first admitted to macisaac that the ringing cell phone was his.see united states materas,cir finding a subsequent confession untainted where police asked the defendant only one question before reading him his miranda rights,at another location,fifteen minutes later.these circumstances do not call into serious question the effectiveness of the miranda warnings that verdugo received before he made his second admission.the district court therefore committed no error in refusing to suppress verdugo statements based on seibert.
verdugo also claims that his statement was involuntary even if it was not tainted by his first statement.the circumstances surrounding verdugo questioning,however,contain no traces of the brutality,p sychological duress,threats,or unduly prolonged interrogation that courts have previously found when they have concluded that statements were involuntarily made.see jackson,at see also colorado connelly,only admissions procured by coercive official police tactics are to be excluded as involuntary greenwald wisconsin,confession involuntary where defendant was interrogated for over hours without food,sleep,or necessary medication beecher alabama,confession coerced where police held a gun to defendant head and interrogated him while he was in the hospital and under the influence of morphine payne arkansas,confession coerced where defendant was held incommunicado for three days with limited food and threatened with attack from a lynch mob.verdugo made his admission and signed the inventory form in an open room where he was no longer handcuffed,and he was not subject to prolonged questioning,threats,or duress.thus,the evidence simply does not support verdugo claim that his statement was involuntary.see united states byram,cir finding no evidence of coercion where police did not threaten violence or serious retaliation,the questioning was not prolonged,and the surrounding atmosphere appear ed to have been benign 
verdugo pomona admission 
verdugo argues that the court should have suppressed the statement that he made when he was arrested because the government failed to prove that he was advised of his miranda rights before he made the statement.he also faults the court for failing to investigate whether his statement was voluntarily made.neither argument has merit.
verdugo first argument challenges the district court decision to credit the testimony of agents naylor and cardello,who both claimed during the suppression hearing that verdugo waived his miranda rights and agreed to speak with them when he was arrested.this argument challenges a credibility assessment made by the district court and such matters are reviewed only for clear error.united states andrade,cir.verdugo can not possibly succeed under this deferential standard,because the district court had ample evidentiary support for its determination that verdugo was advised of his miranda rights.
verdugo second argument fares no better.the court had no reason to make specific findings on the issue of voluntariness because verdugo based his suppression argument solely on the agents alleged failure to administer miranda warnings.in any event,the only evidence in the record that in any way supports verdugo contention that his statement was involuntary comes from his own testimony,which the district court reasonably found to be incredible.thus,the district court did not err in refusing to suppress verdugo pomona admission.
the only suppression issue that fernández pursues on appeal is his claim that the district court improperly refused to suppress his statement to arnold at the charlton police barracks.first,he contends that the court should have excluded his statement because the government failed to prove during the suppression hearing that fernández affirmatively waived his miranda rights before responding to agents questions.next,he claims that the court violated his right to due process by failing to rule on his motion to suppress until the third day of trial.we address each argument in turn.
waiver claim 
fernández does not take issue with the district court findings that arnold read fernández his miranda rights and that fernández understood his rights,nor does he dispute the court determination that the record contains no evidence that the d efendant decision to answer questions was influenced by intimidation,coercion,or deception,wl,at.instead,he rests his argument entirely on the fact that the government did not prove at the suppression hearing that fernández affirmatively waived his miranda rights before he responded to questions.the problem with this argument is that it fails to take account of the fact that the court relied on arnold trial testimony that fernández affirmatively waived his miranda rights when it ultimately upheld its decision to admit fernández statement,wl,at.because fernández does not challenge the district court decision to rely on trial testimony to fill what fernández claims is a gap in the suppression hearing record,he is in no position to argue that suppression is required because of the claimed gap 
timing claim 
fernández also presents an unconvincing claim that the district court committed reversible error in failing to rule on his motion to suppress before trial.because fernández raises this claim for the first time on appeal,we review it for plain error.united states,cir.to satisfy the plain error standard,fernández must show an error that was plain,obvious and clear under current law,prejudicial,affected the outcome of the district court proceedings,and that seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states rivera calderon,cir,cert.denied.quoting united states griffin,cir.although fernández points to the fact that.d ordinarily requires a motion to suppress to be resolved before trial,he cites no case law to support his claim that a delayed suppression ruling can give rise to a due process violation.this failure alone has doomed other claims that were subject to plain error review.see,united states marcano,cir united states,cir.moreover,fernández has failed to present a persuasive argument that he was prejudiced by the timing of the court suppression ruling.without evidence of prejudice,fernández simply can not succeed on a claim that is subject to plain error review.see united states,cir,cert.denied.
trial issues 
interpretations of intercepted conversations 
verdugo cites instances in which he claims that the district court erred in allowing naylor to testify concerning his interpretation of words and phrases used by the conspirators during their intercepted conversations.the only time verdugo actually objected to a proposed interpretation,however,was in response to naylor innocuous explanation that he had initially misinterpreted verdugo statement about seeing some guys at the rest area to mean that verdugo had spotted the surveillance team.verdugo otherwise failed to object to naylor interpretations and,when the court called counsel to the bench to express concern as to why counsel was not objecting,counsel informed the court that he just wanted the court to know his reason was that he did want to limit his with respect to these phone calls because he d id intend to question naylor about certain calls.the government argues that counsel decision not to object to naylor interpretations results in a waiver of verdugo right to challenge the interpretations on appeal.we agree.
as we have noted,claims that are not preserved in the trial court typically are reviewed for plain error.united states medina,cir.an intentional relinquishment of a claim,however,results in a complete waiver of the right to raise the claim on appeal.id.finding that defendant waived his right to object to the admission of physical evidence on appeal where his counsel told the judge at a bench conference during trial that he had no objection to the evidence coming in see also united states washington,cir defense counsel waived the right to object to the admission of telephone calls at trial where he made the deliberate strategic choice to play them to the jury to discredit the prosecution chief witness.here,verdugo counsel made a tactical choice not to object to naylor interpretations in order to lay the groundwork for later.having made this choice,verdugo can not now challenge the court failure to exclude naylor interpretations on appeal.
videotape of verdugo interrogation 
verdugo next claims that the district court improperly barred him from using the videotape of his interrogation at the pomona police station to impeach naylor trial testimony.naylor testified on direct examination about the statement verdugo made when he was arrested,but the subject of the videotaped statement did not come up until,when the following exchange occurred 
q.he verdugo did admit to anything during the videotaped statement,either,am i correct sir 
i do did admit to it.he said he wanted a lawyer.he said,the only thing i can talk about is against myself.i not sure if he admitted it.but i know i talked to him about what we talked about on the scene.so i do know exactly what was admitted to on tape again.i do really remember.but i remember speaking to him.he did deny what i talked about on the street,if that what you mean,sir.
trial tr.vol.
at that point,verdugo counsel asked the court for permission to play the videotape,arguing that the tape was admissible because it contradicted naylor testimony.the court denied counsel request because it concluded that what naylor said about the interview is not inconsistent with what the video shows.id.at.we agree with the district court.
a party ordinarily may introduce extrinsic evidence to impeach testimony by contradiction if the extrinsic evidence concerns a subject that is not collateral to the issues being tried.united states,cir,cert.denied.here,however,the videotape was properly excluded whether or not it was collateral because it simply did not contradict naylor testimony.the only portion of the videotape that arguably bears on the issue of naylor credibility is the following exchange 
naylor i know we spoke for a few minutes on the street.and you said that you never brought any money back that time.and were talking like that.i just wan na,you know so i understand we talked about that on the street.and we talked about um.the kilos that you brought there.that the stuff we talked about on the street.we not going to talk about this now,do you understand.cause you saying now you need a lawyer.but on the street when you were talking to me about that.um,um.that why you being brought up here.do you understand that why we here from rhode island.you understand that,correct 
verdugo i do know what you talking about.
in responding to naylor,verdugo disclaimed knowledge about their prior discussion,but he did not deny his alleged role in the conspiracy.thus,the videotape is consistent with naylor testimony that verdugo did deny what naylor talked about on the street.
verdugo also incorrectly claims for the first time on appeal that the court should have admitted the videotape pursuant to the rule of completeness embodied in.the short answer to this claim is tha
