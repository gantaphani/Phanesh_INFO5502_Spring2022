the court functional approach is tied to the common law identification of functions meriting the protection of absolute immunity,but the court precedents have not mechanically duplicated the precise scope of the absolute immunity the common law provided to protect those functions.for example,it was common in for cases to be prosecuted by private parties,who did not enjoy absolute immunity from suit.but as the prosecutorial function was increasingly assumed by public officials,courts held that public prosecutors,unlike their private predecessors,were absolutely immune from the types of tort claims that an aggrieved or vengeful criminal defendant was most likely to assert.this adaptation of prosecutorial immunity accommodated the special needs of public,as opposed to private,prosecutors.thus,when the issue of prosecutorial immunity under reached this court in imbler pachtman,the court did not simply apply the scope of immunity recognized by courts as of but instead relied substantially on cases extending broad immunity to public prosecutors sued for torts.neither has the court suggested that is simply a federalized amalgamation of claims.the new federal claim created by differs in important ways from torts.accordingly,both the scope of the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity available in actions differ in some respects from the common law.
b a trial witness sued under enjoys absolute immunity from any claim based on his testimony.briscoe lahue.without absolute immunity,the process would be impaired as witnesses might be reluctant to testify,and even a witness who took the stand might be inclined to shade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff for fear of subsequent liability.at.these factors apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses.in both contexts,a witness fear of retaliatory litigation may deprive the tribunal of critical evidence.and in neither context is the deterrent of potential civil liability needed to prevent false testimony because other sanctions,chiefly prosecution for perjury,provide a sufficient deterrent.
for the reasons identified in briscoe,supra,at,there is no reason to distinguish law enforcement witnesses from lay witnesses in actions.and the rule that a grand jury witness has absolute immunity from any claim based on the witness testimony may not be circumvented by claiming that a grand jury witness conspired to present false testimony,or by using evidence of the witness testimony to support any other claim concerning the initiation or maintenance of a prosecution.were it otherwise,a criminal defendant turned civil plaintiff could reframe a claim to attack the preparatory activity such as a preliminary discussion in which the witness relates the substance of his intended testimony rather than the absolutely immune actions themselves.
c petitioner main argument is that under malley briggs,and kalina fletcher,grand jury witnesses who are complaining witnesses are not entitled to absolute immunity.but at the time predecessor was enacted,a complaining witness was a party who procured an arrest and initiated a criminal prosecution.a complaining witness might testify,either before a grand jury or at trial,but testifying was not a necessary characteristic of a complaining witness.thus,testifying,whether before a grand jury or at trial,was not the distinctive function performed by a complaining witness.a complaining witness can not be held liable for perjurious trial testimony,see briscoe,at,and there is no more reason why a complaining witness should be subject to liability for testimony before a grand jury.
once the distinctive function performed by a complaining witness is understood,it is apparent that a law enforcement officer who testifies before a grand jury is not comparable to a complaining witness because it is not the officer who makes the critical decision to press criminal charges,but the prosecutor.it would be anomalous to permit a police officer testifying before a grand jury to be sued for maliciously procuring an unjust prosecution when it is the prosecutor,who is shielded by absolute immunity,who is actually responsible for the decision to initiate a prosecution.petitioner also contends that the deterrent effect of civil liability is more needed in grand jury proceedings because trial witnesses face.but the force of that argument is more than offset by the problem that allowing such civil actions would create subversion of grand jury secrecy,which is essential to the proper functioning of the grand jury system.see united states sells engineering.and finally,contrary to petitioner suggestion,recognizing absolute immunity for grand jury witnesses does not create an insupportable distinction between states that use grand juries and states that permit felony prosecutions to be brought by complaint or information.most states that do not require an indictment for felonies provide a preliminary hearing at which witnesses testify,and the lower courts have held that preliminary hearing witnesses are protected by the same immunity accorded grand jury witnesses.

charles rehberg,petitioner james paulk 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
this case requires us to decide whether a complaining witness in a grand jury proceeding is entitled to the same immunity in an action under as a witness who testifies at trial.we see no sound reason to draw a distinction for this purpose between grand jury and trial witnesses.
petitioner charles rehberg,a certified public accountant,sent anonymous faxes to several recipients,including the management of a hospital in albany,georgia,criticizing the hospital management and activities.in response,the local district attorney office,with the assistance of its chief investigator,respondent james paulk,launched a criminal investigation of petitioner,allegedly as a favor to the hospital leadership.
respondent testified before a grand jury,and petitioner was then indicted for aggravated assault,burglary,and six counts of making harassing telephone calls.the indictment charged that petitioner had assaulted a hospital physician,james hotz,after unlawfully entering the doctor home.petitioner challenged the sufficiency of the indictment,and it was dismissed.
a few months later,respondent returned to the grand jury,and petitioner was indicted again,this time for assaulting hotz on august,and for making harassing phone calls.on this occasion,both the doctor and respondent testified.petitioner challenged the sufficiency of this second indictment,claiming that he was nowhere near hotz on the date in question and that t here was no evidence whatsoever that he committed an assault on anybody.again,the indictment was dismissed.
while the second indictment was still pending,respondent appeared before a grand jury for a third time,and yet another indictment was returned.petitioner was charged with assault and making harassing phone calls.this final indictment was ultimately dismissed as well.
petitioner then brought this action against respondent under stat.petitioner alleged that respondent conspired to present and did present false testimony to the grand jury.respondent moved to dismiss,arguing,among other things,that he was entitled to absolute immunity for his grand jury testimony.the united states district court for the middle district of georgia denied respondent motion to dismiss,but the court of appeals reversed,holding,in accordance with circuit precedent,that respondent was absolutely immune from a claim based on his grand jury testimony.
the court of appeals noted petitioner allegation that respondent was the sole complaining witness before the grand jury,but the court of appeals declined to recognize a complaining witness exception to its precedent on grand jury witness immunity.see,at.a llowing civil suits for false grand jury testimony,the court reasoned,would emasculate the confidential nature of grand jury testimony,and eviscerate the traditional absolute immunity for witness testimony in judicial proceedings.at.the court went on to hold that respondent was entitled to absolute immunity,not only with respect to claims based directly on his grand jury testimony,but also with respect to the claim that he conspired to present such testimony,at.to allow liability to be predicated on the alleged conspiracy,the court concluded,would be to permit through the back door what is prohibited through the front.ibid.quoting jones cannon.
we granted certiorari to resolve a circuit conflict regarding the immunity of a complaining witness in a grand jury proceeding,and we now affirm.
section,which derives from of the civil rights act of,stat,creates a private right of action to vindicate violations of rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.under the terms of the statute,e very person who acts under color of state law to deprive another of a constitutional right is answerable to that person in a suit for damages.imbler pachtman,citing.
despite the broad terms of,this court has long recognized that the statute was not meant to effect a radical departure from ordinary tort law and the immunities applicable in tort suits.see,burns reed.more than years ago,in tenney brandhove,the court held that did not abrogate the absolute immunity enjoyed by legislators for actions taken within the legitimate sphere of legislative authority.immunities well grounded in history and reason,the court wrote,were not somehow eliminated by covert inclusion in the general language of,at.
this interpretation has been reaffirmed by the court time and again and is now an entrenched feature of our jurisprudence.see,pierson ray,the legislative record gives no clear indication that congress meant to abolish wholesale all immunities.accordingly,this court held that the immunity of legislators for acts within the legislative role was not abolished.the immunity of judges for acts within the judicial role is equally well established,and we presume that congress would have specifically so provided had it wished to abolish the doctrine imbler,supra,at statute must be read in harmony with general principles of tort immunities and defenses rather than in derogation of them procunier navarette,although the court has recognized that in enacting congress must have intended to expose state officials to damages liability in some circumstances,the section has been consistently construed as not intending wholesale revocation of the immunity afforded government officials briscoe lahue,it is by now well settled that the tort liability created by can not be understood in a historical vacuum.one important assumption underlying the court decisions in this area is that members of the congress were familiar with principles,including defenses previously recognized in ordinary tort litigation,and that they likely intended these principles to obtain,absent specific provisions to the contrary quoting newport fact concerts,pulliam allen,the starting point in our own analysis is the common law.our cases have proceeded on the assumption that principles of immunity were incorporated into our judicial system and that they should not be abrogated absent clear legislative intent to do so 
recognizing that congress intended to be construed in the light of principles,the court has looked to the common law for guidance in determining the scope of the immunities available in a action.kalina fletcher.we do not simply make our own judgment about the need for immunity.we have made it clear that it is not our role to make a freewheeling policy choice,malley briggs,and that we do not have a license to create immunities based solely on our view of sound policy,see tower glover.instead,we conduct a considered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant official at common law and the interests behind it.imbler,supra,at.
we take what has been termed a functional approach.see forrester white,burns,supra,at.we consult the common law to identify those governmental functions that were historically viewed as so important and vulnerable to interference by means of litigation that some form of absolute immunity from civil liability was needed to ensure that they are performed with independence and without fear of consequences.pierson,supra,at quoting bradley fisher,wall.taking this approach,we have identified the following functions that are absolutely immune from liability for damages under actions taken by legislators within the legitimate scope of legislative authority,see tenney,supra actions taken by judges within the legitimate scope of judicial authority,see pierson,supra actions taken by prosecutors in their role as advocates,see imbler,at and the giving of testimony by witnesses at trial,see briscoe,supra.by contrast,the court has found no absolute immunity for the acts of the chief executive officer of a state,the senior and subordinate officers of a state national guard,the president of a state university,see scheuer rhodes,school board members,see wood strickland,the superintendent of a state hospital,see donaldson,police officers,see pierson,supra,at prison officials and officers,procunier,supra,at and private of a judge,see dennis sparks.
while the court functional approach is tied to the common law identification of the functions that merit the protection of absolute immunity,the court precedents have not mechanically duplicated the precise scope of the absolute immunity that the common law provided to protect those functions.see,burns,at t he precise contours of official immunity need not mirror the immunity at common law quoting anderson creighton.
this approach is illustrated by the court analysis of the absolute immunity enjoyed today by public prosecutors.when predecessor was enacted in,it was common for criminal cases to be prosecuted by private parties.see,stewart sonneborn,bradley,dissenting e very man in the community,if he has probable cause for prosecuting another,has a perfect right,by law,to institute such prosecution,subject only,in the case of private prosecutions,to the penalty of paying the costs if he fails in his suit and private prosecutors,like private plaintiffs in civil suits,did not enjoy absolute immunity from suit.see malley,at,and citing cases.instead,the generally accepted rule was that a private complainant who procured an arrest or prosecution could be held liable in an action for malicious prosecution if the complainant acted with malice and without probable cause.see,at see also briscoe,at marshall,dissenting both english and american courts routinely permitted plaintiffs to bring actions alleging that the defendant had made a false and malicious accusation of a felony to a magistrate or other judicial officer wheeler nesbitt,how,undoubtedly,every person who puts the criminal law in force maliciously,and without any reasonable or probable cause,commits a wrongful act and if the accused is thereby prejudiced,either in his person or property,the injury and loss so sustained constitute the proper foundation of an action to recover compensation dinsman wilkes,how,no immunity where a party had maliciously,and without probable cause,procured the plaintiff to be indicted or arrested for an offence of which he was not guilty 
in the decades after the adoption of the civil rights act,however,the prosecutorial function was increasingly assumed by public officials,and courts held that public prosecutors,unlike their private predecessors,were absolutely immune from the types of tort claims that an aggrieved or vengeful criminal defendant was most likely to assert,namely,claims for malicious prosecution or defamation.see imbler,supra,at white,concurring in judgment kalina,supra,at,noting that cases decided after granted a broader immunity to public prosecutors than had been available in malicious prosecution actions against private persons who brought prosecutions at early common law see also burns,supra,at scalia,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part noting that the tradition of prosecutorial immunity developed much later than 
this adaptation of prosecutorial immunity accommodated the special needs of public,as opposed to private,prosecutors.because the daily function of a public prosecutor is to bring criminal charges,tort claims against public prosecutors could be expected with some frequency,for a defendant often will transform his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions to the state advocate.imbler,at.such harassment by unfounded litigation would cause a deflection of the prosecutor energies from his public duties,and would result in a severe interference with the administration of an important public office,at.constant vulnerability to vexatious litigation would give rise to the possibility that the prosecutor would shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust.ibid.
thus,when the issue of prosecutorial immunity under reached this court in imbler,the court did not simply apply the scope of immunity recognized by courts as of but instead placed substantial reliance on cases extending broad immunity to public prosecutors sued for torts.
while the court has looked to the common law in determining the scope of the absolute immunity available under,the court has not suggested that is simply a federalized amalgamation of claims,an federal claim encompassing the torts of assault,trespass,false arrest,defamation,malicious prosecution,and more.the new federal claim created by differs in important ways from those torts.it is broader in that it reaches constitutional and statutory violations that do not correspond to any previously known tort.see kalina,at.but it is narrower in that it applies only to tortfeasors who act under color of state law.see briscoe,supra,at.section ha s no precise counterpart in state law i t is the purest coincidence when state statutes or the common law provide for equivalent remedies any analogies to those causes of action are bound to be imperfect.wilson garcia,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,both the scope of the new tort and the scope of the absolute immunity available in actions differ in some respects from the common law.
at common law,trial witnesses enjoyed a limited form of absolute immunity for statements made in the course of a judicial proceeding they had complete immunity against slander and libel claims,even if it was alleged that the statements in question were maliciously false.kalina,supra,at scalia,concurring citing hilliard,law of torts see briscoe,supra,at marshall,dissenting burns,at opinion of scalia.
in briscoe,however,this court held that the immunity of a trial witness sued under is broader in such a case,a trial witness has absolute immunity with respect to any claim based on the witness testimony.when a witness is sued because of his testimony,the court wrote,the claims of the individual must yield to the dictates of public policy.at quoting calkins sumner.without absolute immunity for witnesses,the court concluded,the process at trial would be impaired.witnesses might be reluctant to come forward to testify,and even if a witness took the stand,the witness might be inclined to shade his testimony in favor of the potential plaintiff for fear of subsequent liability.at.
the factors that justify absolute immunity for trial witnesses apply with equal force to grand jury witnesses.in both contexts,a witness fear of retaliatory litigation may deprive the tribunal of critical evidence.and in neither context is the deterrent of potential civil liability needed to prevent perjurious testimony.in briscoe,the court concluded that the possibility of civil liability was not needed to deter false testimony at trial because other sanctions chiefly prosecution for perjury provided a sufficient deterrent,at.since perjury before a grand jury,like perjury at trial,is a serious criminal offense,see,a,there is no reason to think that this deterrent is any less effective in preventing false grand jury testimony.
neither is there any reason to distinguish law enforcement witnesses from lay witnesses.in briscoe,it was argued that absolute immunity was not needed for witnesses,but the court refused to draw that distinction.the court wrote 
when a police officer appears as a witness,he may reasonably be viewed as acting like any other witness sworn to tell the truth in which event he can make a strong claim to witness immunity alternatively,he may be regarded as an official performing a critical role in the judicial process,in which event he may seek the benefit afforded to other governmental participants in the same proceeding.nothing in the language of the statute suggests that such a witness belongs in a narrow,special category lacking protection against damages suits.at footnote omitted.
see also,at a police officer on the witness stand performs the same functions as any other witness 
the briscoe court rebuffed two arguments for distinguishing between law enforcement witnesses and lay witnesses for immunity purposes first,that absolute immunity is not needed for law enforcement witnesses because they are less likely to be intimidated by the threat of suit and,second,that such witnesses should not be shielded by absolute immunity because false testimony by a police officer is likely to be more damaging than false testimony by a lay witness.see ibid.the court observed that there are other factors not applicable to lay witnesses that weigh in favor of extending absolute immunity to police officer witnesses.
first,police officers testify with some frequency,at.police officers testify in scores of cases every year,the court noted,and defendants often will transform resentment at being convicted into allegations of perjury by the state official witnesses.ibid.if police officer witnesses were routinely forced to defend against claims based on their testimony,their energy and attention would be diverted from the pressing duty of enforcing the criminal law.at quoting imbler,at.
second,a police officer witness potential liability,if conditioned on the exoneration of the accused,could influence decisions on appeal and collateral relief,at.needless to say,such decisions should not be influenced by the likelihood of a subsequent civil rights action.but the possibility that a decision favorable to the accused might subject a police officer witness to liability would create the risk of injecting extraneous concerns into appellate review and postconviction proceedin
