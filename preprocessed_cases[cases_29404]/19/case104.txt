jonathan edward boyer,petitioner louisiana 
on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of louisiana,third circuit 
justice alito,with whom justice scalia and justice thomas join,concurring.
we granted certiorari in this case to decide w hether a state failure to fund counsel for an indigent defendant for five years,particularly where failure was the direct result of the prosecution choice to seek the death penalty,should be weighed against the state for speedy trial purposes.pet.for cert.i.the premise of that question is that a breakdown in louisiana system for paying the attorneys representing petitioner,an indigent defendant who was charged with a capital offense,caused most of the lengthy delay between his arrest and trial.because the record shows otherwise,i agree that the writ of certiorari was improvidently granted.
in february,petitioner and his brother were hitchhiking in calcasieu parish,louisiana.petitioner robbed and murdered a driver who picked them up.after enlisting his brother to help him cover up the crime,petitioner fled to florida,where he was captured about a month later.the evidence of petitioner guilt was overwhelming.he gave the police a detailed statement describing the murder his brother,an eyewitness,agreed to testify about the crime multiple other members of petitioner family told police that they had heard petitioner confess and petitioner fingerprints were found in the victim truck.
louisiana prosecutors announced that they would seek the death penalty,and the state court appointed thomas lorenzi,an experienced trial attorney,to serve as petitioner primary defense counsel.for the next five years,lorenzi led petitioner defense,but he was assisted at all times by at least one highly credentialed but less experienced attorney from the louisiana capital assistance center lcac.
the attorneys from the lcac were paid by the state,but there was confusion about which branch of the state government was responsible for paying lorenzi fees.the trial court promptly scheduled a hearing on that preliminary matter,but the hearing was repeatedly put off at the urging of the defense.over the course of more than three years,the defense requested that the hearing be continued on eight separate occasions,causing a total delay of approximately months.the trial court also issued several other continuances without any objection from the defense,delaying the hearing an additional months.and just when it seemed that the hearing would finally be held,hurricane rita forced the calcasieu parish courthouse to close.
the trial court held the hearing on march,and at that time it became clear that lorenzi fees could not be fully paid until the start of the next fiscal year.ten months later,the state broke the resulting impasse by announcing that it would no longer seek the death penalty.that greatly reduced the complexity and cost of petitioner defense and allowed his case to proceed.lorenzi withdrew,and attorneys from the lcac accepted the role of lead counsel.
from that point,the case proceeded at a plodding pace.petitioner filed voluminous pretrial motions,took multiple interlocutory appeals,and twice demanded the recusal of the trial judge.the trial court halted proceedings for months after concluding that petitioner was temporarily incompetent to stand trial.at last,despite petitioner contention that he needed still more time to prepare,the trial began on september.a jury found petitioner guilty of murder and armed robbery.
in sum,the record shows that the single largest share of the delay in this case was the direct result of defense requests for continuances,that other defense motions caused substantial additional delay,and that much of the rest of the delay was caused by events beyond anyone control.it is also quite clear that the delay caused by the defense likely worked in petitioner favor.the state court observed that petitioner assertions of his speedy trial right were more perfunctory than aggressive.app.cir,so.and what started out as a very strong case of murder ended up,after much delay,in a conviction for lesser offenses.
the dissent would ignore what the record plainly shows based largely on the louisiana court of appeals observation that t he majority of the delay was caused by the lack of funding.at.see post,at,opinion of sotomayor.but when this statement is read in context,what it most likely means is not that the delay in question was caused by the state failure to provide funding but simply that the delay was attributable to the funding issue.and as noted,most of this delay was caused by the many defense requests for continuances of hearings on the issue of funding.if the defense had not sought and obtained those continuances,the trial might well have commenced at a much earlier date and might have reached a conclusion far less favorable to the defense.
we have before us the same record that was before the court of appeals,and the record simply does not support the proposition that much let alone most of the delay was caused by the state failure to fund the defense.having taken up this case on the basis of a mistaken factual premise,i agree with the court decision to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.
sotomayor,dissenting 
jonathan edward boyer,petitioner louisiana 
on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of louisiana,third circuit 
justice sotomayor,with whom justice ginsburg,justice breyer,and justice kagan join,dissenting.
jonathan boyer waited in jail for more than seven years from the date of his arrest until the day his case went to trial.the louisiana court of appeal rejected boyer claim that this delay violated his right to a speedy trial.in doing so,the court found that most of the delay in boyer case was caused by the state failure to pay for his defense due to a funding crisis experienced by the state of louisiana.app.cir,so.nevertheless,the court did not weigh that part of the delay against the state in assessing the merits of boyer claim,reasoning that it was out of the state control.at.
we granted certiorari to decide whether a delay caused by a state failure to fund counsel for an indigent defense should be weighed against the state in determining whether there was a deprivation of a defendant sixth amendment right to a speedy trial.rather than dismiss the writ as improvidently granted,i would simply address this question.our precedents provide a clear answer such a delay should weigh against the state.it is important for states to understand that they have an obligation to protect a defendant constitutional right to a speedy trial.i respectfully dissent.
the decision below describes the facts as follows.on february,boyer and his brother were walking by the side of the road in sulphur,louisiana.bradlee marsh stopped his truck and gave the two men a ride.once inside the truck,boyer demanded money.when marsh refused,boyer shot him three times in the head and then took some cash and a silver chain from his person.marsh eventually died of his wounds.on march,boyer was arrested in jacksonville,florida,and was indicted in louisiana for murder on june,in violation of.stat.ann.west.louisiana sought the death penalty.
boyer filed a motion to determine the source of funds for his defense in november.a hearing on the motion was held on august,which was continued until a later date.from that point on,the only matters that came before the trial court concerned the source of funding.so,at.boyer and the state filed numerous continuances over the next two years that further postponed the funding hearing.
on july,boyer filed a motion to quash the indictment as a violation of his right to a speedy trial under the louisiana constitution,the state speedy trial statute,and the sixth amendment this hearing was itself postponed.among other things,disruptions caused by hurricanes katrina and rita resulted in further delay.when a hearing on the motion to quash was finally held,defense counsel moved to dismiss boyer federal speedy trial claim without prejudice the trial court denied the motion on november,r
