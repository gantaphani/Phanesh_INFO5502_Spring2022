john ashcroft,petitioner abdullah 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we decide whether a former attorney general enjoys immunity from suit for allegedly authorizing federal prosecutors to obtain valid warrants for detention of terrorism suspects whom they would otherwise lack probable cause to arrest.
the federal statute authorizes judges to order the arrest of a person whose testimony is material in a criminal proceeding if it is shown that it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena.material witnesses enjoy the same constitutional right to pretrial release as other federal detainees,and federal law requires release if their testimony can adequately be secured by deposition,and if further detention is not to prevent a failure of justice.ibid.
because this case arises from a motion to dismiss,we accept as true the factual allegations in abdullah complaint.the complaint alleges that,in the aftermath of the september terrorist attacks,general john ashcroft authorized federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials to use the statute to detain individuals with suspected ties to terrorist organizations.it is alleged that federal officials had no intention of calling most of these individuals as witnesses,and that they were detained,at ashcroft direction,because federal officials suspected them of supporting terrorism but lacked sufficient evidence to charge them with a crime.
it is alleged that this pretextual detention policy led to the arrest of,a united states citizen.fbi agents apprehended him in march as he checked in for a flight to saudi arabia.two days earlier,federal officials had informed a magistrate judge that,if boarded his flight,they believed information crucial to the prosecution of sami omar would be lost.app.remained in federal custody for days and on supervised release until trial concluded months later.prosecutors never called him as a witness.
in march,filed this bivens action,see bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,to challenge the constitutionality of ashcroft alleged policy he also asserted several other claims not relevant here against ashcroft and others.ashcroft filed a motion to dismiss based on absolute and qualified immunity,which the district court denied.a divided panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed,holding that the fourth amendment prohibits pretextual arrests absent probable cause of criminal wrongdoing,and that ashcroft could not claim qualified or absolute immunity.see.
judge bea dissented,at,and eight judges dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc,see.we granted certiorari,see.
qualified immunity shields federal and state officials from money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,and that the right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.harlow fitzgerald.we recently reaffirmed that lower courts have discretion to decide which of the two prongs of analysis to tackle first.see pearson callahan.
courts should think carefully before expending scarce judicial resources to resolve difficult and novel questions of constitutional or statutory interpretation that will have no effect on the outcome of the case.at see,at.when,however,a court of appeals does address both prongs of analysis,we have discretion to correct its errors at each step.although not necessary to reverse an erroneous judgment,doing so ensures that courts do not insulate constitutional decisions at the frontiers of the law from our review or inadvertently undermine the values qualified immunity seeks to promote.the former occurs when the question is wrongly decided the latter when what is not clearly established is held to be so.in this case,the court of appeals analysis at both steps of the inquiry needs correction.
the fourth amendment protects t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures.an arrest,of course,qualifies as a seizure of a person under this provision,dunaway new york,and so must be reasonable under the circumstances.does not assert that government officials would have acted unreasonably if they had used a warrant to arrest him for the purpose of securing his testimony for trial.see brief for respondent tr.of oral arg.he contests,however and the court of appeals here rejected,the reasonableness of using the warrant to detain him as a suspected criminal.
fourth amendment reasonableness is predominantly an objective inquiry.edmond,supra,at.we ask whether the circumstances,viewed objectively,justify the challenged action.scott united states.if so,that action was reasonable whatever the subjective intent motivating the relevant officials.whren united states.this approach recognizes that the fourth amendment regulates conduct rather than thoughts,bond united states,and it promotes evenhanded,uniform enforcement of the law,devenpeck alford.
two limited exception s to this rule are our and cases,where actual motivations do matter.united states knights,internal quotation marks omitted.a judicial warrant and probable cause are not needed where the search or seizure is justified by special needs,beyond the normal need for law enforcement,such as the need to deter drug use in public schools,vernonia school dist.acton,internal quotation marks omitted,or the need to assure that railroad employees engaged in train operations are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol,skinner railway labor executives,and where the search or seizure is in execution of an administrative warrant authorizing,for example,an inspection of premises to determine the cause,michigan clifford,plurality opinion,or an inspection of residential premises to assure compliance with a housing code,camara municipal court of city and county of san francisco.but those exceptions do not apply where the officer purpose is not to attend to the special needs or to the investigation for which the administrative inspection is justified.see whren,supra,at.the government seeks to justify the present arrest on the basis of a properly issued judicial warrant so that the and cases can not be the basis for a purpose inquiry here.
apart from those cases,we have almost uniformly rejected invitations to probe subjective intent.see brigham city stuart.there is one category of exception,upon which the court of appeals principally relied.in edmond,we held that the fourth amendment could not condone suspicionless vehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of detecting illegal narcotics.although we had previously approved vehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of keeping off the road unlicensed drivers,delaware prouse,or drivers,michigan of state police sitz,and for the purpose of interdicting those who illegally cross the border,united states,we found the purpose in edmond invalidating because it was ultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control,at.in the court of appeals view,edmond established that programmatic purpose is relevant to fourth amendment analysis of programs of seizures without probable cause.at.
that was mistaken.it was not the absence of probable cause that triggered the inquiry in edmond.to the contrary,edmond explicitly said that it would approve checkpoint stops for general crime control purposes that were based upon merely some quantum of individualized suspicion.at.purpose was relevant in edmond because programmatic purposes may be relevant to the validity of fourth amendment intrusions undertaken pursuant to a general scheme without individualized suspicion,at emphasis added 
needless to say,warrantless,suspicionless intrusions pursuant to a general scheme,at,are far removed from the facts of this case.a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate judge authorized arrest.the affidavit accompanying the warrant application as concedes gave individualized reasons to believe that he was a material witness and that he would soon disappear.the existence of a judicial warrant based on individualized suspicion takes this case outside the domain of not only our and cases,but of edmond as well.
a warrant based on individualized in fact grants more protection against the malevolent and the incompetent than existed in most of our cases eschewing inquiries into intent.in whren,at,and devenpeck,at,we declined to probe the motives behind seizures supported by probable cause but lacking a warrant approved by a detached magistrate.terry ohio,and knights,at,applied an objective standard to warrantless searches justified by a lesser showing of reasonable suspicion.we review even some suspicionless searches for objective reasonableness.see bond,at.if concerns about improper motives and pretext do not justify subjective inquiries in those less protective contexts,we see no reason to adopt that inquiry here.
would read our cases more narrowly.he asserts that whren establishes that we ignore subjective intent only when there exists probable cause to believe that a violation of law has occurred,at which was not the case here.that is a distortion of whren.our unanimous opinion held that we would not look behind an objectively reasonable traffic stop to determine whether racial profiling or a desire to investigate other potential crimes was the real motive.see,at.in the course of our analysis,we dismissed whren reliance on our and cases by explaining that those cases do not endors e the principle that ulterior motives can invalidate police conduct that is justifiable on the basis of probable cause to believe that a violation of law has occurred,at but to say that ulterior motives do not a search that is legitimate because of probable cause to believe a crime has occurred is not to say that it does invalidate all searches that are legitimate for other reasons.
o nly an undiscerning reader,would think otherwise.we referred to probable cause to believe that a violation of law had occurred because that was the legitimating factor in the case at hand.but the analysis of our opinion swept broadly to reject inquiries into motive generally.see,at.we remarked that our and cases are in their concern for pretext,and do nothing more than explain that the exemption from the need for probable cause and warrant,which is accorded to searches made for the purpose of inventory or administrative regulation,is not accorded to searches that are not made for those purposes,at.and our opinion emphasized that we had at that time prior to edmond rejected every request to examine subjective intent outside the narrow context of special needs and administrative inspections.see,at.thus,approach adds an only to a sentence plucked from the whren opinion,and then elevates that sentence as so revised over the remainder of the opinion,and over the consistent holdings of our other cases.
because concedes that individualized suspicion supported the issuance of the arrest warrant and does not assert that his arrest would have been unconstitutional absent the alleged pretextual use of the warrant we find no fourth amendment violation and evenhanded application of the law demands that we look to whether the arrest is objectively justified,rather than to the motive of the arresting officer.
a government official conduct violates clearly established law when,at the time of the challenged conduct,t he contours of a right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton.we do not require a case directly on point,but existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.see malley briggs.the constitutional question in this case falls far short of that threshold.
at the time of arrest,not a single judicial opinion had held that pretext could render an objectively reasonable arrest pursuant to a warrant unconstitutional.a opinion had suggested,in a footnoted dictum devoid of supporting citation,that using such a warrant for preventive detention of suspects is an illegitimate use of the statute implying we accept for the sake of argument that the detention would therefore be unconstitutional.united states awadallah,supp,sdny.the court of appeals thought nothing could have given john ashcroft fair er warning that his conduct violated the fourth amendment,because the footnoted dictum call ed out ashcroft by name at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.we will indulge the assumption though it does not seem to us realistic that justice department lawyers bring to the attorney general personal attention all district judges footnoted speculations that boldly call him out by name.on that assumption,would it prove that for him and for him only it became clearly established that pretextual use of the statute rendered the arrest unconstitutional an extraordinary proposition.even a district judge ipse dixit of a holding is not controlling authority in any jurisdiction,much less in the entire united states and his ipse dixit of a footnoted dictum falls far short of what is necessary absent controlling authority a robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority.wilson layne.
the court of appeals other cases clearly establishing the constitutional violation are,of course,those we rejected as irrelevant in our discussion of whether there was any constitutional violation at all.and the court of appeals reference to those cases here makes the same error of assuming that purpose is only disregarded when there is probable cause to suspect a violation of law.
the court of appeals also found clearly established law lurking in the broad history and purposes of the fourth amendment.at.we have repeatedly told courts and the ninth circuit in particular,see brosseau haugen,per curiam not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.see also,wilson,supra,at anderson,supra,at sawyer smith.the general proposition,for example,that an unreasonable search or seizure violates the fourth amendment is of little help in determining whether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.see saucier katz,wilson,supra,at.
the same is true of the court of appeals broad historical assertions.the fourth amendment was a response to the english crown use of general warrants,which often allowed royal officials to search and seize whatever and whomever they pleased while investigating crimes or affronts to the crown.see stanford texas.according to the court of appeals,ashcroft should have seen that a pretextual warrant similarly gut s the substantive protections of the fourth amendmen t and allows the state to arrest upon the executive mere suspicion.at.
ashcroft must be forgiven for missing the parallel,which escapes us as well.the principal evil of the general warrant was addressed by the fourth amendment particularity requirement,stanford,supra,at,which ashcroft alleged policy made no effort to evade.the warrant authorizing arrest named and only.it might be argued,perhaps,that when,in response to the english abuses,the fourth amendment said that warrants could only issue on probable cause it meant only probable cause to suspect a violation of law,and not probable cause to believe that the individual named in the warrant was a material witness.but that would make all arrests pursuant to warrants unconstitutional,whether pretextual or not and that is not the position taken by in this case.
while featuring a district court footnoted dictum,the court of appeals made no mention of this court affirmation in edmond of the predominan t rule that reasonableness is an objective inquiry,at.nor did it mention whren and knights statements that subjective intent mattered in a very limited subset of our fourth amendment cases or terry objective evaluation of investigatory searches premised on reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause or bond objective evaluation of a suspicionless investigatory search.the court of appeals seems to have the aspects of our opinions that gave colorable support to the proposition that the unconstitutionality of the action here was clearly established.
qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions.when properly applied,it protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley,at.ashcroft deserves neither label,not least because eight court of appeals judges agreed with his judgment in a case of first impression.see wilson,supra,at.he deserves qualified immunity even assuming contrafactually that his alleged detention policy violated the fourth amendment.
we hold that an objectively reasonable arrest and detention of a material witness pursuant to a validly obtained warrant can not be challenged as unconstitutional on the basis of allegations that the arresting authority had an improper motive.because ashcroft did not violate clearly established law,we need not address the more difficult question whether he enjoys absolute immunity.the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

john ashcroft,petitioner abdullah 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kennedy,with whom justice ginsburg,justice breyer,and justice sotomayor join as to part i,concurring.
i join the opinion of the court in full.in holding that the attorney general could be liable for damages based on an unprecedented constitutional rule,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit disregarded the purposes of the of qualified immunity.this concurring opinion makes two additional observations.
the court holding is limited to the arguments presented by the parties and leaves unresolved whether the government use of the material witness statute in this case was lawful.see ante,at noting that does not assert that his arrest would have been unconstitutional absent the alleged pretextual use of the warrant under the statute,a magistrate judge may issue a warrant to arrest someone as a material witness upon a showing by affidavit that the testimony of a person is material in a criminal proceeding and that it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena.the scope of the statute lawful authorization is uncertain.for example,a citizen might observe a crime during the days or weeks before a scheduled flight abroad.it is unclear whether those facts alone might allow police to obtain a material witness warrant on the ground that it may become impracticable to secure the person presence by subpoena.ibid.the question becomes more difficult if one further assumes the traveler would be willing to testify if asked and more difficult still if one supposes that authorities delay obtaining or executing the warrant until the traveler has arrived at the airport.these possibilities resemble the facts in this case.see ante,at.
in considering these issues,it is important to bear in mind that the material witness statute might not provide for the issuance of warrants within the meaning of the fourth amendment warrant clause.the typical arrest warrant is based on probable cause that the arrestee has committed a crime but that is not the standard for the issuance of warrants under the material witness statute.see ante,at reserving the possibility that probable cause for purposes of the fourth amendment warrant clause means only probable cause to suspect a violation of law if material witness warrants do not qualify as warrants under the fourth amendment,then material witness arrests might still be governed by the fourth amendment separate reasonableness requirement for seizures of the person.see united states watson.given the difficulty of these issues,the court is correct to address only the legal theory put before it,without further exploring when material witness arrests might be consistent with statutory and constitutional requirements.
the fact that the attorney general holds a high office in the government must inform what law is clearly established for the purposes of this case.mitchell forsyth.some federal officers perform their functions in a single jurisdiction,say within the of one state or one federal judicial district.they reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability for damages and so are expected to adjust their behavior in accordance with local precedent.davis scherer,see also anderson creighton.in contrast the attorney general occupies a national office and so sets policies implemented in many jurisdictions throughout the country.the official with responsibilities in many jurisdictions may face ambiguous and sometimes inconsistent sources of decisional law.while it may be clear that one court of appeals has approved a certain course of conduct,other courts of appeals may have disapproved it,or at least reserved the issue.
when faced with inconsistent legal rules in different jurisdictions,national officeholders should be given some deference for qualified immunity purposes,at least if they implement policies consistent with the governing law of the jurisdiction where the action is taken.as we have explained,qualified immunity is lost when plaintiffs point either to cases of controlling authority in their jurisdiction at the time of the incident or to a consensus of cases of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer could not have believed that his actions were lawful.wilson layne,see also ante,at.these standards ensure the officer has fair and clear warning of what the constitution requires.united states lanier.
a national officeholder intent on retaining qualified immunity need not abide by the most stringent standard adopted anywhere in the united states.and the national officeholder need not guess at when a relatively small set of appellate precedents have established a binding legal rule.if national officeholders were subject to personal liability whenever they confronted disagreement among appellate courts,those officers would be deterred from full use of their legal authority.the consequences of that deterrence must counsel caution by the judicial branch,particularly in the area of national security.see ashcroft iqbal,slip,at.furthermore,too expansive a view of clearly established law would risk giving local judicial determinations the effect of rules with de facto national significance,contrary to the normal process of ordered appellate review.
the proceedings in this case illustrate these concerns.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit appears to have reasoned that a federal district court sitting in new york had authority to establish a legal rule binding on the attorney general and,therefore,on federal operations conducted nationwide.see.indeed,this case involves a material witness warrant issued in boise,idaho,and an arrest near washington,of course,district court decisions are not precedential to this extent.ante,at.but nationwide security operations should not have to grind to a halt even when an appellate court finds those operations unconstitutional.the doctrine of qualified immunity does not so constrain national officeholders entrusted with urgent responsibilities.

justice ginsburg,with whom justice breyer and justice sotomayor join,concurring in the judgment.
is a former attorney general subject to a suit for damages on a claim that he instructed subordinates to use the material witness statute,as a pretext to detain terrorist suspects preventively given whren united states,i agree with the court that no clearly established law renders ashcroft answerable in damages for the abuse of authority charged.ante,at.but i join justice sotomayor in objecting to the court disposition of fourth amendment claim on the merits as she observes,post,at opinion concurring in judgment,that claim involves novel and trying questions that will have no effect on the outcome of th is case.pearson callahan.
in addressing fourth amendment claim against ashcroft,the court assumes at the outset the existence of a validly obtained material witness warrant.ante,at.that characterization is puzzling.see post,at opinion of sotomayor,is a warrant validly obtained when the affidavit on which it is based fails to inform the issuing magistrate judge that the government has no intention of using as a witness at another trial,post,at,and does not disclose that had cooperated with fbi agents each of the several times they had asked to interview him,app.
casting further doubt on the assumption that the warrant was validly obtained,the magistrate judge was not told that parents,wife,and children were all citizens and residents of the united states.in addition,the affidavit misrepresented that was about to take a flight to saudi arabia,with a ticket costing approximately in fact,had a,ticket that cost given these omissions and misrepresentations,there is strong cause to question the court opening assumption a valid warrant and equally strong reason to conclude that a merits determination was neither necessary nor proper 
i also agree with justice kennedy that treatment presents serious questions,unaddressed by the court,concerning the legality of the government use of the material witness statute in this case.ante,at concurring opinion.in addition to the questions justice kennedy poses,and even if the initial material witness classification had been proper,what even arguably legitimate basis could there be for the harsh custodial conditions to which was subjected ostensibly held only to secure his testimony,was confined in three different detention centers during his days incarceration,kept in cells lit hours a day,and subjected to inspections on more than one occasion,and handcuffed and shackled about his wrists,legs,and waist.app.bell wolfish,l oading a detainee with chains and shackles and throwing him in a dungeon may ensure his presence at trial and preserve the security of the institution.but it would be difficult to conceive of a situation where conditions so harsh,employed to achieve objectives that could be accomplished in so many alternative and less harsh methods,would not support a conclusion that the purpose for which they were imposed was to punish.
however circumscribed bivens claim against ashcroft may have been,see bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,ante,at majority opinion ante,at kennedy,concurring,his remaining claims against the fbi agents who apprehended him invite consideration of the issues justice kennedy identified his challenges to the brutal conditions of his confinement have been settled.but his ordeal is a grim reminder of the need to install safeguards against disrespect for human dignity,constraints that will control officialdom even in perilous times.

whether the fourth amendment permits the pretextual use of a material witness warrant for preventive detention of an individual whom the government has no intention of using at trial is,in my view,a closer question than the majority opinion suggests.although the majority is correct that a government official subjective intent is generally irrelevant in determining whether that officer actions violate the fourth amendment,bond united states,none of our prior cases recognizing that principle involved prolonged detention of an individual without probable cause to believe he had committed any criminal offense.we have never considered whether an official subjective intent matters for purposes of the fourt
