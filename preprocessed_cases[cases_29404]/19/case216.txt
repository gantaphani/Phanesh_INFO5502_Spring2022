christopher coombs strives to persuade us that the district court erred both in denying his multiple motions to suppress incriminating evidence and in fashioning his sentence.we are not convinced and,therefore,affirm.
background 
we rehearse the facts as supportably found by the district court following an omnibus hearing on the appellant several motions to suppress.see united states gamache,cir.united states paneto,cir.
in the wake of his conviction on charges,the appellant was sentenced to a term of immurement to be followed by a term of supervised release.he served his prison sentence but,during his final six months under supervision,he again found himself on the wrong side of the law.
in october of,customs and border protection cbp agents intercepted a package at john kennedy international airport in new york.an air waybill a document completed by the sender that includes the package origin,destination,and a description of its contents accompanied the package.the air waybill indicated that the package was from marry in shanghai and was to be delivered at the appellant residence in westbrook,maine.the contents were described as p olycarbonate.
inspection of the contents revealed an crystal a substance.the agents conducted a chemical field test and received a reading that was positive for methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma,commonly known as ecstasy.a second analysis,conducted in portland,maine,at a department of homeland security dhs facility,detected,a type of synthetic cathinone.synthetic cathinones are colloquially known as bath salts 
on october,dhs agents and local police,in conjunction with the postal service,executed a controlled delivery of the package with the contents safely removed to the appellant at his westbrook address.
while the controlled delivery was underway,the officers sought an anticipatory search warrant for the appellant residence.in support of probable cause,they represented,inter alia,that the substance in the package had tested positive for mdma and.a state magistrate issued the search warrant,with the caveat that it should be executed only if the appellant took the parcel inside his home.
as matters turned out,the appellant accepted the parcel while standing outside the building,and the officers promptly took him to the ground.he was arrested on the spot and never brought the package into his home.the officers described the appellant manner at the time of the detention as nerved up but cooperative.by the time that news of the warrant arrived at the scene,the appellant already had consented to a search of his residence and had signed a form to that effect.
following the appellant arrest,officers transported him to the police station and read him his miranda rights.see miranda arizona.the appellant stated that he had ordered the package and some other shipments from china on behalf of a third party.when packages arrived,the appellant would deliver them to the requesting individual and would be paid for his trouble.the intercepted parcel,he said,represented the largest order that he had placed.when asked if sounded familiar,he responded in the affirmative.
during a search of the appellant residence,officers seized a computer,a tablet,and five cell phones.thereafter,the appellant still in custody exchanged telephone calls with his wife.a standard recording at the beginning of each call warned him that the conversations would be recorded and monitored.when his wife noted that the authorities had taken his electronic gear,he asked her to delete receipts from two accounts and supplied her with the passwords.in a subsequent conversation,the appellant sought to confirm that his wife had not only deleted the receipts but also had emptied the trash folders to make sure they were deleted securely.
in due course,the government sought and received warrants authorizing the search of the five cell phones found at the appellant residence and the two accounts that he had mentioned to his wife.the search of the disclosed several exchanges between the appellant and overseas pharmaceutical companies,in which the appellant,in his own words,solicited apvp or similar products.in addition,he made inquiries as to pricing and quantities and placed several orders.
subsequent to the issuance of the last of the warrants,the seized crystal was subjected to more sophisticated laboratory testing.this testing was conducted at a drug enforcement administration dea laboratory.it revealed,for the first time,that the substance was rather than.although these substances were and are both regulated as controlled substances illegal bath salts the two have different chemical compositions.
at the time of the appellant offensive conduct,was regulated pursuant to the attorney general authority to designate controlled substances temporarily,as needed,in order to avoid imminent hazards to public safety.h see schedules of controlled substances temporary placement of synthetic cathinones into schedule i,fed.reg.on the other hand,was and is regulated as a controlled substance analogue,meaning that it is substantially similar to a controlled substance,a,and thus may be regulated as such if intended for human consumption,see id.see also mcfadden united states,explicating relevant statutory scheme.
on january,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of maine handed up a indictment against the appellant.count one charged possession with intent to distribute,a schedule i controlled substance analogue.see a,a.count two,which focused on the appellant instructions to his wife to delete certain,charged obstruction of justice.see b b.
the appellant maintained his innocence and filed five separate motions to suppress.following an omnibus hearing,the district court ruling in an electronic order deemed the first suppression motion moot and denied the four remaining motions.the appellant thereafter entered a conditional guilty plea to counts one and two,see fed.crim.a,reserving the right to appeal the denial of his quartet of motions to suppress.
without objection,the district court calculated the appellant guideline sentencing range as to months.the court then sentenced the appellant to a concurrent incarcerative term on each count of conviction,to be followed by five years of supervision.at the same time,the court dealt with the appellant admitted violation of his earlier supervised release and imposed a incarcerative sentence for that violation.the court decreed that the sentence would run consecutively to the concurrent sentences imposed with respect to the offenses of conviction.
the appellant moved to modify the judgment.pertinently,he sought to reduce his new term of supervision from five years to three years.the court granted this entreaty in part,reducing the supervised release term for count two to three years the statutory maximum for that count,see a,b.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
in this venue,the appellant challenges the denial of four of his motions to suppress.we address the first two of these motions together and then examine the other two motions separately.thereafter,we scrutinize the appellant claims of sentencing error.
suppression.
we review a district court findings of fact on a motion to suppress for clear error.see united states zapata,cir.this standard requires us to accept not only the court factual findings but also the reasonable inferences drawn from those discerned facts.see paneto,at.questions of law engender de novo review.see zapata,at.
the second and third motions to suppress.the appellant second motion to suppress sought to exclude evidence obtained from the five cell phones found in his residence,and the third motion sought to exclude messages recovered from the appellant two accounts.the appellant argues that there was no showing of probable cause sufficient to justify the search of his cell phones and.
a finding of probable cause does not demand proof beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states hoffman,cir.as relevant here,it demands proof sufficient to support a fair probability that a crime has been committed and that evidence of that crime is likely to be found within the objects to be searched.see united states clark,cir.united states ricciardelli,cir.the district court concluded that the government proffer passed through this screen.the appellant challenge to this conclusion rests on the assertion that the affidavits accompanying the warrant applications contained false information that the crystal in the mailed package was when,in fact,it was.
a criminal defendant may impugn the veracity of an affidavit supporting a search warrant if he can show that a false statement,necessary to a finding of probable cause,was included in the affidavit knowingly and intentionally,or with reckless disregard for the truth.franks delaware.evidence obtained as a result of a warrant will be suppressed if the defendant proves intentional or reckless falsehood by preponderant evidence and the affidavit creditworthy averments are insufficient to establish probable cause.united states tanguay,cir.
in this instance,the challenged affidavits were signed by dhs special agent gary moulton.moulton submitted two affidavits one in support of the search of the five cell phones and the other in support of the search of the two accounts.each of moulton affidavits incorporated an earlier affidavit from a member of the westbrook police department,augustin rodriguez,originally prepared in support of the application for the anticipatory search warrant.see supra note.the appellant does not allege that either moulton or rodriguez intentionally misled the magistrate in order to obtain search warrants.the question reduces,then,to whether the challenged statements in the affidavit were made with reckless disregard for the truth.united states ranney,cir.
hindsight is always and,when viewed in retrospect,the affidavits at some points the contents of the package.as matters turned out,the package did not contain but.it is apodictic,though,that e ven if a warrant issues upon an insufficient showing of probable cause,suppression may be inappropriate if the officers involved have exhibited objective good faith.united states floyd,cir.this makes perfect sense the purpose of suppression is to deter police misconduct,see united states leon,and when law enforcement officers have obtained a search warrant in good faith and acted within its scope,there is nothing to deter,id.at.
even so,recklessness can defeat a claim of good faith.we have explained that when an affiant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his statements or when circumstances evincing obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the allegations were present,the affiant can be said to have crossed the line into recklessness.ranney,at quoting united states williams,cir.accord tanguay,at.in contrast,small inaccuracies in a warrant affidavit do not invalidate the warrant if those inaccuracies result from mistakes.see,united states capozzi,cir.emphasizing importance of leeway for affidavits drafted by nonlawyers under significant time pressure united states brunette,cir.holding that statement that all seized images were pornographic when at least two of were not was misleading,but did not justify suppression.so,too,incorrect assertions made in good faith reliance on a third party errors,or even lies,do not demand suppression.see united states tzannos,cir.nor does sincere reliance on incorrect technical data,even when law enforcement officers themselves are to blame for the bevue.see united states barnett,cir.
here,the government first line of defense is that there was no false statement at all read together,the affidavits simply stated that the crystal had tested positive for mdma and which was in fact true.but this is only part of the story the affidavits referred,several times,to the substance itself as neither the government nor the defendant is entitled to an affidavit,focusing only on portions of the affidavit that are helpful to that party cause and ignoring the remainder.see clark,at stating that the probable cause analysis requires reading supporting affidavits as a whole.by the time of the suppression hearing,the government knew that the crystal had been identified definitively as.yet,a fair reading of the affidavits as a whole shows,with conspicuous clarity,that they featured the assertion,later revealed to be mistaken,that the crystal was.we therefore reject the government claim that there was no false statement at all.
to be sure,the affidavits did misstate a fact.even so,that the affidavits,in hindsight,misstated a fact does not resolve the matter.rodriguez signed his affidavit on october.moulton signed the first of his two affidavits on november.he signed the second affidavit on november.but the crystal was not accepted for testing at the dea laboratory until november,and the results of that testing were not made available to the dhs until december long after all of the search warrants had been issued.
there is not a shred of evidence that,when the affidavits were executed and submitted,either affiant knew or for that matter had any reason to believe that the crystal was not.the affiants mistaken assertion was made neither knowingly nor with reckless disregard for the truth.quite the opposite the affiants relied on the only laboratory test results then available to them results that indicated,albeit preliminarily,the presence of mdma and.the appellant does not allege that these preliminary tests were conducted negligently or that the affiants acted recklessly in relying upon those results.
when all is said and done,the record in this case contains nothing that shows that either affiant had the slightest reason to entertain serious doubts about the accuracy of the available test results.for aught that appears,the affiants incorporated into their affidavits the best information known to them.law enforcement officers who prepare warrant affidavits are expected to use care,but they are not expected to be clairvoyant.that a small portion of the information contained in these affidavits ultimately proved to be mistaken does not vitiate the affiants good faith.see barnett,at.
we could stop here but,for the sake of completeness,we proceed to consider whether the affidavits,even without the statements incorrectly referring to the crystal as,would still demonstrate probable cause.we think that they do.
to begin,the initial laboratory test results would not need to be edited out of the rodriguez affidavit.regardless of what the substance eventually proved to be,it is not false to say that the initial tests returned positive readings for mdma and.thus,the rodriguez affidavit,incorporated in the later moulton affidavits,would still be read to assert,truthfully,that the contents of the package addressed to the appellant tested positive for controlled substances.
moreover,moulton affidavits would continue to state,truthfully,that the appellant accepted delivery of the package and that he asked his wife to delete receipts from his accounts after learning that the police had seized his computer.given these and other statements,we are satisfied that the affidavits,stripped of the false assertion,would still contain enough true facts to establish a fair probability that evidence of a crime would be found through a search of the appellant cell phones and accounts.see tanguay,at.
that ends this aspect of the matter.in the circumstances of this case,the officers good faith is manifest.they gained no advantage by describing the crystal as rather than.both were regulated as controlled substances and,thus,we conclude that the officers reasonably believed that they were dealing with an illicit drug and identified that drug in a way that,though mistaken,did not materially mislead the magistrate.put another way,had the affidavits referred exclusively to,their force would not have been diminished.to cinch the matter,the affidavits,stripped of the false assertion,still make out a robust showing of probable cause.it follows that no error,clear or otherwise,tainted the district court order denying the appellant second and third motions to suppress.
the fourth motion to suppress.consent is a exception to the requirement that police must have a warrant to search one home.see schneckloth bustamonte,united states laine,cir.here,the appellant c
