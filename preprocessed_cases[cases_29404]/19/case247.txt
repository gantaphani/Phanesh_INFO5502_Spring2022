appellant fernando díaz pled guilty to aiding and abetting others in the possession of a firearm that was discharged during a robbery in violation of c a iii and.on appeal,díaz argues that his sentence should be vacated for lack of a factual basis to support his guilty plea.after careful review,we affirm the district court sentence.
background 
the facts of this case are largely undisputed.on september,two employees of the ranger american armored services were driving an armored truck on their normal delivery route.when they arrived at the morovena credit union in morovis,puerto rico to deliver to the bank,they were attacked by several armed robbers who pulled up behind them in a toyota.díaz was one of the robbers.during the course of the heist,one robber struck the employee who had exited the armored truck with the cash in the back of the head,while another robber pointed a magnum at that employee.the employee ultimately threw the bag of money to the ground and one robber picked it up.díaz then grabbed the employee in a from behind and the employee noticed that he,too,was carrying a gun.the robber wielding the magnum then fired shots in the direction of both the employee and díaz.díaz was struck in the left arm and left leg,the employee was shot in the abdomen,and they both collapsed to the ground.another robber fired at the second ranger american employee who had remained inside the armored truck,but he managed to drive away and escape the scene.then the robbers attempted to shoot the remaining wounded employee in the head.fortunately,the robbers were out of ammunition and the employee was able to escape.the robbers,including díaz,then the toyota and drove off,but were later apprehended by authorities.
on march,the government filed a superseding indictment charging díaz with aiding and abetting others in the robbery of a bank armored truck in violation of and count one and with carrying and using a firearm that was discharged during and in relation to the robbery in violation of c a and count two.count two did not actually use the words aiding and abetting as count one did however,it did cite to the aiding and abetting statute at which specifically provides that w hoever commits an offense against the united states or aids,abets,counsels,commands,induces or procures its commission,is punishable as a principal.
on october,the parties entered into a plea agreement the agreement.by the precise terms of the agreement,díaz agreed to plead guilty to count one,which charge d that díaz,aiding and abetting others,did obstruct,delay,and affect commerce,and the movement of articles and commodities in such commerce,by robbery in violation of and.díaz also agreed to plead guilty to count two,which charge d that díaz,aiding and abetting others,did knowingly carry and use a firearm,which firearm was discharged,during and in relation to the robbery charged in count one.the parties also agreed to the statutory penalties applicable to both counts.in relevant part,the parties agreed that count one had a statutory maximum imprisonment term of no more than twenty years or months pursuant to.the parties also agreed that count two had a mandatory minimum term of not less than ten years or months and a potential maximum of life imprisonment pursuant to c a iii.
for the purposes of calculating díaz sentence under the united states sentencing guidelines manual guidelines,the parties further agreed to a total offense level of for count one,made no determination as to the applicable criminal history category,and agreed that count two was subject to a or ten year mandatory minimum to run consecutively to count one.the agreement also contained a clause which provided that díaz knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal the judgment and sentence in his case,provided that he was sentenced in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the sentencing recommendation provisions of the agreement.
on october,díaz pled guilty to both counts of the indictment and on february,finding an applicable criminal history category of iii and a total offense level of,the court sentenced díaz in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement to months as to count one and another months as to count two,to be served consecutively.díaz did not challenge the court sentencing nor did he attempt to withdraw his guilty plea.
díaz now appeals his sentence,arguing that the court incorrectly sentenced him to months as to count two díaz does not challenge the court sentence as to count one.díaz argues that although he signed a plea agreement with a clause and was sentenced in accordance with that agreement,his sentence on count two should be reversed because the court did not properly calculate the applicable guidelines range.specifically,díaz argues that there was an insufficient factual basis for the court acceptance of his guilty plea as to count two.
discussion 
before turning to the merits of this appeal,we pause to note that the agreement contained a provision that foreclosed any appeal so long as díaz was sentenced in accordance with the agreement terms.accordingly,the government argues that because díaz was sentenced in accordance with the terms of his plea agreement,he has waived his right to appeal.díaz contends that his arguments on appeal are not within the scope of the clause because the district court improperly calculated the applicable guidelines range.we need not tarry with the parties waiver arguments.because díaz claims can be easily resolved on the merits,we assume arguendo that the provision does not bar maintenance of his appeal.see united states,cir.
here,díaz primary contention is that the district court erred in accepting his guilty plea with regards to count two because there was no factual basis for the intent element of the aiding and abetting charge to which he pled guilty.because díaz did not present the issue of an insufficient factual basis to the district court,he now faces the heavy burden of review and must demonstrate that a clear error occurred,which affected his substantial rights and seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states,cir.alterations in original quoting united states,cir.díaz can make no such showing.
our inquiry is guided by both rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure and the aiding and abetting statute.federal rule of criminal procedure b requires that a court determine the factual basis for a guilty plea prior to entering judgment on that plea.under rule,the necessary showing for the factual basis requirement is fairly modest and the evidence need not conclusively demonstrate guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,at citing united states pimentel,cir.indeed,the government need only show a rational basis in fact for the defendant guilt.id.citing pimentel,at united states,cir.t he government is also not required to support every element of the charged crime by direct evidence and a district court may infer t he factual predicate for the requisite mens rea from all the evidence alluded to at the rule hearing.id.
a person is liable under for aiding and abetting a crime if and only if he takes an affirmative act in furtherance of that offense,with the intent of facilitating the offense commission.rosemond united states.in rosemond,the supreme court held that in order to meet the intent requirement when accusing a defendant of aiding or abetting a c offense,the government must show that the defendant actively participated in the underlying drug trafficking or violent crime with advance knowledge that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the crime commission.id.at.the supreme court defined advance knowledge as knowledge at a time the accomplice can do something with it most notably,opt to walk away.id.at.
relying on rosemond,díaz argues that there was an insufficient showing that he had advance knowledge that his fellow robbers would carry or discharge firearms during the robbery and therefore there was an insufficient factual basis to support the intent requirement of the aiding and abetting offense.the government argues that there was a sufficient factual basis to satisfy the intent element of the aiding and abetting statute.
during díaz colloquy,the court detailed the charges to which díaz was pleading guilty.with regard to the relevant aiding and abetting count count two the following exchange took place 
the court and count two charges that you knowingly carried and used a firearm and that the firearm was discharged during and in relation to a crime of violence for which you may be prosecuted in the court of the united states,which was the interference with commerce and robbery that is set forth in count one,and aiding and abetting others to do that.
as to count two,díaz,is that what did you sic 
díaz yes,sir.
the court is that what you are pleading guilty to 
díaz yes,sir.
the court the maximum and minimum punishment that the law provides for the offenses to which you want to plead guilty are as follows 
so,díaz,for count two,the term of imprisonment,as i told you is not less than years,months,and can go up to life imprisonment.
do you understand all those serious possible consequences of your plea of guilty 
díaz yes,sir.
the government then described the facts and evidence it would have presented at trial to prove its case namely that díaz was an accomplice involved in the armored truck robbery that several robbers,including díaz himself possessed weapons during the course of the robbery that at least two weapons,including a magnum and a rifle,were discharged and in fact injured a victim during the robbery and that díaz partook in and facilitated the robbery until the very end when the robbers fled the scene.
the district court then asked díaz whether he agree d with the government version of the facts.he responded that he agreed and admitted to committing the crime as described by the prosecutor.
in light of his factual concessions,we find that there was a sufficient basis to support the requisite intent for aiding and abetting possession of a firearm that was discharged during the course of the robbery.a s long as the government proffered facts,conceded by the defendant to be true,touch all the bases,there is a sufficient factual basis for the tendered plea.united states jiminez,cir.and t he facts relevant to the rule factual basis inquiry may be gleaned either from the defendant admissions or from the prosecution version of the evidence to the extent that it is acknowledged by the defendant.id.at.
here,díaz agreed with the statement of facts presented by the government both at his hearing and within his signed plea agreement.he admitted that he was in a vehicle with confederates all of whom possessed weapons,including a magnum and a rifle and that they robbed an armored truck.he admitted that he himself possessed a weapon that was brandished during the robbery and that his armed confederates discharged their weapons from the moment they exited their vehicle until they ran out of ammunition or drove away from the crime scene.díaz also conceded that he held one of the victims of the robbery in a while a fellow robber opened fire on the victim and díaz.after the victim was hit,and even after díaz himself had been wounded,díaz conceded that he remained in confederation with his fellow robbers,one of whom used his rifle to shoot at a second victim.after both victims eventually escaped,díaz entered the same vehicle he arrived in with his fellow confederates and fled the crime scene.these concessions form a rational basis for accepting díaz guilty plea and make díaz arguments that he did not know that his confederates possessed and planned to use their weapons highly unlikely.see united states laracuent,cir.suggesting that where a defendant agreed that he himself knowingly and unlawfully possessed firearms used in furtherance of a offense,his arguments that he lacked advance knowledge that one of his confederates would carry a gun were particularly flimsy.
at the very least,even if díaz was unaware that his confederates possessed and intended to discharge their weapons prior to arriving at the crime scene,either after his armed confederates began shooting at the victims upon exit from their vehicle or certainly after a fellow robber used his weapon to shoot at a victim who díaz restrained in a or,again,after another robber used his rifle to shoot at a second victim,díaz was afforded ample opportunities upon which he possessed the knowledge necessary to enable him to make the relevant legal and indeed,moral choice.rosemond,at.indeed,he possessed the relevant knowledge at a time he could do something with it most notably,opt to walk away.id.at.yet,despite obtaining the requisite knowledge regarding his confederates possession and use of weapons in sufficient time to withdraw from the crime in multiple instances,díaz simply chose otherwise.
based on díaz own concessions,the district court properly concluded that the government had proffered sufficient facts to form a rational basis from which to infer that díaz possessed the requisite intent for his guilty plea.see,at.
before concluding,we tie up some loose ends raised by díaz himself.despite being represented by competent counsel,díaz requested and was granted permission to file a supplemental pro se brief.in that brief,díaz argues that he was not placed on sufficient notice that he was pleading guilty to an aiding and abetting charge the indictment was fatally defective because it did not include the aiding and abetting statutory language in count two the district court failed to take into account his age at sentencing and the district court erred in failing to grant him a downward departure due to his physical injuries.like those of his counsel,díaz pro se arguments are equally unavailing.
first,the unambiguous terms of the plea agreement itself make clear that díaz agreed to plead guilty to aiding and abetting others who carried and used a discharged weapon during the course of the robbery count two.in the context,the text of the plea agreement and the content of the colloquy are critically important to a determination of knowledge and volition.united states teeter,cir.here,despite díaz contentions,both the text of the plea agreement and the record of the colloquy demonstrate that he knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty to aiding and abetting others in the use of a discharged firearm during and in relation to the robbery count two.
and while the facts as described by the government,and affirmed by díaz,contained no mention of his gun being discharged,there can be no confusion that díaz clearly pled guilty to aiding and abetting others whose firearms were discharged,as the district court clearly indicated such during the colloquy.
next,díaz contention that the indictment was fatally defective because it did not include the aiding and abetting statutory language also fails.the indictment did explicitly cite the aiding and abetting statute.absent any unfair surprise,that was more than enough.see united states sanchez,cir.aiding and abetting is an alternative charge in every count,whether explicit or implicit.quoting united states mcknight,cir.accordingly,the indictment here was more than sufficient when it clearly indicated that díaz was being charged pursuant to the aiding and abetting statute.
díaz also argues that the district court ignored a factors because it failed to consider his age at sentencing.to the contrary,the record demonstrates that the court fully considered díaz age,noting that he was over years old,had a seventh grade education,and that he was a father of three children and a grandfather of four.that díaz would prefer an alternative weighing of the circumstances and specifically his age does not undermine the district court sentencing decision.see united states rossignol,cir.
lastly,díaz argues that the district court should have granted him a downward departure because of his physical impairments under of the guidelines,which provides that a n extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to depart downward.as a general rule,a district court refusal to grant a downward departure is not appealable unless the sentencing court decision not to depart is ba
