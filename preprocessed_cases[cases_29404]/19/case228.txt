on august,josé díaz was indicted in the united states district court for the southern district of florida for his role in planning and organizing a maritime smuggling operation involving over kilograms of cocaine.five days later,díaz was indicted again this time,in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico for his role in planning and organizing a maritime smuggling operation involving over kilograms of cocaine.díaz contends that the double jeopardy clause of the united states constitution bars his prosecution on the puerto rico charges because the florida charges already encompass the conduct for which he was indicted in puerto rico.for the reasons set forth below,we reject this challenge and affirm the decision of the district court to deny díaz motion to dismiss the puerto rico indictment on double jeopardy grounds.
because díaz double jeopardy challenge to the puerto rico indictment hinges in part on the procedural history of the florida case,we first need to describe the two indictments and their subsequent travel in some detail.we will then be well positioned to explain why we are unpersuaded that the puerto rico indictment must be dismissed on double jeopardy grounds.
on august,federal agents intercepted a vessel carrying approximately kilograms of cocaine off the coast of guayama,puerto rico the vessel was registered to díaz,who had rented a dock for it in fajardo,puerto rico.the government later determined that díaz also hired the vessel crew jorge and joel.although díaz was not on board at the time of its seizure,he and another individual were responsible for following behind the vessel in a separate boat.
roughly five months later,on december,federal authorities intercepted a second vessel off the coast of croix,united states virgin islands this one carrying approximately kilograms of cocaine.this vessel had a different crew josé de león and wilson concepción.díaz had purchased this second vessel.he also had directed an associate who later became a confidential source of the broward county,florida,sherriff office to purchase two outboard motors for it.
the december seizure formed the basis for a indictment filed against díaz in the united states district court for the southern district of florida on august.díaz was charged with one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine,in violation of and b a ii.díaz pleaded guilty several months later.
during sentencing,the florida district court relied on both the august and december seizures as evidence that díaz was responsible for trafficking kilograms of cocaine.the florida district court also applied a sentencing enhancement under a of the united states sentencing guidelines for acting as the organizer or leader of a criminal activity involving five or more participants,and a sentencing enhancement under of the guidelines for obstruction of justice for encouraging the confidential source to lie to government investigators.díaz was initially sentenced to life in prison.
five days after díaz was indicted in florida,the government filed a indictment against him in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.based on the august seizure,the puerto rico indictment charged díaz with one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the united states,in violation of,and,and one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine,in violation of and b a ii.
díaz moved to dismiss the puerto rico indictment the same day he entered his plea of guilty in the florida case.díaz contended that the conduct charged in the puerto rico indictment in particular,díaz participation in the events leading up to the august seizure had already been charged in the florida case and thus that dismissal of the puerto rico indictment was required by the fifth amendment double jeopardy clause.
the district court did not rule on that motion right away.instead,the district court held that motion in abeyance pending the resolution of the florida proceedings.
with the puerto rico case on hold,díaz pursued an appeal of his sentence in the florida proceedings to the eleventh circuit.in that appeal,he contended,among other things,that the florida district court erred in applying the leadership enhancement,and in failing to apply a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,pursuant to of the guidelines.united states,fed.appx,cir.
on june,the eleventh circuit vacated and remanded the sentence.id.at.that court concluded,first,that no evidence was provided to support díaz leadership role with respect to the four crewmen suárez,perpiña,de león,and concepción and second,that the confidential source could not be considered a participant.id.at.on this basis,the eleventh circuit then remanded the case to the florida district court for reconsideration of its decision to apply the leadership enhancement,directing the district court also to reconsider its decision not to apply the downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.id.at.upon remand,díaz was sentenced on february,to months of imprisonment 
several days later,the proceedings in the federal district court in puerto rico resumed.the district court referred the motion to dismiss the indictment to a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending that the district court deny díaz motion to dismiss on april.
the magistrate judge found as follows.with respect to count one of the puerto rico indictment,the magistrate judge first noted that the offense charged therein was not an offense charged in the florida case.accordingly,citing united states,cir,the magistrate judge denied díaz motion to dismiss count one.the magistrate judge explained that the elements of the statute díaz was charged with violating in that count,are different from the elements of the statute díaz was charged with violating in the florida case and therefore his prosecution on count one in the puerto rico case presented no double jeopardy problem.
with respect to count two of the puerto rico indictment,the magistrate judge held that the conspiracy for which díaz was charged in the puerto rico indictment was a separate one from the conspiracy for which he was charged in the florida district court.applying the test we laid out in united states,cir,the magistrate judge concluded that three of the factors the time of the activities,the persons involved,and the evidence that would be adduced at trial favored the government.
first,as to timing,the magistrate judge noted that the conspiracy charged in puerto rico ended in september,and therefore covers a different time period than the conspiracy alleged in the florida indictment,which began in october.second,as to personnel,the magistrate judge emphasized that the august conspiracy the one charged in puerto rico involved suárez and perpiña,whereas the december conspiracy the one charged in florida involved de león and concepción.finally,as to evidence,the magistrate judge noted that there were two different drug shipments,involving different time periods and persons,which supports a finding that distinct evidence would have to be adduced in order to establish each of the two conspiracies.what is more,the magistrate judge held,because none of the individuals in the december conspiracy apart from díaz were involved in the alleged august conspiracy,the government may prove an agreement the essential component of a conspiracy between díaz and the individuals in the august voyage without resorting to proof of an agreement between díaz and the individuals involved in the december voyage.
the magistrate judge,however,held that the remaining two factors the places involved and the fact that the two statutory provisions under which díaz was charged were the same did weigh in favor of díaz.the magistrate judge noted that either the dominican republic or puerto rico were the final destination for the shipments charged in both indictments.citation omitted.and,the magistrate judge also noted that count two of the puerto rico indictment and the one count of the florida indictment both alleged violations of the same statutory provisions,thus tipping the fifth factor in díaz direction.but,after weighing these five factors,the magistrate judge ultimately concluded that the conspiracies charged in the two indictments were separate ones insofar as the conduct charged in the two indictments involved distinct time periods,personnel,and evidence,and recommended that the district court deny díaz motion to dismiss count two of the puerto rico indictment on double jeopardy grounds.
the magistrate judge report and recommendation informed díaz that he had fourteen days to file objections.the report and recommendation also notified díaz that f ailure to file timely and specific objections would constitute a waiver of the right to appellate review.díaz,however,did not file any objections to the report and recommendation.accordingly,on april,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation that díaz motion to dismiss be denied and directed that the parties proceed with trial preparation.
díaz then filed this timely interlocutory appeal.we agree with the parties that we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to the supreme court decision in abney united states,which made clear that a double jeopardy challenge to an indictment must be reviewable before the defendant is to stand trial on that indictment.united states,cir.noting that,while ordinarily a defendant can not pursue an immediate appeal from an interlocutory order in a criminal case,defendants may nevertheless immediate ly appeal from denials of a motion to dismiss if the appeal is premised on colorable double jeopardy grounds.
as this case comes to us,it appears that díaz waived his right to bring the challenge he now advances by failing to file objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.see united states lugo guerrero,cir.holding that the defendant waived his right to appeal because he failed to object to the recommendation of the magistrate report see also thomas arn,the question presented is whether a court of appeals may exercise its supervisory powers to establish a rule that the failure to file objections to the magistrate report waives the right to appeal the district court judgment.we hold that it may.davet maccarone,cir.failure to raise objections to the report and recommendation waives the party right to review in the district court and those claims not preserved by such objection are precluded on appeal.
díaz contends that his double jeopardy claim is exempt from the ordinary application of these waiver rules because his guilty plea in the florida case does not now foreclose him from bringing this double jeopardy challenge.it is by no means clear,however,that,under united states broce,díaz failure to object to the magistrate judge report and recommendation did not thereby waive his right to bring this challenge.see id.holding that when the defendants pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy on the explicit premise of two agreements which started at different times and embraced separate objectives,they conceded guilt to two separate offenses,and therefore could not subsequently challenge the theory of the indictments and attempt to show the existence of only one conspiracy see also united states stefanidakis,cir.nevertheless,even assuming that díaz has not waived his right to bring this challenge,we conclude,as we now explain,that this interlocutory appeal fails on the merits.
díaz purports to challenge both counts of the puerto rico indictment on double jeopardy grounds.but,as díaz does not dispute the district court conclusion that count one of the puerto rico indictment did not present a double jeopardy problem because it charged an offense that was not charged in the florida case,we affirm and proceed to consider his challenge regarding count two of the puerto rico indictment 
the government contends that we review the district court ruling under for abuse of discretion.see,at the baseline standard of review applicable to a denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds following the declaration of a mistrial is abuse of discretion.itself,however,seems to have applied a standard of review,at.that case notwithstanding,we held in united states,cir.decided several months afterwards that t he availability of double jeopardy protection is a constitutional question reviewable de novo.here,because our conclusion holds irrespective of the standard of review,rather than choose among the various standards,we apply the more standard of de novo review that díaz contends is applicable.for even on de novo review,we disagree with díaz that the district court denial of díaz motion to dismiss must be reversed under.
díaz first contends that there is a substantial overlap between the evidence at issue in the florida case and the evidence that would be adduced at trial here,given the obvious relatedness of the conduct.for that reason,he argues,the fourth factor whether the same evidence would be used to prove the two conspiracies,at favors him,rather than the government,as the district court concluded.but,díaz points to no specific facts in the record before the district court that suggest that the district court incorrectly applied or weighed this fourth factor.and while díaz also argues that unidentified principal players in the two seizures at issue were the same and thus that the second,factor also favors him that assertion,without more,is insufficient to meet his burden of presenting evidence to establish a prima facie nonfrivolous double jeopardy claim,at quoting united states booth,cir,even if we assume that díaz preserved this argument below accordingly,díaz provides no basis on which the district court ruling may be reversed under the framework we established in.
díaz does make a number of other arguments in support of his contention that the district court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss.none have merit.
díaz argues that,during the sentencing phase of the florida proceedings,the government itself relied on evidence from the august seizure the one charged in the puerto rico indictment to demonstrate his responsibility for the december seizure the one charged in the florida case,thus making clear that díaz participated in only one overarching conspiracy.but,assuming favorably to díaz that our review is de novo,we disagree.
the supreme court has explicitly rejected the argument that double jeopardy principles bar a later prosecution or punishment for criminal activity where that activity has been considered at sentencing for a separate crime.witte united states.thus,the fact that the government presented evidence to the florida district court concerning the seizure for which díaz was charged in this case does not suffice to show that the crimes charged in the two cases are the same for double jeopardy purposes.
díaz also contends that the motion to dismiss must be granted based on two aspects of the record that he identifies for the first time on appeal.specifically,he contends that the florida and puerto rico indictments were coordinated,and therefore represented the culmination of a joint investigation between law enforcement authorities in florida and puerto rico and the government opposed díaz request that his defense in the florida case be handled by a former federal prosecutor in puerto rico because the puerto rico case and the florida case were essentially the same.but,díaz made no reference to these facts in his motion to dismiss before the magistrate judge,and he did not object before the district court to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.thus,our review is,at best,for plain error.see united states,cir,as amended,holding that a double jeopardy claim not raised below is subject to plain error review.díaz must therefore show that that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.stefanidakis,at quoting united states duarte,cir.
