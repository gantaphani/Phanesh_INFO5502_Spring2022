christian pleaded guilty to two drug and charges in exchange,the government dismissed others.sánchez now appeals his sentence,attacking its procedural and substantive reasonableness.although sánchez plea agreement does not bar this appeal,his challenges ultimately fail on their merits.we affirm.
background 
puerto rico law enforcement officers encountered sánchez and his codefendant while searching abandoned apartments in an unrelated case.the officers found sánchez with cocaine,marijuana,drug ledgers,cash,ammunition,and two handguns one of which was modified to fire automatically sánchez eventually entered guilty pleas to possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute,in violation of a,and possessing firearms in furtherance of a crime,in violation of c a i.in exchange,the government agreed to dismiss other charges one of which carried a mandatory sentence.see id.c b ii.
in the plea agreement,the parties stipulated that the appropriate guidelines sentencing range for the marijuana charge was months incarceration,and agreed to recommend a sentence at the higher end.the firearms charge carried a statutorily required consecutive incarcerative term of at least months,and the parties identified the guidelines range as that statutory minimum.see id.c a i b.on that count,however,the plea agreement contemplated an sentence sánchez could argue for as few as months,and the government could request a term of imprisonment of up to one hundred and months.the agreement further provided that sánchez would waive his right to appeal,so long as the court sentenced him according to its terms,conditions,and recommendations.
at the sentencing hearing,sánchez asked the judge to impose a sentence on the marijuana charge and a sentence on the firearms charge months total.the government also recommended a sentence on the marijuana charge,but requested a sentence for the firearms months total.the district court accepted the parties recommendation on the marijuana charge,but found insufficient the sentence that both the government and the defense recommended on the firearms charge.the court then sentenced sánchez to the top of the range specified in the plea agreement for the c violation months for a total incarcerative sentence of months.sánchez did not object at the sentencing hearing in this timely appeal,however,he argues that the sentence was unreasonable.
ii.analysis 
before addressing the merits,we first determine whether this appeal falls within the waiver of appeal to which sánchez agreed.see united states,cir.it does not.
a plea agreement provision is valid if it was knowingly and voluntarily executed,and if enforcement would not result in a miscarriage of justice.united states,cir.but e ven a knowing and voluntary appeal waiver only precludes appeals that fall within its scope.id.at alteration in original quoting united states mccoy,cir.when determining such a provision scope,we rely on basic contract interpretation principles,construing the agreement where possible to give effect to every term and phrase,and construing any ambiguities in favor of allowing the appeal to proceed.id.at citations omitted.
sánchez plea agreement contains this provision defendant hereby agrees that if this honorable court accepts this plea and forfeiture agreement and sentences him according to its terms,conditions,and recommendations,defendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.
the agreement sentence recommendation provision reads,in its entirety 
as to the marijuana count the parties agree to recommend a sentence of imprisonment at the higher end of the above referenced guideline calculation.as to the firearms count the defendant can request a consecutive term of imprisonment of months and the government can request a consecutive term of imprisonment of up to one hundred and months.the parties agree that any recommendation by either party for a term of imprisonment below or above the stipulated sentence recommendation constitutes a material breach of the plea and forfeiture agreement.
sánchez argues that the provision does not apply because the district court sentenced him to months on the firearms count,but he requested months and the government sought only months so the court did not sentence him according to the parties recommendations.the government counters that,because it was permitted to ask for a sentence on the firearms count,sánchez ultimate sentence was within the range contemplated by the parties in the plea agreement,and he was thus sentenced according to the agreement terms and conditions.
plea agreements should be given their plain meaning.united states,cir.but here,the meaning of sánchez plea agreement is ambiguous.the provision bars any appeal from a sentence in accordance with the agreement terms,conditions,and recommendations.emphasis added.the underlined language is not meaningless because we constru e the agreement to give effect to every term and phrase,at,we do not read the provision inclusion of recommendations as mere surplusage see united states garcia,cir.rejecting a construction that would render the language mere surplusage quoting united states bowler,cir.
the agreement ambiguity lies in the meaning of the phrase its recommendations.the phrase could simply refer to any sentence within the stipulated sentence recommendation contained within the agreement four corners.but the phrase could also refer more narrowly to the parties actual requests at sentencing for a term of imprisonment,so long as those requests are within the agreement textually specified sentencing range.united states,cir.construing its recommendations to be limited by the parties agreement to recommend a sentence at the lower end of the applicable guideline range.the phrase meaning as used in the agreement is thus ambiguous.and,because we construe ambiguity against the government,we hold that sánchez appeal is not within the provision scope,and accordingly proceed to the merits.see united states newbert,cir.
sentencing error 
sánchez arguments,however,fail on their merits.we review these claims in two steps we first determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally reasonable and then determine whether it is substantively reasonable,at quoting united states clogston,cir.
procedural reasonableness 
sánchez contends that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not articulate a basis for exceeding the recommendations of the parties.see gall united states,procedural error includes failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.because sánchez did not preserve this argument by raising it below,we review only for plain error.see united states,cir.there was no error here,plain or otherwise.
to satisfy its burden of explanation,the sentencing court need do no more than identify the main factors behind its decision.id.the sentencing court met that obligation here.as acknowledged by sánchez in his brief,the court determined,among other findings,that the parties sentencing requests did not reflect the seriousness of the offense,which included possession of two powerful weapons,one of which is modified to shoot automatically,in addition to the ammunition drugs,drug ledgers,and drug paraphernalia.this explanation sufficed to meet the requirement.see id.at finding no procedural error when explanation reflected defendant possession of an impressive array of munitions,including an assault rifle,in close proximity to a trove of illegal drugs.
one final note on procedural reasonableness to the extent that sánchez asserts that the court erred by not explaining why it rejected the parties requested sentences,the law does not support him.although a sentencing court typically has a duty to explain why it selected a particular sentence,it has no corollary duty to explain why it eschewed other suggested sentences.id.at quoting united states,cir.
substantive reasonableness 
having established that the sentence was not procedurally unreasonable,we turn to its substantive reasonableness.once again,sánchez did not object below.consistent with our recent cases,and favorably to sánchez,we assu
