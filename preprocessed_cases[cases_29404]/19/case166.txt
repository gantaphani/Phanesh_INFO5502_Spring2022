according to an expert who testified during state postconviction relief,petitioner demarcus sears performs at or below the bottom first percentile in several measures of cognitive functioning and reasoning.the cause of this abnormality appears to be significant frontal lobe brain damage sears suffered as a child,as well as drug and alcohol abuse in his teens.but because in the words of the state trial court his counsel conducted a penalty phase investigation that was on its face constitutionally inadequate,app.to pet.for cert,evidence relating to sears cognitive impairments and childhood difficulties was not brought to light at the time he was sentenced to death.
after finding constitutionally deficient attorney performance under the framework we set forth in strickland washington,the state postconviction court found itself unable to assess whether counsel inadequate investigation might have prejudiced sears.app.to pet.for cert.because sears counsel did present some mitigation evidence during sears penalty phase but not the significant mitigation evidence a constitutionally adequate investigation would have uncovered the state court determined it could not speculate as to what the effect of additional evidence would have been,at.accordingly,it denied sears postconviction relief,at.thereafter,the supreme court of georgia summarily denied review of his claims,at.
for the reasons that follow,it is plain from the face of the state court opinion that it failed to apply the correct prejudice inquiry we have established for evaluating sears sixth amendment claim.we therefore grant the petition for writ of certiorari,vacate the judgment,and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion 
in,a georgia jury convicted sears of armed robbery and kidnaping with bodily injury which also resulted in death,a capital crime under state law.see.code ann.d during the penalty phase of sears capital trial,his counsel presented evidence describing his childhood as stable,loving,and essentially without incident.seven witnesses offered testimony along the following lines sears came from a background his actions shocked and dismayed his relatives and a death sentence,the jury was told,would devastate the family.see pet.for cert.counsel mitigation theory,it seems,was calculated to portray the adverse impact of sears execution on his family and loved ones.record.but the strategy backfired.the prosecutor ultimately used the evidence of sears purportedly stable and advantaged upbringing against him during the state closing argument.with sears,the prosecutor told the jury,w e do have a deprived child from an inner city a person who m society has turned its back on at an early age.but,yet,we have a person,privileged in every way,who has rejected every opportunity that was afforded him.pet.for cert.quoting trial transcript internal quotation marks omitted.
the mitigation evidence that emerged during the state postconviction evidentiary hearing,however,demonstrates that sears was far from privileged in every way.sears home life,while filled with material comfort,was anything but tranquil his parents had a physically abusive relationship,exh,record affidavit of demetrius sears,and divorced when sears was young,exh,at affidavit of virginia sears graves he suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an adolescent male cousin,exh,at his mother favorite word for referring to her sons was little mother fuckers,exh,record affidavit of richard dudley,md and his father was verbally abusive,exh,record affidavit of carol and disciplined sears with drills,exh,record exh,record affidavit of frank sears exh,at exh,at affidavit of kenneth burns.sears struggled in school,demonstrating substantial behavior problems from a very young age.for example,sears repeated the second grade,exh,record,and was referred to a local health center for evaluation at age nine,exh,at.by the time sears reached high school,he was described as severely learning disabled and as severely behaviorally handicapped.exh.a to exh,record affidavit of tony strickland.
environmental factors aside,and more significantly,evidence produced during the state postconviction relief process also revealed that sears suffered significant frontal lobe abnormalities.exh,at.two different psychological experts testified that sears had substantial deficits in mental cognition and reasoning,problems with planning,sequencing and impulse control,ibid.as a result of several serious head injuries he suffered as a child,as well as drug and alcohol abuse.see record testimony of strickland,at testimony of dudley.regardless of the cause of his brain damage,his scores on at least two standardized assessment tests placed him at or below the first percentile in several categories of cognitive function,making him among the most impaired individuals in the population in terms of ability to suppress competing impulses and conform behavior only to relevant stimuli.exh,record see also record.the assessment also revealed that sears ability to organize his choices,assign them relative weight and select among them in a deliberate way is grossly impaired.exh,record.from an etiological standpoint,one expert explained that sears history is replete with multiple head trauma,substance abuse and traumatic experiences of the type expected to lead to these significant impairments,at see also record.
whatever concern the dissent has about some of the sources relied upon by sears experts informal personal accounts,see post,at opinion of scalia,it does not undermine the expert assessment based on between and hours of interviews,testing,and observations,see record,that sears suffers from substantial cognitive impairment.sears performed dismally on several of the forensic tests administered to him to assess his frontal lobe functioning.on the stroop word interference test,which measures response inhibition,at,of those individuals in his cohort which accounts for age,education,and background performed better than he did.ibid.on the b test,which also measures frontal lobe functioning,at,sears performed at the first and lowest percentile,at.based on these results,the expert observations,and an extensive review of sears personal history,the expert opinion was unequivocal there is clear and compelling evidence that sears has pronounced frontal lobe pathology.at.
further,the fact that sears brother is a convicted drug dealer and user,and introduced sears to a life of crime,record,actually would have been consistent with a mitigation theory portraying sears as an individual with diminished judgment and reasoning skills,who may have desired to follow in the footsteps of an older brother who had shut him out of his life.post,at.and the fact that some of such evidence may have been hearsay does not necessarily undermine its value or its admissibility for penalty phase purposes post,at.
finally,the fact that along with this new mitigation evidence there was also some adverse evidence is unsurprising,post,at,given that counsel initial mitigation investigation was constitutionally inadequate.competent counsel should have been able to turn some of the adverse evidence into a positive perhaps in support of a cognitive deficiency mitigation theory.in particular,evidence of sears grandiose and evidence of his magical thinking,were features,in another expert view of a profound personality disorder.record.this evidence might not have made sears any more likable to the jury,but it might well have helped the jury understand sears,and his horrendous acts especially in light of his purportedly stable upbringing.
because they failed to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation,none of this evidence was known to sears trial counsel.it emerged only during state postconviction relief.
unsurprisingly,the state postconviction trial court concluded that sears had demonstrated his counsel penalty phase investigation was constitutionally deficient.see strickland,at explaining that first inquiry when evaluating sixth amendment ineffectiveness claim is whether counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in its view,the cursory nature of counsel investigation into mitigation evidence limited to one day or less,talking to witnesses selected by sears mother was on its face constitutionally inadequate.app.to pet.for cert.
what is surprising,however,is the court analysis regarding whether counsel facially inadequate mitigation investigation prejudiced sears.see strickland,supra,at.although the court appears to have stated the proper prejudice standard it did not correctly conceptualize how that standard applies to the circumstances of this case.because sears counsel did present some mitigation evidence during his penalty phase,the court concluded that t his case can not be fairly compared with those where little or no mitigation evidence is presented and where a reasonable prediction of outcome can be made.app.to pet.for cert.the court explained that it is impossible to know what effect a different mitigation theory would have had on the jury.ibid.because counsel put forth a reasonable theory with supporting evidence,the court reasoned,sears failed to meet his burden of proving that there is a reasonable likelihood that the outcome at trial would have been different if a different mitigation theory had been advanced.ibid.
there are two errors in the state court analysis of sears sixth amendment claim.first,the court curtailed a more probing prejudice inquiry because it placed undue reliance on the assumed reasonableness of counsel mitigation theory.the court determination that counsel had conducted a constitutionally deficient mitigation investigation,should have,at the very least,called into question the reasonableness of this theory.wiggins smith,explaining that counsel failure to uncover and present voluminous mitigating evidence at sentencing could not be justified as a tactical decision because counsel had not fulfill ed their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant background quoting williams taylor,alteration in original.and,more to the point,that a theory might be reasonable,in the abstract,does not obviate the need to analyze whether counsel failure to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation before arriving at this particular theory prejudiced sears.the reasonableness of counsel theory was,at this stage in the inquiry,beside the point sears might be prejudiced by his counsel failures,whether his haphazard choice was reasonable or not.
justice scalia chides the court for concluding that the trial court assumed,rather than found,that counsel mitigation theory was a reasonable one.post,at.but our point is that any finding with respect to the reasonableness of the mitigation theory counsel utilized in this case,family impact is in tension with the trial court unambiguous finding that counsel investigation was itself so unreasonable as to be facially unconstitutional.this point is plain in williams we rejected any suggestion that a decision to focus on one potentially reasonable trial strategy in that case,petitioner voluntary confession was justified by a tactical decision when counsel did not fulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant background.at.a tactical decision is a precursor to concluding that counsel has developed a reasonable mitigation theory in a particular case 
second,and more fundamentally,the court failed to apply the proper prejudice inquiry.we have never limited the prejudice inquiry under strickland to cases in which there was only little or no mitigation evidence presented,app.to pet.for cert.true,we have considered cases involving such circumstances and we have explained that there is no prejudice when the new mitigating evidence would barely have altered the sentencing profile presented to the decisionmaker,strickland,supra,at.but we also have found deficiency and prejudice in other cases in which counsel presented what could be described as a superficially reasonable mitigation theory during the penalty phase,williams,supra,at remorse and cooperation with police rompilla beard,residual doubt.we did so most recently in porter mccollum,per curiam slip,at,where counsel at trial had attempted to blame his client bad acts on his drunkenness,and had failed to discover significant mitigation evidence relating to his client heroic military service and substantial mental health difficulties that came to light only during postconviction relief,at slip,at.not only did we find prejudice in porter,but bound by deference owed under d we also concluded the state court had unreasonably applied strickland prejudice prong when it analyzed porter claim.porter,supra,at slip,at.
we certainly have never held that counsel effort to present some mitigation evidence should foreclose an inquiry into whether a facially deficient mitigation investigation might have prejudiced the defendant.to the contrary,we have consistently explained that the strickland inquiry requires precisely the type of probing and analysis that the state trial court failed to undertake below in the williams decision,for instance,we categorically rejected the type of truncated prejudice inquiry undertaken by the state court in this case,at.and,in porter,we recently explained 
to assess the probability of a different outcome under strickland,we consider the totality of the available mitigation evidence both that adduced at trial,and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding and reweig h it against the evidence in aggravation.at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted third alteration in original.
that same standard applies and will necessarily require a court to speculate as to the effect of the new evidence regardless of how much or how little mitigation evidence was presented during the initial penalty phase.indeed,it is exactly this kind of probing inquiry that justice scalia now undertakes,post,at,and that the trial court failed to do.in all circumstances,this is the proper prejudice standard for evaluating a claim of ineffective representation in the context of a penalty phase mitigation investigation.
a proper analysis of prejudice under strickland would have taken into account the newly uncovered evidence of sears significant mental and psychological impairments,along with the mitigation evidence introduced during sears penalty phase trial,to assess whether there is a reasonable probability that sears would have received a different sentence after a constitutionally sufficient mitigation investigation.see porter,supra,at slip,at williams,supra,at strickland,supra,at.it is for the state court and not for either this court or even justice scalia to undertake this reweighing in the first instance.
accordingly,the petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.the judgment below is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

the court concludes,ante,at,that the superior court of butts county,georgia,made errors of law in applying the prejudice inquiry for claims under strickland washington.in my view there was no error of law,and the court today remands for the state court to do what it has already done find no reasonable likelihood that the mitigation evidence the court details in its opinion would have persuaded a jury to change its mind about the death sentence for this brutal.
the state habeas court responsibly executed the first step in the strickland analysis,finding that the investigation of mitigation evidence by sears trial counsel was deficient performance.the issue here is the second step whether sears was prejudiced by that deficiency.as the court acknowledges,ante,at,the state habeas court correctly stated the prejudice standard under strickland the defendant has the burden to establish a reasonable probability that,but for counsel deficient performance,the result of the proceeding would have been different.app.to pet.for cert.citing,at.when applied to the sentencing phase of death penalty trials,that means a reasonable probability that,absent counsel errors,the sentencer would have concluded that the balance of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.app.to pet.for cert.
the court today concludes that there were two errors in the application of that proper standard.first,it reasons that the court erroneously curtailed a more probing prejudice inquiry because it placed undue reliance on the assumed reasonableness of counsel mitigation theory at trial.ante,at.that argument is flawed on several levels.to begin with,the state habeas court did not assume trial counsel mitigation theory was reasonable it found that it was.it said a lthough counsel failed to investigate thoroughly,they did develop a reasonable mitigation theory with evidence to support it.app.to pet.for cert.after interviews of roughly a dozen potential mitigation witnesses,who,with the exception of sears father,gave positive accounts of sears and his family,see record,at,sears trial counsel developed a mitigation theory that sears came from a good family and had a solid upbringing that his offense was completely out of character that he cooperated with police and that sentencing sears to death would devastate his family and friends,see,at,at,at.to support that approach his attorneys called seven witnesses,including sears mother,four family friends,and his high school guidance counselor.see pet.for cert.citing trial transcript pages between and.the state habeas court did not declare that this mitigation theory might be reasonable,in the abstract,as the court puts it,ante,at.rather,it concluded that counsel put forth a reasonable theory with supporting evidence.app.to pet.for cert.
the court argument is also flawed because the habeas court reasonableness finding did not cause it to curtai l its prejudice inquiry,or lead to the conclusion that it could obviate the need to analyze whether pursuing a different mitigation theory would have made a difference.ante,at.the reasonableness finding merely meant that the prejudice determination had to be made by asking,not whether the jury mind would probably have been changed by hearing sears new mitigation theory instead of hearing no mitigation theory at all but rather whether it would probably have been changed by substituting sears new mitigation theory for the reasonable mitigation theory that was presented and rejected after hearing all the witnesses and other evidence sears presented before it,the state court concluded that it is just not possible to know what effect a different mitigation theory would have had.app.to pet.for cert.emphasis added 
the second,and more fundamenta l,legal error the court alleges,ante,at,is really encased within the first.the court claims that the state habeas court limited the prejudice inquiry under strickland to cases in which there was only little or no mitigation evidence presented.at quoting app.to pet.for cert.the court erred,we are told,by determining that present ation of some mitigation evidence should foreclose an inquiry into whether sears was prejudiced.ibid.that is not a fair reading of the opinion.the state court did not hold that a defendant could never suffer prejudice whenever his counsel provided any mitigation evidence.rather,it stated that t his case can not be fairly compared with those where little or no mitigation evidence is presented and where a reasonable prediction of outcome can be made.app.to pet.for cert.emphasis added.that is absolutely correct.this case is not like the prejudice cases on which the court relies,where it could readily be said that the overlooked mitigation theory would have made a much deeper impression on the jury than the utterly unsupported theory or absence of any theory offered at trial.see porter mccollum,per curiam slip,at rompilla beard,wiggins smith,williams taylor.sears trial counsel presented a reasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence sufficient to support it,so the prejudice inquiry was more difficult so difficult that sears could not make the requisite showing.clearly referring to the evidence in this particular case,the court said 
although here,the petitioner can argue that a prior appeal shows the difficulty one juror was having reaching the same verdict as the others,it is just not possible to know what effect a different mitigation theory would have had on her,just as it is impossible to know what effect it would have had on other jurors.app.to pet.for cert.
since the habeas court made no legal error en route to its strickland conclusion,the only basis for reversing the judgment here would be disagreement with the conclusion itself that sears had not established that his new mitigation theory would probably have caused the jury to impose a life sentence instead of death.
the court makes no attempt to contradict that conclusion.doing so would require a inquiry into the record to measure the persuasiveness of the evidence supporting sears new mitigation theory an inquiry the court purports to disavow,ante,at,but nonetheless tendentiously undertakes,ante,at.the reader might think the state habeas court conclusion highly questionable from the court account,which recites as solid all the evidence supporting sears new mitigation theory,see ante,at.it is far from solid.some is likely inadmissible as unreliable hearsay under georgia law,see gissendaner state,gulley state,such as much of the evidence for the uncorroborated claim that sears suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an adolescent male cousin,ante,at other evidence a competent attorney would likely not have placed before the jury such as all the testimony about sears childhood from his brother demetrius,an admitted drug dealer and drug user,record,and a convicted felon for bank fraud,wire fraud,identity theft,and cocaine trafficking,at.no juror would have been impressed by such a character witness.
some of the evidence is incredible,such as the psychiatrist assertion that sears had substantial deficits in mental cognition and reasoning as a result of serious head injuries he suffered as a child,ante,at.the serious head injuries consisted of sears hitting his head at a rink sometime early in elementary school,record,at,running into an end table as a child,at,and getting hit with a golf club sometime later in elementary school,at,at the last of these major injuries might not have been introduced anyway,since that would have provided the prosecution an opportunity to refute both the extent of the injury and the of sears,by introducing into evidence sears boast that when he was or he beat the s out of someone after he was hit on the head with a golf club,at.likewise incredible was the assertion that demetrius introduced sears to a life of crime,ante,at.according to testimony on which the court relies,demetrius would never let sears hang around with him and his friends.record.
a jury also would have discredited the psychiatric testimony of strickland that f rom an etiological standpoint sears history is replete with multiple head trauma,substance abuse and traumatic experiences of the type expected to lead to these significant mental impairments,ante,at quoting,at.as already noted,the evidence of trauma is nonexistent.the psychiatric testimony of dudley relied upon the reporting of sears himself and the testimony of his brother,demetrius,see,record.and then there are the unfavorable parts of dudley testimony sears is a narcissis t,at,with a grandiose opinion of himself,at,at.dudley affidavit portrays sears as arrogant and,at,and notes what he termed sears fantastical boasting of his first sexual experience with a woman at the age of six and his other innumerable sexual experiences,at,at.it is hard to see how it could be thought probable that sears magical thinking,at,would have helped his plea for leniency,see ante,at.it seems to me more likely the jury would conclude that sears profoun d personality disorder,record,made him exactly the kind of person who would commit heinous crimes in the future.
and some of the evidence the court recounts is so utterly unlikely to affect a jury determination that thi
