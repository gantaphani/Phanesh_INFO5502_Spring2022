in,scott tevlin tevlin was convicted in a massachusetts state court of murder in the felony murder,armed robbery,and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the felony murder and a concurrent term of nine to ten years for the assault and battery.his convictions were affirmed on direct appeal,and postconviction relief was also denied by the massachusetts state courts.in,tevlin petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts pursuant to.the court denied the petition on june.on appeal tevlin argues,first,that he received ineffective assistance of counsel due to trial counsel failure to challenge or investigate certain evidence,and second,that he was denied due process by the commonwealth refusal to grant him postconviction access to fingerprint evidence.we hold that tevlin has failed to establish any constitutional violation,and we therefore affirm the denial of habeas corpus relief.
in habeas cases,we presume that factual determinations by state courts are correct.e teti bender,cir.in any event,the facts as presented at trial and as set forth by the supreme judicial court of massachusetts are not herein contested.see commonwealth tevlin.in light of tevlin convictions,those decisions correctly recited the version of the facts at trial most favorable to the commonwealth.tevlin,at.thus,we describe the facts of this case as they appear in the decisions of the massachusetts courts.see teti,at.
on the morning of march,just before,the evidence showed that tevlin assaulted angela lyons lyons while attempting to steal her purse in a shaw supermarket parking lot in brockton,massachusetts.lyons resisted,and tevlin responded by knocking her down and dragging her across the pavement.he then stomped on her stomach.upon wrestling the purse free,tevlin fled the scene in a white car.
cecelia peterson peterson was an eyewitness to the attack and assisted lyons immediately afterward.lyons told peterson that the assailant had stomped on her stomach that she was upset and in pain and that she was losing sensation in her legs.
officer steven williamson officer williamson of the brockton police department responded to the scene.lyons told him that a young,white male had attacked her.peterson described the assailant as approximately years old,five feet ten inches tall,and pounds,with black hair,a mustache,and a goatee.peterson also told officer williamson that the assailant escaped in a white car with the license plate number zpf.another witness also described the assailant leaving in a white car with a license plate number beginning with.
at the hospital,lyons explained to john steinmetz that a young man had tried to steal her purse and stomped twice on her stomach.an examination revealed that lyons aorta had been crushed just above her navel,and due to calcification of cholesterol plaque in the vessel,her aorta remained crushed,impairing blood flow to her spinal cord and lower extremities.her condition deteriorated,and despite surgery to repair the damaged aorta,lyons died on march.the cause of death was complications due to blunt abdominal trauma.
in the days following the attack,peterson worked with state trooper scott berna trooper berna to prepare composite sketches of the assailant.peterson also reviewed photographs of possible suspects.none of the photographs was of tevlin.then on march,police found a white pontiac bonneville parked outside an apartment complex in brockton.the car,with license plate number zpv,had been stolen from the owner home a few days earlier,sometime on the evening of march or in the early morning of march.it was later identified by peterson as the car in which she saw the assailant escape.a fingerprint analysis was conducted,and a fingerprint on the wiper control lever was found to match tevlin thumbprint.
on march,trooper berna showed peterson a series of eighteen photographs,one of which was a photograph of tevlin,but peterson could not make an identification.the following day,tevlin was arrested,and peterson reviewed eight more photographs,including one of tevlin taken that morning.peterson still failed to make a positive identification.
on march,peterson saw tevlin picture in the newspaper.he was identified as the man arrested for the attack on lyons.peterson telephoned trooper berna to express her concern that the police may have arrested the wrong person,because she did not recognize tevlin as the assailant.on march,peterson met with trooper berna and asked if there were any more pictures of tevlin she could review.trooper berna provided her with about a dozen photographs of tevlin.she did not make,nor was she asked to make,an identification at that time.instead,peterson and trooper berna discussed the case,and trooper berna told peterson that tevlin fingerprint had been found in the pontiac.on march,peterson called trooper berna and told him that she was now confident that tevlin was in fact the assailant.she explained that previously she had been focused on the assailant grin on the morning of the attack,and that once she removed that grin from her mind,she realized that the police had the right man.at trial,she identified tevlin as the man who attacked lyons.
at the time of the attack,tevlin lived within a walk from where the pontiac bonneville had been stolen.on the morning of the attack,at about,tevlin stopped at the brockton home of his surrogate stepfather.tevlin stayed for about minutes and smoked a piece of crack cocaine before leaving with the stated intention of getting more crack.the attack on lyons occurred shortly before tevlin returned at about,where he told dorothea hustus hustus,who also lived at the apartment,that he and a friend had been involved in robberies at shaw supermarkets in the nearby towns of easton and abington.he did not mention an attack in brockton.he also told hustus that he had stolen a car.hustus noted that tevlin appeared very nervous and repeatedly looked out of the windows.when she told tevlin to leave,he asked her to check outside for police.hustus then observed tevlin walk to a white car parked on the street,pace back and forth for about twenty minutes,and finally get in and drive off.twenty minutes later,however,tevlin was back at the apartment with the white car.he told hustus that he had gotten into an accident and that he needed a place to stay because the police might be looking for him.tevlin left for the final time at about.the following week,hustus went to the brockton police station and identified the pontiac bonneville as the car tevlin had driven to her house on the morning of the attack on lyons,march.
tevlin was arrested on march.on the date of his arrest,which was nine days after the attack,tevlin was five feet eleven inches tall,weighed pounds,and had dark hair,a mustache,and a goatee.he thus matched peterson initial description with only minor variations.after his arrest,while incarcerated at the plymouth county house of correction,tevlin admitted his involvement in the robbery and attack in question to another inmate.this inmate later testified at the trial as to tevlin admission.
on march,tevlin was indicted on four counts murder in the first degree,in violation of.laws ch,armed robbery,in violation of.laws ch,unarmed robbery on a victim sixty years of age or older,in violation of.laws ch,a and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon on a victim sixty years of age or older,in violation of.laws ch,a.
on april,on the eve of trial,tevlin counsel filed a motion to suppress peterson identification,but the motion was withdrawn following a voir dire examination of peterson.tevlin counsel explained to the trial judge that he had discussed the motion with tevlin and concluded as a matter of judgment not to pursue it.tevlin jury trial began on april,and on may,the jury found him guilty of murder based on a felony murder theory with armed robbery as the predicate felony,armed robbery,and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.the massachusetts superior court sentenced tevlin to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the murder,and nine to ten years on the assault and battery conviction,to be served concurrently.
tevlin appealed his conviction to the supreme judicial court of massachusetts.among his arguments on direct appeal was that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue the motion to suppress peterson identification.the supreme judicial court rejected tevlin claims and affirmed his convictions on january.see tevlin,at.
on march,tevlin filed a motion for new trial with the superior court.his arguments in support included two more ineffective assistance claims relevant to the present appeal failure to adequately investigate alternative medical theories for lyons cause of death,and failure to adequately challenge the fingerprint evidence on of the commonwealth fingerprint expert.tevlin also filed a motion for postconviction access to fingerprint evidence for additional testing.on october,the trial court denied tevlin motion for postconviction discovery of fingerprint evidence not presented at trial,holding that tevlin had not established a prima facie case for postconviction relief as required by massachusetts law.on june,the court denied tevlin motion for a new trial,rejecting the ineffective assistance arguments.a single justice of the supreme judicial court denied tevlin petition to appeal the denial of his motion for a new trial,under the gatekeeper provision of.laws ch,on february.
failing to obtain relief in the massachusetts courts,tevlin filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus on may,in the district of massachusetts,pursuant to,asserting four separate grounds for relief,only two of which are raised on appeal here ineffective assistance of counsel,and denial of due process in failing to grant access to postconviction discovery.
on june,without holding an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the petition.as to the ineffective assistance of counsel claims,the court held that it could not the conclusions of the courts of the commonwealth as to the tactical choices made by trial counsel and that it was satisfied on a review of the entire record that the conclusion that they were tactical choices is an appropriate conclusion on this record given the strength of the evidence against tevlin.as to the commonwealth denial of access to fingerprint evidence,the district court stated that because the supreme court has never yet authorized access to fingerprint evidence on a showing like that here,the district court could not authorize it in tevlin case.
tevlin timely appealed,and the district court granted a certificate of appealability.we have jurisdiction pursuant to u.and.
we review the district court denial of habeas relief de novo.aspen bissonnette,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,the level of deference owed to a state court decision on federal habeas review hinges on whether the state court ever adjudicated the relevant claim on the merits or not.clements.clarke,cir citing d.if a state court has adjudicated a claim on the merits,a federal habeas court must defer to the state court proceedings unless the adjudication 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the aedpa standard applies,and it is difficult to meet.this is particularly so where,as here,tevlin argues that there has been a departure from a very general standard such as that set forth in strickland washington.however,we need not dwell on whether there was here a decision by the massachusetts courts that was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,for we conclude that there was in fact no constitutional violation.without a constitutional violation,of course,tevlin can not meet the aedpa standard.
in the present appeal,tevlin argues that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel under three theories failure to pursue the motion to suppress peterson identification,failure to adequately investigate alternative medical theories regarding lyons cause of death,and failure to adequately challenge the fingerprint evidence.as to the first ineffective assistance theory,the massachusetts supreme judicial court considered tevlin argument on its merits and rejected it.as to tevlin other two ineffective assistance theories,the superior court also adjudicated these claims on their merits.
to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,tevlin must show both deficient performance by counsel and resulting prejudice.strickland,at.in order to satisfy the deficient performance prong,tevlin must show that his trial counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.review of counsel performance must be deferential,and reasonableness must be considered in light of prevailing professional norms.id.at.there is a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,and tevlin must overcome the presumption that the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.id.at quoting michel louisiana.thus,this court has held that a lawyer performance is deficient under strickland only where,given the facts known at the time,counsel choice was so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it.knight spencer,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
in order to satisfy the prejudice prong,tevlin must establish a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.porter mccollum,per curiam quoting strickland,at quotation marks omitted.although he need not show that counsel deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome of his proceeding,he must establish a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in that outcome.id.at quoting strickland,at quotation marks omitted.a defendant failure to satisfy one prong of the strickland analysis obviates the need for a court to consider the remaining prong.see strickland,at.
tevlin first argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue the motion to suppress peterson identification,because of the unduly suggestive manner in which the identification was procured.he contends that trooper berna tainted the identification by showing peterson numerous photographs of tevlin and telling her that tevlin fingerprints had been found in the white pontiac bonneville.in cases in which a witness was subjected to a pretrial confrontation so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that the defendant was denied due process of law,the defendant may seek to exclude the identification evidence from trial.stovall denno,see manson brathwaite,neil biggers,commonwealth venios.
tevlin contends that trooper berna actions were so suggestive that any competent counsel would have sought to suppress peterson identification of tevlin.the massachusetts supreme judicial court,however,held that there was a sound tactical basis for the decision not to seek to suppress the identification.tevlin,at.the court noted that t he evidence against the defendant,even without peterson identification,was extremely strong,and as such the suppression of that identification would not seriously have weakened the commonwealth case.id.but p ermitting the identification testimony and then attacking the strength and circumstances of the identification provided the defense with a basis on which to attack the police procedure.id.the defense would then have the opportunity to impeach peterson identification in an effort to develop enough question on that issue that might create a reasonable doubt about the entire case.id.at.tevlin counsel did just that at trial he argued that his arrest and prosecution were the result of a police rush to judgment in a highly publicized murder case in which the police were under pressure to make an arrest.peterson identificatio
