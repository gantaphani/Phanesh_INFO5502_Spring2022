marcus mitchell was convicted after a jury trial for conspiring to distribute cocaine.he now appeals his conviction on two grounds.first,he contends that the district court improperly admitted statements despite insufficient evidence to corroborate mitchell participation in the conspiracy.see united states petrozziello,cir.second,he contends that the district court erred by failing to give a instruction sua sponte,which would have asked the jury to consider whether mitchell relationship with the conspiracy was that of an active member or merely a purchaser of narcotics for personal use.we conclude that the government offered more than sufficient extrinsic evidence to support the admission of the statements and that the need for a instruction was not supported by the record.we affirm.
a.the conspiracy 
from january to october,manuel pinales ran a wholesale drug operation that supplied large quantities of cocaine to customers in the boston area.luis clas,josé rodríguez,and richard pena were also major players.their customers typically purchased kilograms of cocaine at a time,often on consignment,for approximately per kilogram.one of their customers,who purchased wholesale quantities of cocaine,was known variously as prieto or marko.
in january,clas asked rodríguez to take over the organization distribution activities while he was away in the dominican republic.before he left,clas introduced rodríguez to many of the organization customers,one of whom was prieto.at this initial meeting,rodríguez sold prieto and another man a kilogram of cocaine.while clas was away,rodríguez was the principal contact for clas customers.
from january through october,rodríguez delivered,on five occasions,large quantities of cocaine to prieto,totaling approximately fifteen kilograms.prieto generally purchased one or two kilograms at a time,although he purchased three kilograms on one occasion and five on another.prieto often purchased on consignment and,at one point,was in debt to rodríguez to the tune of.
b.the wiretap investigation 
from july through october,the drug enforcement administration dea,which had been investigating pinales role in the conspiracy,began a wiretap investigation on phones belonging to pinales,pena,rodríguez,and clas.over eight hundred phone calls were intercepted.are relevant to this appeal.
there were thirteen calls involving other buyers,not mitchell.all of these calls were in code and involved conspiracy members other than mitchell discussing the purchase and sale of drugs.drugs were referred to as concert tickets,vehicles,or car parts.for instance,during one recorded call,clas arranged to meet a customer to exchange twenty three for a tire.subsequent surveillance of clas showed him distributing a kilogram of cocaine to that customer.
seven calls the mitchell calls were made to,or originated from,mitchell listed number.in these calls,mitchell spoke directly to clas or rodríguez in code about drugs and drug proceeds.for instance,in one conversation,rodríguez said to mitchell,my boy told me about something but it was um in the price range,what i was looking for he set it high if worst comes to worst,i just,you know,i just tell him to give me that car so i can um i can have stuff to transportation.in another exchange,clas asked mitchell,c an i see you tomorrow please.mitchell replied,i t kind of early,man,but agreed to see him.at trial,these calls were offered as admissions of the defendant.mitchell did not object to their admission,nor does he challenge them on appeal.
six calls the prieto calls involved conversations among conspiracy members in which they discussed prieto.two of the mitchell calls overlapped with the prieto calls and provided strong circumstantial evidence that mitchell was prieto.for example,during one recording,mitchell called rodríguez at looking to speak to clas.at,rodríguez called pinales and asked him to tell clas to call prieto.pinales said that he would.at,clas called mitchell.the remaining calls demonstrated prieto role in the conspiracy.for example,during one exchange,rodríguez told pinales that he was going to collect a debt from prieto.the next day,he told pinales that prieto only brought nineteen pesos,short of the full payment amount.in another call,rodríguez asked pinales if he could give prieto five tickets in advance since prieto could only afford three.the prieto calls were offered at trial as statements,which mitchell now challenges in this appeal 
c.the jig is up 
in october,government agents seized kilograms of cocaine from clas residence along with drug ledgers from pinales store.the ledgers showed numerous entries for marko prieto,revealing that he generally received three to five kilograms at a time,often delivered on consignment,and that he owed up to in the summer of.around this time,rodríguez began to cooperate with the government pursuant to a plea agreement.
on february,government agents showed rodríguez an array of several photographs and asked him to identify anyone that he knew.rodríguez pointed to a photo of mitchell and said,that prieto,although he did not know mitchell actual name.later,mitchell was arrested and,in july,indicted by a grand jury.he was charged,along with thirteen,with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute,and distribution of,more than five kilograms of cocaine,in violation of a,b a,and.
at mitchell jury trial,rodríguez testified,among other things,that pinales,pena,clas,and rodríguez only referred to one customer as prieto marko.rodríguez identified that person as mitchell.the government also introduced the wiretapped calls,including the prieto calls now challenged on appeal.mitchell made a timely objection to the admission of the prieto calls under petrozziello,asserting that there was insufficient evidence,independent of the statements themselves,to establish that he was prieto and therefore a member of the conspiracy the district court disagreed and admitted the statements.mitchell was convicted after a trial and now appeals.
ii.discussion 
admission of statements 
mitchell heartland claim on appeal is that he was convicted on the basis of statements that were improperly admitted under the exception to the hearsay rule.see.d e.he challenges the admission of those statements,and asks us to vacate his conviction and remand for a new trial 
federal rule of evidence d e permits the admission of statements made by a of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.see,united states portela,cir.to introduce statements under this exception,t he proponent of the statement bears the burden of establishing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the defendant existed,and that the declarant uttered the statement during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states bradshaw,cir quoting sepúlveda,at see.d e.a court determination as to whether this burden has been met is known in this circuit as a petrozziello ruling.see united states,cir citing united states newton,cir.
a statement,standing alone,is insufficient to meet the preponderance standard of rule d e.sepúlveda,at.the proponent of the statement must introduce some extrinsic evidence sufficient to delineate the conspiracy and corroborate the declarant and the defendant roles in it.united states piper,cir.thus,w hile a trial court may consider the contents of the statement at issue as evidence of the elements of a petrozziello determination,the determination must rest at least in part on corroborating evidence beyond that contained in the statements at issue.portela,at.we will uphold the trial court admission of statements unless it was clearly erroneous.united states thompson,cir.
mitchell principal contention is that the admission of the statements was in error because the uncorroborated testimony of rodríguez laid an insufficient evidentiary foundation to support the conclusion that mitchell was,more likely than not,prieto,a member of the conspiracy.this argument is a nonstarter.the testimony of rodríguez,a cooperating witness,was extrinsic evidence that was probative of the existence of the conspiracy to distribute c
