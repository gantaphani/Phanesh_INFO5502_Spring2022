aldo persichilli was tried and convicted of knowingly possessing a social security card with intent to alter it,a c the alteration count,and of aggravated identity theft,the identity theft count,for which the intent to alter charge was the predicate offense.the relevant background facts can be briefly summarized.
in october,persichilli became a fugitive from justice,and in february,marshals found him at a motel in wilbraham,massachusetts.certain items in his room brought secret service agents to the scene,and their search of the room and persichilli car uncovered two laptops,printers,duffel bags containing materials used in counterfeiting,a stack of counterfeit bills and a lockbox.later evidence indicated that one laptop belonged to persichilli and that the other belonged to an alleged named ryan craig.
inside the lockbox,the agents found more counterfeiting materials six original birth certificates in persichilli name several of which had been altered with bleach or and an original social security card in the name of dashawn brown.brown later identified the card as his and testified at trial that he had lost this card in.on the laptop belonging to persichilli,agents found two images of brown social security card with the middle two digits of his number altered,an image of persichilli driver license with his birthday altered,and a digital manual that contained four ones entitled how to change your identity and get lost.both laptops also contained images of currency.
persichilli was indicted in november on four currency counterfeiting counts,a,to which he pled guilty,and the identity theft and alteration counts identified above.after jury trial on the latter two counts in january,persichilli was convicted on both.persichilli was sentenced to concurrent terms of and months on the counterfeiting counts,a concurrent term of months on the alteration count,and a consecutive term of months on the identity theft count forfeiture and restitution payments were also ordered.
on persichilli appeal,we start with challenges to his conviction on the alteration count.the alteration provision proscribes a number of acts if done with a listed purpose or for any other purpose.a c.persichilli was indicted for knowingly possess ing a social security card or counterfeit social security card with the intent to alter it a listed act with its own scienter element with the purpose of obtaining something of value from a person and the purpose of obtaining a new identity that would enable him to remain a fugitive from justice.the first purpose is listed the second,in the government view,is within the statute purpose clause for any other purpose.
intent to alter.persichilli first argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he intended to alter brown card,the judge having instructed that this showing was required under the indictment although persichilli concedes that the jury could have found he was planning some sort of misfeasance with brown card,he asserts that no reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the wrongdoing would consist of altering the physical card.as noted,the intent to alter is only the first of two different scienter requirements required to convict.
the district court denied a motion for acquittal,and our review is de novo.united states,cir,cert.denied.for us,as for the district judge,the question is whether the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the with all plausible inferences drawn therefrom would allow a rational jury using a reasonable doubt standard to side with the government.united states,cir,cert.denied.
at trial,elizabeth wife,who was arrested with him and was indicted as a that persichilli counterfeited currency by taking an actual bill,bleaching and scrubbing the ink off that bill to obtain genuine but blank currency paper,and then printing an image of a bill from his laptop onto the blank currency paper.in october she said,persichilli and craig discussed their plans to use someone else social security card and a birth certificate to obtain a driver license in a new name.
a government agent testified to the unique physical characteristics of a genuine social security card that made it hard to feel of the paper,special coloring embedded in the paper,and on the signature line.to someone inspecting the card,the altered genuine article might more easily pass muster than a facsimile.so it was plausible that one seeking to assume a new identity verified by a social security card he had hold of a genuine likely seek to alter the physical card than to create one from scratch.
the government also offered evidence as to persichilli currency counterfeiting,the many counterfeiting implements he possessed,the birth certificates he had already practiced altering,and the digital images of brown social security card with altered numbering on his laptop.the government argued to the jury that the digital images were that persichilli made to try to ensure that he did not make a mistake when he tried to alter the actual social security card.
from all this,a jury rationally could conclude that persichilli wanted a forged social security card to get a new driver license in a different name and was planning to alter brown actual social security card in much the same way as he altered bills into bills or as he altered the birth certificates.the evidence sufficiently showed means,method and a specific a driver license in a different taken together permitted the jury to find that he intended to alter the card.
anything of value.next,persichilli argues that he did not have either of the two statutory purposes listed above that the government says support his conviction on the alteration count.starting with the phrase for the purpose of obtaining anything of value from any person,a,persichilli agrees the jury could have found that he aimed to get a driver license,but he argues that a driver license is issued by a government entity and that this provision does not reach misappropriation of something from the government 
persichilli basic claim is that the word person in the statute is limited only to natural persons if it were read to include entities other than natural persons,he does not suggest that it excludes agencies that issue driver licenses.there is some doubt whether the latter issue was properly preserved.but to answer the first question and treat the second,closely related one as forfeit would not be suitable.so we address both questions,interpreting the statute de novo.united states tobin,f d,cir.
urging a broad reading of persons,the government cites the dictionary act,which provides general rules of statutory construction and says that the words person and whoever include corporations,companies,associations,firms partnerships,societies,and joint stock companies,as well as individuals.u.but the act definitions do not apply if the context indicates otherwise,and anyway the list lack of a reference to government could be taken in persichilli favor.united states united mine workers of.based on the omission,some cases presume against the word person extending to governments.agency of natural res.ex rel.stevens.
but with or without a presumption,context still controls,inyo county indians,united states cooper.not surprisingly,against background doctrines such as sovereign immunity,courts are more likely to read person as excluding government entities where the statute is one authorizing suits against or damages from the government conversely,when the government is a potential victim or in this have been more likely to read person protectively to include the government 
neither party cites case law or legislative history directly construing person in this statute,although some decisions assume that victimizing persons but still entities violates the provision before us,united states darrell,cir bank loan.nevertheless,both case law,united states,cir,and the legislative history.i,at,reprinted in,support a broad reading of.and in various contexts where it makes sense,courts have read person to include governments and governmental units,inyo county,at giving examples see also note,above.
