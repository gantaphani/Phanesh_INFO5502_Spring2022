darryl scott,contests the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.scott,who is african american,argues that massachusetts state courts unreasonably applied batson kentucky,which held that the equal protection clause prohibits prosecutors from challenging potential jurors on the basis of race,d.after careful consideration,we affirm the district court denial of habeas corpus relief.
background 
petitioner darryl scott was convicted of murder in the first degree,two counts of armed assault with intent to kill,assault with a dangerous weapon,and various firearms offenses by a jury in the massachusetts superior court superior court following the shooting death of nabil essaid in december and an attempt to evade police in february.commonwealth scott.the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc has ably detailed the events leading to these charges as they could have been found by the jury,id.at,and they do not bear restatement here.the sole issue before us concerns the jury selection proceedings in the superior court.
jury selection in the superior court 
jury selection took place over two days,april and.on the first day of jury selection,the prosecutor sought a peremptory challenge against juror,an african american man.defense counsel objected under commonwealth soares,which bars the use of peremptory challenges to exclude members of discrete groups.id.at.the judge then asked the prosecutor,why the prosecutor cited juror responses to the court inquiry about concerns over the length of the trial namely,that juror had an upcoming job interview and was expecting a child that month.the judge responded that juror was one of the few black males in the room,adding,t here no difference between him and anyone else that been up here as a juror,other than the fact that he going to have a child.the prosecutor tried once more your honor,the other consideration,seemingly he did want to be here.the judge replied,nobody wants to be here.none of those people seated over there wants to be here.i not going to give you that.the judge then seated juror.
on the second day of jury selection,the prosecutor challenged juror,an african american woman,and juror,a latina.each time,defense counsel objected to the challenge under soares.when objecting to the prosecutor challenge to juror,defense counsel noted that she was the third or fourth person of color,the fourth person of color the commonwealth has challenged.the judge responded that he did not allow one of these challenges the challenge to juror and for t he others,there were neutral reasons in this county,they challenge everybody under,thirty,whatever.the judge then asked the prosecutor for a reason for the challenge the prosecutor did not give a reason but replied that there were a number of women of color whom he did not challenge and who were seated,indicating that there was no pattern.the prosecutor acknowledged the judge decision to seat juror over his challenge as a male,then reiterated,b ut there are a number of women of color who were seated on the jury yesterday.the judge permitted the prosecutor challenge and noted defense counsel objection.
defense counsel opposed the challenge to juror on the grounds that s he a hispanic female,member of the minority community.the prosecutor responded by again denying the existence of a pattern and noting that juror worked at a school where a man whom the prosecutor was trying for murder was employed.when asked,juror stated that she did not know the man being prosecuted.the prosecutor withdrew the challenge,and the judge seated juror.scott was convicted of murder in the first degree and related offenses.the superior court subsequently denied his motion for a new trial scott then filed an amended motion for a new trial which was also denied.
appeal to the massachusetts supreme judicial court 
on appeal to the sjc,scott argued,inter alia,that the superior court erred by allowing the prosecutor peremptory challenge of juror scott,at.the sjc began its opinion by observing that p eremptory challenges are presumed to be proper.id.at citing commonwealth maldonado.that presumption of propriety can be rebutted,the sjc noted,by demonstrating that there is a pattern of excluding members of a discrete group and it is likely that individuals are being excluded solely on the basis of their membership.id.
the sjc outlined the process for determining whether a peremptory challenge is improper under massachusetts law,explaining that the judge must make an initial finding as to whether the opposing party has made a prima facie showing that the use was improper.id.next,i f the judge concludes that the opposing party has established a prima facie case that the use was for a discriminatory purpose,the burden shifts to the party seeking to exercise the challenge to provide a explanation for that challenge.id.at.finally,t he judge must then determine whether the reason provided is bona fide or a sham offered to avoid admitting to group discrimination.id.at.the sjc stated that ultimately a determination whether the explanation offered is adequate to establish a permissible,nondiscriminatory basis for the challenge is within the sound discretion of the judge,and will not be disturbed so long as there is support for the ruling in the record.id.citing commonwealth leclair.
the sjc noted that a challenge to a single prospective juror within a protected class could,in some circumstances,constitute a prima facie case of impropriety where the venire contains few such individuals.id.quoting commonwealth fryar.moreover,it acknowledged that there are some circumstances in which a judge,by asking for a reason for the prosecutor challenge,may have implicitly found that a defendant has made a prima facie showing that the challenge was improper.id.citing commonwealth calderón.in certain situations,however,w here a venire contains a paucity of african americans,a judge has broad discretion to require an explanation without having to make the determination that a pattern of improper exclusion exists.id.quoting commonwealth van winkle.
regarding juror,the sjc found that the superior court judge did not supply a explanation by mentioning the under thirty reasoning.id.the sjc noted that the age remark was made before he asked the prosecutor for a reason,and after the judge had pointed out that either there had been reasons for earlier peremptory challenges,or that,in one instance,he had rejected the challenge and seated the male african american juror.id.the court reasoned that 
b y not requiring the prosecutor to provide a reason for the challenge after his initial statement that there was no pattern of discrimination,the judge plainly accepted the prosecutor assertion,unchallenged by the defendant,that a number of african american women had been seated without challenge on the previous day,and that there was no pattern of discrimination,thus concluding that the defendant had not met his burden of establishing a prima facie case.
id.the sjc concluded that it could not say that it was an abuse of discretion to allow the peremptory challenge to juror because defense counsel did not object to the argument that three african american jurors had already been seated.id.
scott then filed a petition for habeas corpus relief under.in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts district court alleging,again inter alia,that his state court convictions were contrary to,or constituted an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law in batson scott gelb,wl,at.july.the district court denied the petition,but granted a certificate of appealability.id.at.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court decision to deny habeas relief de novo.sánchez roden,cir.our de novo review encompasses the district court own determination of the appropriate standard of review of the state court proceeding.id.quoting zuluaga spencer,cir.the district court opinion is not entitled to deference.healy spencer,cir.rather,this court determine s whether the habeas petition should have been granted in the first instance.sánchez,at.
antiterrorism and effective death penalty act standards 
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,habeas relief 
shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d see hodge mendonsa,cir zuluaga,at when a habeas claim has been adjudicated on its merits in state court,aedpa mandates highly deferential federal court review of state court holdings.
an adjudication is on the merits giving rise to deference under d of aedpa,if there is a decision finally resolving the parties claims,with res judicata effect,that is based on the substance of the claim advanced,rather than on a procedural,or other,ground.yeboah sefah ficco,cir quoting teti bender,cir.a adjudication of an issue framed in terms of state law is nonetheless entitled to deference under section d as long as the state and federal issues are for all practical purposes synonymous and the state standard is at least as protective of the defendant rights.foxworth amand,cir.
here,we find the sjc analyzed scott batson claim using state law standards that were at least as protective as the federal standard,entitling that court to deference under d.id.at.in its opinion,the sjc cited and relied upon both maldonado,based in part on the standard set in soares,and fryar,which together ensure essentially the same protections as the standard set by batson and its progeny.scott,at see caldwell maloney,cir because the judge conducted an inquiry which was virtually identical to a batson inquiry and because the holding of soares is quite similar to the holding of batson,we do not accord the trial judge findings any less of a presumption of correctness citations omitted as such,we review the sjc decision under aedpa deferential standard.
clearly established federal law 
to determine whether a decision was contrary to supreme court precedent or constituted an unreasonable application of federal law under such precedent per d,this court look s to the supreme court holdings,as opposed to dicta,at the time the state court rendered its decision.hensley roden,cir citing gonzález fuentes molina,cir see thaler haynes,d.
the parties agree that batson,in which the supreme court held that the equal protection clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race,at,constitutes the clearly established federal law at issue.so,too,do we.
batson set forth a test for determining whether a prosecutor peremptory challenges against members of a group to which the defendant belongs constitute racial discrimination at.the batson court explained the first prong,requiring the defendant to make a prima facie case of discrimination,at length 
the defendant first must show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group,and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant race.second,the defendant is entitled to rely on the fact,as to which there can be no dispute,that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.finally,the defendant must show that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of their race.
at internal citations and quotation marks omitted see also johnson california,d a prima facie case of discrimination can be made out by offering a wide variety of evidence.the second prong of the batson test,reached only if the first is satisfied,requires the prosecution to respond.once the defendant makes the requisite showing,the burden shifts to the state to explain adequately the racial exclusion.id.at.the third prong falls to the court,as after the defendant has made a showing and the prosecution has responded,t he trial court then will have the duty to determine if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination.id.at.
while gelb engaged d to some extent,and the district court suggested that both d and d may be implicated,scott,wl,at,scott phrasing of the issue and arguments are limited to d and,further,to an unreasonable application of federal law.therefore,we,too,limit our consideration to d and the question of unreasonable application.
on appeal,this court asks,as the district court did,whether the massachusetts supreme judicial court determination that a prima facie case of discrimination had not been made out was an unreasonable application of batson and its supreme court progeny.scott,wl at.
d.an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law 
a state court adjudication constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.hensley,at quoting abrante amand,cir.for purposes of d,an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.harrington richter,d quoting williams taylor,d.a state court determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court decision.id.quoting yarborough alvarado,d.thus,to obtain federal habeas relief,a petitioner must show the state court ruling on the claim was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility of fairminded disagreement.id.at.i n considering a batson objection,or in reviewing a ruling claimed to be batson error,all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity must be consulted.snyder louisiana,d citing miller el drake miller el ii,d.
we have elsewhere held that where a defendant makes a batson objection on the basis of a bare numerical argument,i t i s the defendant burden to bring forward other reasons and to flesh out the record with regard to the numerical claim.united states girouard,cir.a defendant who advances a batson argument ordinarily should come forward with facts,not just numbers alone.united states bergodere,cir quoting united states moore,cir.while one sustained batson or equivalent challenge to a peremptory strike could in some instances raise an inference of discriminatory intent,that is not always the case.instead,consistent with the supreme court mandate in snyder,we must consider other factors including but not limited to the number of strikes involved in the conduct the nature of the prosecutor other strikes and,as the capstone,the presence of an alternative,explanation for the strike.girouard,at internal citation omitted.relevant to our inquiry here,other factors to which we may give some weight include the presence of other members of a certain group on the jury.see united states jesús,cir.not every case will present every factor,and accordingly each batson analysis will turn on the peculiarities of the proceedings below.what ultimately guides our review,however,is the principle that the constitution affords a defendant the right be tried by a jury of the defendant peers.to that end,batson and its progeny help guarantee that a defendant receives a fair trial by protecting a potential juror right not to be discriminated on account of his or her race.sánchez,at.
here,scott argues,in essence,that the trial judge unreasonably applied batson with respect to juror by stating a potential reason for the prosecutor challenge and failing to require an explanation from the prosecutor and that the sjc perpetuated that misapplication.we can not agree.
the sjc reasonably concluded that the trial judge found that scott had not met his burden to raise an inference of discrimination.neither does the superior court j
