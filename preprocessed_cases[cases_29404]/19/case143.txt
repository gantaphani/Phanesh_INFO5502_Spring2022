under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,a state prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus from a federal court must show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington richter,slip,at.the court of appeals for the sixth circuit purported to identify three such grievous errors in the ohio supreme court affirmance of respondent archie dixon murder conviction.because it is not clear that the ohio supreme court erred at all,much less erred so transparently that no fairminded jurist could agree with that court decision,the sixth circuit judgment must be reversed.

hammer mother reported her son missing the day after his murder.while investigating hammer disappearance,police had various encounters with dixon,three of which are relevant here.on november,a police detective spoke with dixon at a local police station.it is undisputed that this was a chance encounter dixon was apparently visiting the police station to retrieve his own car,which had been impounded for a traffic violation.the detective issued miranda warnings to dixon and then asked to talk to him about hammer disappearance.see miranda arizona.dixon declined to answer questions without his lawyer present and left the station.
as their investigation continued,police determined that dixon had sold hammer car and forged hammer signature when cashing the check he received in that sale.police arrested dixon for forgery on the morning of november.beginning at detectives intermittently interrogated dixon over several hours,speaking with him for about minutes total.prior to the interrogation,the detectives had decided not to provide dixon with miranda warnings for fear that dixon would again refuse to speak with them.
dixon readily admitted to obtaining the identification card in hammer name and signing hammer name on the check,but said that hammer had given him permission to sell the car.dixon claimed not to know where hammer was,although he said he thought hammer might have left for tennessee.the detectives challenged the plausibility of dixon tale and told dixon that tim hoffner was providing them more useful information.at one point a detective told dixon that now is the time to say whether he had any involvement in hammer disappearance because if tim starts cutting a deal over there,this is kinda like,a bus leaving.the first one that gets on it is the only one that gon na get on.app.to pet.for cert.dixon responded that,if hoffner knew anything about hammer disappearance,hoffner had not told him.dixon insisted that he had told police everything he knew and that he had n othing whatsoever to do with hammer disappearance,at.at approximately the interrogation concluded,and the detectives brought dixon to a correctional facility where he was booked on a forgery charge.
the same afternoon,hoffner led police to hammer grave.hoffner claimed that dixon had told him that hammer was buried there.after concluding their interview with hoffner and releasing him,the police had dixon transported back to the police station.
dixon arrived at the police station at about prior to any police questioning,dixon stated that he had heard the police had found a body and asked whether hoffner was in custody.the police told dixon that hoffner was not,at which point dixon said,i talked to my attorney,and i want to tell you what happened.state dixon,ohio.the police read dixon his miranda rights,obtained a signed waiver of those rights,and spoke with dixon for about half an hour.at the police,now using a tape recorder,again advised dixon of his miranda rights.in a detailed confession,dixon admitted to murdering hammer but attempted to pin the lion share of the blame on hoffner.
at dixon trial,the ohio trial court excluded both dixon initial confession to forgery and his later confession to murder.the state took an interlocutory appeal.the state did not dispute that dixon forgery confession was properly suppressed,but argued that the murder confession was admissible because dixon had received miranda warnings prior to that confession.the ohio court of appeals agreed and allowed dixon murder confession to be admitted as evidence.dixon was convicted of murder,kidnaping,robbery,and forgery,and sentenced to death.
the ohio supreme court affirmed dixon convictions and sentence.to analyze the admissibility of dixon murder confession,the court applied oregon elstad.the ohio supreme court found that dixon confession to murder after receiving miranda warnings was admissible because that confession and his prior,unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary.state dixon,supra,at,at see elstad,supra,at we hold today that a suspect who has once responded to unwarned yet uncoercive questioning is not thereby disabled from waiving his rights and confessing after he has been given the requisite miranda warnings 
dixon then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under in the district court for the northern district of ohio.dixon claimed,inter alia,that the state court decisions allowing the admission of his murder confession contravened clearly established federal law.the district court denied relief,but a divided panel of the sixth circuit reversed.dixon houk.
the sixth circuit had authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus only if the ohio supreme court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as set forth in this court holdings,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the state court record.d see harrington,at slip,at.the sixth circuit believed that the ohio supreme court decision contained three such egregious errors.
first,according to the sixth circuit,the miranda decision itself clearly established that police could not speak to dixon on november,because on november dixon had refused to speak to police without his lawyer.that is plainly wrong.it is undisputed that dixon was not in custody during his chance encounter with police on november.and this court has never held that a person can invoke his miranda rights anticipatorily,in a context other than custodial interrogation.mcneil wisconsin,see also montejo louisiana,slip,at if the defendant is not in custody then miranda and its progeny do not apply 
second,the sixth circuit held that police violated the fifth amendment by urging dixon to cut a deal before his accomplice hoffner did so the sixth circuit cited no precedent of this court or any court holding that this common police tactic is unconstitutional,elstad,supra,at t he court has refused to find that a defendant who confesses,after being falsely told that his codefendant has turned state evidence,does so involuntarily because no holding of this court suggests,much less clearly establishes,that police may not urge a suspect to confess before another suspect does so,the sixth circuit had no authority to issue the writ on this ground 
third,the sixth circuit held that the ohio supreme court unreasonably applied this court precedent in elstad.in that case,a suspect who had not received miranda warnings confessed to burglary as police took him into custody.approximately an hour later,after he had received miranda warnings,the suspect again confessed to the same burglary.this court held that the later,warned confession was admissible because there is no warrant for presuming coercive effect where the suspect initial inculpatory statement,though technically in violation of miranda,was voluntary.the relevant inquiry is whether,in fact,the second warned statement was also
