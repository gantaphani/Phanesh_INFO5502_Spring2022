after the ohio courts sentenced respondent spisak to death and denied his claims on direct appeal and collateral review,he filed a federal habeas petition claiming that,at his trial penalty phase,the instructions and verdict forms unconstitutionally required the jury to consider in mitigation only those factors that it unanimously found to be mitigating,see mills maryland,and his counsel inadequate closing argument deprived him of effective assistance of counsel,see strickland washington.the district court denied the petition,but the sixth circuit accepted both arguments and ordered relief.
because the state court upholding of the mitigation jury instructions and forms was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by this court,d,the sixth circuit was barred from reaching a contrary decision.the court of appeals erred in holding that the instructions and forms contravened mills,in which this court held that the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue violated the constitution because,read naturally,they told the jury that it could not find a particular circumstance to be mitigating unless all jurors agreed that the mitigating circumstance had been proved to exist,at.even assuming that mills sets forth the pertinent clearly established federal law for reviewing the decision in this case,the instructions and forms used here differ significantly from those in mills they made clear that,to recommend a death sentence,the jury had to find unanimously that each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances,but they did not say that the jury had to determine the existence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously.nor did they say anything about how or even whether the jury should make individual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance existed.they focused only on the overall question of balancing the aggravating and mitigating factors,and they repeatedly told the jury to consider all relevant evidence.thus,the instructions and verdict forms did not clearly bring about,either through what they said or what they implied,the constitutional error in the mills instructions.
similarly,the decision rejecting spisak claim was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of the law clearly established in strickland.d.to prevail on this claim,spisak must show,inter alia,that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,supra,at.even assuming that the closing argument was inadequate in the respects claimed by spisak,this court finds no reasonable probability that a better closing argument without these defects would have made a significant difference.any different,more adequate closing argument would have taken place in the following context spisak defense at the trial guilt phase consisted of an effort by counsel to show that spisak was not guilty by reason of insanity.counsel,apparently hoping to demonstrate spisak mentally defective condition,called him to the stand,where he freely admitted committing three murders and two other shootings and repeatedly expressed an intention to commit further murders if given the opportunity.in light of this background and for the following reasons,the assumed closing argument deficiencies do not raise the requisite reasonable probability of a different result but for the deficient closing.first,since the sentencing phase took place immediately after the guilt phase,the jurors had fresh in their minds the government extensive and graphic evidence regarding the killings,spisak boastful and unrepentant confessions,and his threats to commit further violent acts.second,although counsel did not summarize the mitigating evidence in great detail,he did refer to it,and the defense experts more detailed testimony regarding spisak mental illness was also fresh in the jurors minds.third,spisak does not describe what other mitigating factors counsel might have mentioned all those he proposes essentially consist of aspects of the mental defect factor that the defense experts described.finally,in light of counsel several appeals to the jurors sense of humanity,it is unlikely that a more explicit or elaborate appeal for mercy could have changed the result,either alone or together with the foregoing circumstances.the court need not reach spisak claim that d does not apply to his claim,because it would reach the same conclusion even on de novo review.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
frank spisak,the respondent,was convicted in an ohio trial court of three murders and two attempted murders.he was sentenced to death.he filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court,claiming that constitutional errors occurred at his trial.first,spisak claimed that the jury instructions at the penalty phase unconstitutionally required the jury to consider in mitigation only those factors that the jury unanimously found to be mitigating.see mills maryland.second,spisak claimed that he suffered significant harm as a result of his counsel inadequate closing argument at the penalty phase of the proceeding.see strickland washington.the federal court of appeals accepted these arguments and ordered habeas relief.we now reverse the court of appeals.
in,an ohio jury convicted spisak of three murders and two attempted murders at cleveland state university in.the jury recommended,and the judge imposed,a death sentence.the ohio courts denied spisak claims,both on direct appeal and on collateral review.state spisak,ohio,per curiam state spisak,wl ohio,cuyahoga,state spisak,ohio,per curiam.
spisak then sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.among other claims,he argued that the sentencing phase of his trial violated the constitution for the two reasons we consider here.the district court denied his petition.spisak coyle,case nd ohio,app.to pet.for cert.but the court of appeals accepted spisak two claims,namely,his mitigation instruction claim and his claim.spisak mitchell.the court of appeals consequently ordered the district court to issue a conditional writ of habeas corpus forbidding spisak execution,at.
the state of ohio then sought certiorari in this court.we granted the petition and vacated the court of appeals judgment.hudson spisak.we remanded the case for further consideration in light of two recent cases in which this court had held that lower federal courts had not properly taken account of the deference federal law grants determinations on federal habeas review.see d carey musladin,schriro landrigan.on remand,the sixth circuit reinstated its earlier opinion.spisak hudson.the state again sought certiorari.we again granted the petition.and we now reverse.
spisak first claim concerns the instructions and verdict forms that the jury received at the sentencing phase of his trial.the court of appeals held the sentencing instructions unconstitutional because,in its view,the instructions,taken together with the forms,require d juror unanimity as to the presence of a mitigating factor contrary to this court holding in mills maryland,supra,at.since the parties do not dispute that the ohio courts adjudicated this claim,they considered and rejected it on the merits,the law permits a federal court to reach a contrary decision only if the decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.unlike the court of appeals,we conclude that spisak claim does not satisfy this standard.
the parties,like the court of appeals,assume that mills sets forth the pertinent clearly established federal law.while recognizing some uncertainty as to whether mills was clearly established federal law for the purpose of reviewing the ohio supreme court opinion,we shall assume the same.compare williams taylor,stevens,for the court applicable date for purposes of determining whether federal law is established is when the conviction became final with,at,for the court applicable date is the time of the relevant decision see state spisak,ohio,decided,cert.denied,decided,mills maryland,supra decided june.
the rule the court set forth in mills is based on two principles.first,the constitution forbids imposition of the death penalty if the sentencing judge or jury is precluded from considering,as a mitigating factor,any aspect of a defendant character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.at quoting eddings oklahoma,in turn quoting lockett ohio,plurality opinion.second,the sentencing judge or jury may not refuse to consider or be precluded from considering any relevant mitigating evidence.mills,at quoting skipper south carolina,in turn quoting eddings,supra,at.
applying these principles,the court held that the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue in the case violated the constitution because,read naturally,they told the jury that it could not find a particular circumstance to be mitigating unless all jurors agreed that the mitigating circumstance had been proved to exist.mills,at.if,for example,the defense presents evidence of three potentially mitigating considerations,some jurors may believe that only the first is mitigating,some only the second,and some only the third.but if even one of the jurors believes that one of the three mitigating considerations exists,but that he is barred from considering it because the other jurors disagree,the court held,the constitution forbids imposition of the death penalty.see,at,see also mckoy north carolina,mills requires that each juror be permitted to consider and give effect to all mitigating evidence in deciding whether aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances because the instructions in mills would have led a reasonable juror to believe the contrary,the court held that the sentencing proceeding violated the constitution,at.
in evaluating the court of appeals determination here,we have examined the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue in mills and compared them with those used in the present case.in the mills sentencing phase,the trial judge instructed the jury to fill out a verdict form that had three distinct parts.section i set forth a list of specific aggravating circumstances next to which were spaces where the jury was to mark yes or no.just above the list,the form said 
based upon the evidence we unanimously find that each of the following aggravating circumstances which is marked yes has been proven and each aggravating circumstance which is marked no has not been proven.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
section ii set forth a list of eight potentially mitigating circumstances seven specific circumstances and the eighth designated as other next to which were spaces where the jury was to mark yes or no.just above the list the form said 
based upon the evidence we unanimously find that each of the following mitigating circumstances which is marked yes has been proven to exist and each mitigating circumstance marked no has not been proven.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
section iii set forth the overall balancing question,along with spaces for the jury to mark yes or no.it said 
based on the evidence we unanimously find that it has been proven that the mitigating circumstances marked yes in section ii outweigh the aggravating circumstances marked yes in section at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
explaining the forms,the judge instructed the jury with an example.he told the jury that it should mark yes on the jury form if it unanimously concluded that an aggravating circumstance had been proved,at.otherwise,he said,of course you must answer no.ibid.emphasis deleted.these instructions,together with the forms,told the jury to mark yes on section ii list of mitigating factors only if the jury unanimously concluded that the particular mitigating factor had been proved,and to consider in its weighing analysis in section iii only those mitigating factors marked yes in section ii.thus,as this court found,the jury was instructed that it could consider in the ultimate weighing of the aggravating and mitigating evidence only the mitigating factors that the jury had unanimously found to exist.see,at.
the instructions and jury forms in this case differ significantly from those in mills.the trial judge instructed the jury that the aggravating factors they would consider were the specifications that the jury had found proved beyond a reasonable doubt at the guilt phase of the trial essentially,that each murder was committed in a course of conduct including the other crimes,and,for two of the murders,that the murder was committed with the intent to evade apprehension or punishment for another offense.tr.july.
he then explained the concept of a mitigating factor.after doing so,he listed examples,including that the defendant because of a mental disease or defect lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.at.the court also told the jury that it could take account of any other mitigating consideration it found relevant to the issue of whether the defendant should be sentenced to death.at.and he instructed the jury that the state bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors,at.
with respect to the procedure by which the jury should reach its verdict,the judge told the jury only the following 
y ou,the trial jury,must consider all of the relevant evidence raised at trial,the evidence and testimony received in this hearing and the arguments of counsel.from this you must determine whether,beyond a reasonable doubt,the aggravating circumstances,which spisak has been found guilty of committing in the separate counts are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present in this case.if all twelve members of the jury find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance in each separate count outweighs the mitigating factors,then you must return that finding to the court.
on the other hand,if after considering all of the relevant evidence raised at trial,the evidence and the testimony received at this hearing and the arguments of counsel,you find that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances which spisak has been found guilty of committing in the separate counts outweigh the mitigating factors,you will then proceed to determine which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the court.at.
the judge gave the jury two verdict forms for each aggravating factor.the first of the two forms said 
we the jury in this case do find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance was sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present in this case.we the jury recommend that the sentence of death be imposed.at.
the other verdict form read 
we the jury do find that the aggravating circumstances are not sufficient to outweigh the mitigation factors present in this case.we the jury recommend that the defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment.at.
the instructions and forms made clear that,to recommend a death sentence,the jury had to find,unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt,that each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances.but the instructions did not say that the jury must determine the existence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously.neither the instructions nor the forms said anything about how or even whether the jury should make individual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance existed.they focused only on the overall balancing question.and the instructions repeatedly told the jury to conside r all of the relevant evidence.at.in our view the instructions and verdict forms did not clearly bring about,either through what they said or what they implied,the circumstance that mills found critical,namely,
a substantial possibility that reasonable jurors,upon receiving the judge instructions in this case,and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed,well may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance.at.
we consequently conclude that that the state court decision upholding these forms and instructions was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states in mills.d.
we add that the court of appeals found the jury instructions unconstitutional for an additional reason,that the instructions require d the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing alternatives.at citing maples coyle.we have not,however,previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for this reason.mills says nothing about the matter.neither the parties nor the courts below referred to beck alabama,or identified any other precedent from this court setting forth this rule.jones united states,rejecting an arguably analogous claim.but see post,at stevens,concurring in part and concurring in judgment.whatever the legal merits of the rule or the underlying verdict forms in this case were we to consider them on direct appeal,the jury instructions at spisak trial were not contrary to clearly established federal law.d.
spisak second claim is that his counsel closing argument at the sentencing phase of his trial was so inadequate as to violate the sixth amendment.to prevail,spisak must show both that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,strickland,at,and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,at.
the ohio supreme court held that spisak claim was not on the basis of our review of the record.state spisak,ohio,at,at citing,inter alia,strickland,supra.the district court concluded that counsel did a constitutionally adequate job and that t here simply is not a reasonable probability that,absent counsel alleged errors,the jury would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.spisak coyle,app.to pet.for cert.the court of appeals,however,reached a contrary conclusion.it held that counsel closing argument,measured by an objective standard of reasonableness,was inadequate,and it asserted that a reasonable probability exists that adequate representation would have led to a different result,at,quoting strickland,supra,at.responding to the state petition for certiorari,we agreed to review the court of appeals terse finding of a reasonable probability that a more adequate argument would have changed a juror vote.
in his closing argument at the penalty phase,spisak counsel described spisak killings in some detail.he acknowledged that spisak admiration for hitler inspired his crimes.he portrayed spisak as sick,twisted,and demented.tr.july.and he said that spisak was never going to be any different.ibid.he then pointed out that all the experts had testified that spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness.and,after a fairly lengthy and rambling disquisition about his own decisions about calling expert witnesses and preparing them,counsel argued that,even if spisak was not legally insane so as to warrant a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity,he nonetheless was sufficiently mentally ill to lessen his culpability to the point where he should not be executed.counsel also told the jury that,when weighing spisak mental illness against the substantial aggravating factors present in the case,at,the jurors should draw on their own sense of pride for living in a humane society made up of a humane people,at.that humanity,he said,required the jury to weigh the evidence fairly and to be loyal to that oath the jurors had taken to uphold the law,at.
spisak and his supporting amici say that this argument was constitutionally inadequate because it overly emphasized the gruesome nature of the killings it overly emphasized spisak threats to continue his crimes it understated the facts upon which the experts based their mental illness conclusions it said little or nothing about any other possible mitigating circumstance and it made no explicit request that the jury return a verdict against death.
we assume for present purposes that spisak is correct that the closing argument was inadequate.we nevertheless find no reasonable probability that a better closing argument without these defects would have made a significant difference.
any different,more adequate closing argument would have taken place in the following context spisak admitted that he had committed three murders and two other shootings.spisak defense at the guilt phase of the trial consisted of an effort by counsel to show that spisak was not guilty by reason of insanity.and counsel,apparently hoping to demonstrate spisak mentally defective condition,called him to the stand.
spisak testified that he had shot and killed horace rickerson,timothy sheehan,and brian warford.he also admitted that he had shot and tried to kill john hardaway,and shot at coletta dartt.he committed these crimes,he said,because he was a follower of adolf hitler,who was spisak spiritual leader in a war for survival of the aryan people.at,july.he said that he had purchased guns and stockpiled ammunition to further this war,at.and he had hoped to create terror at cleveland state university,because it was one of the prime targets where the jews and the system are brainwashing the youth.at.
spisak then said that in february he had shot rickerson,who was black,because rickerson had made a sexual advance on spisak in a university bathroom.he expressed satisfaction at having eliminated that particular threat to me and to the white race.at july.in june he saw a stranger,john hardaway,on a train platform and shot him seven times because he had been looking for a black person to kill as blood atonement for a recent crime against two white women,at july.he added that he felt good after shooting hardaway because he had accomplished something,but later felt k ind of bad when he learned that hardaway had survived,at.in august,spisak shot at coletta dartt because,he said,he heard her making some derisive remarks about us,meaning the nazi party,at.later that august,he shot and killed timothy sheehan because he thought he was one of those jewish professors that liked to hang around in the men room and seduce and pervert and subvert the young people that go there.at july.spisak added that he was sorry about that murder because he later learned sheehan was jewish like i thought he was.ibid.and three days later,while on a search and destroy mission,he shot and killed brian warford,a young black man who looked like he was almost asleep in a bus shelter,to fulfill his duty to inflict the maximum amount of casualties on the enemies.at.
spisak also testified that he would continue to commit similar crimes if he had the chance.he said about warford murder that he did want to get caught that time because i wanted to be able to do it again and again and again and again.at july.in a letter written to a friend,he called the murders of rickerson and warford the finest thing i ever did in my whole life and expressed a wish that he had a human submachine gun right now so i could exterminate black men and watch them scream and twitch in agony.at.and he testified that,if he still had his guns,he would escape from jail,go out and continue the war i started,and continue to inflict the maximum amount of damage on the enemies as i am able to do.at.
the state replied by attempting to show that spisak was lying in his testimony about the motives for these crimes.the state contended instead that the shootings were motivated by less unusual purposes,such as robbery.see,at.
the defense effort to show that spisak was not guilty by reason of insanity foundered when the trial judge refused to instruct the jury to consider that question and excluded expert testimony regarding spisak mental state.the defense expert witness,oscar markey,had written a report diagnosing spisak as suffering from a schizotypal personality disorder and an atypical psychotic disorder,and as,at times,unable to control his impulses to assault.at,july.his testimony was somewhat more ambiguous during a voir dire,however.on,he conceded that he could not say spisak failed ohio sanity standard at the time of the murders.after markey made the same concession before the jury,the court granted the prosecution renewed motion to exclude markey testimony and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony that it heard.and the court excluded the defense proffered reports from other psychologists and psychiatrists who examined spisak,because none of the reports said that spisak met the ohio insanity standard at the time of the crimes,at,at,july.
during the sentencing phase of the proceedings,defense counsel called three expert witnesses,all of whom testified that spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness.sandra mcpherson,a clinical psychologist,said that spisak suffered from schizotypal and borderline personality disorders characterized by bizarre and paranoid thinking,gender identification conflict,and emotional instability.she added that these defects substantially impair his ability to conform himself to the law requirements,at,july.kurt bertschinger,a psychiatrist,testified that spisak suffered from a schizotypal personality disorder and that mental illness does impair his reason to the extent that he has substantial inability to know wrongfulness,or substantial inability to refrain.at.markey,whose testimony had been stricken at the guilt phase,again testified and agreed with the other experts diagnoses,at,july.
in light of this background and for the following reasons,we do not find that the assumed deficiencies in defense counsel closing argument raise a reasonable probability that,but for the deficient closing,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.we therefore can not find the ohio supreme court decision rejecting spisak claim to be an unreasonable application of the law clearly established in strickland.d.
first,since the sentencing phase took place immediately following the conclusion of the guilt phase,the jurors had fresh in their minds the government evidence regarding the killings which included photographs of the dead bodies,images that formed the basis of defense counsel vivid descriptions of the crimes as well as spisak boastful and unrepentant confessions and his threats to commit further acts of violence.we therefore do not see how a less descriptive closing argument with fewer disparaging comments about spisak could have made a significant difference.
similarly fresh in the jurors minds was the three defense experts testimony that spisak suffered from mental illness.the jury had heard the experts explain the specific facts upon which they had based their conclusions,as well as what they had learned of his family background and his struggles with gender identity.and the jury had heard the experts draw connections between his mental illness and the crimes.we do not see how it could have made a significant difference had counsel gone beyond his actual argument which emphasized mental illness as a mitigating factor and referred the jury to the experts testimony by repeating the facts or connections that the experts had just described.
nor does spisak tell us what other mitigating factors counsel might have mentioned.all those he proposes essentially consist of aspects of the mental defect factor that the defense experts described.
finally,in light of counsel several appeals to the jurors sense of humanity he used the words humane people and humane society times at various points in the argument we can not find that a more explicit or more elaborate appeal for mercy could have changed the result,either alone or together with the other circumstances just discussed.thus,we conclude that there is not a reasonable probability that a more adequate closing argument would have changed the result,and that the ohio supreme court rejection of spisak claim was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of strickland.d.
spisak contends that the deferential standard of review under d should not apply to this claim because the ohio supreme court may not have reached the question whether counsel closing argument caused spisak prejudice.that is,the ohio supreme court summary rejection of this claim did not indicate whether that court rested its conclusion upon a finding that counsel was not ineffective,or that a better argument would not have made a difference,or both.see state spisak,ohio,at,at.spisak argues that,under these circumstances,a federal court should not defer to a state court that may not have decided a question,but instead should decide the matter afresh.lower federal courts have rejected arguments similar to spisak.see,hennon cooper,see also weeks angelone,applying the d standard in case involving a state court summary denial of a claim,though not a strickland claim,and without full briefing regarding whether or how d applied to a summary decision chadwick janecka,alito,relying on weeks in holding that d applies where a state court denies a claim on the merits without giving any indication how it reached its decision see generally hertz liebman,federal habeas corpus practice and procedure,ed.and supp.however,we need not decide whether deference under d is required here.with or without such deference,our conclusion is the same.
for these reasons,the judgment of the court of appeals for the sixth circuit is reversed.
it is so ordered.
keith smith,warden,petitioner frank spisak.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice stevens,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
in my judgment the court of appeals correctly concluded that two errors that occurred during spisak trial violated clearly established federal law.first,the jury instructions impermissibly required that the jury unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing options.second,the closing argument of spisak counsel was so egregious that it was constitutionally deficient under any standard.nevertheless,for the reasons set forth in part iii of the court opinion,ante,at,i agree that these errors did not prejudice spisak and thus he is not entitled to relief.
the jury instructions given during spisak penalty phase,described in the court opinion,ante,at,are fairly read to require the jury first to consider whether the death penalty is warranted,whether the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors before moving on to consider whether instead a lesser penalty,one of two available life sentences is appropriate.consistent with ohio law at the time of spisak trial the jury was told that it must reach its decision unanimously.the jury was not instructed on the consequence of their failure to agree unanimously that spisak should be sentenced to death.spisak and the court of appeals both described these instructions as acquittal first because they would have led a reasonable jury to believe that it first had to acquit the defendant of death unanimously before it could give effect to a lesser penalty.
following its prior decision in davis mitchell,in which it struck down virtually identical jury instructions,spisak mitchell,the court of appeals concluded that the instructions given during spisak penalty phase were impermissible because they require d the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing alternatives,at.in davis,the court had explained that an instruction that requires a capital jury to first unanimously reject the death penalty before it can consider a life sentence precludes the individual jury from giving effect to mitigating evidence at.the source of this constitutional infirmity,the court decided,was our decision in mills maryland.for the reasons cogently ex
