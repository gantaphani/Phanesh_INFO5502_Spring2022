francisco rodríguez soler wants us to undo his conviction for various drug and firearm charges.his appeal rises or falls depending on whether the district judge slipped by admitting pictures showing him with accused coconspirators and by allowing police officers to testify about the pics.his appeal falls,for reasons revealed below.and so when all is said and done,we affirm.
reader alert 
if our defendant were questioning the sufficiency of the evidence against him,we would of course narrate the facts in the light most flattering to the government.see,united states tum,cir.but for cases like his ones with no sufficiency challenge,just plenty of evidentiary issues there is surprisingly no clear consensus on the subject.some opinions say that we can still retell the facts in the light most favorable to the government.see,united states bunchan,cir united states benedetti,cir united states mercado,cir.others say that we ought to present the facts in a balanced way,without favoring either side.see,united states felton,cir united states bartelho,cir united states procopio,cir.as best we can tell,we are the first panel to note this split.but whatever the exact contours of our review,none of it matters here for even using the approach which is surely the better of the two from a defendant perspective,rodríguez soler appeal still falters.
how the case got here 
a federal grand jury indicted rodríguez soler for conspiring to possess illegal drugs with intent to distribute within feet of a protected area conspiring to possess a firearm during and in relation to a crime and possessing or aiding and abetting the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime the government theory of guilt at trial was straightforward rodríguez soler served as the man to christian figueroa alvardo,also known as tatón which is what we will call him,who ran a drug point at a complex.and the government offered much evidence in the hopes of proving its case.
for example,some accused conspirators having flipped after getting caught testified about how rodríguez soler was one of the bosses at the drug point,supervising the conspiracy underlings and handling problems whenever the need arose,procuring and preparing drugs for sale,carrying and using guns to protect the conspiracy turf.and a number of police officers testified about their investigation of the case,like how they had set up video equipment in empty apartments to record what was going on at the drug point and how they had given informants hidden cameras to capture drug buys.one officer also explained how he had found rodríguez soler cell phone at an area in the complex where drug deals went down.the phone had a photo of rodríguez soler holding what appeared to be a rifle.
on top of that,the jury had before it two key categories of exhibits admitted through the officers testimony.the first involved surveillance videos,one of which showed rodríguez soler getting out of his car near the drug point and talking to conspirators.the second involved two sets of photos.
set one showed rodríguez soler with conspiracy members outside a police station following tatón arrest on an unrelated charge.for simplicity we will call these pics the photos.rodríguez soler lawyer did not object when the judge admitted them,though he did object unsuccessfully on relevance and prejudice grounds after an officer id a few persons in the pics and was about to say what he had seen one of them doing at the housing project before that officer later testified without objection that those appearing with rodríguez soler in the photos were under investigation for the criminality occurring at the drug point.later still another officer testified without objection that rodríguez soler went to the station with other persons who are also members of tatón organization to find out what had happened.and then a third officer testified without objection that those who ended up outside the station were not under arrest but had gone there to support tatón,who was this group leader.i took a photograph of them,the officer said,and that was the first time that i had seen him meaning rodríguez soler.
the second set of pics showed rodríguez soler with conspiracy members after being pulled over for an unrelated traffic violation near the drug point.our defendant was the car driver.for clarity we will call these pics the photos.rodríguez soler lawyer voiced no objection when the judge admitted these photos into evidence or when the officer testified about them.
undaunted,rodríguez soler tried hard to poke holes in the government case.his lawyer,for starters,vigorously the cooperating witnesses about their motives for testifying,touching on the agreements they had negotiated with prosecutors and exploring their lives of crime.his attorney also got the officers to admit to various things,including that one can not tell by looking at the photo whether the rifle was real or fake,that not everyone appearing in the surveillance videos was a drug dealer,and that nothing shows the police found drugs during the traffic stop.rodríguez soler witnesses described him as a respectful,hardworking university student who did not sell drugs and was always trying to improve himself.even rodríguez soler took the stand,testifying that he lived at the housing complex in a building near the drug point,that he had parking near the drug point,that he owned no guns,that he had known tatón and other alleged conspirators for years but had no clue that they were drug dealers,that the police found no drugs during the traffic stop,and that he had nothing to do with the drug point.
the jury found rodríguez soler guilty on all counts.and the judge sentenced him to concurrent month prison terms on counts and,and a consecutive month prison term on count.
rodríguez soler appeals his conviction,criticizing the judge for admitting both sets of photos and the related testimony about his being with conspiracy members.all this evidence,he says,is of a character,suggesting that he was a conspirator simply because he palled around with conspirators.in a slight variation on this theme,he also contends the evidence primed the jury to think that he was a bad man because he hung out with horse thieves and was a traffic violator illegal doings horse thievery and traffic infractions unrelated to the crimes that landed him in prison.and he complains that the officers essentially told the jury that they had snapped his photo as part of an investigation into the conspiracy which,his argument continues,conveyed to the jury that they thought he was a conspiracy member too.so,reaching a crescendo,he claims the evidence is irrelevant,prejudicial,and constitutes forbidden evidence.see,and.we think he is wrong,for reasons we now explain.
our analysis 
a the standards of review 
figuring out the applicable standards of review here is tricky.take the relevance and prejudice issues.the parties who agree on little else both think rodríguez soler protested enough below to argue on appeal about the relevance and prejudice of the evidence the photos and the testimony concerning his being with conspirators.if true,that would trigger review a standard that requires a challenger to show that no rational person could accept the judge decision.see,united states maldonado,cir united states polanco,cir.one could quibble with their shared view after all,even rodríguez soler concedes his counsel did not initially object to the introduction of the photos plus he says more here about relevance and prejudice than he did below.but we will give him the benefit of the doubt on this point.polanco,at commenting that w e need not wrestle with the question of whether the defendant did enough to preserve an issue because he still loses using the standard.still,he raised no relevance or prejudice objection below regarding the evidence the photos and the testimony about his being with conspirators.so we review this matter only for plain error an demanding standard,requiring him to show error,plainness,prejudice to him and the threat of a miscarriage of justice.see united states jones,cir alteration in original quoting united states torres rosario,cir.
as for the issue,rodríguez soler never objected to the or the evidence on this basis.and that means he must also run the gauntlet of review to get anywhere with this argument.
now on to rodríguez soler claims.
the rule issue 
up first is the relevance issue.as rodríguez soler tells it,the and evidence had nothing to do with the charged conspiracy.ergo,he says,the evidence was irrelevant.
the problem for rodríguez soler is that federal rules of evidence set a very low bar for relevance.see,united states cotto aponte,cir.rule says emphasis ours that if the evidence has any tendency to make a material fact more or less likely,it is relevant.see bielunas misty dawn,cir noting how t he definition of relevance is quite expansive,which helps explain why a argument is usually a tough sell.and the evidence here clears this modest bar with ease,because it tends to show at least to some degree that rodríguez soler knew some of the conspirators while the conspiracy was raging.actually,it tends to show that he knew some of them fairly well well enough to a go with members to the station to help the conspiracy leader,who was there on an unrelated charge and b drive members around before being stopped by the police for an unrelated traffic infraction.
now a conspiracy member need not know all his fellow coconspirators.see,united states rivera calderón,cir.but evidence tying one alleged member to another or others certainly is relevant.see united states anello,cir breyer,explaining that telephone messages between alleged conspirators were relevant because they tended to prove that some of them knew each other.and it matters not whether the evidence conclusively ties rodríguez soler to the charged crime.see,e,rivera calderón,at.m ost convictions result from the cumulation of bits of proof which,taken singly,would not be enough in the mind of a fair minded person.united states pugliese,cir.when it comes to relevancy,then,what matters is that each bit may have enough rational connection with the issue to be considered a factor contributing to an answer.see also rivera calderón,at.and again,the evidence fits the bill.
let us be perfectly clear.merely hanging out with criminals hardly suffices to prove participation in a conspiracy.see,polanco,at united states benavente gomez,cir.and nothing we say today is intended to suggest anything to the contrary.but our focus,once again,is on relevancy,not sufficiency.and because the evidence moves the knowledge inquiry forward to some degree,it is relevant even though standing alone it is not enough to convict him.
the bottom line is this.the relevancy requirement is not very hard to meet.see,polanco,at.and it is met here.so we reject rodríguez soler claim that the judge abused his wide discretion in ruling the evidence relevant.and using the regime a standard that is not,see,united states williams,cir we also reject his claim that the judge should have deemed the evidence not relevant.generally torres rivera cancel,cir finding that a judge action was not abuse of discretion and,thus,was not plain error.enough said on that.
the rule issue 
of course even relevant evidence can be excluded if its probative value is substantially overbalanced by other things,like the danger of unfair prejudice.that is what rule says.seizing on this rule,rodríguez soler complains that the contested evidence prejudiced him by inviting the jury to convict because of guilt by association suggesting conspirators flock together,because he was a bad person showing he cavorted with horse rustlers and was a traffic offender,and because the officers said they took his pics as they zeroed in on the conspiracy implying he was in on the conspiracy too.these are not easy arguments to win on.for one thing,he faces difficult standards of review abuse of discretion on some issues,plain error on others.for another as we have said time and again only in the rarest and most compelling cases will we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reject a judge rule ruling.see dirico city of quincy,cir parenthetically quoting united states sabetta,cir.
probative worth 
the same qualities that make the disputed evidence relevant give it a probative value too.as we just said though we say it again,because the point can not be emphasized enough innocent association with those involved in illegal activities can never form the sole basis for a conviction.united states ortiz,cir.but and it is a very big but the existence of a close relationship between a defendant and others involved in criminal activity can,as a part of a larger package of proof,assist in supporting an inference of involvement in illicit activity.id.and the contested evidence falls squarely within the latter category,the photos and accompanying testimony suggest an intimacy of association that is a factor which,with others,can rather quickly add up to circumstantial proof of criminality.see id.at parenthetically quoting united states francomano,cir.
hoping to downplay the evidence probative worth,rodríguez soler tries to distinguish ortiz away.the evidence there,unlike here,involved the defendant association with other conspirators or accomplices occurring at or near the scene of the crime.or so he argues.but his effort fails.
ortiz involved a defendant named nunez who drove with a drug dealer to a drug deal involving a customer who was really an undercover dea agent.see at.things hit a snag,because the dealer had packaged too much cocaine a kilo rather than the half a kilo.id.no worries,the dealer said.he would go back to his house with nunez and repackage the product.id.at.nunez chimed in,seconding the dealer plan.id.the dealer later met up with the agent,this time with nunez,defendant ortiz,in tow and with a half a kilo bag of cocaine in plain view.id.at.ortiz did not say a word as the deal went down.id.at.
affirming ortiz conviction for aiding and abetting a scheme,we thought it significant that he and nunez were.id.at.then came the money quote referenced above 
while innocent association with those involved in illegal activities can never form the sole basis for a conviction,the existence of a close relationship between a defendant and others involved in criminal activity can,as a part of a larger package of proof,assist in supporting an inference of involvement in illicit activity.
id.citations omitted.rodríguez soler reads this passage as applying only to ortiz and the dealer ties ties,he notes,that put them together at the crime scene.but even a quick skim of ortiz confirms that this passage deals with ortiz and nunez ties who were never together at the crime scene.given this reality,rodríguez soler bid to minimize ortiz effect on the question by hinting that the case reach is limited to association evidence tied to the criminals presence at or near the crime scene goes nowhere.
if more were needed and we doubt that it is united states vega molina,cir,also throws cold water on his effort to discount the evidence probative worth.there a quartet of criminals got arrested for running a scheme in puerto rico that resulted in the kidnappee death.id.at.at trial one defendant challenged the admission of photos of him with other codefendants.id.at.the pics were of them at a connecticut hotel about a month after the crimes occurred,not of them at or near the puerto rico crime scenes,and not of them doing any acts related to the crimes of conviction nothing in the opinion suggests otherwise.see id.yet we did not back away from ortiz.instead we doubled down,saying,w e have held before,and today reaffirm,that the existence of a close relationship between a defendant and others involved in criminal activity can,as part of a larger package of proof,assist in supporting an inference of involvement in illicit activity.id.quoting ortiz,at.and we okayed the photos admission because they showed that the appellants had an intimate relationship with one another.id.again,that devastates rodríguez soler attempt to recast ortiz as requiring evidence of a defendant association with others at or near the crime scene.
unfair prejudice 
as for prejudice,we do not deny that the
