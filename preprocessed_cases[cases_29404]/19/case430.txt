melvin hernández maldonado pled guilty in october to being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm,in violation of g,and was sentenced to months imprisonment.
he now seeks to vacate his plea because the district court did not warn him that he could not withdraw his plea if the court did not follow the parties sentencing recommendations,as required by federal rule of criminal procedure c b,though the plea agreement did contain this warning.under the plea agreement,the government agreed to recommend months imprisonment,and hernández maldonado agreed to request months.the plea agreement specified the sentencing guideline range was between and months,with a maximum penalty of months.hernández maldonado also challenges his month sentence as unreasonable.
we affirm hernández maldonado conviction and sentence.hernández maldonado has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for the district court failure to advise him that he could not withdraw his plea if it did not follow the government recommendation,he would not have entered the plea.furthermore,the sentence the district court imposed was procedurally and substantively reasonable.
we confine our discussion of the facts to those necessary to frame the issues on appeal.the relevant facts are not in dispute.on march,a woman told two puerto rico police department agents that a man was being robbed and pointed to him.the agents observed three individuals in a ford explorer suv wearing masks.when the individuals in the suv saw the agents,they left the scene,first in the suv and then on foot.the agents pursued the individuals and saw the driver was carrying a firearm.one agent saw the driver toss the firearm and then remove his mask and shirt as he ran.the agent recovered the firearm a pistol with an attached chip,which allowed the pistol to fire automatically.the driver was later identified as hernández maldonado.the investigation revealed that the suv was stolen and that hernández maldonado had previously been convicted on two occasions of crimes punishable by more than one year imprisonment.one of these convictions was for murder.hernández maldonado was on probation for that crime when he was arrested.
hernández maldonado,through different counsel,seeks to vacate his guilty plea because the district court failed to meet the requirement of federal rule of criminal procedure c b that,t o the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in rule c b,the court must advise the defendant that the defendant has no right to withdraw the plea if the court does not follow the recommendation or request.because there was no objection,the district court failure to give the required warning is reviewed for plain error.see united states dominguez benitez,d united states borrero acevedo,cir citing united states vonn,d.hernández maldonado must prove an error,that is clear or obvious,which affects his substantial rights and which seriously impugns the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the proceeding.united states correa osorio,cir.
because it is clear that the defendant has established the first two prongs,this case turns on the third prong of the plain error test,effect on substantial rights.see borrero acevedo,at.to meet the third prong of the plain error test,a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea,on the ground that the district court committed plain error under rule,must show a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.dominguez benitez,at.hernández maldonado has failed to make this showing.
we look to the full record.id.at citing vonn,at.relevant factors include,inter alia,the defendant statements at the colloquy,the overall strength of the government case and any possible defenses that appear from the record,and the inclusion of the warning in the plea agreement.see id.at.
hernández maldonado signed a plea agreement,which itself contained the required warning.he stated that he had time to consult with his attorney and was satisfied with the attorney services.further,he acknowledged that under the plea agreement,he surrendered the right to appeal if the court sentenced pursuant to the recommendation suggesting hernández maldonado understood he could appeal if the court did not sentence according the recommendation.
whether or not hernández maldonado subjectively believed he had a strong case,the question is whether he has met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that he would not have pled guilty if the missing warning had been administered.see id.at.hernández maldonado has not come close to meeting that burden.he is no neophyte to the criminal justice system.he voluntarily entered into a plea agreement and received the benefit of a month sentence recommendation from the government,below the maximum penalty.this plea agreement specifically warned that he could not withdraw his plea if the court refused to accept the government recommendations.this fact,uncontested by hernández maldonado,tends to show that the rule error made no difference to the outcome here.id.at.
hernández maldonado also argues that the district court month sentence,at the top of the guideline recommendation and five months below the month maximum,was unreasonable.he contends that his history and characteristics,including his completion of high school and steady employment despite a troubled childhood,dictated a lower sentence.hernández maldonado acknowledges that he did not object to the sentence at sentencing and concedes that his sentence is reviewed for plain error.see united states ruiz huertas,wl,at cir.july.we recognize that other circuits have not required a defendant to object at sentencing to preserve a substantive reasonableness challenge.id.at collecting cases.this court,however,has held that a failure to interpose an objection in the district court to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence begets plain error review.id.avoiding the question and assuming the abuse of discretion standard applies see also united states murphy cordero,cir we discern no error,plain or otherwise.
we review sentences for procedural and substantive reasonableness.ruiz huertas,wl,at.the district court sentence was neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable.
to the extent hernández maldonado challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence,that claim fails.united states crespo ríos,cir the lack of an adequate explanation can be characterized as either a procedural error or a challenge to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.procedural reasonableness includes that the district court committed no significant procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.united states martin,cir quoting gall united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.the district court did not improperly calculate the guidelines range,fail to consider the a factors,or commit any other procedural error.
hernández maldonado sentence was also substantively reasonable.t here is almost always a range of reasonable sentences for any given offense t he linchpin of a reasonable sentence is a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result.united states santiago rivera,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.furthermore,reversals in substantive reasonableness challenges are particularly unlikely when the sentence imposed fits within the compass of a properly calculated guidelines sentencing range.ruiz huertas,wl,at alterations in original quoting united states vega salgado,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
hernández maldonado has prior convictions,including one for murder.when he was on probation he was in a stolen vehicle,in a mask,in possession of a machine gun.in an attempt to evade the puerto rico police department,he ran across a highway,creating danger not only to the police but those on the road.the district court explicitly stated that it reviewed the guideline calculations a
