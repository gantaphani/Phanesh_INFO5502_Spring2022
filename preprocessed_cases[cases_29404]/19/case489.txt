words are slippery things.take malice,its legal definitions alone can encompass the intent to commit a wrongful act,reckless disregard for the law,ill will,wickedness of heart,and the intent to kill.see black law dictionary ed.but can malice fifty shades of meaning include improper motive former flight attendant nancy gray,convicted of providing false information regarding a bomb threat on an airplane,seeks to convince us that she was denied a fundamentally fair trial when her jury was instructed that malice meant evil purpose or improper motive.because we find that the district court definition just wo fly,we vacate gray conviction and remand this case for a new trial.
backgrounda.bomb on board 
by september of,nancy gray had been an american airlines flight attendant for over ten years.on september,she was scheduled to work flight from boston to miami.that afternoon,gray and the rest of the flight crew boarded and began their safety checks as the cabin service crew cleaned the aircraft.
cabin service crew member john marino worked his way from the back of the plane to the front,cleaning first the rear lavatories,then the middle lav before finishing with the first class lav.this task included restocking the dispensers with paper towels,tissues,and toilet paper.to restock the paper towels,marino had to unlatch and open a small door to access the storage area behind the towel dispenser.when he opened that door in the middle lav on flight,marino did not see anything written on the inside of the door.while marino was finishing up in the first class cabin,he saw a female flight attendant gray enter the middle lav,and come out again.
gray then hurried over to the lead flight attendant and told him that she had found a note in the middle lav.together they went back to the lav,where the lead flight attendant saw,written on the inside of the storage compartment door,the words bomb on board bos mia.they then rushed to the cockpit to notify the captain.had begun,and by the time they returned to the middle lav with the captain,it was occupied by a passenger.once he could enter the lav,the captain saw the message and decided to stop boarding and notify the authorities.
the aircraft was evacuated and towed to a remote area of logan airport where,over a period of several hours,it was searched.no bomb was found.
b.the confession 
on december,gray,whose job was suspended at the time,contacted fbi special agent joseph devuono at his office at international airport to request an interview to clear her name.they arranged to meet at devuono office on the morning of december.gray arrived at around,carrying a very large sized soft drink.devuono offered her a cup of coffee,which she declined,but at her request,he bought her a chocolate bar.gray met with devuono and special agent david mertz for an hour and a half before taking a break.at the break,gray who had been sipping the soda and eating the candy bar during the interview sought and received permission to test her blood sugar level gray showed the agents that her blood sugar was,and indicated that it was a good number and that she felt fine.
gray next met with special agent jay cherry,who interviewed her for approximately two hours devuono then rejoined gray and conducted a final hour and a half interview,during which she wrote and signed the following confession 
after careful consideration and with deep regret and remorse i take blame for writing on the door on sept,boston to miami.the codes bos mia were already on the door.i did not have anything to do with any other threats made,ever to american airlines.after i did it i realized what i had done.i have been under extreme,stressful personal things in my life.after the ground worker called me a fucking bitch i snapped for a moment.i care deeply about aa,crew the passengers.i have loved my job still do.i will never do it again.to clarify what i wrote bomb on board it was wrong.i truly sorry.i never want a to happen again and i did it more to get the ground workers in trouble than cause what i did.
she left the fbi office at,and according to devuono,she did not appear impaired or disoriented.according to her,scot brewer,when gray returned home around,she was walking funny,talking in slurred speech and asking to see her mother,who had died ten years earlier.brewer gave her sweet tea and a poptart and she slowly started to come back around.
c.the trial 
on august,a grand jury indicted gray for giving false information regarding a bomb threat on an airplane in violation of gray pled not guilty 
during the trial that ensued,the government introduced gray signed confession into evidence,and elicited testimony from the fbi special agents,american airlines employees,and several crew members of flight about the bomb hoax incident and subsequent investigation.flight attendant stacy hyde testified to a possible motive,saying that gray was very upset with american airlines handling of a medical issue she had.on direct examination,hyde recalled that,previous to the day of the flight,gray had told her that she was going to,get back at them.during,hyde was shown the statement she made to a state police officer immediately following the bomb hoax.at that time,she did not report that gray said she get back at american airlines.rather,she quoted gray as saying they never be able to fire me,i have to quit.
gray,brewer,testified that gray seemed incoherent and disoriented when he spoke to her after she left her fbi interview gray did not take the stand.
d.the jury instructions 
both gray and the government submitted proposed jury instructions.because the statute she was accused of violating requires the government to prove that gray wrote the threat knowing the information to be false,willfully and maliciously or with reckless disregard for the safety of human life,both parties offered instructions defining maliciously.citing sand modern federal jury instructions criminal,instruction,gray suggested the definition t o act maliciously means to do something with an evil purpose or motive.citing united states gullett,cir,the government offered t o act maliciously means to act intentionally or with willful disregard of the likelihood that damage or injury would result.
the district court conducted a charging conference,during which the government pointed out that this circuit has never defined malice in the context of.the government argued that absent any legislative history,the definition the government had offered was the better standard.nevertheless,the court determined that it would sharpen the instruction by including the definition of malice offered by the defense.the court then instructed the jury,saying 
and then we turn to the question of what we call malice,willful or malicious conduct.to act maliciously in this context means to do something with an evil purpose or motive.it means to do something that is knowingly wrong,and here suggestions have been made that gray had some malice toward american airlines.but the g overnment has to prove that and you have to evaluate it.emphasis added.
at the conclusion of jury instruction,the court held a sidebar conference and the government objected to the definition of malice,arguing that the jury did need to find motive at all,that evil intent was sufficient.the court noted that evil purpose or motive was phrased in the disjunctive,and added i understand the objection.i think i am going to leave it where it is.however,after sidebar,the court again addressed malice,telling the jury what malice means is to act with an evil purpose or an improper motive,that is or,and it is up to you to decide whether or not the circumstances under these conditions,if you find them,constitute either acting with an evil purpose or acting with an improper motive.emphasis added.defense counsel asked for a sidebar and pointed out that i think under sand modern federal jury instruction it evil purpose or evil motive.improper purpose sic i think lessens the burden.the court replied no,it does,and the jury was sent to deliberate.
an hour and twenty minutes later,the jury sent a note back with a question what are the criteria to consider for a verdict the court noted to the attorneys that defense counsel was concerned about the use of the word improper and asked counsel what,assuming that i am going to respond more specifically about malice,do you want defense counsel continued to argue for evil purpose or motive.the court offered its own definition and,after some discussion,defense counsel asked for a brief break to review the relevant cases the court agreed,and suggested that,so the jury could keep working,it would send back just the four elements under the statute,and would wait to see if they ask more about maliciously.both parties agreed.minutes later,the jury returned,not with a question,but with a verdict guilty.gray was sentenced to months in prison,with three years of supervised release.this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
gray makes several arguments on appeal,but one we find dispositive she argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury that malice could be an improper purpose,thus reducing the government burden of proof.the government counters that gray argument should be deemed waived,and that in any event,the court instruction was correct.
the government asserts that gray offers us only a skeletal,perfunctory argument about the definition of malice.we have often stated that we deem waived claims not made or claims adverted to in a cursory fashion,unaccompanied by developed argument.rodriguez municipality of san juan,cir.we require parties to spell out their issues clearly,highlighting the relevant facts and analyzing authority.id.specifically,parties must give us the raw materials so that we can do our work.id.
here,gray offered a short but argument in her opening brief,citing to the fourth circuit decision in united states hassouneh,cir,for the proposition that evil purpose or motive more accurately reflects the proper legal standard necessary to convict a person of acting maliciously under the analogous bomb hoax act.she outlined for us the sequence of events during jury instruction,and provided a transcript of the proceeding.she further developed her argument in her reply brief,and during oral argument,she focused entirely on this single issue.therefore,we find the argument has been sufficiently developed and is not waived.
jury instruction 
we proceed,then,to the question of whether the court second attempt at defining malice to act with an evil purpose or improper motive was error.preserved claims of instructional error are assessed on appeal under a bifurcated framework.united states sasso,cir.w e consider de novo whether an instruction embodied an error of law,but we review for abuse of discretion whether the instructions adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.united states symonevich,cir internal quotations omitted.gray claim of instructional error involves the district court amended definition of the malice element in,engendering de novo review.see sasso,at.
the government asserts that,where a statute does not define a term like malice,courts presume that congress adopted the definition of that term.see morissette united states.the government had offered such a definition in its proposed jury instruction to act intentionally or with willful disregard of the likelihood that damage or injury would result and now argues that the amended instruction given by the district court is the substantive equivalent of that definition.gray,on the other hand,proposed the definition found in sand modern federal jury instructions for violations of both and the analogous bomb hoax act,b which states,to act maliciously means to do something with an evil purpose or motive.sand modern federal jury instructions criminal,instruction.in order to determine which definition of malice to adopt to best reflect congressional intent,we must analyze the reasoning behind the conflicting definitions.
w here a federal criminal statute uses a term of established meaning without otherwise defining it,the general practice is to give that term its meaning.united states bayes,cir quoting united states turley.this is the approach taken by the eighth circuit in united states sweet,cir.in a brief opinion involving the analogous b charge the eighth circuit upheld a district court instruction defining maliciously as acting intentionally or with willful disregard of the likelihood that damage or injury will result.id.in doing so,it declined with little explanation the defendant proposal that the definition should include the words evil purpose or motive.id.
however,we will not presume a meaning if there are grounds for inferring any affirmative instruction from congress to define it otherwise.morissette,at.this is the tack followed by the fourth circuit in a case also involving the related statute,the bomb hoax act.the fourth circuit found that an instruction including the evil purpose or motive component more accurately reflects the proper legal standard necessary to convict a person of acting maliciously under b.hassouneh,at.in reaching this conclusion,the court examined the legislative history of the bomb hoax act to divine congress intent.id.at.because the statute at issue here is very similar to,it is worth reviewing that history.
prior to its amendment in,was a misdemeanor statute that punished those who willfully and knowingly imparted false information concerning a bomb threat.id.at.in,the act was amended to delete the word willfully and incorporate the remaining language into the new subsection a.id.at.at the same time,subsection b was added to make it a felony to convey false information about a bomb threat willfully and maliciously or with reckless disregard for the safety of human life.id.at quoting b.
the hassouneh court noted that the amended statute indicated a congressional intent to subject anyone who provides false information of the type proscribed in the statute to punishment,but to punish those who make such statements willfully and maliciously,or with reckless disregard for the safety of human life more severely.id.at.as further evidence of this intent,the court cited an executive communication from the united states attorney general to the speaker of the house of representatives,made at the time the statute was amended to provide for the separate penalties,which explained that the earlier statute had created judicial confusion over the applicability of the statute in prankster cases.id.quoting united states white,cir quoting cong.admin.news.in proposing the amendment that created separate penalties,the attorney general stated,
i submit to the congress a bill which would make it a felony for one to convey a false report willfully and maliciously,or with reckless disregard for the safety of human life,and a misdemeanor to do so with knowledge of its false character even though without malice or reckless disregard for human life.such a statute would clearly show the congressional intention to make it a criminal offense to give false reports even without an evil or reckless motive and would provide a more adequate penalty for those whose actions warrant it.
id.emphasis added.in his explanation of the need for the amendment,the attorney general thus equated the felony standard willfully and maliciously,or with reckless disregard with evil or reckless motive.accordingly,in deciding that the defendant proffered evil purpose or motive instruction more accurately reflected the proper legal standard,the fourth circuit found that there were considerable grounds for inferring that congress intended a meaning of maliciously different from the common law definition.id.at.
section and are very similar,as noted by sand when he chose to select the fourth circuit definition of malice as more appropriate to violations of.both statutes provide two separate penalties for those who convey false information about bomb threats in aviation.just as a describes a civil penalty and b a felony,a is a civil penalty for knowingly providing false information about a bomb threat,while is a felony for providing the false information about the threat willfully and maliciously.
like sand,we find the fourth circuit approach more persuasive.to repeat,when congress uses a common law term and does not otherwise define it,it is presumed that congress intended to adopt the common law definition.united states patterson,cir.however that presumption is overcome here when we consider the statutory scheme as a whole.the only difference between a and is the addition of the words willfully and maliciously.if maliciously means intentionally,as the common law definition states,then two redundancies would be created.first,as hassouneh explains,there would be no difference between the two provisions,despite their very different penalties.see at.second,a redundancy would result between willfully and maliciously internal to.
it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that we must give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.williams taylor,internal quotation marks omitted.the dissent favors a common law definition of malice that specifically requires committing the wrongful act without justification,excuse,or mitigation.united states serawop,cir citing.homicide.were we to adopt this definition,we would not be adequately giving effect to the distinct mens rea of willfully.as the district court explained,willfully means that a person acted deliberately and intentionally it was not done inadvertently or mistakenly.it was done on purpose as opposed to accidentally or carelessly or unintentionally.the only distinction between this and the dissent definition of malice are the words without justification,excuse,or mitigation.we do not believe that is sufficient to reflect congress intent see hassouneh,at noting that maliciously was added to b because willfully by itself does not necessarily embrace any evil purpose but comprehends merely a voluntary and conscious imparting or conveying of the false information with which the statute deals internal quotation marks omitted.
we believe sand definition,on the other hand,is more in line with congressional intent.the history of reveals that its statutory precursor,m,was modeled after.united states irving,cir.the wiser course then,given how closely related the two statutes are,is to follow sand approach and define malice in the context of both b and as evil purpose or motive.
we recognize that there are multiple common law definitions of malice the dissent favors a common law definition that is frequently used to distinguish manslaughter from murder.see serawop,at.the seventh circuit,on the other hand,recently upheld another common law definition of maliciously as acting intentionally or with deliberate disregard of the likelihood that damage or injury will result.united states grady,cir addressing the definition of maliciously within the context of the federal arson statute.the grady court stated that this definition is indeed a common definition of the word,is found in the fourth,eighth and eleventh circuit model jury instructions,and is how the common law traditionally defined the term.id.at.furthermore,the grady court explicitly rejected the dissent position that malice must include the phrase without just cause or reason.id.it is clear there is no one size fits all common law definition of malice.that said,we find evil purpose or motive to be a closer fit within the context of.
there are a couple of other reasons to favor gray proposed definition.s tatutes which relate to the same subject matter should be considered together so that they will harmonize with each other and be consistent with their general objective scope.rathbun autozone,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we should construe b and in pari materia because they proscribe the same conduct and are very similarly worded.see united states cothran,cir stating that b language closely tracks that of.
finally,to the extent the definition of malice under may be ambiguous,the rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them.united states santos,applying the rule of lenity to adopt the defendant proposed definition of proceeds in a statute as profits.because sand definition raises the bar for the government,it favors the defendant.we hold that gray proposed instruction,from sand,defining malice in the context of as to do something with an evil purpose or motive,is the appropriate definition.
having determined that gray proffered definition was legally correct,we do not stop there.had the district court allowed its original definition to stand,we would be here.but alas,the court amended its definition to include or improper motive.because the district court has considerable discretion in how it words its jury instructions,united states gonzalez,cir,we must now determine whether the instruction given conveyed the correct definition of malice,or if,as gray contends,it diluted the meaning of the word 
the government argues the three words are close enough to gray requested definition because they conveyed the same meaning.because jury instructions demand somewhat greater precision than that required by horseshoes and hand grenades,we assess this argument to see if the court definition of malice was correct or merely close,but no cigar.
the government claims that t he word improper imparted a sense of deliberate wrongfulness above and beyond a reckless disregard for the law,which is precisely the idea conveyed by gray requested evil purpose or motive instruction.we must disagree.the word improper carries several meanings,not one of which is the equal of evil the universe of things that are considered improper would encompass anything from wearing a hat indoors to filing a frivolous lawsuit.evil,on the other hand,is more commonly used to describe something that is morally reprehensible.it should go without saying that the words are not interchangeable.
we faced a similar situation in united states tobin,f d,cir.in tobin,we addressed a jury instruction that defined harassment in the context of telephone calls as using the phone in a way that is not meant as a good faith effort to communicate and is done with an unjustifiable motive.id.at.we held that t he district court bad motive instruction would include the charged conduct harassing phone calls,but would also include almost anything else of which the jury might disapprove.id.at.the same danger exists here.the court definition allowed the jury to convict gray if it found that she was improperly motivated by something it frowned upon.this diluted the willful and malicious element,and lowered the government burden considerably.notably,it resulted in a standard lower than the willful disregard instruction proposed by the government.
the district court instruction was not nearly close enough.instead,its definition diluted the meaning of malice to an impermissibly low standard 
harmless error 
our analysis does not end with the determination that the instruction was erroneous.even an incorrect instruction to which an objection has been preserved will not require us to set aside a verdict if the error is harmless.sasso,at.we employ two barometers for measuring harmless error in a criminal case.id.issues of a constitutional dimension require the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not influence the verdict.id.quoting chapman california.if,however,the error is found to be of a dimension,a less stringent standard applies to allow a conviction to stand as long as it can be said with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.id.quoting kotteakos united states.
although gray characterizes the incorrect jury instruction as depriving her of a fundamentally fair trial,she offers us no more than that.she does not present a constitutional argument,does not even hint at a standard of review for harmless error,does not address the question of prejudice,and seems to ask us to simply presume prejudice from the erroneous instruction.similarly,the government provides us with no harmless error analysis.
as for what standard of review to apply,sasso provides guidance.at.the court in sasso had erred by offering the jury a definition of willfully that diluted the level of scienter required by the statute under which the defendant had been charged.id.in that case,we determined that the error was of the variety,requiring us to apply the less stringent standard to determine whether the judgment was substantially swayed by the error.id.at quoting kotteakos,at.we will do the same here.
in reviewing the record,arguably the only evidence of malice was the statement in the confession i did it more to get the ground workers in trouble than cause what i did,and the testimony of flight attendant hyde that gray told her that she was upset with american airlines and would get back at them.the jury could have considered the full text of the confession,which included gray statement that she care d deeply about aa,crew the passengers,and concluded that she may have intended some benign mischief toward a,rather than intending behavior evidencing evil intent.as to hyde testimony,the jury could have weighed her damning statement on the stand,and contrasted it with the more innocuous account she gave immediately following the incident to conclude that gray bore no evil intent.yet the jury could reasonably have deemed these intentions as improper.we therefore can not say with fair assurance that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.
the government had the burden of proving that gray wrote the bomb threat willfully and maliciously.the proof of motive was less than compelling,and gray motivation was debatable.the court incorrect definition of malice evil purpose or improper motive impermissibly diluted the standard and introduced too great a likelihood that the instructional error may have influenced the verdict.sasso,at.our review of the record convinces us that the error was not harmless.
conclusion 
the district court jury instruction was erroneous,and gray was prejudiced by the likelihood that the diluted standard may have influenced the verdict.consequently,we vacate the conviction and remand for a new trial in accordance with this opinion.
dissenting opinion follows 
when a federal statute incorporates a term that has accumulated a settled common law meaning,we must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress means to incorporate that term established meaning.neder united states,citation omitted.that command is complicated in this case because,like words,m alice is a rather slippery concept.carson united states.courts have not always been consistent in describing malice common law definition.but the discord that may have been bred by a few decisions ought not distract us from adhering to an established maxim of statutory interpretation.in this case,the district court instructions comported with the settled common law definition of malice.i respectfully dissent because i think that the majority endorses a truncated definition of malice that leads it to unnecessarily look beyond the common law meaning and find error.
the majority accepts a definition of malice provided by the fourth and eighth circuits as the settled common law meaning.under that definition,the majority contends,to act maliciously means,simply,to act intentionally.op.at.yet,as substantial authority demonstrates,that definition is,at best,incomplete.malice is not satisfied simply by acting with an intentional or reckless mental state.united states serawop,cir.instead,the settled common law definition of malice specifically requires committing the wrongful act without justification,excuse,or mitigation.id.emphasis added accord black law dictionary ed defining malice as the intent,without justification or excuse,to commit a wrongful act.we have previously acknowledged this precise definition,including its requirement of more than a mere intentional action.see hernandez cuevas taylor,cir.
other circuits have also endorsed this unabridged common law definition when construing congress use of the term malice in federal statutes.in serawop,for example,the tenth circuit adopted this meaning for purposes of the federal manslaughter statute.see at.the ninth circuit,too,has applied this common law definition to certain federal statutes.see united states kelly,cir construing statute criminalizing willful and malicious destruction of maritime property,codified at united states doe,cir construing arson statute,codified at.
this definition common law pedigree is further confirmed by its repeated invocation in the decisions of several state courts and the district of columbia,as well as in various treatises.see,mcgee state,alaska defining malice as the the intentional commission of an unlawful act without justification or other legal excuse carson,at adopting definition that includes the absence of all elements of justification,excuse or recognized mitigation when construing a cruelty to children statute dean state,defining malice as that state of mind which actuates conduct injurious to others without lawful reason,cause or excuse commonwealth york,met,defining malice in its legal sense as meaning a wrongful act,done intentionally,without just cause or excuse d criminal law malice,in its legal sense,denotes that condition of mind manifested by intentionally doing a wrongful act without just cause or excuse.rollin perkins ronald boyce,criminal law ed.i n the absence of justification,excuse or recognized mitigation,it is malicious to intend to do what constitutes the actus reus of the crime in question.
as pertinent here,the federal statute that gray was charged with violating proscribes making a false bomb threat willfully and maliciously while knowing the information to be false.emphasis added.by including maliciously,congress indicated that the government must prove,beyond a reasonable doubt,that a defendant acted without a cognizable justification,excuse,or mitigating motivation.serawop,at.indeed,the supreme court has distinguished mens rea elements like knowingly and willfully where the government need not disprove the existence of excuses or justifications from malice where the nature of the mens rea would require the government to disprove the existence of those justifications beyond a reasonable doubt.dixon united states.we,too,have recognized that where malice is included as an element of an offense,the government must prove the absence of any justification beyond a reasonable doubt.gagne meachum,cir.
properly viewed,then,the common law definition of malice is not the truncated one supplied by the cases the majority relies on to be sure,to act maliciously a defendant must act intentionally or with willful disregard.op.at.but an instruction requiring the government to prove that the defendant acted merely intentionally,without more,is incomplete.see wade state,finding error where malice instruction excluded element that the defendant acted without justification or serious provocation because the instruction by its incompleteness,removed from the prosecution the burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt citation omitted.
thus,the fourth circuit discovery of a redundancy in an analogous statute,the bomb hoax act,rests on a flawed premise.see united states hassouneh,cir i f maliciously simply meant intentionally,there would seem to be a redundancy.the majority reliance on hassouneh to drive its analysis of the statute in this case similarly leads it astray.having found malice at common law to require only an intentional action,the majority then resolves that it must define malice as evil purpose or motive for purposes of in order to avoid creating indistinguishable civil and criminal prohibitions yet,because common law malice requires the government to make an additional showing that the defendant acted without justification,excuse,or mitigation,employing the common law definition in will create no redundancy that requires us to look beyond the common law.
to support its conclusion,the majority also invokes a single stray remark by the attorney general at the time that an analogous statute,the bomb hoax act,was amended.yet,the supreme court has consistently instructed that the grounds for inferring any alternative intent by congress must come from the face of the statute,th
