jeffrey healey and edward given reside in the massachusetts treatment center in bridgewater,massachusetts the treatment center or center.each has been civilly committed as a sexually dangerous person sdp.in separate suits,healey and given challenged the adequacy of sex offender treatment provided by the center as well as the conditions of their confinement.they sought equitable relief against the massachusetts department of corrections,as well as the commissioner of correction and the superintendent of the treatment center,in their official capacities hereinafter referred to collectively as doc.the cases were consolidated.
healey and given alleged violations of the constitution and state statutory provisions.healey also alleged that the doc was not in compliance with the terms of its plan for the management of the treatment center a management plan the doc developed during the course of prior litigation.following a trial on the merits,the district court entered a final order granting plaintiffs declaratory and injunctive relief on some claims,but entered judgment in favor of the defendants on the remaining claims.both sides appeal from the district court final judgment.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
massachusetts law provides for the involuntary civil commitment of persons found to be sexually dangerous.laws ch,et.under section of the civil commitment statute,sexually dangerous persons may be placed in the treatment center,for care,custody,treatment and rehabilitation.id.operational control of the center is vested in the doc.id.each resident of the center is permitted,by section of the statute,to annually petition the massachusetts superior court for an examination and determination of whether he or she remains sexually dangerous.id.
an earlier version of the statute provided for shared control of the treatment center by the doc and the massachusetts department of mental health dmh.in,treatment center residents brought two lawsuits seeking to rectify a broad array of appalling conditions,as well as inadequacies in treatment,work opportunities,and avocational and educational activities at the center.see king greenblatt king i,cir and williams lesiak,cir.that litigation gave rise to nearly three decades of judicial oversight of the treatment center operations.the layered history of that period of judicial supervision can be found in this court related decisions.see,king greenblatt king ii,cir recounting prior decisions in re pearson,cir same langton johnston,cir.during that period,substantial improvements in both the conditions of confinement and treatment protocols for center residents were realized,and,in,the relevant equitable decrees were finally terminated.see king greenblatt king iii,d.the general background that follows is necessarily a condensed version of that history,but one sufficient to illuminate the current issues.
in,the district court entered two remedial consent decrees in king and one in williams,the parties having agreed that the then prevailing conditions warranted judicial relief.see king iii,d at.the cases were later consolidated.id.conditions at the treatment center at that time were medieval worse than those obtaining in the prison system,langton,at,and included cramped,poorly furnished cells without toilets or sinks a polluted and unsafe water supply an outmoded and sewerage system obsolete heating and ventilation equipment which caused some cells to go unheated for days a dearth of medical professionals the absence of a library,educational programs,gymnasium,outdoor recreation area,work release or community access programs and limited vocational facilities.king iii,d at.the consent decrees,which became known as the original decree and the supplemental decree,aimed to correct those and other inadequacies.id 
the original decree provided that patients at the treatment center should have the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the purposes of commitment.king ii,at internal quotation marks omitted.that provision,we noted in king ii,was the original decree substantive essence.id.the decree more specific provisions required dmh and doc to take steps jointly to improve physical conditions,implement a meaningful work program,and have a system of differing security for different categories of patients to permit less restrictive conditions for those patients not requiring maximum security.king iii,d at internal quotation marks omitted.defendants were also required to submit a plan for therapeutic,educational,vocational,and avocational programs at the treatment center,as well as for the release of residents into the community id.the supplemental decree prohibited the placement of treatment center residents into solitary confinement as punishment or for disciplinary purposes,and required all sequestration to meet minimum standards of due process and human decency.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the decrees considered the center a mental health facility,with primary responsibility over residents and their treatment vested in the department of mental health.the department of corrections,on the other hand,was responsible for providing a secure setting.the doc was expected to work collaboratively with dmh to carry out the decrees requirements.id.at.the joint governance framework embodied in the decrees mimicked the division of control described in the statute,as it then existed.
for nearly two decades after entry of the consent decrees,t he stream of enforcement litigation occasionally overflowed the district court,pearson,at,much of it occasioned by the conflicts inherent in doc and dmh shared governance of the center shared governance by statutory command came to an end in,when the massachusetts legislature transferred all operational control of the treatment center to the doc.see.acts ch.the commonwealth then moved,under.b,to modify the consent decrees to reflect that change in governance.the district court at first denied the motion to modify,finding that doc had not presented the court with any information demonstrating its ability to provide treatment in compliance with the consent decrees.king iii,d at.the court invited doc to provide specific details in the form of a plan of how it proposed to operate the facility.id.at.doc,in response,developed and proffered a detailed management plan and,subsequently,an amended management plan plan.
finding that the proffered plan met the goals of treatment and security and protection of residents rights,the district court modified the outstanding decrees to reflect doc sole responsibility for the treatment center operation.id.at.the original decree provisions governing the allocation of state agency responsibility were modified,and the supplemental decree general proscription of disciplinary and punishment procedures was stricken,with solitary confinement link ed to the offense underlying the original commitment of the individual.king ii,at.the commonwealth alternative request for outright vacation of the decrees was denied,but without prejudice to its renewing that request after one year.king iii,d at.
in several related appeals from the district court modification orders,this court determined that the modifications passed muster under rufo inmates of suffolk cnty.jail,d.see king ii,at.rufo requires institutional consent decree modifications to be grounded on a significant change in either factual conditions or in law and suitably tailored to the changed circumstance.king i,at quoting rufo,at.we held that the state statutory amendment constituted a significant change in law impacting the original decree terms regarding the division of control between dmh and doc,id.at,and that factual circumstances had changed sufficiently to warrant modification of the supplemental decree general proscription of disciplinary and punishment procedures.king ii,at.
addressing rufo second prong,we anticipatorily scrutinized the doc plan,id.at,and determined,based on that review,that the change in treatment center governance did not appear likely to undermine the original decree or to violate the constitution.id.at.importantly,in making that determination,we emphasized that the plan itself did not constitute a modification of the original decree,but represented,instead,the ways in which doc aspire d to fulfill the requirements of the original decree.id.at.just as the policies and practices that had been relied on in the past by dmh constituted that agency response to its obligation under the decree to achieve effective treatment under the least restrictive conditions,the plan represented the doc own proposed means of achieving the same goal.id.we also held,upon review of the plan provisions regarding clinical treatment programs and procedural safeguards,and its specifications for a disciplinary system,that the modifications to the supplemental decree were suitably tailored to the changed circumstances.id.at.
within a year of this court decision in king ii,the commonwealth again filed a motion to vacate or,in the alternative,to terminate the consent decrees.king iii,d at.after full discovery and a hearing,the district court granted the motion to terminate the decrees and closed the king iii and williams cases.id.at.
in a thorough decision,the district court mazzone,correctly identified and applied the relevant legal standards,as described in bd.of educ.dowell,d.and,after considering a voluminous record that included testimony of treatment center professionals and residents,plan provisions,and the doc record of implementing those provisions,the court found that the underlying conditions that existed when the decrees were entered have been remedied and that the commonwealth has complied with the decrees in good faith since they were entered.king iii,d at.the evidence,the court determined,clearly shows that the consent decrees have served the purpose of correcting those conditions and are no longer necessary to maintain those improvements.id.at.judge mazzone further concluded that there is little or no likelihood that the treatment center will revert to an earlier time,nor that the constitutional violations will be repeated when the decree is lifted.id.at.satisfied that the preconditions to decree termination were met,judge mazzone terminated the decrees.id.at.
in a preface to his findings,judge mazzone acknowledged that there may be issues arising out of the administration of the plan in the future if doc becomes indifferent to its responsibilities both under the statute and the plan to keep residents separate and apart from inmates.id.at.he suggested that,i f ignored,the plan will simply replace the consent decrees as the basis of future complaints and the parties will be destined for a future generation of litigation.id.he found,nevertheless,that the commonwealth has sustained its burden of demonstrating that the preconditions to termination of the decrees had been met and specifically concluded that these consent decrees should be terminated.id.
in an epilogue to his findings,judge mazzone offered the following commentary which,for comprehensiveness and context,we repeat in its entirety 
i believe the management plan is an enforceable operating document that recognizes the improvements made as a result of the consent decrees over the years and acknowledges doc responsibilities to manage the treatment center accordingly.
i recognize that residents will continue to voice their complaints about the circumstances of their existence at the treatment center.this decision does not preclude them from challenging events on the basis of constitutional or other protected rights.in the first place,residents may bring an action to enforce the terms of the existing plan.moreover,as the first circuit stated in affirming a district court decision to terminate another consent decree,plaintiffs remain free to initiate a new round of proceedings designed to show that conditions actually do violate their federally protected rights.rouse,at.i remind the parties again today that any new allegations of unconstitutional conditions or treatment will be addressed in separate proceedings.
id.at emphasis added.
two years after the consent decrees were terminated,healey brought this suit challenging both the conditions of his confinement at the treatment center and the adequacy of his sexual offender treatment.in,healey case was consolidated with a similar suit in which given was later joined as plaintiff both healey and given alleged violations of various constitutional rights.healey also alleged that the doc was in violation of numerous provisions of the plan.arguing that the plan constitutes a settlement agreement,healey alleged a breach of contract by the doc and,contending that the plan amounts to an enforceable court order,he alleged that plan violations can be remedied in the context of contempt proceedings.both healey and given sought permanent injunctive relief on their own behalf no class was certified.
the district court gertner,determined that the plan was not properly construed as an enforceable settlement agreement.but,relying on kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d,it held that the plan was enforceable as a court order.under kokkonen,a federal court retains subject matter jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement if the dismissal order incorporates the terms of the agreement or if the court retains jurisdiction to enforce it.id.at.the district court determined that judge mazzone had effectively incorporated the plan into his order allowing the termination of the consent decrees,such that the plan acquired the character of a court order over which the court retained continuing jurisdiction to enforce.central to the district court reasoning was its apparent conclusion that judge mazzone termination of the consent decrees was conditional on the plan having attained the status of an enforceable injunctive order 
after additional dispositive rulings,judge gertner presided over a bench trial on the remaining claims,which included healey and given claims that the doc failure to provide adequate treatment violated their fourteenth amendment substantive due process rights claims for violations of several other constitutional provisions and healey claim that the doc was in violation of numerous plan requirements.while mediation proceedings were being conducted,judge gertner retired.the case was reassigned to chief judge saris who presided over a second,shorter,trial.see.describing the procedure when one judge replaces another before the completion of a trial.after the second trial,chief judge saris issued a memorandum and order and final judgment and order.
the district court entered judgment for the doc on most of healey claims,but ruled that the doc violated some of its obligations under the plan,as well as healey substantive due process rights,by failing to provide adequate pharmacological evaluation and treatment.healey,wl,at.the district court further held that the doc violated both plan and state statutory requirements but not healey due process rights by failing to provide a functioning community access program cap.see id.at.the district court found in favor of given only on his claim that the doc violated his substantive due process rights by failing to provide adequate pharmacological evaluation and treatment.see id.at.
the district court ordered the doc to have healey and given evaluated by a qualified psychiatrist and,if appropriate,provide them pharmacological treatment.id.at.the district court declined to afford injunctive relief to healey with respect to his cap claim,because his persistent behavioral problems rendered him ineligible for the program.id.at.the court,did,however,enter a broad injunction requiring the doc to meet the requirements of the amended management plan in all material respects.id.at.
the doc appeals the declaratory judgment in favor of healey on his claim that it violated its obligations under the plan and failed to provide adequate pharmacological evaluation and treatment.the doc also challenges the district court injunction to the extent it recognizes the plan as an enforceable court order,and requires compliance with its provisions.for his part,healey also appeals from the injunction compelling doc compliance with the plan,arguing that the district court should have required more,and erred in not finding additional plan violations.healey and given both challenge the district court determinations that the doc,in several respects,did not violate their constitutional rights,including its determination that the doc failure to provide a functioning community access program does not violate their constitutional right to due process.neither side has challenged the district court determination that the constitution requires the defendants to offer the plaintiffs adequate pharmacological evaluation and treatment.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of permanent injunctive relief for abuse of discretion.asociacion de educacion privada de,garcia padilla,cir.factual findings are reviewed for clear error and questions of law de novo.id.the district court rulings regarding the constitutionality of the conditions of confinement at the center and the adequacy of its treatment program present mixed questions of law and fact which might not sit neatly at either end of the review spectrum.an inquiry into whether current institutional conditions constitute an ongoing violation of a federal right comprises a mixed question of fact and law,the answer to which we review along a continuum,ranging from plenary review for questions to review for questions.morales feliciano rullan,cir quoting inmates of suffolk cnty.jail rouse,cir.here,we need not decide where,precisely,on the continuum our review of the district court constitutional determinations should fall for,even under the more lens of de novo review,healey and given claim s of error are unavailing.united states gonzalez,cir.
iii.discussion 
to issue a permanent injunction,the district court must find that plaintiffs prevail on the merits plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury in the absence of injunctive relief the harm to plaintiffs would outweigh the harm the defendant would suffer from the imposition of an injunction and the public interest would not be adversely affected by an injunction.garcia padilla,at.
although the parties devote considerable attention to the element of irreparable harm,this case can be resolved by answering two basic questions that relate to the merits.the first question is whether the plan is an enforceable court order.that question,which we answer in the negative,is necessary to healey contempt claim and central to both the doc accountability for its failure to follow plan provisions and healey claim that the district court did not do enough to enforce the plan.the second question,broadly speaking,is whether,as healey and given argue,the district court erred in not finding additional constitutional violations.
plan violations 
the district court construction of the plan as,effectively,an enforceable court order,is in error.an order enforceable on pain of contempt,as the district court construed the plan to be,is an injunction.see int l longshoremen ass n,local philadelphia marine trade ass n,d a n equitable decree compelling obedience under the threat of contempt is an order granting an injunction.quoting.d.the plan,however,was clearly not offered as a proposed decree meant to be substituted for the existing consent decrees that were being terminated.indeed,the plan was never entered as an order,and certainly not an order that was consistent with the requirements of.d moreover,judge mazzone did not,either expressly or impliedly,condition termination of the existing consent decrees on the plan status as an enforceable injunction,as plaintiffs contend.
in his final decision,judge mazzone commented pointedly and forcefully about his hope for,and expectations of,the plan.his comments,upon which given and healey heavily rely,that i believe the plan is an enforceable operating document and that i n the first place,residents may bring an action to enforce the terms of the existing plan,are at best ambiguous in context.but even broadly construed,these passing comments simply can not provide the necessary positive command of an order compelling obedience under the threat of contempt,particularly when they were made in the course and context of terminating consent decrees that mandated essentially identical legal obligations.int l longshoreman ass n,at 
the critical point,however,is that judge mazzone did precisely what he intended to do we perceive no misstep on his part.the highly respected judge was fully capable and experienced he knew how to issue an injunction and how to make it stick.viewing his decision in the full context of this litigation,it is plain to us that judge mazzone dissolved the existing consent decrees,while simultaneously exhorting the doc not to regress,to continue to implement the plan as the right thing to do,and to recognize that failure to maintain the thenacceptable conditions would surely result in yet additional costly,disruptive,and likely successful litigation.as judicial oversight of the doc operation of the treatment center came to an end,the judge comments were meant to counsel,not dictate.acknowledging federalism demand that judicial oversight not continue in perpetuity,judge mazzone considered the record evidence,applied the proper legal standards,and correctly concluded that the time had arrived to terminate judicial supervision.king iii,d at.terminating the decrees,he remarked,removed from the doc operations a constant reminder of the federal court presence.id.at.
the plan was important,of course.it supplied the assurance of continuing constitutionally acceptable conditions necessary to support the court termination of the decrees.because the unconstitutional conditions had been remedied,assurances of future adequacy had been given and found credible,and the consent decrees had outlived their usefulness,the judge path to termination was.see freeman pitts,d we have said that the court end purpose must be to remedy the violation and,in addition,to restore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that is operating in compliance with the constitution.
the plan can not plausibly be characterized as a replacement consent decree.a consent decree is both a settlement and an injunction.aronov napolitano,cir.for the reasons given,the plan is not an enforceable injunction.in any event,judge mazzone reference to the plan replac ing the consent decrees can hardly be thought to mean that the consent decrees were being for the plan,as an injunction.the issue for decision was whether court supervision,through enforcement of the consent decrees,should be terminated.terminating the consent orders only to simultaneously replace them with virtually coextensive plan provisions,as an injunctive order,would have merely maintained the status quo.judge mazzone of course did not intend to continue judicial supervision of the center.
the supreme court also has cautioned that a district court must be explicit if it wishes to retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement by,for example,incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement into its final order.see kokkonen,at.judge mazzone order,read in toto,does not by any stretch of the imagination explicitly retain continuing jurisdiction over the matter.in point of fact,it gives the opposite impression.by the same token,the order does not incorporate the terms of the plan.
all of this is not to say that judge mazzone comments about the plan role as an operating document served no purpose.the end of judicial oversight in institutional reform cases often brings with it appropriate judicial warnings cautioning defendants to avoid future repetition of past violations.it seems to us that judge mazzone comments fell comfortably within that commendable tradition.see,people who care rockford bd.of educ.sch.dist,cir posner,it should go without saying that if the board takes advantage of its new freedom from federal judicial control to discriminate against minority students in violation of federal law,it will expose itself to a new and draconian round of litigation.we trust that million later,it has learned its lesson.tasby moses,d,t he school district must adhere to the covenants and commitments adopted by the board and relied on by the court in
