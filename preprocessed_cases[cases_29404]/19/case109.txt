while police were preparing to execute a warrant to search a basement apartment for a handgun,detectives conducting surveillance in an unmarked car outside the apartment saw two men later identified as petitioner chunon bailey and bryant middleton leave the gated area above the apartment,get in a car,and drive away.the detectives waited for the men to leave and then followed the car approximately a mile before stopping it.they found keys during a patdown search of bailey,who initially said that he resided in the apartment but later denied it when informed of the search.both men were handcuffed and driven in a patrol car to the apartment,where the search team had already found a gun and illicit drugs.after arresting the men,police discovered that one of bailey keys unlocked the apartment door.
at trial,the district court denied bailey motion to suppress the apartment key and the statements he made to the detectives when stopped,holding that bailey detention was justified under michigan summers,as a detention incident to the execution of a search warrant,and,in the alternative,that the detention was supported by reasonable suspicion under terry ohio.bailey was convicted.the second circuit affirmed denial of the suppression motion.finding that summers authorized bailey detention,it did not address the alternative terry holding.
held the rule in summers is limited to the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched and does not apply here,where bailey was detained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of the immediate vicinity of the premises in question.
a the summers rule permits officers executing a search warrant to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted,at,even when there is no particular suspicion that an individual is involved in criminal activity or poses a specific danger to the officers,muehler mena.detention is permitted because the character of the additional intrusion caused by detention is slight and because the justifications for detention are substantial.at.in summers and later cases the detained occupants were found within or immediately outside the residence being searched.here,however,petitioner left the apartment before the search began and was detained nearly a mile away.
b in summers,the court recognized three important law enforcement interests that,taken together,justify detaining an occupant who is on the premises during the search warrant execution,at.the first,officer safety,requires officers to secure the premises,which may include detaining current occupants so the officers can search without fear that the occupants will become disruptive,dangerous,or otherwise frustrate the search.if an occupant returns home during the search,officers can mitigate the risk by taking routine precautions.here,however,bailey posed little risk to the officers at the scene after he left the premises,apparently without knowledge of the search.had he returned,he could have been apprehended and detained under summers.were police to have the authority to detain persons away from the premises,the authority to detain incident to the execution of a search warrant would reach beyond the rationale of ensuring the integrity of the search by detaining those who are on the scene.as for the second circuit additional concerns,if officers believe that it would be dangerous to detain a departing individual in front of a residence,they are not required to stop him and if officers have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity,they can instead rely on terry.the risk that a departing occupant might alert those still inside the residence is also an insufficient safety rationale for expanding the detention authority beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.
the second law enforcement interest is the facilitation of the completion of the search.unrestrained occupants can hide or destroy evidence,seek to distract the officers,or simply get in the way.but a general interest in avoiding obstruction of a search can not justify detention beyond the vicinity of the premises.occupants who are kept from leaving may assist the officers by opening locked doors or containers in order to avoid the use of force that can damage property or delay completion of the search.but this justification must be confined to persons on site as the search warrant is executed and so in a position to observe the progression of the search.
the third interest is the interest in preventing flight,which also serves to preserve the integrity of the search.if officers are concerned about flight in the event incriminating evidence is found,they might rush the search,causing unnecessary damage or compromising its careful execution.the need to prevent flight,however,if unbounded,might be used to argue for detention of any regular occupant regardless of his or her location at the time of the search,detaining a suspect miles away,ready to board a plane.even if the detention of a former occupant away from the premises could facilitate a later arrest if incriminating evidence is discovered,the mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the fourth amendment.mincey arizona.
in sum,none of the three law enforcement interests identified in summers applies with the same or similar force to the detention of recent occupants beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.and each is also insufficient,on its own,to justify an expansion of the rule in summers to permit the detention of a former occupant,wherever he may be found away from the scene of the search.
c as recognized in summers,the detention of a current occupant represents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant,at,but an arrest of an individual away from his home involves an additional level of intrusiveness.a public detention,even if merely incident to a search,will resemble a arrest and can involve the indignity of a compelled transfer back to the premises.
d limiting the rule in summers to the area within which an occupant poses a real threat to the safe and efficient execution of a search warrant ensures that the scope of the detention incident to a search is confined to its underlying justification.because petitioner was detained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of immediate vicinity,there is no need to further define that term here.since detention is justified by the interests in executing a safe and efficient search,the decision to detain must be acted upon at the scene of the search and not at a later time in a more remote place.

chunon bailey,aka polo,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
the fourth amendment guarantees the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.a search may be of a person,a thing,or a place.so too a seizure may be of a person,a thing,or even a place.a search or a seizure may occur singly or in combination,and in differing sequence.in some cases the validity of one determines the validity of the other.the instant case involves the search of a place an apartment dwelling and the seizure of a person.but here,though it is acknowledged that the search was lawful,it does not follow that the seizure was lawful as well.the seizure of the person is quite in question.the issue to be resolved is whether the seizure of the person was reasonable when he was stopped and detained at some distance away from the premises to be searched when the only justification for the detention was to ensure the safety and efficacy of the search.
at on july,local police obtained a warrant to search a residence for a caliber handgun.the residence was a basement apartment at lake drive,in wyandanch,new york.a confidential informant had told police he observed the gun when he was at the apartment to purchase drugs from a heavy set black male with short hair known as polo.app.as the search unit began preparations for executing the warrant,two officers,detectives richard sneider and richard gorbecki,were conducting surveillance in an unmarked car outside the residence.about,sneider and gorbecki observed two men later identified as petitioner chunon bailey and bryant middleton leave the gated area above the basement apartment and enter a car parked in the driveway.both matched the general physical description of polo provided by the informant.there was no indication that the men were aware of the officers presence or had any knowledge of the impending search.the detectives watched the car leave the driveway.they waited for it to go a few hundred yards down the street and followed.the detectives informed the search team of their intent to follow and detain the departing occupants.the search team then executed the search warrant at the apartment.
detectives sneider and gorbecki tailed bailey car for about a mile and for about five minutes before pulling the vehicle over in a parking lot by a fire station.they ordered bailey and middleton out of the car and did a patdown search of both men.the officers found no weapons but discovered a ring of keys in bailey pocket.bailey identified himself and said he was coming from his home at lake drive.his driver license,however,showed his address as bayshore,new york,the town where the confidential informant told the police the suspect,polo,used to live,at.bailey passenger,middleton,said bailey was giving him a ride home and confirmed they were coming from bailey residence at lake drive.the officers put both men in handcuffs.when bailey asked why,gorbecki stated that they were being detained incident to the execution of a search warrant at lake drive.bailey responded i do live there.anything you find there ai mine,and i not cooperating with your investigation.at.
the detectives called for a patrol car to take bailey and middleton back to the lake drive apartment.detective sneider drove the unmarked car back,while detective gorbecki used bailey set of keys to drive bailey car back to the search scene.by the time the group returned to lake drive,the search team had discovered a gun and drugs in plain view inside the apartment.bailey and middleton were placed under arrest,and bailey keys were seized incident to the arrest.officers later discovered that one of bailey keys opened the door of the basement apartment.
bailey was charged with three federal offenses possession of cocaine with intent to distribute,in violation of a and b b iii possession of a firearm by a felon,in violation of g and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a offense,in violation of c a i.at trial bailey moved to suppress the apartment key and the statements he made when stopped by detectives sneider and gorbecki.that evidence,bailey argued,derived from an unreasonable seizure.after an evidentiary hearing the united states district court for the eastern district of new york denied the motion to suppress.the district court held that bailey detention was permissible under michigan summers,as a detention incident to the execution of a search warrant.in the alternative,it held that bailey detention was lawful as an investigatory detention supported by reasonable suspicion under terry ohio.after a trial the jury found bailey guilty on all three counts.
the court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that bailey detention was proper and affirmed denial of the suppression motion.it interpreted this court decision in summers to authoriz e law enforcement to detain the occupant of premises subject to a valid search warrant when that person is seen leaving those premises and the detention is effected as soon as reasonably practicable.having found bailey detention justified under summers,the court of appeals did not address the district court alternative holding that the stop was permitted under terry.
the federal courts of appeals have reached differing conclusions as to whether michigan summers justifies the detention of occupants beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises covered by a search warrant.this court granted certiorari to address the question.
the fourth amendment,applicable through the fourteenth amendment to the states,provides the right of the people to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.this court has stated the general rule that fourth amendment seizures are reasonable only if based on probable cause to believe that the individual has committed a crime.dunaway new york.the standard of probable cause,with roots that are deep in our history,henry united states,represent s the accumulated wisdom of precedent and experience as to the minimum justification necessary to make the kind of intrusion involved in an arrest reasonable under the fourth amendment.dunaway,supra,at.
within the framework of these fundamental rules there is some latitude for police to detain where the intrusion on the citizen privacy was so much less severe than that involved in a traditional arrest that the opposing interests in crime prevention and detection and in the police officer safety could support the seizure as reasonable.summers,supra,at quoting dunaway,supra,at see also terry,supra,at holding that a police officer who has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity may conduct a brief investigative stop.
in summers,the court defined an important category of cases in which detention is allowed without probable cause to arrest for a crime.it permitted officers executing a search warrant to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.at.the rule in summers extends farther than some earlier exceptions because it does not require law enforcement to have particular suspicion that an individual is involved in criminal activity or poses a specific danger to the officers.muehler mena.in muehler,applying the rule in summers,the court stated an officer authority to detain incident to a search is categorical it does not depend on the quantum of proof justifying detention or the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure.at quoting summers,supra,at.the rule announced in summers allows detention incident to the execution of a search warrant because the character of the additional intrusion caused by detention is slight and because the justifications for detention are substantial.muehler,supra,at.
in summers and later cases the occupants detained were found within or immediately outside a residence at the moment the police officers executed the search warrant.in summers,the defendant was detained on a walk leading down from the front steps of the house.see tr.of oral arg.in,see also muehler,supra,at detention of occupant in adjoining garage los angeles county rettele,per curiam detention of occupants in bedroom.here,however,petitioner left the apartment before the search began and the police officers waited to detain him until he was almost a mile away.the issue is whether the reasoning in summers can justify detentions beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises being searched.an exception to the fourth amendment rule prohibiting detention absent probable cause must not diverge from its purpose and rationale.see florida royer,plurality opinion the scope of the detention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justification it is necessary,then,to discuss the reasons for the rule explained in summers to determine if its rationale extends to a detention like the one here.
in summers,the court recognized three important law enforcement interests that,taken together,justify the detention of an occupant who is on the premises during the execution of a search warrant officer safety,facilitating the completion of the search,and preventing flight,at.
the first interest identified in summers was the interest in minimizing the risk of harm to the officers.at.there the court held that the execution of a warrant to search for narcotics is the kind of transaction that may give rise to sudden violence or frantic efforts to conceal or destroy evidence,and t he risk of harm to both the police and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.at.
when law enforcement officers execute a search warrant,safety considerations require that they secure the premises,which may include detaining current occupants.by taking unquestioned command of the situation,at,the officers can search without fear that occupants,who are on the premises and able to observe the course of the search,will become disruptive,dangerous,or otherwise frustrate the search.
after summers,this court decided muehler mena.the reasoning and conclusions in muehler in applying the summers rule go quite far in allowing seizure and detention of persons to accommodate the necessities of a search.there,the person detained and held in handcuffs was not suspected of the criminal activity being investigated but,the court held,she could be detained nonetheless,to secure the premises while the search was underway.the safety risk inherent in executing a search warrant for weapons was sufficient to justify the use of handcuffs,and the need to detain multiple occupants made the use of handcuffs all the more reasonable.at.while the court in muehler did remand for consideration of whether the detention there alleged to have been two or three hours was necessary in light of all the circumstances,the fact that so prolonged a detention indeed might have been permitted illustrates the authority the police have when the detention is made at the scene of the search.this in turn counsels caution before extending the power to detain persons stopped or apprehended away from the premises where the search is being conducted.
it is likely,indeed almost inevitable in the case of a resident,that an occupant will return to the premises at some point and this might occur when the officers are still conducting the search.officers can and do mitigate that risk,however,by taking routine precautions,for instance by erecting barricades or posting someone on the perimeter or at the door.in the instant case bailey had left the premises,apparently without knowledge of the search.he posed little risk to the officers at the scene.if bailey had rushed back to his apartment,the police could have apprehended and detained him under summers.there is no established principle,however,that allows the arrest of anyone away from the premises who is likely to return.
the risk,furthermore,that someone could return home during the execution of a search warrant is not limited to occupants who depart shortly before the start of a search.the risk that a resident might return home,either for reasons unrelated to the search or after being alerted by someone at the scene,exists whether he left five minutes or five hours earlier.unexpected arrivals by occupants or other persons accustomed to visiting the premises might occur in many instances.were police to have the authority to detain those persons away from the premises,the authority to detain incident to the execution of a search warrant would reach beyond the rationale of ensuring the integrity of the search by detaining those who are in fact on the scene.
the court of appeals relied on an additional safety consideration.it concluded that limiting the application of the authority to detain to the immediate vicinity would put law enforcement officers in a dilemma.they would have to choose between detaining an individual immediately and risk alerting occupants still inside or allowing the individual to leave and risk not being able to arrest him later if incriminating evidence were discovered,at.although the danger of alerting occupants who remain inside may be of real concern in some instances,as in the case when a warrant has been issued,this safety rationale rests on the false premise that a detention must take place.if the officers find that it would be dangerous to detain a departing in front of a residence,they are not required to stop him.and,where there are grounds to believe the departing occupant is dangerous,or involved in criminal activity,police will generally not need summers to detain him at least for brief questioning,as they can rely instead on terry.
the risk that a departing occupant might notice the police surveillance and alert others still inside the residence is also an insufficient safety rationale to justify the existing categorical authority to detain so that it extends beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.if extended in this way the rationale would justify detaining anyone in the neighborhood who could alert occupants that the police are outside,all without individualized suspicion of criminal activity or connection to the residence to be searched.this possibility demonstrates why it is necessary to confine the summers rule to those who are present when and where the search is being conducted.
the second law enforcement interest relied on in summers was that the orderly completion of the search may be facilitated if the occupants of the premises are present.at.this interest in efficiency derives from distinct,but related,concerns.
if occupants are permitted to wander around the premises,there is the potential for interference with the execution of the search warrant.they can hide or destroy evidence,seek to distract the officers,or simply get in the way.those risks are not presented by an occupant who departs beforehand.so,in this case,after bailey drove away from the lake drive apartment,he was not a threat to the proper execution of the search.had he returned,officers would have been free to detain him at that point.a general interest in avoiding obstruction of a search,however,can not justify detention beyond the vicinity of the premises to be searched.
summers also noted that occupants can assist the.under the reasoning in summers,the occupants may induce them to open locked doors or locked containers to avoid the use of force that is not only damaging to property but may also delay the completion of the task at hand.ibid.this justification must be confined to those persons who are on site and so in a position,when detained,to at once observe the progression of the search and it would have no limiting principle were it to be applied to persons beyond the premises of the search.here,it appears the police officers decided to wait until bailey had left the vicinity of the search before detaining him.in any event it later became clear to the officers that bailey did not wish to cooperate.see app,i do live there.anything you find there ai mine,and i not cooperating with your investigation and,by the time the officers brought bailey back to the apartment,the search team had discovered contraband.bailey detention thus served no purpose in ensuring the efficient completion of the search.
the third law enforcement interest addressed in summers was the the legitimate law enforcement interest in preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found.at.the proper interpretation of this language,in the context of summers and in the broader context of the reasonableness standard that must govern and inform the detention incident to a search,is that the police can prohibit an occupant from leaving the scene of the search.as with the other interests identified in summers,this justification serves to preserve the integrity of the search by controlling those persons who are on the scene.if police officers are concerned about flight,and have to keep close supervision of occupants who are not restrained,they might rush the search,causing unnecessary damage to property or compromising its careful execution.allowing officers to secure the scene by detaining those present also prevents the search from being impeded by occupants leaving with the evidence being sought or the means to find it.
the concern over flight is not because of the danger of flight itself but because of the damage that potential flight can cause to the integrity of the search.this interest does not independently justify detention of an occupant beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.the need to prevent flight,if unbounded,might be used to argue for detention,while a search is underway,of any regular occupant regardless of his or her location at the time of the search.if not circumscribed,the rationale of preventing flight would justify,for instance,detaining a suspect who is miles away,ready to board a plane.the interest in preventing escape from police can not extend this far without undermining the usual rules for arrest based on probable cause or a brief stop for questioning under standards derived from terry.even if the detention of a former occupant away from the premises could facilitate a later arrest should incriminating evidence be discovered,the mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the fourth amendment.mincey arizona.
in sum,of the three law enforcement interests identified to justify the detention in summers,none applies with the same or similar force to the detention of recent occupants beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.any of the individual interests is also insufficient,on its own,to justify an expansion of the rule in summers to permit the detention of a former occupant,wherever he may be found away from the scene of the search.this would give officers too much discretion.the categorical authority to detain incident to the execution of a search warrant must be limited to the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.
in summers,the court recognized the authority to detain occupants incident to the execution of a search warrant not only in light of the law enforcement interests at stake but also because the intrusion on personal liberty was limited.the court held detention of a current occupant represents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant.at.because the detention occurs in the individual own home,it could add only minimally to the public stigma associated with the search itself and would involve neither the inconvenience nor the indignity associated with a compelled visit to the police station.at.
where officers arrest an individual away from his home,however,there is an additional level of intrusiveness.a public detention,even if merely incident to a search,will resemble a arrest.as demonstrated here,detention beyond the immediate vicinity can involve an initial detention away from the scene and a second detention at the residence.in between,the individual will suffer the additional indignity of a compelled transfer back to the premises,giving all the appearances of an arrest.the detention here was more intrusive than a usual detention at the search scene.bailey car was stopped he was ordered to step out and was detained in full public view he was handcuffed,transported in a marked patrol car,and detained further outside the apartment.these facts illustrate that detention away from a premises where police are already present often will be more intrusive than detentions at the scene.
summers recognized that a rule permitting the detention of occupants on the premises during the execution of a search warrant,even absent individualized suspicion,was reasonable and necessary in light of the law enforcement interests in conducting a safe and efficient search.because this exception grants substantial authority to police officers to detain outside of the traditional rules of the fourth amendment,it must be circumscribed.
a spatial constraint defined by the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched is therefore required for detentions incident to the execution of a search warrant.the police action permitted here the search of a residence has a spatial dimension,and so a spatial or geographical boundary can be used to determine the area within which both the search and detention incident to that search may occur.limiting the rule in summers to the area in which an occupant poses a real threat to the safe and efficient execution of a search warrant ensures that the scope of the detention incident to a search is confined to its underlying justification.once an occupant is beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched,the law enforcement interests are diminished and the intrusiveness of the detention is more severe.
here,petitioner was detained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of the immediate vicinity of the premises in question and so this case presents neither the necessity nor the occasion to further define the meaning of immediate vicinity.in closer cases courts can consider a number of factors to determine whether an occupant was detained within the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched,including the lawful limits of the premises,whether the occupant was within the line of sight of his dwelling,the ease of reentry from the occupant location,and other relevant factors.
confining an officer authority to detain under summers to the immediate vicinity of a premises to be searched is a proper limit because it accords with the rationale of the rule.the rule adopted by the court of appeals here,allowing detentions of a departed occupant as soon as reasonably practicable,departs from the spatial limit that is necessary to confine the rule in light of the substantial intrusions on the liberty of those detained.because detention is justified by the interests in executing a safe and efficient search,the decision to detain must be acted upon at the scene of the search and not at a later time in a more remote place.if officers elect to defer the detention until the suspect or departing occupant leaves the immediate vicinity,the lawfulness of detention is controlled by other standards,including,of course,a brief stop for questioning based on reasonable suspicion under terry or an arrest based on probable cause.a suspect particular actions in leaving the scene,including whether he appears to be armed or fleeing with the evidence sought,and any information the officers acquire from those who are conducting the search,including information that incriminating evidence has been discovered,will bear,of course,on the lawfulness of a later stop or detention.for example,had the search team radioed detectives sneider and gorbecki about the gun and drugs discovered in the lake drive apartment as the officers stopped bailey and middleton,this may have provided them with probable cause for an arrest.
detentions incident to the execution of a search warrant are reasonable under the fourth amendment because the limited intrusion on personal liberty is outweighed by the special law enforcement interests at stake.once an individual has left the immediate vicinity of a premises to be searched,however,detentions must be justified by some other rationale.in this respect it must be noted that the district court,as an alternative ruling,held that stopping petitioner was lawful under terry.this opinion expresses no view on that issue.it will be open,on remand,for the court of appeals to address the matter and to determine whether,assuming the terry stop was valid,it yielded information that justified the detention the officers then imposed.
the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice scalia,with whom justice ginsburg and justice kagan join,concurring.
i join the court opinion.i write separately to why the court of appeals approach to this case endorsed by the dissent is incompatible with the categorical rule set forth in michigan summers.
summers identified several interests supporting the detention of occupants incident to the execution of a warrant to search for contraband,along with several reasons why such detentions are typically less intrusive than an arrest.see,at.weighing those factors,the court determined that it is constitutionally reasonable to require a citizen to remain while officers of the law execute a valid warrant to search his home.at.
the existence and scope of the summers exception were predicated on that balancing of the interests and burdens.but crucially whether summers authorizes a seizure in an individual case does not depend on any balancing,because the summers exception,within its scope,is categorical.muehler mena.that summers establishes a categorical,rule is simply not open to debate summers itself insisted on it the rule we adopt today does not depend upon such an ad hoc determination,because the officer is not required to evaluate either the quantum of proof justifying detention or the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure.at.where summers applies,a seizure is ipso facto constitutionally reasonable.at.
the question in this case is whether summers applies at all.it applies only to seizures of occupants that is,persons within the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.ante,at.bailey was seized a mile away.ergo,summers can not sanction bailey detention.it really is that simple.
the court of appeals mistake,echoed by the dissent,was to replace that straightforward,binary inquiry with balancing.weighing the equities bailey posed a risk of harm to the officers,his detention was not unreasonably prolonged,and so forth the court of appeals proclaimed the officers conduct,in the circumstances presented,reasonable and prudent.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted see also post,at opinion of breyer.that may be so,but it is irrelevant to whether summers authorized the officers to seize bailey without probable cause.to resolve that issue,a court need ask only one question was the person seized within the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched ante,at.
the court of appeals read summers spatial constraint somewhat more promiscuously in its view,it sufficed that police observed bailey in the process of leaving the premises and detained him as soon as practicable.at emphasis deleted see also post,at.that has pragmatic appeal police,the argument runs,should not be precluded from seizing the departing occupant at a distance from the premises if that would be safer than stopping him on the front steps.but it rests on the fallacy that each search warrant entitles the government to a concomitant summers detention.conducting a summers seizure incident to the execution of a warrant is not the government right it is an exception justified by necessity to a rule that would otherwise render the seizure unlawful.thornton united states,scalia,concurring in judgment.
it bears repeating that the general rule is that fourth amendment seizures are reasonable only if based on probable cause.dunaway new york.summers embodies a categorical judgment that in one narrow circumstance the presence of occupants during the execution of a search warrant seizures are reasonable despite the absence of probable cause.sum mers itself foresaw that without clear limits its exception could swallow the general rule if a multifactor balancing test of reasonable police conduct under the were extended to cover all seizures that do not amount to technical arrests,it recognized,the protections intended by the framers could all too easily in the consideration and balancing of the circumstances presented by different cases.at,quoting dunaway,supra,at some internal quotation marks omitted.the dissent would harvest from summers what it likes permission to seize without probable cause and leave behind what it finds uncongenial limitation of that permission to a narrow,categorical exception,not an reasonableness inquiry.summers anticipated that gambit and explicitly disavowed the dissent balancing test.see,at,t he rule we adopt today does not depend upon such an ad hoc determination 
regrettably,this court opinion in summers facilitated the court of appeals error here by setting forth a smorgasbord of interests assertedly justifying its holding,including preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found and obtaining residents assistance in open ing locked doors or locked containers.at.we should not have been so expansive.the summers exception is appropriately predicated only on law enforcement interest in carrying out the search unimpeded by violence or other disruptions.the common denominator of the few fourth amendment doctrines permitting seizures based on less than probable cause is the presence of some governmental interest independent of the ordinary interest in investigating crime and apprehending suspects.at stewart,dissenting.preventing flight is not a special governmental interest it is indistinguishable from the ordinary interest in apprehending suspects.similarly,the interest in inducing residents to open locked doors or containers is nothing more than the ordinary interest in investigating crime.that summers detentions aid police in uncovering evidence and nabbing criminals does not distinguish them from the mine run of seizures unsupported by probable cause,which the fourth amendment generally proscribes.
summers clear rule simplifies the task of officers who encounter occupants during a search.i f police are to have workable rules,the balancing of the competing must in large part be done on a categorical basis not in an ad hoc,fashion by individual police officers.at,quoting dunaway,supra,at white,concurring see also arizona gant,scalia,concurring.but having received the advantage of summers categorical authorization to detain occupants incident to a search,the government must take the bitter with the sweet beyond summers spatial bounds,must comport with ordinary fourth amendment principles.

justice breyer,with whom justice thomas and justice alito join,dissenting.
did the police act reasonably when they followed for miles,and then detained,two men who left a basement apartment as the police were about to enter to execute a search warrant for a gun the court of appeals for the second circuit found that the police action was reasonable because the premises were subject to a valid search warrant,the detained persons were seen leaving those premises,and the detention was effected as soon as reasonably practicable.in light of the risks of flight,of evidence destruction,and of human injury present in this and similar cases,i would follow the approach of the court of appeals and uphold its determination.
the court of appeals rested its holding upon district court findings.the police stopped the men at the earliest practicable location that was consistent with the safety and security of the officers and the public.supp,edny.d etention in open view outside the residence would have subjected the officers to additional dangers during the execution of the search,and it would have frustrat ed the whole purpose of the search due to destruction of evidence.at.it also could have 
jeopardize d the search or endanger ed the lives of the officers by allowing any other occupants inside the residence,who might see or hear the detention of the individual outside the residence as he was leaving,to have some time to destroy or hide incriminating evidence just before the police are about to enter for the search flee through a back door or window or arm themselves in preparation for a violent confrontation with the police when they entered to conduct the search.at.
moreover,the police stopped the men car at the first spot where they determined it was safe to conduct the stop,namely after the car,which had traveled a few blocks a
