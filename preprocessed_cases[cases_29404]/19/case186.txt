petitioner lawrence jefferson,who has been sentenced to death,claimed in both state and federal courts that his lawyers were constitutionally inadequate because they failed to investigate a traumatic head injury that he suffered as a child.the state court rejected that claim after making a finding that the attorneys were advised by an expert that such investigation was unnecessary.under the governing federal statute,that factual finding is presumed correct unless any one of eight exceptions applies.see d ed.but the court of appeals considered only one of those exceptions specifically d.and on that basis,it considered itself to accept the state court finding,and rejected jefferson claim.because the court of appeals did not fully consider several remaining potentially applicable exceptions,we vacate its judgment and remand.
when jefferson was a child,he suffered a serious injury to his head.jefferson terry,supp,nd see,at quoting jefferson mother testimony that a car ran over the top of his head when he was two years old.the accident left his skull swollen and misshapen and his forehead visibly scarred.jefferson hall,carnes,dissenting.during the district court proceedings below,uncontroverted experts testified that,as a result of his head injury,jefferson has permanent brain damage that causes abnormal behavior over which he has no or substantially limited control.supp,at.according to these experts,jefferson condition causes otional dullness,restless or aggressive characteristics,impulsiveness,temper outbursts,markedly diminished impulse control,impaired social judgment,and transient outbursts of rage which are totally inconsistent with his normal behavioral pattern.at.
the experts further testified that jefferson severe cognitive disabilities profoundly alter his ability to plan and coordinate his actions,to be aware of the consequences of his behavior,and to engage in premeditated or intentional acts.at.but they testified he is neither psychotic nor retarded,at.thus,they said,to a lay observer or even to a professional psychologist,jefferson does not outwardly appear mentally impaired.indeed,according to the experts,the behavior that may result from his condition could,without the administration of proper testing,be mistaken for volitional.at.
jefferson faced a death sentence for killing his while the two men were fishing,at.prior to trial,he was examined by a psychologist named gary dudley,who prepared a formal report in which he concluded that jefferson mental deficiencies do not impair his judgment or capacity.at quoting report.but dudley report included a caveat one possibility that could not be explored because of jefferson incarceration has to do with the sequelae,pathologies,related to a head injury experienced during childhood.ibid.in my opinion,he wrote,it would be worthwhile to conduct neuropsychological evaluation of this individual to rule out an organic etiology,to rule out brain damage.ibid.
although it is undisputed that the testing dudley recommended could have easily been performed,supp,at,and that jefferson attorneys possessed police reports and hospital records recounting his head injury,at,the attorneys did not have jefferson tested.at sentencing,they presented only testimony from two prison guards,who stated that jefferson was an unproblematic inmate,and from three members of jefferson family,who testified that he is a responsible,generous,gentle,and kind person and a good father.at.and while jefferson mother briefly mentioned the car accident,she was not questioned and did not offer any testimony regarding the impact,if any,that the accident had on him.at.thus,a s far as the jury knew,jefferson did not suffer from brain damage or neurological impairment he had no organic disorders and his emotional stability,impulse control,and judgment were perfectly normal.at carnes,dissenting.
jefferson sought habeas relief in state court,arguing that his two trial attorneys unreasonably failed to pursue testing.in response,the trial attorneys testified that they did not pursue such testing because,after delivering his formal written report,dudley later told them that further investigation may be a waste of time because the rest of his report had said that jefferson was non psychotic.at quoting testimony.dudley did not testify in person at the hearing,but he submitted a sworn affidavit denying that he had ever made such statements.he said it had always been his expert opinion that neuropsychological testing was necessary and that when he wrote as much in his formal report he meant it.at carnes,dissenting quoting affidavit.he added,i never,before or after that report,suggested to jefferson attorneys that such an evaluation was not necessary or that it would not be worthwhile.pet.for cert.
jefferson contends,and the state has not disputed,that after the hearing concluded the judge contacted the attorneys for the state ex parte.and in a private conversation that included neither jefferson nor his attorneys,the judge asked the state attorneys to draft the opinion of the court.see,at.according to jefferson,no such request was made of him,nor was he informed of the request made to opposing counsel,at,see also jefferson zant,jefferson contends the order amounts to no more and no less than a reply brief to which he has not had a chance to respond

notably,as the georgia supreme court acknowledged,the state opinion discusses statements purportedly made on jefferson behalf by a witness who did not testify or participate in the proceedings,at,at see state order.nonetheless,the opinion was adopted verbatim by the state court.at,at.and while the state supreme court recognized that we have criticized such a practice,it affirmed the judgment,at,at,quoting anderson bessemer city.
jefferson next sought federal habeas relief in the district court.in his opening brief,he argued that there is no reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give any deference to the findings of the state habeas corpus court.brief for petitioner in nd,doc,and hereinafter district court brief.in support of that argument,he claimed that the state court merely signed an order drafted by the state without revision of a single word,even though the order described witnesses who never testified.ibid.and he said that such a process rais es serious doubts as to whether the judge even read,much less carefully considered,the proposed order submitted by the state.ibid.
the district court ruled in jefferson favor.it noted that under the relevant statute factual findings of state courts are presumed to be correct unless one of eight enumerated exceptions applies.supp,at see also,at,listing the exceptions.and it acknowledged the state habeas corpus court failure to explain the basis for its credibility findings,at.but it accepted jefferson claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without disturbing the state court factual findings because it believed he should prevail even accepting those findings as true,at.
on appeal,jefferson defended the district court judgment primarily on its own terms.but he also argued that the state court factfinding was dubious at best in light of the process that court employed,and that the court of appeals therefore should harbor serious doubts about the findings of fact and credibility determinations in the state court record.brief for in,hereinafter appeals brief.
a divided court of appeals panel reversed,and jefferson filed this petition for certiorari asking us to review his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.and,in so doing,he challenges as he did in the state supreme court,the district court,and the court of appeals the fact findings of the state court,given what he describes as the deficient procedure employed by that court while reviewing his claim.pet.for cert,recounting reason s to doubt the state court findings.lebron national railroad passenger corporation,stating standard for preserving an issue for review in this court.
this habeas application was filed prior to the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of and is therefore governed by federal habeas law as it existed prior to that point.lindh murphy.in,we set forth the appropriate standard to be applied by a federal court in habeas corpus when the facts pertinent to a habeas application are in dispute.townsend sain.we held that when the habeas applicant was afforded a full and fair hearing by the state court resulting in reliable findings the district court ordinarily should accept the facts as found by the judge,at.however,if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court,either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding,we held that the federal court must hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve any facts that are in dispute.at.we further explain ed the controlling criteria by enumerating six circumstances in which such an evidentiary hearing would be required 
the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole the procedure employed by the state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence the material facts were not adequately developed at the hearing or for any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hearing.at emphasis added.
three years later,in,congress enacted an amendment to the federal habeas statute that was an almost verbatim codification of the standards delineated in townsend sain.miller fenton.that codification read in relevant part as follows 
in any proceeding instituted in a federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,a determination of a factual issue,made by a state court of competent jurisdiction,shall be presumed to be correct,unless the applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear,or the respondent shall admit that the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state court hearing that the factfinding procedure employed by the state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing that the material facts were not adequately developed at the state court hearing that the state court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter or over the person of the applicant in the state court proceeding that the applicant was an indigent and the state court,in deprivation of his constitutional right,failed to appoint counsel to represent him in the state court proceeding that the applicant did not receive a full,fair,and adequate hearing in the state court proceeding or that the applicant was otherwise denied due process of law in the state court proceeding or unless the federal court on a consideration of the relevant part of the record as a whole concludes that such factual determination is not fairly supported by the record.d emphasis added.
as is clear from the statutory text quoted above,and as the district court correctly stated,if any one of the eight enumerated exceptions applies then the state court factfinding is not presumed correct.supp,at accord,miller,supra,at under d,findings of fact shall be presumed to be correct in a federal habeas corpus proceeding unless one of eight enumerated exceptions applies see also hertz liebman,federal habeas corpus practice and procedure c,ed.
jefferson has consistently argued that the federal courts should harbor serious doubts about and should not give any deference to the findings of fact and credibility determinations made by the state habeas court because those findings were drafted exclusively by the attorneys for the state pursuant to an ex parte request from the judge,who made no such request of jefferson,failed to notify jefferson of the request made to opposing counsel,and adopted the state proposed opinion verbatim even though it recounted evidence from a nonexistent witness.see,appeals brief,district court brief,pet.for cert.these are arguments that the state court process was deficient.in other words,they are arguments that jefferson did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in state court.townsend,supra,at.or,to use the statutory language,they are arguments that the state court factfinding procedure,hearing,and proceeding were not full,fair,and adequate.d.
but the court of appeals did not consider the state court process when it applied the statutory presumption of correctness.instead,it invoked circuit precedent that applied only paragraph of d,which,codifying the second townsend exception,at,lifts the presumption of correctness for findings that are not fairly supported by the record.see,at quoting jackson herring,in turn quoting d.and even though the court of appeals recognize d that jefferson had argued that the state court process had produced factual findings that were dubious at best,and that federal courts should therefore harbor serious doubts about the state court findings of fact and credibility,the court of appeals nonetheless held that the state court findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness that it was to apply,at,quoting appeals brief.the court of appeals explicitly stated that it considered itself to defer to the state court findings because jefferson has not argued that any of the state courts factual findings were not fairly supported by the record,a direct reference to d and to the second townsend exception,at,emphasis added.and it then concluded based on these factual findings of the state habeas courts all of which are fairly supported by the record we believe that jefferson counsel were reasonable in deciding not to pursue neuropsychological testing.at emphasis added.
in our view,the court of appeals did not properly consider the legal status of the state court factual findings.under townsend,as codified by the governing statute,a federal court is not to accept any and all findings that are fairly supported by the record.those words come from d,which is only one of eight enumerated exceptions to the presumption of correctness.but there are seven others,see d,none of which the court of appeals considered when addressing jefferson claim.to be sure,we have previously stated in cases applying d that a federal court may not overturn a state court factual conclusion unless the conclusion is not fairly supported by the record.parker dugger,granting federal habeas relief after rejecting state court finding under d see also demosthenes baal,per curiam applying d post,at scalia,dissenting.but in those cases there was no suggestion that any other provisions enumerated in d were at issue.that is not the case here.in treating d as the exclusive statutory exception,and by failing to address jefferson argument that the state court procedures deprived its findings of deference,the court of appeals applied the statute and our precedents incorrectly.
although we have stated that a court verbatim adoption of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties should be treated as findings of the court,we have also criticized that practice.anderson,at.and we have not considered the lawfulness of,nor the application of the habeas statute to,the use of such a practice where a judge solicits the proposed findings ex parte,does not provide the opposing party an opportunity to criticize the findings or to submit his own,or adopts findings that contain internal evidence suggesting that the judge may not have read them,at.code of judicial conduct,canon a prohibiting ex parte judicial communications.
we decline to determine in the first instance whether any of the exceptions enumerated in d apply in this case,see,cutter wilkinson,especially given that the facts surrounding the state habeas court process are undeveloped.respondent has conceded that it drafted the state court final order at that court request and that the order was adopted verbatim,at,at,and has not disputed in this court that the state court solicited the order ex parte and without prior notice and did not seek a proposed order from petitioner,pet.for cert,and.but the precise nature of what transpired during the proceedings is not fully known.see at,at noting dispute as to whether jefferson had a chance to respond to the final order see also pet.for cert.
accordingly,we believe it necessary for the lower courts to determine on remand whether the state court factual findings warrant a presumption of correctness,and to conduct any further proceedings as may be appropriate in light of their resolution of that issue.see townsend,supra,at keeney.in so holding,we express no opinion as to whether jefferson sixth amendment rights were violated assuming the state court factual findings to be true.
the petition for a writ of certiorari and motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.the judgment of the court of appeals is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
decided may,
justice scalia,with whom justice thomas joins,dissenting.
the question presented by jefferson petition for writ of certiorari is whether his trial attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when they declined to pursue further investigation of jefferson childhood head injury.in my view the court should either answer that question or as i would prefer deny the petition.instead,it summarily vacates the judgment of the court of appeals on an altogether different ground that was neither raised nor passed upon below and that is not fairly included within the sole question presented.to make matters worse,the court conjures up an error with respect to that ground by misquoting and mischaracterizing the court of appeals opinion,ante,at,and by overlooking relevant authority from this court.i respectfully dissent.
the prior version of d ed.applicable in this case provided that in federal habeas proceedings the factual determinations of a state court shall be presumed to be correct,unless the applicant proves,the respondent admits,or a federal court determines that one of eight exceptions set forth in d applies.the court concludes that the eleventh circuit misapplied that provision and our precedents by treating one of those exceptions,d,as the exclusive statutory exception to the presumption of correctness,and by failing to address whether d,or might also bar application of that presumption ante,at.
the court opinion,however,is the first anyone including jefferson has heard of this argument.jefferson briefs below contain no discussion or even citation of subsection d let alone of paragraphs,or and the courts below understandably never passed upon the application of those provisions.under our longstanding practice,that should be the end of the matter.see,pennsylvania of corrections yeskey.
but the court insists,ante,at,that if we squint at them long enough we can see in jefferson briefs below a challenge to the state court process cognizable under d,and.but the handful of isolated,vague statements it musters buried in hundreds of pages of briefs show no such thing.the court only evidence that jefferson presented the point to the district court,ante,at,consists of a single sentence of text and an accompanying footnote in the prior proceedings section of his brief.final evidentiary brief and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,record in nd,doc.hereinafter district court brief.the sentence is in entering the state habeas corpus order judge newton merely signed an order drafted by the state without revision of a single word.at.the footnote adds 
t he order signed by judge newton described witnesses who never testified,raising serious doubt as to whether he even read,much less carefully considered,the proposed order submitted by the state.in this circumstance,there is no reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give any deference to the findings of the state habeas court,because there was apparently no serious consideration or deliberation of the factual and legal issues raised.
this passing suggestion that deference would be unwarranted is,to put it mildly,an elliptical way to argue that the state procedure was inadequate,d,that jefferson was denied a full,fair,and adequate hearing,d,or that jefferson was denied due process of law,d.and it only appeared,i emphasize again,in the prior proceedings section of the brief.the argument section of jefferson district court brief,consisting of pages and containing separate assignments of error from iii to xliv,makes no mention of the ground upon which the court today relies.and the assignment of error that is the basis for the question presented in jefferson petition,vi,at,did not dispute the state courts factual findings under d,but only challenged the state courts legal conclusion that his attorneys failure to conduct a fuller investigation into the head injury he suffered as a child was not deficient performance under strickland washington.
jefferson also did not raise the point in the eleventh circuit.his brief to that court acknowledged that the state courts f indings of fact and credibility determinations are reviewed for clear error.brief for,hereinafter appeals brief.it declared that the district court correctly deferred to the fact findings of the state court in adjudicating his claim,at capitalization and boldface type deleted see also,at,and.and it conceded that with respect to the claim,t he relevant facts are not in dispute.at.jefferson did characterize the state habeas court factual findings as generally dubious and suggested there were serious doubts about them,at.but not once did he argue that the dubiousness of the findings was the consequence of a failure to meet the requirements of d,or or even more generally that the findings should not be presumed correct under d.instead,he pressed the same argument he made in the district court even if the state courts factual findings were correct,his trial attorneys rendered ineffective assistance in deciding to forgo further investigation of his childhood head injury,at.
nor did the courts below pass upon the argument the court now addresses.the district court did not dispute the state courts factual findings.jefferson terry,supp,nd.it accepted those findings as true,including the state habeas court credibility findings,at,and,but held as a matter of law that it was objectively unreasonable for jefferson attorneys not to investigate further into the effect,if any,of the accident on jefferson mental capacity and health,at.concluding that jefferson was thereby prejudiced,the court ordered a new sentencing hearing,at.
the court of appeals disagreed with that determination and reversed,holding that his trial attorneys performance was not objectively unreasonable under strickland.jefferson hall.that court correctly stated the applicable framework under d 
questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact resolved by state habeas courts are reviewed de novo,while the state courts factual findings are subject to the presumption of correctness.freund butterworth,cir.although these findings may be disregarded if,for example,they are not fairly supported by the record,jackson herring,cir.quoting d,this court has construed the presumption of correctness standard to be the same as the clear error standard of review.at emphasis added footnote omitted.
confronted with no argument that d applied or that it must disregard the state courts factual findings,the court of appeals understandably did not pass upon those questions.
the court of appeals did consider the record on its own,as required by d,to determine whether the state courts factual determinations were fairly supported by the
