respondent was convicted in rhode island superior court on counts of sexual assault and sentenced to consecutive life terms.his conviction became final on direct review on may.in addition to his direct appeal,he filed two relevant state motions.one,a may,motion to reduce his sentence under rhode island superior court rule of criminal procedure,was denied.the state supreme court affirmed on january.the second,a state postconviction relief motion,was also denied.that decision was affirmed on december.when respondent filed his federal habeas petition,his conviction had been final for over years.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa generally requires a federal petition to be filed within one year of the date on which a judgment became final,d a,but a properly filed application for state or other collateral review tolls that period,d.respondent postconviction relief motion tolled the period for over nine years,but his rule motion must also trigger the tolling provision for his habeas petition to be timely.the district court dismissed the petition as untimely,adopting the magistrate judge conclusion that the rule motion was not a properly filed application for collateral review under d.the first circuit reversed.
the phrase collateral review in d means judicial review of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review.
a the parties agree that the answer to the question whether a motion to reduce sentence is an application for state or other collateral review turns on the meaning of collateral review,but they disagree about what that meaning should be.
b because collateral review is not defined in aedpa,the court begins with the ordinary understanding of that phrase.by definition,collateral describes something that is indirect,not direct.oxford english dictionary.this suggests that collateral review is not part of direct review.this conclusion is supported by the definition of the related phrase collateral attack and by the court prior use of the term collateral to describe proceedings that are separate from the direct review process.
c the term review is best understood as a judicial reexamination.webster third new international dictionary.
a rule motion to reduce sentence under rhode island law is an application for collateral review that triggers aedpa tolling provision.
a rhode island rule is similar to the version of federal rule of criminal procedure in effect before the federal sentencing reform act of.the rule permits a court to provide relief,as relevant here,to reduce any sentence,and it is generally addressed to the sound discretion of the sentencing justice.under the limited review available,an appellate court may disturb the trial justice decision if the sentence imposed is without justification and is grossly disparate when compared to sentences for similar offenses.
b keeping these principles in mind,a rule sentence reduction proceeding is collateral.the parties agree that the motion is not part of the direct review process,and both this court and lower federal courts have described a motion to reduce sentence under old federal rule as invoking a collateral remedy.therefore,it is not difficult to conclude that rhode island motion to reduce sentence is collateral.a rule motion also calls for review of the sentence within d meaning.the decision to reduce a sentence involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to determine whether a more lenient sentence is proper.the trial justice is guided by several sentencing factors in making that decision.and those factors are also used by the state supreme court in evaluating the trial justice justifications for the sentence.
c rhode island arguments in support of its opposing view that collateral review includes only legal challenges to a conviction or sentence,and thus excludes motions for a discretionary sentence reduction,are unpersuasive.nor does collateral review turn on whether a motion is part of the same criminal case.

justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim tolls the limitation period for filing a federal habeas petition.d.the question in this case is whether a motion to reduce sentence under rhode island law tolls the limitation period,thereby rendering respondent khalil kholi federal habeas petition timely.we hold that the phrase collateral review in d means judicial review of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review.because the parties agree that a motion to reduce sentence under rhode island law is not part of the direct review process,we hold that respondent motion tolled the aedpa limitation period and that his federal habeas petition was therefore timely.
in,respondent was convicted in rhode island superior court on counts of sexual assault,and he was sentenced to consecutive terms of life.respondent raised various challenges to his conviction on direct appeal,but the supreme court of rhode island affirmed his conviction.see state kholi.the parties agree that respondent conviction became final on direct review when his time expired for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in this court.brief for petitioner,brief for respondent,see generally jimenez quarterman,slip,at.that date was may.see this court rules.
in addition to taking a direct appeal,respondent filed two state motions that are relevant to our decision.the first,filed on may,was a motion to reduce sentence under rule of the rhode island superior court rules of criminal procedure app.in that motion,respondent asked the trial court to reconsider its prior determination and order that his life sentences run concurrently.state kholi,order.concluding that the sentence imposed was appropriate,the hearing justice denied the rule motion.ibid.on january,the state supreme court affirmed and observed that the facts clearly justified the sentence,at.
on may,while the rule motion was pending,respondent also filed an application for state postconviction relief,see laws et lexis titled post conviction remedy which challenged his conviction.the trial court denied this motion as well,and the state supreme court affirmed that decision on december.see kholi wall.
respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the district of rhode island on september.app.by that time,his conviction had been final for over years.aedpa generally requires a federal habeas petition to be filed within one year of the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review.d a.but the limitation period is tolled during the pendency of a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.d.
there is no dispute that respondent application for postconviction relief tolled the limitation period for over nine years from may,through december,at.even after subtracting that stretch of time from the period,however,the period between the conclusion of direct review and the filing of the federal habeas petition still exceeds one year.thus,in order for respondent petition to be timely,the rule motion to reduce sentence must also trigger the tolling provision.
respondent federal habeas petition was referred to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation,and the magistrate judge concluded that the rule motion was not a properly filed application for or other collateral review under d because it was a plea of leniency,and not a motion challenging the legal sufficiency of his sentence.no.ca,wl.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation and therefore dismissed the federal habeas petition as untimely.see,at.on appeal,the first circuit reversed.
the courts of appeals are divided over the question whether a motion to reduce sentence tolls the period of limitation under d we granted certiorari to answer this question with respect to a motion to reduce sentence under rhode island law.
aedpa establishes a period of limitation for a state prisoner to file a federal application for a writ of habeas corpus.d.this period runs from the latest of four specified dates,including the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.d a see also jimenez,supra,at slip,at explaining when the conclusion of direct review occurs the limitation period is tolled,however,during the pendency of a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.d.the question in this case is whether a motion for reduction of sentence under rhode island rule is an application for state or other collateral review.
the parties agree that the answer to this question turns on the meaning of the phrase collateral review,see brief for petitioner brief for respondent,but they disagree about the definition of that term.rhode island argues that collateral review includes only legal challenges to a conviction or sentence and thus excludes motions seeking a discretionary sentence reduction.respondent,on the other hand,maintains that collateral review is review other than review of a judgment in the direct appeal process and thus includes motions to reduce sentence.brief for respondent.we agree with respondent understanding of collateral review.
collateral review is not defined in aedpa,and we have never provided a comprehensive definition of that term.see duncan walker.we therefore begin by considering the ordinary understanding of the phrase collateral review.see williams taylor,we give the words of a statute their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import internal quotation marks omitted see also carey saffold,considering the ordinary meaning of the word pending in d.
the term collateral,in its customary and preferred sense,williams,supra,at,means l ying aside from the main subject,line of action,issue,purpose,subordinate,indirect,oxford english dictionary ed.hereinafter oed see also webster third new international dictionary hereinafter webster accompanying as secondary,indirect,or ancillary by definition,something that is collateral is indirect,not direct.oed.this suggests that collateral review is review that is l ying aside from the main review,that is not part of direct review.see ibid.
the definition of the related phrase collateral attack points in the same direction.a collateral attack is a n attack on a judgment in a proceeding other than a direct appeal.black law dictionary ed.emphasis added.code defining collateral attack as any form of postconviction relief other than a direct appeal this usage buttresses the conclusion that collateral review means a form of review that is not part of the direct appeal process.
our prior usage of the term collateral also supports this understanding.we have previously described a variety of proceedings as collateral,and all of these proceedings share the characteristic that we have identified,they stand apart from the process of direct review.
for example,our cases make it clear that habeas corpus is a form of collateral review.we have used the terms habeas corpus and collateral review interchangeably,see,murray carrier,and it is well accepted that state petitions for habeas corpus toll the limitation period,rhines weber,t he statute of limitations was tolled while rhines state habeas corpus petition was pending 
we have also described coram nobis as a means of collateral attack,see,united states morgan,internal quotation marks omitted,and we have used the term collateral to describe proceedings under and a prior version of rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.in united states robinson,we distinguished between the process of direct appeal and a number of collateral remedies,including federal rule motions,motions,and coram nobis,at.similarly,in bartone united states,per curiam,we drew a distinction between a d irect attack on a criminal judgment and collateral proceedings,such as rule,habeas corpus,and proceedings,at.
all of the proceedings identified in these prior opinions as collateral are separate from the direct review process,and thus our prior usage of the term collateral buttresses the conclusion that collateral review means a form of review that is not direct.
of course,to trigger the tolling provision,a collateral proceeding must also involve a form of review,but the meaning of that term seems clear.review is best understood as an act of inspecting or examining or a judicial reexamination.webster see also black,supra,at c onsideration,inspection,or reexamination of a subject or thing oed t o submit a decree,act,to examination or revision we thus agree with the first circuit that review commonly denotes a looking over or examination with a view to amendment or improvement.at quoting webster.viewed as a whole,then,collateral review of a judgment or claim means a judicial reexamination of a judgment or claim in a proceeding outside of the direct review process.
we now apply this definition of collateral review to a rule motion to reduce sentence under rhode island law.
rule of the rhode island rules of criminal procedure is much like the version of federal rule of criminal procedure that was in force prior to the enactment of the federal sentencing reform act of and the promulgation of the federal sentencing guidelines.see state byrnes,per curiam reporter notes following super.rule crim.proc,court rules,lexis.under the rhode island rules,a rule motion permits a court to provide relief from a sentence in three ways a court may correct an illegal sentence,correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner,and reduce any sentence.super.rule crim.proc.a see,supra.in this case,respondent filed a motion to reduce his sentence,which permits a trial justice to decide on reflection or on the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence originally imposed was,for any reason,unduly severe.state ruffner,quoting state mendoza,see also reporter notes following super.rule crim.proc,court rules,at.rhode island courts have,at times,referred to such a motion as a plea for leniency.ruffner,supra,at quoting mendoza,supra,at.
a rule motion is made in the superior court,and it is generally heard by the same trial justice who sentenced the defendant.byrnes,supra,at.the rhode island supreme court has explained that a motion to reduce sentence is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice and that appellate review of the trial justice decision is limited.ruffner,supra,at quoting mendoza,supra,at.an appellate court may nevertheless disturb the trial justice decision when the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.ruffner,supra,at quoting state coleman,internal quotation marks omitted see also ruffner,supra,at asking whether trial justice abuse d his discretion 
with these principles in mind,we consider whether rhode island rule motion to reduce sentence is an application for collateral review.
the first and the critical question is whether a rhode island rule sentence reduction proceeding is collateral.respondent and rhode island agree that such a motion is not part of the direct review process.moreover,we have previously referred to a motion to reduce sentence under old rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure as invoking a collateral remedy,see robinson,supra,at,and rhode island rule motion to reduce sentence is substantially similar to former federal rule,byrnes,supra,at.lower courts have also referred to federal rule sentence reduction motions as collateral.see,fernandez united states,fernandez initiated a collateral attack on his sentence with a rule b motion to reduce his sentence under the old federal rule.we thus have little difficul
