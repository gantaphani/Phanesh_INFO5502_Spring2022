amit mathur wants a new trial or,at least,resentencing based on the government tardy disclosure of brady material.see brady maryland.concluding,as we do,that the district court acted appropriately in addressing the delayed disclosure,we affirm.
background 
we bifurcate our discussion of the background events,first rehearsing the underlying facts and then charting the course of the proceedings below.
a.the scheme.
refined to its essentials,this case involves a kaleidoscopic stream of misrepresentations and the misappropriation of millions of dollars in client funds.the best way to capture the essence of what transpired is to follow the trail blazed by the indictment,returned on september,which charged the defendant with eighteen counts of mail fraud and two counts of wire fraud.see.
from until,the defendant ran entrust capital management entrust,which he held out as the manager of a hedge fund.entrust and the defendant maintained offices in worcester,massachusetts,but the defendant business partner,rajeev johar,worked out of a satellite office in louisiana.
the indictment identified fifteen defrauded clients,five of whom testified at trial.their testimony confirmed the defendant successful efforts to inveigle them into investing in the hedge fund.these efforts involved the dissemination of hyperbolic marketing literature,daily,and presentations,all of which were designed to create a false impression that entrust managed approximately in assets for more than investors.these claims were wildly exaggerated,and the defendant persistent boast that entrust hedge fund offered high rewards at low risk was unfounded.
many potential investors took the bait.to illustrate the five testifying investors,in the aggregate,entrusted the defendant with roughly to be invested and managed as part of the hedge fund.one of the five,david massad,earmarked some additional specified stock purchases.the defendant use of these funds failed to comport either with his own representations or with investors instructions.
this is how the scheme played out.when the defendant received money earmarked for the hedge fund,he would deposit it into an entrust account at commerce account over which he had exclusive control.some money from that account was transferred to a brokerage account at kimball cross investment management k c.the defendant retained sole transactional authority over this account and funneled money from it into the hedge fund.the money left in the commerce bank account remained at the defendant disposal,and he used much of it for personal purposes.
entrust investors were hoodwinked.they received periodic statements sometimes monthly,sometimes quarterly purporting to describe the status of their investments and the hedge fund performance.the statements reported,without exception,that the clients money had been invested in the hedge fund and that the investments had appreciated.
the statements,taken in the ensemble,show the magnitude of the fraud.viewed collectively,they represented that had been invested in the hedge fund and that the value of the investment had grown to approximately by the end of.this figure overstated the actual value of the investment by more than that is,the investment had depreciated by over ninety percent.the discrepancy between entrust apocryphal and authentic balance sheets was accounted for by an array of factors the hedge fund had incurred and the defendant had hidden investment losses in excess of the defendant had invented in nonexistent appreciation and he had diverted more than in client funds for his own pursuits 
the defendant dealings with david massad were more complicated.beginning in,massad the principal owner of commerce bank gave the defendant checks totaling more than for investment in the hedge fund.in the summer of,he gave the defendant the further sum of with instructions to purchase shares of gmac preferred stock and shares of ford motor credit preferred stock.
the monies that massad committed to the hedge fund suffered much the same fate as the monies committed by other investors.as to the stock purchases,the defendant assured massad that he had followed his massad instructions.in fact,he purchased fewer than half of the specified number of shares and pocketed the difference.for well over a year,he nonetheless sent massad accountant regular checks purporting to represent quarterly dividends on the shares that massad thought he had acquired those checks were meant to disguise the defendant failure to purchase the specified number of shares for massad account.
from time to time,massad sought to withdraw sums from his entrust account.the defendant obliged.but in early,massad asked to withdraw.the defendant never honored this request.
at about that time,the defendant learned that the securities and exchange commission sec was investigating him.in response,he contacted his investors and set up a meeting with them.at this meeting,which was held in april of,the defendant urged the investors to destroy the false statements showing gains in their hedge fund accounts and replace them with statements showing losses.he explained,falsely,that the proposal was designed to help them avoid tax liability on their gains,which he disingenuously maintained were still increasing.this artifice drew no takers and,therefore,no investors destroyed their original statements in response to it.
in the end,massad and the other investors sustained substantial losses as a result of the defendant chicanery.the sec investigation continued,leading to both criminal and civil proceedings against the defendant.
b.the aftermath.
this brings us to the defendant criminal trial,which began on may.the government introduced evidence establishing the facts recounted above.in the course of its case in chief,it produced copious evidence corroborating the defendant role in the fraudulent scheme including his use of the mails and wire transmissions.
the defendant premised his defense on two theories.first,he argued that he himself was an innocent dupe whose business partner,johar,had supplied him with misinformation.second,he argued that he was somehow a pawn in a broad but scheme orchestrated by massad.the evidence at trial belied both theories.it showed,for example,that the defendant received monthly statements from k c enumerating the funds actually contained in entrust brokerage account.moreover,the defendant had,on occasion,personally directed the avails of specific profitable trades both in the hedge fund and in entrust account to his personal accounts.there was no probative evidence of any overarching plot masterminded by massad.
we come now to the denouement.on the seventh day of trial may,the government rested.immediately prior to resting,it handed over a previously undisclosed memorandum emanating from the sec investigation the sec memorandum this document had not come to the prosecutor attention until that day.the document contained conclusions drawn from interviews with several of the testifying investors.
with regard to massad,the sec memorandum limned three pieces of information that the defendant characterizes as significant.first,massad had retained counsel in connection with his financial affairs.second,massad had made inconsistent statements concerning the amount of money in his entrust account.third,john sten,an attorney in the law firm of greenberg traurig,had represented both massad and the defendant for some period of time and,during this period,had delivered bogus bank statements to the sec,ostensibly via a commerce bank facsimile machine.
at the end of that day,the defendant moved to dismiss the indictment,arguing that the failure to disclose the sec memorandum earlier in the proceedings denied him a fair trial.the government objected and,in an effort to show that the information contained in the sec memorandum had previously been turned over,submitted copies of various documents,including sec interviews of massad and other investors,that had been given to the defendant counsel in.
on may,the district court offered to halt the trial and give the defendant time to sort out the new information,assuring him that he would not be required to proceed until that feat was accomplished.the defendant declined the court invitation.
on may,the court postponed the trial for another day.it renewed its invitation for a continuance and again offered to allow the defendant to recall any of the government witnesses for further.the defendant refused the offers,and the court then heard arguments on the motion to dismiss.
on the next day the court,ruling ore tenus,denied the motion.it emphasized the defendant decision neither to recall any witnesses nor to avail himself of a continuance in order to analyze and follow up on the belatedly disclosed information.it observed that the defendant had pointed to nothing in the new material that would have enabled him to impeach any witness,nor had he identified any other aspect of the material that would have been helpful to his case in any meaningful sense.following the lawyers summations and the court charge,the jury found the defendant guilty on all counts.
we to april.on that date,the defendant moved for a new trial.see.as part of its opposition,the government disclosed additional materials the greenberg traurig documents elaborating upon the information contained in the sec memorandum.the prosecution represented that it had obtained the greenberg traurig documents from attorney john sten after the defendant claimed to have been ignorant of sten dual representation of both massad and himself.the greenberg traurig documents included account statements,on entrust letterheads and bearing entrust louisiana address,which purported to show losses in massad investment account for,and.they also included a facsimile cover sheet purportedly indicating that the documents had been transmitted from a number at commerce bank,as well as a transmittal letter from sten to the sec.
four days later,the district court held a hearing.it denied the defendant new trial motion,concluding that much of the information contained in the sec memorandum,as explicated by the greenberg traurig documents,was either irrelevant or immaterial.although a small fraction of the information might have been used for impeachment purposes,it was of questionable value and incapable of affecting the outcome of the trial.
the court then turned to sentencing.the defendant did not object to proceeding on that day,nor did he request a continuance.after further arguments and allocution,the court imposed a incarcerative term on each count of conviction,to run concurrently.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the defendant contends that the district court erred both in denying his motion for a new trial and in sentencing him too hastily.these plaints rest on the notion that the government failed to satisfy its brady obligations and thereby prejudiced the defendant.given the related nature of these plaints,we address them together.
to gain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence,a defendant normally must pass a test he must show that i the evidence in question was unknown or unavailable to him at the time of trial ii his failure to learn of it did not result from a lack of due diligence on his part iii the evidence is material and iv the evidence,if available upon retrial,would likely bring about an acquittal.united states huddleston,cir united states wright,cir.when,however,a criminal defendant new trial motion is premised on the belated disclosure of evidence that should have been made available to him in accordance with the imperatives of brady,a somewhat less formidable standard applies.
to obtain the benefit of this more paradigm,a defendant must make three showings.the evidence at issue whether exculpatory or impeaching must be favorable to the accused that evidence must have been either willfully or inadvertently suppressed by the government and prejudice must have ensued.united states connolly,cir citing strickler greene.the first two showings are comparable to the first two requirements of the wright test.
the difference between the two standards lies in the replacement of the last two requirements of the wright test with the unitary requirement that the defendant establish a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at quoting united states bagley.in this context,the supreme court has equated reasonable probability with something sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.kyles whitley,internal quotation omitted.
we have noted two other refinements that distinguish the brady new trial standard from the ordinary wright standard.see connolly,at.first,the probability that a defendant must show does not have to be an actual probability that the result would have differed it may be a merely theoretical but still reasonable probability.id.emphasis in original.second,undisclosed impeachment evidence,if it suffices to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial,may carry the day.id.citing bagley,at.
we do not apply these standards directly.in the first instance,that is the responsibility of the trial court.the trial judge,having seen and heard the witnesses at first hand,has a special sense of the ebb and flow of the recently concluded trial.united states natanel,cir.thus,his views about the likely impact of newly disclosed evidence deserve considerable deference.connolly,at united states,cir.for those reasons,we review the challenged rulings in this case for abuse of discretion see,connolly,at united states alicea,cir.it is within the confines of this template that we consider whether the late disclosure of either the sec memorandum or the greenberg traurig documents warrants relief.
we start with the arguendo assumption that these materials,which comprised part of the parallel sec investigation,were constructively in the prosecution possession.see strickler,at extending the disclosure obligation to materials in the possession of government agents.we also assume,again for argument sake,that the substance of the materials was not made available to the defendant before trial.these assumptions permit us to narrow the lens of our inquiry to focus on whether the evidence was favorable to the defendant and,if so,whether its dilatory disclosure prejudiced him.
the defendant asserts that the belatedly disclosed materials would have supported his theory that massad was not a victim but,rather,was engaged in funny business of his own.in his view,the sec memorandum shows that massad retained control of his own finances and told inconsistent stories about his dealings with entrust.moreover,the greenberg traurig documents can be read to indicate that massad forwarded bogus statements to the sec through sten.the defendant protests that the timely availability of these materials would have enabled him to impeach massad.he further insists that the materials have a potentially exculpatory value because they suggest that i massad was using sten as part of a plot to manipulate the defendant and to obscure his own malefactions and ii massad and others should be investigated further for potential fraudulent activity.
the defendant claim that he could have used the belatedly disclosed materials for impeachment purposes is wishful thinking.the impact of withholding evidence is more severe when it is highly impeaching or when the impeached testimony is essential to the defendant conviction.united states,cir.here,however,these conditions do not obtain.the defendant attempt to shift the blame to massad verges on the chimerical.the impeachment value of the evidence is marginal necessarily so,given the vagueness of the defendant allegations,and that value could effectively have been realized by recalling massad for further.
what is more,the modest impeachment potential of this evidence is diminished by the extensive corroboration of massad direct testimony.like other testifying investors,massad was able to describe in exquisite detail the losses that he incurred as a result of the defendant misrepresentations and misappropriations.to buttress this testimony,the government introduced abundant documentary evidence supporting a conclusion that massad had been victimized.this evidence included pho
