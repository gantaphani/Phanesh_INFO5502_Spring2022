respondent fields,a michigan state prisoner,was escorted from his prison cell by a corrections officer to a conference room where he was questioned by two sheriff deputies about criminal activity he had allegedly engaged in before coming to prison.at no time was fields given miranda warnings or advised that he did not have to speak with the deputies.as relevant here fields was questioned for between five and seven hours fields was told more than once that he was free to leave and return to his cell the deputies were armed,but fields remained free of restraints the conference room door was sometimes open and sometimes shut several times during the interview fields stated that he no longer wanted to talk to the deputies,but he did not ask to go back to his cell after fields confessed and the interview concluded,he had to wait an additional minutes for an escort and returned to his cell well after the hour when he generally retired.
the trial court denied fields motion to suppress his confession under miranda arizona,and he was convicted.the michigan court of appeals affirmed,rejecting fields contention that his statements should have been suppressed because he was subjected to custodial interrogation without a miranda warning.the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan subsequently granted fields habeas relief under d.affirming,the sixth circuit held that the interview was a custodial interrogation within the meaning of miranda,reasoning that mathis united states,clearly established,d,that isolation from the general prison population,combined with questioning about conduct occurring outside the prison,makes any such interrogation custodial per se.
this court precedents do not clearly establish the categorical rule on which the sixth circuit relied.the court has repeatedly declined to adopt any such rule.see,illinois perkins.the sixth circuit misread mathis,which simply held,as relevant here,that a prisoner who otherwise meets the requirements for miranda custody is not taken outside the scope of miranda because he was incarcerated for an unconnected offense.it did not hold that imprisonment alone constitutes miranda custody.nor does the statement in maryland shatzer,that n o one questions that inmate shatzer was in custody for miranda purposes support a per se rule.it means only that the issue of custody was not contested in that case.finally,contrary to respondent suggestion,miranda itself did not hold that the inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation are always present when a prisoner is taken aside and questioned about events outside the prison walls.
the sixth circuit categorical rule that imprisonment,questioning in private,and questioning about events in the outside world create a custodial situation for miranda purposes is simply wrong.
a the initial step in determining whether a person is in miranda custody is to ascertain,given all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation,how a suspect would have gauged his freedom of movement.stansbury california.however,not all restraints on freedom of movement amount to miranda custody.see,berkemer mccarty.shatzer,distinguishing between restraints on freedom of movement and miranda custody,held that a break in miranda custody between a suspect invocation of the right to counsel and the initiation of subsequent questioning may occur while a suspect is serving an uninterrupted term of imprisonment.if a break in custody can occur,it must follow that imprisonment alone is not enough to create a custodial situation within the meaning of miranda.at least three strong grounds support this conclusion questioning a person who is already in prison does not generally involve the shock that very often accompanies arrest a prisoner is unlikely to be lured into speaking by a longing for prompt release and a prisoner knows that his questioners probably lack authority to affect the duration of his sentence.thus,service of a prison term,without more,is not enough to constitute miranda custody.
b the other two elements in the sixth circuit rule are likewise insufficient.taking a prisoner aside for questioning may necessitate some additional limitations on the prisoner freedom of movement,but it does not necessarily convert a noncustodial situation into miranda custody.isolation may contribute to a coercive atmosphere when a nonprisoner is questioned,but questioning a prisoner in private does not generally remove him from a supportive atmosphere and may be in his best interest.neither does questioning a prisoner about criminal activity outside the prison have a significantly greater potential for coercion than questioning under otherwise identical circumstances about criminal activity within the prison walls.the coercive pressure that miranda guards against is neither mitigated nor magnified by the location of the conduct about which questions are asked.
when a prisoner is questioned,the determination of custody should focus on all of the features of the interrogation.the record in this case reveals that respondent was not taken into custody for miranda purposes.while some of the facts lend support to his argument that miranda custody requirement was met,they are offset by others.most important,he was told at the outset of the interrogation,and reminded thereafter,that he was free to leave and could go back to his cell whenever he wanted.moreover,he was not physically restrained or threatened,was interviewed in a,conference room where the door was sometimes left open,and was offered food and water.these facts are consistent with an environment in which a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate the interview and leave,subject to the ordinary restraints of life behind bars.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit held that our precedents clearly establish that a prisoner is in custody within the meaning of miranda arizona,if the prisoner is taken aside and questioned about events that occurred outside the prison walls.our decisions,however,do not clearly establish such a rule,and therefore the court of appeals erred in holding that this rule provides a permissible basis for federal habeas relief under the relevant provision of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d.indeed,the rule applied by the court below does not represent a correct interpretation of our miranda case law.we therefore reverse.
while serving a sentence in a michigan jail,randall fields was escorted by a corrections officer to a conference room where two sheriff deputies questioned him about allegations that,before he came to prison,he had engaged in sexual conduct with a boy.in order to get to the conference room,fields had to go down one floor and pass through a locked door that separated two sections of the facility.see app.to pet.for cert.fields arrived at the conference room between and and was questioned for between five and seven hours 
at the beginning of the interview,fields was told that he was free to leave and return to his cell.see,at.later,he was again told that he could leave whenever he wanted.see,at.the two interviewing deputies were armed during the interview,but fields remained free of handcuffs and other restraints.the door to the conference room was sometimes open and sometimes shut.see,at.
about halfway through the interview,after fields had been confronted with the allegations of abuse,he became agitated and began to yell.see,at.fields testified that one of the deputies,using an expletive,told him to sit down and said that if he did want to cooperate,he could leave.at see also,at.fields eventually confessed to engaging in sex acts with the boy.according to fields testimony at a suppression hearing,he said several times during the interview that he no longer wanted to talk to the deputies,but he did not ask to go back to his cell prior to the end of the interview.see,at.
when he was eventually ready to leave,he had to wait an additional minutes or so because a corrections officer had to be summoned to escort him back to his cell,and he did not return to his cell until well after the hour when he generally retired at no time was fields given miranda warnings or advised that he did not have to speak with the deputies.
the state of michigan charged fields with criminal sexual conduct.relying on miranda,fields moved to suppress his confession,but the trial court denied his motion.over the renewed objection of defense counsel,one of the interviewing deputies testified at trial about fields admissions.the jury convicted fields of two counts of criminal sexual conduct,and the judge sentenced him to a term of to years of imprisonment.on direct appeal,the michigan court of appeals affirmed,rejecting fields contention that his statements should have been suppressed because he was subjected to custodial interrogation without a miranda warning.the court ruled that fields had not been in custody for purposes of miranda during the interview,so no miranda warnings were required.the court emphasized that fields was told that he was free to leave and return to his cell but that he never asked to do so.the michigan supreme court denied discretionary review.
fields then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,and the court granted relief.the sixth circuit affirmed,holding that the interview in the conference room was a custodial interrogation within the meaning of miranda because isolation from the general prison population combined with questioning about conduct occurring outside the prison makes any such interrogation custodial per se.the court of appeals reasoned that this court clearly established in mathis united states,that miranda warnings must be administered when law enforcement officers remove an inmate from the general prison population and interrogate him regarding criminal conduct that took place outside the jail or prison.see also,at the central holding of mathis is that a miranda warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population and interrogated,questioned in a manner likely to lead to,about conduct occurring outside of the prison because fields was isolated from the general prison population and interrogated about conduct occurring in the outside world,the court of appeals found that the state court decision was contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by this court in mathis,at.
we granted certiorari.
under aedpa,a federal court may grant a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus if the adjudication pursuant to which the prisoner is held resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.in this context,clearly established law signifies the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of this court decisions.williams taylor.
in this case,it is abundantly clear that our precedents do not clearly establish the categorical rule on which the court of appeals relied,that the questioning of a prisoner is always custodial when the prisoner is removed from the general prison population and questioned about events that occurred outside the prison.on the contrary,we have repeatedly declined to adopt any categorical rule with respect to whether the questioning of a prison inmate is custodial.
in illinois perkins,where we upheld the admission of statements elicited from an inmate by an undercover officer masquerading as another inmate,we noted that t he bare fact of custody may not in every instance require a warning even when the suspect is aware that he is speaking to an official,but we do not have occasion to explore that issue here.at emphasis added.instead,we simply reject ed the argument that miranda warnings are required whenever a suspect is in custody in a technical sense and converses with someone who happens to be a government agent.at.
most recently,in maryland shatzer,we expressly declined to adopt a rule for determining the applicability of miranda in prisons.shatzer considered whether a break in custody ends the presumption of involuntariness established in edwards arizona,and,if so,whether a prisoner return to the general prison population after a custodial interrogation constitutes a break in miranda custody.see,at slip,at.in considering the latter question,we noted first that w e have never decided whether incarceration constitutes custody for miranda purposes,and have indeed explicitly declined to address the issue.at slip,at citing perkins,supra,at emphasis added.the answer to this question,we noted,would depen d upon whether incarceration exerts the coercive pressure that miranda was designed to guard against the danger of coercion that results from the interaction of custody and official interrogation.at slip,at quoting perkins,supra,at.
in concluding that our precedents establish a categorical rule,the court of appeals placed great weight on the decision in mathis,but the court of appeals misread the holding in that case.in mathis,an inmate in a state prison was questioned by an internal revenue agent and was subsequently convicted for federal offenses.the court of appeals held that miranda did not apply to this interview for two reasons a criminal investigation had not been commenced at the time of the interview,and the prisoner was incarcerated for an unconnected offense.mathis united states.this court rejected both of those grounds for distinguishing miranda,at,and thus the holding in mathis is simply that a prisoner who otherwise meets the requirements for miranda custody is not taken outside the scope of miranda by either of the two factors on which the court of appeals had relied.mathis did not hold that imprisonment,in and of itself,is enough to constitute miranda custody nor,contrary to respondent submission,see brief for respondent,did oregon mathiason,per curiam,which simply restated in dictum the holding in mathis.
the court of appeals purported to find support for its per se rule in shatzer,relying on our statement that n o one questions that shatzer was in custody for miranda purposes when he was interviewed,at slip,at.but this statement means only that the issue of custody was not contested before us.it strains credulity to read the statement as constituting an unambiguous conclusion or finding by this court that shatzer was in custody,at.
finally,contrary to respondent suggestion,see brief for respondent,miranda itself did not clearly establish the rule applied by the court of appeals.miranda adopted a set of prophylactic measures designed to ward off the inherently compelling pressures of custodial interrogation,shatzer,supra,at slip,at quoting miranda,at,but miranda did not hold that such pressures are always present when a prisoner is taken aside and questioned about events outside the prison walls.indeed,miranda did not even establish that police questioning of a suspect at the station house is always custodial.see mathiason,supra,at declining to find that miranda warnings are required simply because the questioning takes place in the station house,or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect 
in sum,our decisions do not clearly establish that a prisoner is always in custody for purposes of miranda whenever a prisoner is isolated from the general prison population and questioned about conduct outside the prison 
not only does the categorical rule applied below go well beyond anything that is clearly established in our prior decisions,it is simply wrong.the three elements of that rule imprisonment,questioning in private,and questioning about events in the outside world are not necessarily enough to create a custodial situation for miranda purposes.
as used in our miranda case law,custody is a term of art that specifies circumstances that are thought generally to present a serious danger of coercion.in determining whether a person is in custody in this sense,the initial step is to ascertain whether,in light of the objective circumstances of the interrogation,stansbury califor nia,per curiam,a reasonable person would have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.thompson keohane.and in order to determine how a suspect would have gauge d his freedom of movement,courts must examine all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.stansbury,supra,at,internal quotation marks omitted.relevant factors include the location of the questioning,see shatzer,supra,at slip,at,its duration,see berkemer mccarty,statements made during the interview,see mathiason,supra,at yarborough alvarado,stansbury,supra,at,the presence or absence of physical restraints during the questioning,see new york quarles,and the release of the interviewee at the end of the questioning,see california beheler,per curiam.
determining whether an individual freedom of movement was curtailed,however,is simply the first step in the analysis,not the last.not all restraints on freedom of movement amount to custody for purposes of miranda.we have decline d to accord talismanic power to the inquiry,berkemer,supra,at,and have instead asked the additional question whether the relevant environment presents the same inherently coercive pressures as the type of station house questioning at issue in miranda.our cases make clear that the test identifies only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for miranda custody.shatzer,at slip,at.
this important point is illustrated by our decision in berkemer mccarty,supra.in that case,we held that the roadside questioning of a motorist who was pulled over in a routine traffic stop did not constitute custodial interrogation,at.we acknowledged that a traffic stop significantly curtails the freedom of action of the driver and the passengers,and that it is generally a crime either to ignore a policeman signal to stop one car or,once having stopped,to drive away without permission.at.f ew motorists,we noted,would feel free either to disobey a directive to pull over or to leave the scene of a traffic stop without being told they might do so.ibid.nevertheless,we held that a person detained as a result of a traffic stop is not in miranda custody because such detention does not sufficiently impair the detained person free exercise of his privilege against to require that he be warned of his constitutional rights.at.as we later put it,the temporary and relatively nonthreatening detention involved in a traffic stop or terry stop does not constitute miranda custody,shatzer,supra,at slip,at citation omitted.see terry ohio.
it may be thought that the situation in berkemer the questioning of a motorist subjected to a brief traffic stop is worlds away from those present when an inmate is questioned in a prison,but the same can not be said of shatzer,where we again distinguished between restraints on freedom of movement and miranda custody.shatzer,as noted,concerned the edwards prophylactic rule,which limits the ability of the police to initiate further questioning of a suspect in miranda custody once the suspect invokes the right to counsel.we held in shatzer that this rule does not apply when there is a sufficient break in custody between the suspect invocation of the right to counsel and the initiation of subsequent questioning.see,at slip,at.and,what is significant for present purposes,we further held that a break in custody may occur while a suspect is serving a term in prison.if a break in custody can occur while a prisoner is serving an uninterrupted term of imprisonment,it must follow that imprisonment alone is not enough to create a custodial situation within the meaning of miranda.
there are at least three strong grounds for this conclusion.first,questioning a person who is already serving a prison term does not generally involve the shock that very often accompanies arrest.in the paradigmatic miranda situation a person is arrested in his home or on the street and whisked to a police station for questioning detention represents a sharp and ominous change,and the shock may give rise to coercive pressures.a person who is cut off from his normal life and companions,shatzer,supra,at slip,at,and abruptly transported from the street into a atmosphere,miranda,at,may feel coerced into answering questions.
by contrast,when a person who is already serving a term of imprisonment is questioned,there is usually no such change.interrogated suspects who have previously been convicted of crime live in prison.shatzer,at slip,at.for a person serving a term of incarceration,we reasoned in shatzer,the ordinary restrictions of prison life,while no doubt unpleasant,are expected and familiar and thus do not involve the same inherently compelling pressures that are often present when a suspect is yanked from familiar surroundings in the outside world and subjected to interrogation in a police station,at slip,at.
second,a prisoner,unlike a person who has not been sentenced to a term of incarceration,is unlikely to be lured into speaking by a longing for prompt release.when a person is arrested and taken to a station house for interrogation,the person who is questioned may be pressured to speak by the hope that,after doing so,he will be allowed to leave and go home.on the other hand,when a prisoner is questioned,he knows that when the questioning ceases,he will remain under confinement,at,slip,at.
third,a prisoner,unlike a person who has not been convicted and sentenced,knows that the law enforcement officers who question him probably lack the authority to affect the duration of his sentence,at slip,at.and where the possibility of parole exists,the interrogating officers probably also lack the power to bring about an early release.ibid.when the suspect has no reason to think that the listeners have official power over him,it should not be assumed that his words are motivated by the reaction he expects from his listeners.perkins,at.under such circumstances,there is little basis for the assumption that a suspect will feel compelled to speak by the fear of reprisal for remaining silent or in the hope of a more lenient treatment should he confess.at.
in short,standard conditions of confinement and associated restrictions on freedom will not necessarily implicate the same interests that the court sought to protect when it afforded special safeguards to persons subjected to custodial interrogation.thus,service of a term of imprisonment,without more,is not enough to constitute miranda custody.
the two other elements included in the court of appeals rule questioning in private and questioning about events that took place outside the prison are likewise insufficient.
taking a prisoner aside for questioning as opposed to questioning the prisoner in the presence of fellow inmates does not necessarily convert a noncustodial situation to one in which miranda applies.mathiason,at.when a person who is not serving a prison term is questioned,isolation may contribute to a coercive atmosphere by preventing family members,friends,and others who may be sympathetic from providing either advice or emotional support.and without any such assistance,the person who is questioned may feel overwhelming pressure to speak and to refrain from asking that the interview be terminated.
by contrast,questioning a prisoner in private does not generally remove the prisoner from a supportive atmosphere.fellow inmates are by no means necessarily friends.on the contrary,they may be hostile and,for a variety of reasons,may react negatively to what the questioning reveals.in the present case,for example,would respondent have felt more at ease if he had been questioned in the presence of other inmates about the sex
