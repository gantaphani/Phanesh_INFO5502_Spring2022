josé,who pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances,alleges that the district court erred in calculating drug quantity and,therefore,imposed an overly harsh sentence.discerning no error,we affirm the judgment below.
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the colloquy,the presentence investigation report psi report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states santos,cir united states dietz,cir.
a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico indicted a number of suspected participants in a notorious drug ring known as las avispas.these individuals,including the appellant,were charged with conspiring to distribute controlled substances.see a.
the appellant initially maintained his innocence.along with several codefendants,he went to trial on february.after five days,however,he opted out of the trial and entered a straight guilty plea,unaccompanied by any plea agreement.meanwhile,the trial continued as to six of his codefendants,all of whom were eventually found guilty.
during his hearing,the prosecutor maintained that the appellant had sold drugs for las avispas during a span from to.the appellant accepted this account.in addition,he admitted to possessing capsules of crack cocaine,which contained,in the aggregate,grams of cocaine base.
in accordance with the customary routine,the district court directed the probation department to prepare the psi report.that report,when completed,was delivered to the prosecutor,the appellant through his counsel,and the court.we summarize certain pertinent entries.
according to the psi report,las avispas purveyed an assortment of drugs,including crack cocaine cocaine base,heroin,and marijuana.the report referenced trial testimony from a cooperating witness,josé,who confirmed that las avispas ran two drug points,each of which operated hours a day,seven days a week,weeks a year with the exception of holy friday.
each drug point was manned by three shifts of sellers morning shift,an afternoon shift,and a night shift.on average,each shift participant would sell approximately capsules of crack cocaine,together with other kinds of drugs,during each morning and afternoon shift.the night shifts were busier each vendor would sell,on average,between and capsules of crack,along with other drugs.
the psi report summarized the trial testimony of a forensic scientist.this portion of the report related that a typical crack cocaine capsule sold by las avispas contained,on average,grams of cocaine base.conservatively assuming average sales of capsules per day,the drug ring had annual sales of kilograms of cocaine base.thus,during its four years of operations,the drug ring sold an estimated total of kilograms of cocaine base.
the psi report further noted that,at trial,the scientist had been about the methodology used to determine the amount of cocaine base.the scientist responded that sampling was the method he had used,and that the samples used were capsules actually seized from the las avispas drug points.in the scientist opinion,this sampling permitted a reasoned determination of an average drug weight per capsule.
the psi report indicated,too,that a confidential informant ci had identified the appellant as a seller of drugs for las avispas.the ci stated that the appellant was usually at one of the drug points,dealing drugs with two other members of the ring whom he named.both of these men had been indicted alongside the appellant.
the psi report contained more information from the ci about the appellant.for example,the ci identified the appellant as having stored both guns and drugs for las avispas.moreover,the ci said that,on one occasion,the appellant had warned him the ci that the police were en route to one of the drug points.
the psi report went into some detail anent possible sentencing options.among other things,the probation department recommended a series of sentencing calculations premised on the november edition of the guidelines which controls here.it suggested a base offense level of,premised on a drug quantity of more than kilograms of cocaine base.see ussg a,c.it arrived at a total offense level of after applying various enhancing and mitigating adjustments,none of which is controverted here.placing the appellant in criminal history category i,the probation department envisioned a guideline sentencing range gsr of months.see id.ch,pt.a sentencing table.
the appellant interposed a timely objection to the proposed drug quantity determination and,by fair implication,to the calculations employed therein.he argued that the psi report rested this determination on unreliable computations and,thus,exaggerated his role in the conspiracy 
the district court convened the disposition hearing on may.the appellant renewed his objection to the proposed drug quantity.the government endorsed it.the court concluded that the estimates for both the number of capsules sold and the drug weight were accurate.nevertheless,the court decided to use a set of related assumptions even more favorable to the appellant it assumed that the appellant worked only daytime shifts that he worked only three shifts a week and that he sold an average of capsules per shift.
based on these assumptions,the court attributed kilograms of cocaine base per year to the appellant.taking into account the life of the conspiracy,the court attributed a total drug quantity of kilograms of crack to the appellant all of these findings were grounded in the recitals contained in the psi report.
with the drug quantity contretemps resolved,the court proceeded to sentence the appellant to a incarcerative term the low end of the gsr.this timely appeal followed.
the appellant advances two principal claims of error first,he argues that the sentencing court failed to make an individualized finding of drug quantity.second,he argues that,in all events,the drug quantity determination was not supported by competent evidence.we deal with these claims sequentially.
we begin with the nature of the sentencing court drug quantity determination.the appellant argues that the court made a determination rather than an individualized determination.because the question of whether the district court drug quantity determination was based on an individualized determination or not presents a question of law,our review is de novo.see united states,cir.if,however,the district court has engaged in an individualized determination,our review is for clear error.
sentences in drug cases are largely driven by the amount and type of drugs involved.united states sepulveda,cir.when sentencing a participant in a conspiracy,the district court must make an individualized finding concerning the quantity of drugs attributable to,or reasonably foreseeable by,the offender,at.in this case the sentencing to the appellant that rule and complied with it.although the court mentioned the drug figure was certainly relevant as a check on the integers used in determining the amount of drugs attributable to the clearly made an individualized determination.specifically,the court attributed kilograms of cocaine base to the appellant personally.this individualized determination,in turn,guided the court in fixing the appellant base offense level.see ussg a,c.given the state of the record,the appellant first claim of error fizzles.
this brings us to the appellant claim that the sentencing court drug quantity determination was insupportable.the appellant advances three rationales in service of this claim.
first,the appellant suggests that the court erred by sentencing him on the basis of a drug quantity beyond that which he acknowledged at the hearing.this suggestion does not accurately reflect the law.
under the guidelines,a defendant may be held responsible at sentencing for relevant conduct,including all acts and omissions committed by the defendant.ussg a a see united states,cir.relevant conduct for which the defendant may be sentenced also includes,in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.ussg a b.t
