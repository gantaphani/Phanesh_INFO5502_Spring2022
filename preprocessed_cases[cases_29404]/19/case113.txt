petitioner southern union company was convicted by a jury in federal court on one count of violating the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra for having knowingly stored liquid mercury without a permit at a subsidiary facility on or about september,to october.violations of the rcra are punishable by,inter alia,a fine of not more than for each day of violation.d.at sentencing,the probation office calculated a maximum fine of million,on the basis that southern union violated the rcra for each of the days from september,through october.southern union argued that imposing any fine greater than the penalty of would be unconstitutional under apprendi new jersey,which holds that the sixth amendment guarantee requires that any fact other than the fact of a prior conviction that increases the maximum punishment authorized for a particular crime be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.southern union contended that,based on the jury verdict and the district court instructions,the only violation the jury necessarily found was for one day.the district court held that apprendi applies to criminal fines,but concluded from the content and context of the verdict all together that the jury found a violation.the court therefore set a maximum potential fine of million,from which it imposed a fine of million and a community service obligation of million.on appeal,the first circuit disagreed with the district court that the jury necessarily found a violation of days.but the first circuit affirmed the sentence because it held that apprendi does not apply to criminal fines.
held the rule of apprendi applies to the imposition of criminal fines.
a apprendi rule is rooted in longstanding practice,cunningham california,and preserves the historic jury function of determining whether the prosecution has proved each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt,oregon ice.this court has repeatedly affirmed apprendi rule by applying it to a variety of sentencing schemes that allow judges to find facts that increase a defendant maximum authorized sentence.see cunningham,at united states booker,blakely washington,ring arizona,at.while the punishments at stake in these cases were imprisonment or a death sentence,there is no principled basis under apprendi to treat criminal fines differently.apprendi core concern to reserve to the jury the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense,ice,at applies whether the sentence is a criminal fine or imprisonment or death.criminal fines,like these other forms of punishment,are penalties inflicted by the sovereign for the commission of offenses.fines were by far the most common form of noncapital punishment in colonial america and they continue to be frequently imposed today.and,the amount of a fine,like the maximum term of imprisonment or eligibility for the death penalty,is often determined by reference to particular facts.the government argues that fines are less onerous than incarceration and the death sentence and therefore should be exempt from apprendi.but where a fine is substantial enough to trigger the sixth amendment guarantee,apprendi applies in full.
b the historical role of the jury at common law,which informs the scope of the constitutional jury right,ice,at,supports applying apprendi to criminal fines.to be sure,judges in the colonies and during the founding era had much discretion in determining whether to impose a fine and in what amount.but the exercise of such discretion is fully consistent with apprendi,which permits courts to impose judgment within the range prescribed by statute.at emphasis in original.the more salient question is what role the jury played in prosecutions for offenses that pegged the amount of a fine to the determination of specified facts.a review of both state and federal decisions discloses that the predominant practice was for such facts to be alleged in the indictment and proved to the jury.the rule that juries must determine facts that set a fine maximum amount is an application of the two longstanding tenets of criminal jurisprudence on which apprendi is based first,the truth of every accusation against a defendant should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours.blakely,at.and second,an accusation which lacks any particular fact which the law makes essential to the punishment is no accusation within the requirements of the common law,and is no accusation in reason.ibid.contrary to the government contentions,neither united states murphy,pet,nor united states tyler,cranch,overcomes the ample historical evidence that juries routinely found facts that set maximum criminal fines.
c the government remaining arguments,echoed by the dissent,are unpersuasive.the government claims that facts relevant to a fine amount typically quantify the harm caused by the defendant offense,and do not define a separate set of acts for punishment.the government contends that only the latter determination implicates apprendi concerns.but this argument rests on the rejected assumption that,in determining the maximum punishment for an offense,there is a constitutionally significant difference between a fact that is an element of the offense and one that is a sentencing factor.further,the facts the district court found in imposing a fine on southern union are not fairly characterized as merely quantifying the harm the company caused.
the government also argues that applying apprendi to criminal fines will prevent states and the federal government from enacting statutes that calibrate the amount of a fine to a defendant.but legislatures are free to enact such statutes,so long as the statutes are administered in conformance with the sixth amendment.
finally,the government contends that requiring juries to determine facts related to fines will cause confusion,prejudice defendants,or be impractical.these policy arguments rehearse those made by the dissents in our prior apprendi cases.they must be rejected because the rule the government espouses is unconstitutional.in addition,because apprendi is now more than a decade old,the reliance interests underlying the government arguments are by this point attenuated.

southern union company,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
the sixth amendment reserves to juries the determination of any fact,other than the fact of a prior conviction,that increases a criminal defendant maximum potential sentence.apprendi new jersey,blakely washington.we have applied this principle in numerous cases where the sentence was imprisonment or death.the question here is whether the same rule applies to sentences of criminal fines.we hold that it does.
petitioner southern union company is a natural gas distributor.its subsidiary stored liquid mercury,a hazardous substance,at a facility in pawtucket,rhode.in september,youths from a nearby apartment complex broke into the facility,played with the,and spread it around the facility and complex.the complex residents were temporarily displaced during the cleanup and most underwent testing for mercury poisoning.
in,a grand jury indicted southern union on multiple counts of violating federal environmental statutes.as relevant here,the first count alleged that the company knowingly stored liquid mercury without a permit at the pawtucket facility f rom on or about september,until on or about october,app,in violation of the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra.see stat,as amended,d a.a jury convicted southern union on this count following a trial in the district court for the district of rhode island.the verdict form stated that southern union was guilty of unlawfully storing liquid mercury on or about september,to october.app.
violations of the rcra are punishable by,inter alia,a fine of not more than for each day of violation.d.at sentencing,the probation office set a maximum fine of million,on the basis that southern union violated the rcra for each of the days from september,through october.southern union objected that this calculation violated apprendi because the jury was not asked to determine the precise duration of the violation.the company noted that the form listed only the violation approximate start date,on or about and argued that the court instructions permitted conviction if the jury found even a violation.therefore,southern union maintained,the only violation the jury necessarily found was for one day,and imposing any fine greater than the penalty of would require factfinding by the court,in contravention of apprendi.
the government acknowledged the jury was not asked to specify the duration of the violation,but argued that apprendi does not apply to criminal fines.the district court disagreed and held that apprendi applies.but the court concluded from the content and context of the verdict all together that the jury found a violation.app.to pet.for cert.the court therefore set a maximum potential fine of million,from which it imposed a fine of million and a community service obligatio n of million.app.
on appeal,the united states court of appeals for the first circuit rejected the district court conclusion that the jury necessarily found a violation of days.but the court of appeals affirmed the sentence because it also held,again in contrast to the district court,that apprendi does not apply to criminal fines,at.other circuits have reached the opposite conclusion.see united states pfaff,per curiam united states lagrou distribution.we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict,and now reverse.
this case requires us to consider the scope of the sixth amendment right of jury trial,as construed in apprendi.under apprendi,o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.at.the statutory maximum for apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.blakely,at emphasis deleted.thus,while judges may exercise discretion in sentencing,they may not inflic t punishment that the jury verdict alone does not allow.at.
apprendi rule is rooted in longstanding practice.cunningham california.it preserves the historic jury function of determining whether the prosecution has proved each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.oregon ice.we have repeatedly affirmed this rule by applying it to a variety of sentencing schemes that allowed judges to find facts that increased a defendant maximum authorized sentence.see cunningham,at elevated upper term of united states booker,increased imprisonment range for defendant under federal sentencing guidelines blakely,at increased above statutorily prescribed standard range ring arizona,death penalty authorized upon finding existence of aggravating factors apprendi,at extended term of imprisonment based on violation of a hate crime statute.
while the punishments at stake in those cases were imprisonment or a death sentence,we see no principled basis under apprendi for treating criminal fines.apprendi core concern is to reserve to the jury the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense.ice,at.that concern applies whether the sentence is a criminal fine or imprisonment or death.criminal fines,like these other forms of punishment,are penalties inflicted by the sovereign for the commission of offenses.fines were by far the most common form of noncapital punishment in colonial america they are frequently imposed today,especially upon organizational defendants who can not be imprisoned and the amount of a fine,like the maximum term of imprisonment or eligibility for the death penalty,is calculated by reference to particular facts.sometimes,as here,the fact is the duration of a statutory violation under other statutes it is the amount of the defendant gain or the victim loss,or some other factor in all such cases,requiring juries to find beyond a reasonable doubt facts that determine the fine maximum amount is necessary to implement apprendi animating principle the preservation of the jury historic role as a bulwark between the state and the accused at the trial for an alleged offense.ice,at.in stating apprendi rule,we have never distinguished one form of punishment from another.instead,our decisions broadly prohibit judicial factfinding that increases maximum criminal sentence s,penalties,or punishment s terms that each undeniably embrace fines,blakely,at apprendi,at ring,at.
the government objects,however,that fines are less onerous than incarceration and the death sentence.the government notes that apprendi itself referred to the physical deprivation of liberty that imprisonment occasions,see,at,and that we have placed more weight on imprisonment than on fines when construing the scope of the sixth amendment rights to counsel and jury trial.see blanton north las vegas,jury trial scott illinois,counsel.therefore,the government concludes,fines categorically do not implicate the primary concerns motivating apprendi.brief for united states.
this argument fails because its conclusion does not from its premise.where a fine is so insubstantial that the underlying offense is considered petty,the sixth amendment right of jury trial is not triggered,and no apprendi issue arises.see,muniz hoffman,fine imposed on labor union does not entitle union to jury trial see also blanton,at no jury trial right for petty offenses,as measured by the severity of the maximum authorized penalty internal quotation marks omitted.the same,of course,is true of offenses punishable by relatively brief terms of imprisonment these,too,do not entitle a defendant to a jury trial.see,at establishing a rebuttable presumption that offenses punishable by six months imprisonment or less are petty duncan louisiana.
but not all fines are insubstantial,and not all offenses punishable by fines are petty.see,mine workers bagwell,criminal contempt fine of million imposed on union unquestionably is a serious contempt sanction that triggers right of jury trial.the federal statute,in particular,see d,has been used to obtain substantial judgments against organizational defendants.see,amended judgment in united states lg display,nd cal,million fine for conviction of single count of violating sherman antitrust act judgment in united states siemens aktiengesellschaft,d dc,million fine for two violations of foreign corrupt practices act united states sentencing commission,annual report,ch,noting fine of billion imposed on pharmaceutical corporation for violations of food and drug laws.and,where the defendant is an individual,a large fine may engender a significant infringement of personal freedom.blanton,at quoting frank united states,see also a requiring court to consider the burden that the fine will impose upon the defendant in determining whether to impose a fine and in what amount.
the government thus asks the wrong question by comparing the severity of criminal fines to that of other punishments.so far as apprendi is concerned,the relevant question is the significance of the fine from the perspective of the sixth amendment jury trial guarantee.where a fine is substantial enough to trigger that right,apprendi applies in full.as we said in cunningham,asking whether a defendant basic right is preserved,though some facts essential to punishment are reserved for determination by the judge,is the very inquiry apprendi rule was designed to exclude.at.
this case is exemplary.the rcra subjects southern union to a maximum fine of for each day of violation.d.the government does not deny that,in light of the seriousness of that punishment,the company was properly accorded a jury trial.and the government now concedes the district court made factual findings that increased both the potential and actual fine the court imposed.brief for united states.this is exactly what apprendi guards against judicial factfinding that enlarges the maximum punishment a defendant faces beyond what the jury verdict or the defendant admissions allow.
in concluding that the rule of apprendi does not apply to criminal fines,the court of appeals relied on our decision in ice.ice addressed the question whether,when a defendant is convicted of multiple offenses,apprendi forbids judges to determine facts that authorize the imposition of consecutive sentences,at.in holding that apprendi does not,ice emphasized that juries historically played no role in deciding whether sentences should run consecutively or concurrently.see,at.the court of appeals reasoned that juries were similarly uninvolved in setting criminal fines,at 
the court of appeals was correct to examine the record,because the scope of the constitutional jury right must be informed by the historical role of the jury at common law.ice,at.see also,blakely,at apprendi,at.but in our view,the record supports applying apprendi to criminal fines.to be sure,judges in the and during the founding era possessed a great deal of discretion in determining whether to impose a fine and in what amount.lillquist see also preyer.often,a fine range was apparently without limit except insofar as it was within the expectation on the part of the court that it would be paid.ibid.for some other offenses,the maximum fine was capped by statute.see,at robbery,larceny,burglary,and other offenses punishable in massachusetts bay colony by fines of up to act of,ch,stat.any consul who gives a false certificate shall forfeit and pay a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars,at the discretion of the court stith cabranes,fear of judging sentencing guidelines in the federal courts describing federal practice.
the exercise of such sentencing discretion is fully consistent with apprendi,which permits courts to impose judgment within the range prescribed by statute.at emphasis in original.nor,a fortiori,could there be an apprendi violation where no maximum is prescribed.indeed,in surveying the historical record that formed the basis of our holding in apprendi,we considered the english practice with respect to fines,which,as was true of many colonial offenses,made sentencing largely dependent upon judicial discretion.see,at,see also jones united states,blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england hereinafter blackstone.and even then,as the dissent acknowledges,post,at opinion of breyer,there is authority suggesting that english juries were required to find facts that determined the authorized pecuniary punishment.see starkie,a treatise on criminal pleading in cases where the offence,or its defined measure of punishment,depends upon property specific value,the value must be proved precisely as it is laid in the indictment,and any variance will be fatal see also,at i n the case of usury,where the judgment depends upon the quantum taken,the usurious contract must be averred according to the fact and a variance from it,in evidence,would be fatal,because the penalty is apportioned to the value emphasis in original hawkins,a treatise of the pleas of the crown,ch,ed.doubting whether it be to set forth the value of the goods in an indictment of trespass for any other purpose than to aggravate the fine 
in any event,the salient question here is what role the jury played in prosecutions for offenses that did peg the amount of a fine to the determination of specified facts often,the value of damaged or stolen property.see apprendi,at,thomas,concurring.our review of state and federal decisions discloses that the predominant practice was for such facts to be alleged in the indictment and proved to the jury.see,commonwealth smith,declining to award judgment of treble damages for all stolen items in larceny prosecution when indictment alleged value of only some of the items clark people,arson indictment must allege value of destroyed building because statute imposed a fine equal in value to the property burned state garner,port,same in malicious mischief prosecution where punishment was fine not exceeding four fold the value of the property injured or destroyed ritchey state,blackf,same in arson prosecution because,i n addition to imprisonment in the penitentiary,the guilty person is liable to a fine not exceeding double the value of the property destroyed hope commonwealth,the value of the property alleged to be stolen must be set forth in the indictment in part because o ur statutes prescribe the punishment for larceny,with reference to the value of the property stolen state goodrich,it may also be suggested,that,in the case of simple larceny,the respondent may be sentenced to pay the owner of the goods stolen,treble the value thereof,which is an additional reason for requiring the value of the stolen items to be stated in the indictment united states woodruff,t he defendant is entitled to his constitutional right of trial by jury to ascertain the exact sum for which a fine may be imposed 
the rule that juries must determine facts that set a fine maximum amount is an application of the two longstanding tenets of criminal jurisprudence on which apprendi is based first,the truth of every accusation against a defendant should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours.blakely,at quoting blackstone.and second,an accusation which lacks any particular fact which the law makes essential to the punishment is no accusation within the requirements of the common law,and it is no accusation in reason.at quoting bishop,criminal procedure,ed.indeed,bishop leading treatise on criminal procedure specifically identified cases involving fines as evidence of the proposition that the indictment must,in order to inform the court what punishment to inflict,contain an averment of every particular thing which enters into the punishment.at discussing clark and garner.this principle,bishop explained,pervades the entire system of the adjudged law of criminal procedure.it is not made apparent to our understandings by a single case only,but by all the cases.criminal procedure,at.see also,at thomas,concurring explaining that bishop grounded this principle in practice and in the provisions of federal and state constitutions guaranteeing notice of an accusation in all criminal cases,indictment by a grand jury for serious crimes,and trial by jury 
as counterevidence that juries historically did not determine facts relevant to criminal fines,the government points to two decisions from this court.one is united states murphy,pet,which considered whether an interested witness was competent to testify in a larceny prosecution brought under a provision of the crimes act of.murphy only relevance to this case is that the crimes act authorized a fine of up to four times the value of the stolen property,and the court remarked that the fine is,as to its amount,purely in the discretion of the court.at.but this statement is best read as permitting the court to select a fine from within the maximum authorized by facts a practice,as noted,that accords with apprendi.such a reading is consistent with the fact that the indictment in murphy alleged the value of the stolen items,see,at,and with the practice of contemporary courts addressing the same statute,see united states holland,cas,cc sdny trial court instructs jury to assess the value of the property taken in order to determine maximum fine pye united states,cas.cc dc value of stolen items alleged in indictment.
the government and dissent place greater reliance on united states tyler,cranch.but like murphy,this decision involved no constitutional question.rather,it construed a federal embargo statute that imposed a fine of four times the value of the property intended to be exported.the indictment identified the property at issue as but the jury guilty verdict instead to that were worth two hundred and eighty dollars.tyler,cranch,at the question was whether the discrepancy rendered the verdict not sufficiently certain as to the value of the property charged in the indictment,ibid.the court held that the discrepancy was immaterial,on the ground that under this law,no valuation by the jury was necessary to enable the circuit court to impose the proper fine.ibid.the court reasoning is somewhat opaque,but appears to rest on the text of the embargo statute,which directed that the defendant shall,upon conviction,be fined a sum by the court.ibid.in any event,nothing in the decision purports to construe the sixth amendment.and,insofar as tyler reflects prevailing practice,it bears noting that both the indictment and identified the value of the property at issue.see tr.in tyler,cranch,reprinted in appellate case files of the supreme court of the united states,national archives microfilm publications,roll indictment nineteen barrels of pearlashes,which were then and there of the value of six hundred dollars whatever the precise meaning of this decision,it does not outweigh the ample historical evidence showing that juries routinely found facts that set the maximum amounts of fines.
the government remaining arguments,echoed by the dissent see post,at,are unpersuasive.the government first submits that,when it comes to fines,the judicially found facts typically involve only quantifying the harm caused by the defendant offense for example,how long did the violation last,or how much money did the defendant gain or the victim lose as opposed to a separate set of acts for punishment.brief for united states.only the latter determination,the government contends,implicates apprendi concerns.
this argument has two defects.first,it rests on an assumption that apprendi and its progeny have uniformly rejected that in determining the maximum punishment for an offense,there is a constitutionally significant difference between a fact that is an element of the offense and one that is a sentencing factor.see,at ring,at.second,we doubt the coherence of this distinction.this case proves the point.under d,the fact that will ultimately determine the maximum fine southern union faces is the number of days the company violated the statute.such a finding is not fairly characterized as merely quantifying the harm southern union caused.rather,it is a determination that for each given day,the government has proved that southern union committed all of the acts constituting the offense.
the government next contends that applying apprendi to fines will prevent states and the federal government from enacting statutes that,like d,calibrate fines to a defendant culpability,thus providing just punishment and reducing unwarranted sentencing disparity.but the government presents a false choice.as was true in our prior apprendi cases,and remains so here,legislatures are free to enact statutes that constrain judges discretion in sentencing apprendi requires only that such provisions be administered in conformance with the sixth amendment.
last,the government argues that requiring juries to determine facts related to fines will cause confusion because expert testimony might be needed to guide the inquiry or prejudice the defendant who might have to deny violating a statute while simultaneously arguing that any violation was minimal or be impractical at least when the relevant facts are unknown or unknowable until the trial is completed these arguments rehearse those made by the dissents in our prior apprendi cases.see booker,at breyer,dissenting in part blakely,at,dissenting,at breyer,dissenting apprendi,at same.here,as there,they must be rejected.for even if these predictions are,the rule the government espouses is unconstitutional.that should be the end of the matter.blakely,at.
but here there is particular reason to doubt the strength of these policy concerns.apprendi is now more than a decade old.the reliance interests that underlie many of the government arguments are by this point attenuated.nor,in our view,does applying apprendi rule to criminal fines mark an unexpected extension of the doctrine.most circuits to have addressed the issue already embrace this position,see pfaff,at lagrou distribution,at united states yang,fed.appx,as did the government prior to ice,see brief in opposition.in light of the reasons given in this opinion,the dramatic departure from precedent would be to hold criminal fines exempt from apprendi.
we hold that the rule of apprendi applies to the imposition of criminal fines.the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice breyer,with whom justice kennedy and justice alito join,dissenting.
where a criminal fine is at issue,i believe the sixth amendment permits a sentencing judge to determine sentencing facts facts that are not elements of the crime but are relevant only to the amount of the fine the judge will impose.those who framed the bill of rights understood that the finding of a particular fact of this kind was ordinarily a matter for a judge and not necessarily within the domain of the jury.oregon ice,quoting harris united states,plurality opinion.the court contrary conclusion,i believe,is ahistorical and will lead to increased problems of unfairness in the administration of our criminal justice system.
although this dissent does not depend upon the dissents in apprendi new jersey,and its progeny,summarizing those earlier dissents will help the reader understand this one.see,at,dissenting,at breyer,dissenting see also united states booker,breyer,dissenting in part citing cases blakely washington,breyer,dissenting same.the apprendi dissenters argued that the law had long distinguished between facts that constitute elements of the offense and facts relevant only to sentencing.the term elements of the offense means constituent parts of a crime that the prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.black law dictionary ed.the statute that creates the crime in question typically sets forth those constituent parts.and a jury must find the existence of each such element beyond a reasonable doubt.see,united states gaudin,in re winship.
thus,a bank robbery statute might prohibit an offender from taking by force or by intimidation in the presence of another person a thing of value belonging to,or in custody of,a bank.in that case,the jury can convict only if it finds the existence of each of these four factual elements beyond a reasonable doubt.but it need not find other facts beyond a reasonable doubt,for these four factual elements alone constitute the crime.
other facts may be relevant to the length or kind of sentence the court will impose upon a convicted offender.these sentencing facts typically characterize the manner in which the offender carried out the crime or set forth relevant features characterizing the offender.for example,in respect to manner,an offender might have carried out a particular bank robbery 
with or without a gun,which the robber kept hidden or brandished,might have frightened or merely warned,injured seriously or less seriously,tied up or simply pushed a guard,teller,or customer,at night or at noon,in an effort to obtain money for other crimes or for other purposes,in the company of a few or many other robbers united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual,ussg.
in respect to characteristics of the offender,a current bank robbery conviction might be that offender first or his fourth criminal conviction.
traditionally,sentencing facts help the sentencing judge determine where,within say a broad statutory range of,say,up to years of imprisonment,the particular bank robber punishment should lie.the apprendi dissenters concluded that the constitution did not require the jury to find the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable doubt.rather the law,through its rules,statutes,and the constitution due process clause would typically offer the defendant factfinding protection.see,fed.rule crim.proc.federal presentence report prepared by probation office sets forth facts,which defendant may contest at sentencing proceeding united states,constitutional inquiry.
the dispute in apprendi and its line of cases arose after congress and many states codified these sentencing facts during the sentencing reform movement of the and.congress,for example,concluded that too many different judges were imposing too many different sentences upon too many similar offenders who had committed similar crimes in similar ways.it subsequently enacted the sentencing reform act of,creating a federal sentencing commission which would produce greater uniformity in sentencing through the promulgation of mandatory uniform guidelines structuring how judges,in ordinary cases,should typically use sentencing facts to determine sentences,ed.and supp.iv see also b,e.the majority agreed that,where a statute set a higher maximum sentence,a commission might structure how a judge found sentencing facts relevant to the sentence imposed below that otherwise applicable maximum,at least if the resulting guidelines were not mandatory.see booker,at.but the majority held that where a sentencing fact increased the otherwise applicable maximum penalty,that fact had to be found by a jury.apprendi,at.
as i have said,the dissenters thought that the sixth amendment did not require a jury to find any of these sentencing facts.why,asked the dissenters,should congress or a state desire for greater sentencing uniformity achieved through statutes seeking more uniform treatment of similar offenders committing similar offenses in similar ways suddenly produce new sixth amendment jury trial requirements 
those requirements would work against greater sentencing fairness.to treat all sentencing facts where so specified in a statute or rule as if they were elements of the offense could lead congress simply to set high maximum ranges for each crime,thereby avoiding appren di jury trial requirement.alternatively,congress might enact statutes that more specifically tied particular punishments to each crime limiting or removing judicial discretion,for example,mandatory minimum statutes.but this system would threaten disproportionality by insisting that similar punishments be applied to very different kinds of offense behavior or offenders.apprendi jury trial requirements might also prove unworkable.consider the difficulty of juries having to find the different facts in the bank robbery example i have set forth above.moreover,how is a defendant,arguing that he did not have a gun,alternatively to argue that,in any event,he did not fire the gun 
finally,the dissenters took a different view of sixth amendment history.they believed that under the common law and at the time the constitution was ratified,judges,not juries,often found sentencing facts,facts relevant only to the determination of the offender punishment.see,booker,supra,at breyer,dissenting in part apprendi,at,dissenting.
the dissenters lost the argument.the court in apprendi held that other than the fact of a prior conviction any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.at.but the dissenters views help to explain why i continue to believe this court should not extend apprendi rule beyond the central sphere of its concern.ice,at quoting cunningham california,kennedy,dissenting.that is the court view,too,as set forth in ice.and i base my dissent here primarily upon ice.
this case involves sentencing facts,not elements of a crime.the criminal statute at issue constitutes one part of the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra,which,among others things,authorizes the environmental protection agency to create a list of hazardous wastes.the criminal statute says 
any person who knowingly treats,stores,or disposes of any hazardous waste identified or listed under rcra without an permit shall,upon conviction,be subject to a fine of not more than for each day of violation,or imprisonment not to exceed five years,or both.d a.
no one here denies that this statute creates a crime with four elements knowing treatment,storage,or disposal of a waste that is hazardous,without a permit,and knowing that the waste has a substantial potential of causing harm to others or to the environment.app.see brief for petitioner.
the number of day s of each violation,however,is not an additional element of the crime.the statute says that the number of days becomes relevant only upon conviction of the crime as previously defined.moreover,the number of days is relevant to application of only one of two kinds of punishment that the statute mentions fine and imprisonment one can not easily read this statute as creating two separate crimes identical but for the punishment.finally,congress did not include here,as it sometimes has done,statutory words such as each day of violation shall constitute a separate offense.b see also b.rather,as in many other similar statutes,the statute here sets forth the crime and kinds of punishments fine and imprisonment,while separately specifying facts that determine the maximum punishment of one kind fines.
in this particular case,the indictment set forth a violation period of days from on or about september,until on or about october,app.the jury guilty verdict did not specify the number of days on which the defendant committed the offense,at.but after the conviction and sentencing hearing,the judge found that,among other things,the clear and essentially irrefutable evidence at trial supported the conclusion set forth in the presentence report,namely,that the maximum fine available amounted to per day for days or million.app.to pet.for cert.the judge imposed a fine of million along with a million community service obligation.app.
apprendi says that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.at.the number of days beyond one on which the defendant violated this criminal statute is such a fact.nonetheless,like the majority,i believe that apprendi rule does not automatically control the outcome in this case.
that is because this case concerns a fine,not,as in apprendi,a term of imprisonment.and we made clear in oregon ice,that apprendi does not encompass every kind of sentencing decision that increases the statutory maximum.in ice,we considered apprendi application to a sentencing decision about whether two prison sentences for conviction of two separate crimes,illegal drug possession and illegal gun possession would run concurrently or consecutively,at.an oregon statute required a concurrent sentence unless the sentencing judge found certain facts,at.those facts could make a large difference in a term of imprisonment.their presence could mean that a sentence for illegal drug possession and a sentence for illegal gun possession would amount to years of imprisonment rather than indeed,in ice itself,the judge factfinding increased the sentence by years,see,at,and.thus,the presence of those fact s could increas e the penalty beyond what would otherwise be the prescribed statutory maximum.at internal quotation marks omitted.nonetheless,we held that the sixth amendment permitted a judge it did not require a jury to make that factual determination,at.
we consequently concluded that apprendi does not encompass every kind of sentencing decision that increases the statutory maximum.in doing so,we wrote that the animating principle of apprendi rule is the preservation of the jury historic role as a bulwark between the state and the accused at the trial for an alleged offense.at.and we refused to extend apprendi rule to a new category of facts for two basic reasons.
first,we considered a historical question,namely,whether the finding of a particular fact was understood as within the domain of the jury by those who framed the bill of rights.at quoting harris,at.and we read the historical record as showing that in england before the founding of our nation,and in the early american states,the jury played no role in the decision to impose sentences consecutively or concurrently.at footnote omitted.rather,that decision rested exclusively with the judge.at.
second,recognizing that administration of a discrete criminal justice system is among the states basic sovereign prerogatives,we considered the need to respect state sovereignty.ibid.we expressed concern lest application of apprendi to this kind of decision inhibit state legislative efforts to establish a fairer sentencing system by helping to bring about more uniform sentencing.ice,at.we concluded that n either apprendi nor our sixth amendment traditions compel straitjacketing the states in this respect.ibid.
this case presents another new category of sentencing decisions,namely,decisions about the amount of a fine.thus,as the majority recognizes,we must begin with a historical question.ante,at.who judge or jury found the facts that determine the amount of a criminal fine in england before the founding of our nation,and in the early american states ice,supra,at footnote omitted.unlike the majority,i believe the answer to this question is that,in most instances,the judge made that determination.
apprendi relied heavily upon the fact that in england before the founding of our nation the prescribed punishment for more serious crimes,felonies,was typically fixed indeed,fixed at death,at see baker,an introduction to english legal history ed.beattie,crime and the courts in england,hereinafter beattie langbein,the english criminal trial on the eve of the french revolution,in the trial jury in england,france,germany,schioppa ed.the facts related to the application of that punishment were typically elements of the crime.and the jury,not the judge,determined the existence of those facts.see blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england hereinafter blackstone see also baker,supra,at in practice,the jury or judge could ameliorate capital punishment through application of doctrines such as pious perjury,benefit of clergy,and reprieves,or the king could grant a royal pardon beattie same.
punishment for lesser crimes,however,included fines.and under the common law,the judge,not the jury,determined the amount of the fine and the sentencing facts relevant to the setting of that amount.see baker,supra,at beattie.pertinent sentencing facts typically concerned the manner in which the offender committed the crime and the characteristics of that offender.see,at.thus,in,blackstone wrote 
our statute law has not therefore often ascertained the quantity of fines,nor the common law ever it directing such an offense to be punished by fine,in general,without specifying the certain sum.blackstone emphasis added.
that is because 
the quantum,in particular,of pecuniary fines neither can,nor ought to be,ascertained by any invariable law.the value of money itself changes from a thousand causes and,at all events,what is ruin to one man fortune,may be a matter of indifference to another.at.
moreover,the quantum of pecuniary fines 
must frequently vary,from aggravations or otherwise of the offense,the manner in which the crime was committed,the quality and conditions of the parties,the offender characteristics,and from innumerable other circumstances.ibid.
similarly,the statesman and baron auckland pointed out that in england law had attached a fixed financial penalty to each specific crime.principles of penal law ed.that law,for example,imposed a penalty of cows for perjury and cows for the rape of a maid.ibid.this system,baron auckland added,ignored variations in,for example,the differing value of a fixed fine,say a cow,over time and among individuals it also ignored the manner in which the offense was committed and the characteristics of the offender,at.for those reasons,english law ordinarily left the quantum of the fine to the discretion of the judges.at emphasis deleted.
because t he enormity and tendency of the crime,the malice and wilfulness of the intention,the inconsiderateness and suddenness of the act,the age,faculties,and fortune of the offender,form a chain of complex questions which can be resolved only by the evidence of each separate charge,and for which no human foresight can provide then arises a necessary appeal to the breast of the judge.at emphasis added.
the only generally applicable limitations on the judge,when imposing the fine,were those contained in the english bill of rights and the magna carta,ch,in eng.stat.at large forbidding excessive fines magna carta,hen.iii,in eng.stat.at large fine can not deprive offender of means of livelihood see auckland,supra,at so interpreting magna carta blackstone same.
to be sure,the jury,not the judge,would determine the facts that made up the elements of the crime,even though those elements might be relevant to whether a fine could apply and,if so,the amount of the fine imposed as well.the common law,for example,defined larceny as the theft of goods that had some intrinsic value and divided the offense into grand larceny,which was theft of goods valued at more than a shilling,and petit larceny,which was theft of goods worth less than a shilling.blackstone langbein,supra,at see also beattie whether benefit of clergy was available depended on value stolen.consequently,the jury would determine the value of the goods in question.in doing so,the jury might manipulate the sentence by valuing the goods at under a shilling and thereby spare the defendant the capital sanction.lillquist,the puzzling return of jury sentencing misgivings about apprendi.but otherwise the jury could not influence what other penalties like fines the defendant might face because in criminal cases the amount of punishment was left solely in the hands of the justices.ibid.
i can not determine with any certainty the extent to which law placed other relevant limitations upon the judges authority to determine sentencing facts.i have found an english treatise on criminal pleading that says,unlike in cases where to constitute the offence the value must only be of a certain amount,in cases where the offence,or its defined measure of punishment,depends upon the quantity of that excess a variance from the amount averred will be fatal.starkie,a treatise on criminal pleading emphasis deleted.it then adds that in the case of usury,where the judgment depends upon the quantum taken,the usurious contract must be averred according to the fact and a variance from it,in evidence,would be fatal,because the penalty is apportioned to the value.at.and an treatise says that it is questionable whether it is necessary to set forth the value of the goods in an indictment of trespass for any other purpose than to aggravate the fine.hawkins,a treatise of the pleas of the crown,ch,ed.emphasis added.one might read these statements as supporting the majority,for they might indicate that,where a statute sets forth facts that determine a pecuniary penalty,then a jury,not judge,would determine those facts.
but whether that is the correct reading is unclear.for one thing,prosecutions for economic crimes were usually brought by injured parties and the fine in such cases went in whole or in part to compensate that party for damages.see beattie.for example,immediately following the sentence i have just quoted,hawkins wrote that it is questionable whether it is necessary to set forth the value of the goods in an indictment of larceny for any other purpose than to sh o w that the crime amounts to grand larceny,and to ascertain the goods,thereby the better to e ntitle the prosecutor to a resti tution.hawkins,supra,at emphasis added footnote omitted.likewise,blackstone dated english usury law back to a statute that provided as the penalty that the offending lender shall both make f i ne at the king will and pleasure and forfeit treble value of the money borrowed with half to the king and the other half to him or them that will sue for the same.hen.viii,ch,in stat.of realm emphasis added see blackstone see also ord,an essay on the law of usury ed.forfeitures recovered through information qui tam but discretionary fines recovered through criminal indictment.thus,the statutes at issue were what american courts would later call statutes part civil,part criminal see also beattie.
parliament consequently would have had a special reason for requiring jury determinations of the amount of the pecuniary penalty.and parliament had the authority to depart from the common law and to insist that juries determine sentencing facts without establishing a generally applicable principle.the relevant question here is how often and for what purposes parliament did so.blackstone himself wrote that such statutes fixing fines in amounts were both in derogation of the common law and uncommon.blackstone.finally,no one here argues that we adopt the rule actually suggested by the treatises.that rule is not that sentencing is to be done according to value found by the jury but instead that a discrepancy between the value alleged and value found by the jury might render the entire case fatal.see starkie,supra,at.
thus,i can not place great weight upon these statutes.the parties did not refer to them in their briefs.and in any event,the historical sources taken together make clear that the predominant practice in england was for a judge,not a jury,to find sentencing facts related to the imposition of a fine.
indeed,the court in apprendi conceded the point.it distinguished punishments for greater crimes fixed punishments from punishments for lesser crimes included fines,at.and it wrote that judges most commonly imposed discretionary sentences of fines upon misdemeanants.ibid.emphasis added.insofar as english practice helps determine what the framers would have thought about the scope of the constitution terms here,the sixth amendment right to trial by an impartial jury that practice suggests they would not have expected that right to include determination of sentencing facts relevant only to the imposition of a fine.
practice in the early american states is even less ambiguous.in the colonial era,judges would normally determine the amount of a fine within an unlimited or otherwise broad range while also determining related sentencing facts say,about the manner in which the offender committed the crime and the offender characteristics.legal historians tell us that in the american colonies a criminal fine was overwhelmingly the most common of the punishments,that in most instances the range of the fine was apparently without limit except insofar as it was within the expectation of the court that it would be paid,that the judge established the precise amount of the fine,and that the amount was tailored individually to the particular case.preyer,penal measures in the american colonies an overview,am.legal hist.c olonial judges,like their english brethren,possessed a great deal of discretion and could set the amount of fine depending upon the nature of the defendant and the crime.lillquist,at.
enactment of the constitution and bill of rights did not change this practice.some early american statutes specified that the judge has discretion to set the amount of the fine while saying nothing about amount,crimes act of,ch,stat.any person who bribes a judge on conviction thereof shall be fined and imprisoned at the discretion of the court stat.any person who does violence to an ambassador or public minister,on conviction,shall be imprisoned not exceeding three years,and fined at the discretion of the court others set only a maximum limitation,act of,ch,stat.officer of inspection convicted of oppression or extortion shall be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars,or imprisoned not exceeding six months,or both,at the discretion of the court in respect to these statutes,justice iredell wrote in that the common law practice must be adhered to that is to say,the jury are to find whether the prisoner be guilty,and the court must assess the fine.united states mundell,cas,cc.
still other statutes,as in england,specifically keyed the amount of the fine to a specific factual finding.a section of the crimes act of,for example,said that any person who upon united states property or the high seas shall take and carry away,with an intent to steal or purloin the personal goods of another shall,on conviction,be fined not exceeding the fourfold value of the property so stolen.stat.this crime has several elements taking and carrying away with intent to steal personal goods belonging to another on united states property or the high seas.the jury must find the existence of these facts beyond a reasonable doubt to establish a conviction.but the statute also says that the fine can not exceed the fourfold value of the property so stolen.and it thereby requires the finding of a sentencing fact,namely the value of the stolen property.who would make this determination judge or jury 
unlike in england,in the united states there is case law directly answering the question.in united states tyler,cranch,this court considered a federal embargo statute making it a crime to put certain goods on board a ship with intent to export them outside of the united states.see act of,ch,stat.the statute also provided that an offender goods and ship shall be forfeited,and the offender,shall,upon conviction,be fined a sum,by the court before which the conviction is had,equal to four times the value of such specie,goods,wares and merchandise.ibid.the statute thereby required determination of a sentencing fact,namely the value of such goods.was the finding of this sentencing fact for the judge or for the jury 
in tyler,the defendant had been indicted for attempting to export barrels of,valued at.ante,at.the jury convicted the defendant,but when doing so,it said that it found the defendant guilty of having tried to export worth two hundred and eighty dollars.cranch,at emphasis deleted.the defendant appealed,claiming a difference between the jury basis for conviction and the crime as charged in the indictment.the difference between the words and is unlikely to have mattered,for is simply a refined grade of potassium carbonate.see barker,dickinson,hardie,origins of the synthetic alkali industry in britain,economica.thus,the defendant did not focus upon that difference.rather,he claimed that the jury verdict was not sufficiently certain as to the value of the property charged in the indictment.tyler,cranch,at emphasis added.because differs from,the jury had not found him guilty of the crime charged.
the supreme court,however,found that the jury finding as to valuation was not relevant.it upheld the conviction because it was of the opinion that,under this law,no valuation by the jury was necessary to enable the circuit court to impose the proper fine.ibid.emphasis added.the court did not say explicitly that the sixth amendment permitted the judge to find the relevant sentencing fact.see ante,at.but it seems unlikely that a court that included chief justice john marshall,justice joseph story,and others familiar with both the common law and the constitution would have interpreted a federal statute as they did if either contemporary legal practice or the constitution suggested or required a different interpretation.
nor can we say that the court did not fully consider the matter.justice story later authoritatively interpreted tyler.sitting as a circuit justice in united states mann,cas.ccnh,he considered the same question in respect to the same embargo statute.his court wrote that in tyler,cranch,in a prosecution on this same clause,the court held that the fine and quadruple value must be assessed and adjudged by the court,and not by the jury.at emphasis added see also cas,ccnh story,noting that the supreme court would not have reached its result unless satisfied that the fine was to be imposed by the court,and not found by the jury 
thus,nothing in early american practice suggests that the framers thought that the sixth amendment jury trial right encompassed a right to have a jury determine sentencing facts.but,to the contrary,there is a supreme court opinion,namely tyler,that holds,or at least strongly indicates,the opposite.
the majority reaches a different conclusion.but the majority does not pose what i believe to be the relevant historical question,namely whether traditionally in england before the founding of our nation,and in the early american states,see ice,at footnote omitted,judges,not juries,normally determined sentencing facts.instead,it asks whether a jury,rather than the judge,found those facts in that subclass of cases where a statute peg ged the amount of a fine to the determination of specified facts.ante,at.it concludes that the predominant practice was for such facts to be alleged in the indictment and proved to the jury.ibid.
putting the question this way invites a circular response.as is true of the english usury cases,nothing prohibits a legislature from requiring a jury to find a sentencing fact in a particular subset of cases.and obviously when a state does so,the jury will indeed have to find those facts.thus,if,say,states decide to make juries find facts that will set the fine for,say,simple larceny,then jury practice in those states during,say,the century will include the jury finding of those sentencing facts.but that circumstance tells us only that in those states for those specific statutes the legislatures so required.it tells us little,if anything,about practices in most states,and it tells us nothing at all about traditional practice in england or america.nor does a discovery that,say,state legislatures once required juries,rather than judges,generally to set fines tell us about the scope of the sixth amendment constitutional right to trial by jury.the matter is important because the majority rests its conclusion almost exclusively upon reports of jury trials in a handful of states,namely alabama,illinois,indiana,massachusetts,and new hampshire,and a treatise that bases its statements upon those cases.ante,at.
scholars tell us that in fact there were about states including alabama,illinois,and indiana that after ratification of the sixth amendment enacted statutes that required juries,not judges,to determine a defendant punishment,including not only the length of a prison term but also the amount of a fine.see iontcheva,jury sentencing as democratic practice,king,origins of felony jury sentencing in the united states.the courts that considered this practice,however,did not believe that the constitutional right to jury trial compelled it.
alabama supreme court,for example,explained that its state system,which allowed the jury to determine both the fine and imprisonment,was in derogation of,and created an innovation upon,the rules of the common law,so far as it transfers those powers from the court to the jury.hawkins state,stew.thus,in state garner,port,see ante,at,the malicious mischief statute at issue said that the offender would be fined in such sum as the jury trying the same may assess,not exceeding four fold the value of the property injured or destroyed.at emphasis added.the statute,in other words,transferred all sentencing facts to the jury and was not illustrative of practice.further,the statute said that the fine shall be paid to the party injured.ibid.the court held that it was consequently proper to allege the amount of the property value in the indictment,not because the state constitution required any such thing,but because the fine thus assesse d is for the benefit of the injured party the case is,therefore,a quasi civil proceeding and for that reason it would be more consonant to the rules of pleading,and to the principles which govern analogous cases,that the indictment should contain an averment of the value of the property.ord,law of usury,at usury as proceeding.
illinois law was similar.illinois became a state in.see iontcheva,supra,at,citing act of.laws.the illinois supreme court subsequently wrote that,even though at common law juries never were invested with the power of determining the character or extent of the punishment,we are to be governed entirely the provisions and enactments of our code of criminal jurisprudence.blevings people,scam.and in clark people,scam,see ante,at,the court made clear that the arson statute at issue 
ha d changed the common law,that the fine equal in value to the property burne d is imposed as part of the punishment hence,t he indictment should have charged the value of the property destroyed,for otherwise it could not properly have been inquired into by the jury.at.
indiana was another state.iontcheva,supra,at,king,supra,at.indiana case law decided before indiana changed its system indicates that the judge could decide certain facts required to set the applicable maximum fine,morris state,blackf.but after indiana became a state,its courts held,not surprisingly,that under indiana law the jury must determine sentencing facts.see ritchey state,blackf,ante,at.
massachusetts presents a special circumstance.the two massachusetts cases that the majority cites,ante,at,are larceny cases.value traditionally was an element of the crime of larceny both because larceny was theft of goods that had some intrinsic value and because value distinguished grand larceny from petit larceny and thus juries traditionally had to determine at least some facts about the value of the property stolen.see blackstone.massachusetts had abolished the distinction between grand and petit larceny before its courts decided the two cases the majority cites.see commonwealth smith.but those decisions nonetheless rest in significant part upon the jury traditional larceny factfinding role.in hope commonwealth,metcalf,for example,the massachusetts supreme judicial court wrote 
the well settled practice,familiar to us all,has been that of stating in the indictment the value of the article alleged to have been stolen.the reason for requiring this allegation and finding of value may have been,originally,that a distinction might appear between the offences of grand and petit larceny.our statutes prescribe the punishment for larceny,with reference to the value of the property stolen and for this reason,as well as because it is in conformity with long established practice,the court are of opinion that the value of the property alleged to be stolen must be set forth in the indictment.at.
the long established practice to which the court refers is larceny case practice,not practice in all criminal cases.
the new hampshire case to which the majority refers,state goodrich,ante,at,is also a larceny case that relied on the established larceny case practice.the court explained 
the indictment ought to state the value of the articles stolen that it may appear whether the offence be grand or petit larceny,and such we believe is the settled practice.it has been held in some jurisdictions,that,in case no value is alleged,the offence charged may be regarded as simple larceny,and a conviction be had accordingly but we think it best to adhere to the well established doctrine in such cases.it may also be suggested,that,in the case of simple larceny,the respondent may be sentenced to pay the owner of the goods stolen,treble the value thereof,which is an additional reason for requiring the character of the offence to be stated.at.
the court wrote nothing to suggest that its holding rested on generally applicable constitutional grounds.and it was in the new hampshire federal circuit court a earlier when justice story had indicated that the federal constitution did not impose any such requirement.see mann,at.
that leaves the majority puzzling federal district court case from kansas.united states woodruff,ante,at.the circumstances of this case are highly unusual,and the district court reasoning as to why no fine could be set seems to have rested on a combination of statutory construction and constitutional principle.see woodruff united states,cc woodruff,at.still,i concede this case to the majority as the lone swallow that can not make the majority summer.
taken together,the cases upon which the majority rests its holding do not show anything about practice in the vast majority of states.they concede that practice was to the contrary.and they tell us little about the meaning of the sixth amendment.even were that not so,i do not understand why these cases should tell us more about the constitution meaning than,say,the common practice of leaving sentencing fact determinations to the judge.this court apparently once app
