respondent pollard sought damages from employees at a privately run federal prison in california,claiming that they had deprived him of adequate medical care in violation of the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.the federal district court dismissed the complaint,ruling that the eighth amendment does not imply an action under bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,against a privately managed prison personnel.the ninth circuit reversed.
held because in the circumstance of this case,state tort law authorizes adequate alternative damages actions providing both significant deterrence and compensation no bivens remedy can be implied here.
a wilkie robbins,fairly summarizes the basic considerations the court applies here.in deciding whether to recognize a bivens remedy,a court must first ask whether any alternative,existing process for protecting the constitutionally recognized interest amounts to a convincing reason for the judicial branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding damages remedy.even absent an alternative,a bivens remedy is a subject of judgment the federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a tribunal,paying particular heed to any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.at.in bivens itself,the court held that the fourth amendment implicitly authorized a court to order federal agents to pay damages to a person injured by the agents violation of the amendment strictures,at,noting that the fourth amendment prohibited conduct that state law might permit,at,and that the interests protected on the one hand by state trespass and invasion of privacy laws and on the other hand by the fourth amendment may be inconsistent or even hostile,at.it also stated that h istorically,damages have been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in liberty,at,and found no special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress.at.bivens actions were allowed in davis passman,for a fifth amendment due process claim involving employment discrimination,and in carlson green,for an eighth amendment claim based on federal government officials deliberat e indifferen ce to a federal prisoner medical needs,at.since carlson,this court has declined to imply a bivens action in several different instances.see,bush lucas,correctional services malesko.
applying wilkie approach here,pollard can not assert a bivens claim,primarily because his eighth amendment claim focuses on a kind of conduct that typically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law.and in the case of a privately employed defendant,state tort law provides an alternative,existing process capable of protecting the constitutional interests at stake.wilkie,at.the existence of that alternative remedy constitutes a convincing reason for the judicial branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding damages remedy.ibid.
b pollard contrary arguments are rejected.first,he claims that carlson authorizes an eighth bivens action here,but carlson involved government,not privately employed,personnel.the potential existence of an adequate alternative,existing process differs dramatically for public and private employees,as prisoners ordinarily can bring state tort actions against private employees,but not against public ones.second,pollard argument that this court should consider only whether federal laws provide adequate alternative remedies because of the vagaries of state tort law,carlson,supra,at,was rejected in malesko,supra,at.third,pollard claims that state tort law does not provide remedies adequate to protect the constitutional interests at issue here,but california,like every other state as far as the court is aware,has tort law that provides for negligence actions for claims such as his.that the state law may prove less generous than would a bivens action does not render the state law inadequate,and state remedies and a potential bivens remedy need not be perfectly congruent.fourth,pollard argues that there may be similar eighth amendment claims that state tort law does not cover,but he offers no supporting cases.the possibility of a future case,where an eighth amendment claim or state law differs significantly from those at issue,provides insufficient grounds for reaching a different conclusion here.

margaret minneci,et,petitioners richard lee pollard et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the question is whether we can imply the existence of an eighth damages action a bivens action against employees of a privately operated federal prison.see generally bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,v iolation of the fourth amendment by a federal agent gives rise to a cause of action for damages against a federal government employee.because we believe that in the circumstances present here state tort law authorizes adequate alternative damages actions actions that provide both significant deterrence and compensation we can not do so.see wilkie robbins,no bivens action where alternative,existing processes provide adequate protection.
richard lee pollard was a prisoner at a federal facility operated by a private company,the wackenhut corrections corporation.in he filed a pro se complaint in federal court against several wackenhut employees,who now include a security officer,a supervisor,and several members of the medical staff.as the federal magistrate judge interpreted pollard complaint,he claimed that these employees had deprived him of adequate medical care,had thereby violated the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment,and had caused him injury.he sought damages.
pollard said that a year earlier he had slipped on a cart left in the doorway of the prison butcher shop.the prison medical staff took x rays,thought he might have fractured both elbows,brought him to an outside clinic for further orthopedic evaluation,and subsequently arranged for surgery.in particular,pollard claimed 
despite his having told a prison guard that he could not extend his arm,the guard forced him to put on a jumpsuit to travel to the outside clinic,causing him the most excruciating pain,app.
during several visits to the outside clinic,prison guards made pollard wear arm restraints that were connected in a way that caused him continued pain 
prison medical and other personnel failed to follow the outside clinic instructions to put pollard left elbow in a posterior splint,failed to provide necessary physical therapy,and failed to conduct necessary studies,including nerve conduction studies 
at times when pollard arms were in casts or similarly disabled,prison officials failed to make alternative arrangements for him to receive meals,with the result that to avoid being humiliated in the general food service area,at pollard had to auction off personal items to obtain funds to buy food at the commissary 
prison officials deprived him of basic hygienic care to the point where he could not bathe for two weeks 
prison medical staff provided him with insufficient medicine,to the point where he was in pain and could not sleep and 
prison officials forced him to return to work before his injuries had healed.
after concluding that the eighth amendment did not provide for a bivens action against a privately managed prison personnel,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss pollard complaint.the district court did so.but on appeal the ninth circuit found that the eighth amendment provided pollard with a bivens action,and it reversed the district court.pollard v.the geo group,as amended.
the defendants sought certiorari.and,in light of a split among the courts of appeals,we granted the petition.compare ibid.finding an eighth amendment bivens action where prisoner sues employees of a privately operated federal prison,with,alba montford,no bivens action available,and holly scott,same.
recently,in wilkie robbins,supra,we rejected a claim that the fifth amendment impliedly authorized a bivens action that would permit landowners to obtain damages from government officials who unconstitutionally interfere with their exercise of property rights.after reviewing the court earlier bivens cases,the court stated 
t he decision whether to recognize a bivens remedy may require two steps.in the first place,there is the question whether any alternative,existing process for protecting the constitutionally recognized interest amounts to a convincing reason for the judicial branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.but even in the absence of an alternative,a bivens remedy is a subject of judgment the federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a tribunal,paying particular heed,however,to any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.at quoting bush lucas.
these standards seek to reflect and to reconcile the court reasoning set forth in earlier cases.in bivens itself the court held that the fourth amendment implicitly authorized a court to order federal agents to pay damages to a person injured by the agents violation of the amendment constitutional strictures,at.the court noted that where federally protected rights have been invaded,courts can adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief.at quoting bell hood.see also correctional services malesko,authority to imply a new constitutional tort anchored within general arising under jurisdiction.it pointed out that the fourth amendment prohibited,among other things,conduct that state law might permit such as the conduct at issue in that very case.bivens,at.it added that the interests protected on the one hand by state trespass and invasion of privacy laws and on the other hand by the fourth amendment guarantees may be inconsistent or even hostile.at.it stated that h istorically,damages have been regarded as the ordinary remedy for an invasion of personal interests in liberty.at.and it found no special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress.at.
in davis passman,the court considered a former congressional employee claim for damages suffered as a result of her employer unconstitutional discrimination based on gender.the court found a damages action implicit in the fifth amendment due process clause,at.in doing so,the court emphasized the unavailability of other alternative forms of judicial relief.at.and the court noted that there was no evidence that congress or the constitution intended to foreclose such a remedy,at.
in carlson green,the court considered a claim for damages brought by the estate of a federal prisoner who the estate said had died as the result of government officials deliberat e indifferen ce to his medical needs indifference that violated the eighth amendment,at,citing estelle gamble.the court implied an action for damages from the eighth amendment,at.it noted that state law offered the particular plaintiff no meaningful damages remedy,at.although the estate might have brought a damages claim under the federal tort claims act,the defendant in any such lawsuit was the employer,namely the united states,not the individual officers who had committed the violation,at.a damages remedy against an individual officer,the court added,would prove a more effective deterrent.ibid.and,rather than leave compensation to the vagaries of state tort law,a federal bivens action would provide uniform rules.at.
since carlson,the court has had to decide in several different instances whether to imply a bivens action.and in each instance it has decided against the existence of such an action.these instances include 
a federal employee claim that his federal employer dismissed him in violation of the first amendment,bush,supra,at congressionally created federal civil service procedures provide meaningful redress 
a claim by military personnel that military superiors violated various constitutional provisions,chappell wallace,special factors related to the military counsel against implying a bivens action,see also united states stanley,similar 
a claim by recipients of social security disability benefits that benefits had been denied in violation of the fifth amendment,schweiker chilicky,elaborate administrative scheme provides meaningful alternative remedy 
a former bank employee suit against a federal banking agency,claiming that he lost his job due to agency action that violated the fifth amendment due process clause,fdic meyer,no bivens actions against government agencies rather than particular individuals who act unconstitutionally 
a prisoner eighth suit against a private corporation that managed a federal prison,at to permit suit against the would risk skewing relevant incentives at the same time,the ability of a prisoner to bring state tort law damages action against private individual defendants means that the prisoner does not lack effective remedies,at.
although the court,in reaching its decisions,has not always similarly emphasized the same aspects of the cases,wilkie fairly summarizes the basic considerations that underlie those decisions,at.we consequently apply its approach here.and we conclude that pollard can not assert a bivens claim.
that is primarily because pollard eighth amendment claim focuses upon a kind of conduct that typically falls within the scope of traditional state tort law.and in the case of a privately employed defendant,state tort law provides an alternative,existing process capable of protecting the constitutional interests at stake,at.the existence of that alternative here constitutes a convincing reason for the judicial branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.ibid.our reasoning is best understood if we set forth and explain why we reject pollard arguments to the contrary.
pollard together with supporting amici asks us to imply a bivens action for four basic reasons none of which we find convincing.first,pollard argues that this court has already decided in carlson that a federal prisoner may bring an eighth bivens action against prison personnel and we need do no more than simply apply carlson holding here.carlson,however,was a case in which a federal prisoner sought damages from personnel employed by the government,not personnel employed by a private firm,at.and for present purposes that fact of employment status makes a critical difference.
for one thing,the potential existence of an adequate alternative,existing process differs dramatically in the two sets of cases.prisoners ordinarily can not bring tort actions against employees of the federal government.see,b westfall act substituting united states as defendant in tort action against federal employee osborn haley,westfall act immunizes federal employee through removal and substitution of united states as defendant.but prisoners ordinarily can bring tort actions against employees of a private firm.infra,at.
for another thing,the court specifically rejected justice stevens somewhat similar suggestion in his dissenting opinion in malesko,namely that a prisoner suit against a private firm should fall within carlson earlier holding because such a firm,like a federal employee,is a federal agent.compare malesko,at,and majority opinion,with,at,dissenting opinion.in rejecting the dissent suggestion,the court explained that the context in malesko was fundamentally different from the contexts at issue in earlier cases,including carlson,at.that difference,the court said,reflected in part the nature of the defendant,a corporate employer ra
