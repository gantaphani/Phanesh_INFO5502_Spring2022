petitioner stephen voisine pleaded guilty to assaulting his girlfriend in violation of of the maine criminal code,which makes it a misdemeanor to intentionally,knowingly or recklessly cause bodily injury to another.when law enforcement officials later investigated voisine for killing a bald eagle,they learned that he owned a rifle.after a background check turned up voisine prior conviction under,the government charged him with violating g.petitioner william armstrong pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife in violation of a maine domestic violence law making it a misdemeanor to commit an assault prohibited by against a family or household member.while searching armstrong home as part of a narcotics investigation a few years later,law enforcement officers discovered six guns and a large quantity of ammunition.armstrong was also charged under g.both men argued that they were not subject to g prohibition because their prior convictions could have been based on reckless,rather than knowing or intentional,conduct and thus did not quality as misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence.the district court rejected those claims,and each petitioner pleaded guilty.the first circuit affirmed,holding that an offense with a mens rea of recklessness may qualify as a misdemeanor crime of violence under g.voisine and armstrong filed a joint petition for certiorari,and their case was remanded for further consideration in light of castleman.the first circuit again upheld the convictions on the same ground.
held a reckless domestic assault qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under g.
a that conclusion follows from the statutory text.nothing in the phrase use of physical force indicates that g distinguishes between domestic assaults committed knowingly or intentionally and those committed recklessly.dictionaries consistently define the word use to mean the act of employing something.accordingly,the force involved in a qualifying assault must be volitional an involuntary motion,even a powerful one,is not naturally described as an active employment of force.see castleman,at.but nothing about the definition of use demands that the person applying force have the purpose or practical certainty that it will cause harm,as compared with the understanding that it is substantially likely to do so.nor does leocal ashcroft,which held that the use of force excludes accidents.reckless conduct,which requires the conscious disregard of a known risk,is not an accident it involves a deliberate decision to endanger another.the relevant text thus supports prohibiting petitioners,and others with similar criminal records,from possessing firearms.
b so too does the relevant history.congress enacted g in to bar those domestic abusers convicted of assault or battery misdemeanors just like those convicted of felonies from owning guns.then,as now,a significant majority of jurisdictions states plus the district of columbia defined such misdemeanor offenses to include the reckless infliction of bodily harm.in targeting those laws,congress thus must have known it was sweeping in some persons who had engaged in reckless conduct.see,united states bailey,pet.indeed,that was part of the point to apply the federal firearms restriction to those abusers,along with all others,covered by the states ordinary misdemeanor assault laws.
petitioners reading risks rendering g broadly inoperative in the jurisdictions with assault laws extending to recklessness.consider maine law,which criminalizes intentionally,knowingly or recklessly injuring another.assuming that statute defines a single crime,petitioners view that a a requires at least a knowing mens rea would mean that no conviction obtained under that law could qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.descamps united states.in castleman,the court declined to construe a a so as to render g ineffective in states.all the more so here,where petitioners view would jeopardize g force in several times that many.

stephen voisine and william armstrong,iii,petitioners united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
federal law prohibits any person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from possessing a firearm.g.that phrase is defined to include any misdemeanor committed against a domestic relation that necessarily involves the use of physical force.a a.the question presented here is whether misdemeanor assault convictions for reckless as contrasted to knowing or intentional conduct trigger the statutory firearms ban.we hold that they do.
congress enacted g some years ago to close a dangerous loophole in the gun control laws.united states castleman,slip,at quoting united states hayes.an existing provision already barred convicted felons from possessing firearms.see g ed.but many perpetrators of domestic violence are charged with misdemeanors rather than felonies,notwithstanding the harmfulness of their conduct.see castleman,at slip,at.and f irearms and domestic strife are a potentially deadly combination.hayes,at.accordingly,congress added g to prohibit any person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from possessing any gun or ammunition with a connection to interstate commerce.and it defined that phrase,in a a,to include a misdemeanor under federal,state,or tribal law,committed by a person with a specified domestic relationship with the victim,that has,as an element,the use or attempted use of physical force.
two terms ago,this court considered the scope of that definition in a case involving a conviction for a knowing or intentional assault.see castleman,at slip,at.in castleman,we initially held that the word force in a a bears its meaning,and so is broad enough to include offensive touching.see,at slip,at.we then determined that the knowing or intentional application of such force is a use of force.at slip,at.but we expressly left open whether a reckless assault also qualifies as a use of force so that a misdemeanor conviction for such conduct would trigger g firearms ban.see,at,slip,at.the two cases before us now raise that issue.
petitioner stephen voisine pleaded guilty in to assaulting his girlfriend in violation of of the maine criminal code,which makes it a misdemeanor to intentionally,knowingly or recklessly cause bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another person.me.stat,tit,a.several years later,voisine again found himself in legal trouble,this time for killing a bald eagle.see a.while investigating that crime,law enforcement officers learned that voisine owned a rifle.when a background check turned up his prior misdemeanor conviction,the government charged him with violating g 
petitioner william armstrong pleaded guilty in to assaulting his wife in violation of a maine domestic violence law making it a misdemeanor to commit an assault prohibited by the general statute under which voisine was convicted against a family or household member.see me.stat,tit,a.a few years later,law enforcement officers searched armstrong home as part of a narcotics investigation.they discovered six guns,plus a large quantity of ammunition.like voisine,armstrong was charged under g for unlawfully possessing firearms.
both men argued that they were not subject to g prohibition because their prior convictions as the government conceded could have been based on reckless,rather than knowing or intentional,conduct.the district court rejected those claims.each petitioner then entered a guilty plea conditioned on the right to appeal the district court ruling.
the court of appeals for the first circuit affirmed the two convictions,holding that an offense with a mens rea of recklessness may qualify as a misdemeanor crime of violence under g.united states armstrong,see united states voisine,fed.appx,per curiam.voisine and armstrong filed a joint petition for certiorari,and shortly after issuing castleman,this court without opinion vacated the first circuit judgments and remanded the cases for further consideration in light of that decision.see armstrong united states.on remand,the court of appeals again upheld the convictions,on the same ground.see.
we granted certiorari,to resolve a circuit split over whether a misdemeanor conviction for recklessly assaulting a domestic relation disqualifies an individual from possessing a gun under g we now affirm.
the issue before us is whether g applies to reckless assaults,as it does to knowing or intentional ones.to commit an assault recklessly is to take that action with a certain state of mind or mens rea in the dominant formulation,to consciously disregard a substantial risk that the conduct will cause harm to another.ali,model penal code c me.stat,tit,supp.adopting that definition see farmer brennan,noting that a person acts recklessly only when he disregards a substantial risk of harm of which he is aware for purposes of comparison,to commit an assault knowingly or intentionally the latter,to add yet another adverb,sometimes called purposefully is to act with another state of mind respecting that act consequences in the first case,to be aware that harm is practically certain and,in the second,to have that result as a conscious object.model penal code a b me.stat,tit.
statutory text and background alike lead us to conclude that a reckless domestic assault qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under g.congress defined that phrase to include crimes that necessarily involve the use of physical force.a a.reckless assaults,no less than the knowing or intentional ones we addressed in castleman,satisfy that definition.further,congress enacted g in order to prohibit domestic abusers convicted under misdemeanor assault and battery laws from possessing guns.because fully of such state laws extend to recklessness,construing g to exclude crimes committed with that state of mind would substantially undermine the provision design.
nothing in the word use which is the only statutory language either party thinks relevant indicates that g applies exclusively to knowing or intentional domestic assaults.recall that under a a,an offense counts as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence only if it has,as an element,the use of force.dictionaries consistently define the noun use to mean the act of employing something.webster new international dictionary ed.a ct of employing anything random house dictionary of the english language ed.act of employing,using,or putting into service black law dictionary ed.a ct of employing,application on that common understanding,the force involved in a qualifying assault must be volitional an involuntary motion,even a powerful one,is not naturally described as an active employment of force.see castleman,at slip,at t he word use conveys the idea that the thing used here,physical force has been made the user instrument some internal quotation marks omitted.but the word use does not demand that the person applying force have the purpose or practical certainty that it will cause harm,as compared with the understanding that it is substantially likely to do so.or,otherwise said,that word is indifferent as to whether the actor has the mental state of intention,knowledge,or recklessness with respect to the harmful consequences of his volitional conduct.
consider a couple of examples to see the ordinary meaning of the word use in this context.if a person with soapy hands loses his grip on a plate,which then shatters and cuts his wife,the person has not use d physical force in common parlance.but now suppose a person throws a plate in anger against the wall near where his wife is standing.that hurl counts as a use of force even if the husband did not know for certain or have as an object,but only recognized a substantial risk,that a shard from the plate would ricochet and injure his wife.similarly,to spin out a scenario discussed at oral argument,if a person lets slip a door that he is trying to hold open for his girlfriend,he has not actively employed used force even though the result is to hurt her.but if he slams the door shut with his girlfriend following close behind,then he has done so regardless of whether he thinks it absolutely sure or only quite likely that he will catch her fingers in the jamb.see tr.of oral arg.counsel for petitioners acknowledging that this example involves the use of physical force once again,the word use does not exclude from g compass an act of force carried out in conscious disregard of its substantial risk of causing harm.
and contrary to petitioners view,nothing in leocal ashcroft,suggests a different conclusion,that use marks a dividing line between reckless and knowing conduct.see brief for petitioners.in that decision,this court addressed a statutory definition similar to a a there,the use of physical force against the person or property of another.that provision excludes merely accidental conduct,leocal held,because it is not natural to say that a person actively employs physical force against another person by accident.at.for example,the court stated,one would not ordinarily say a person use s physical force against another by stumbling and falling into him.ibid.that reasoning fully accords with our analysis here.conduct like stumbling or in our hypothetical,dropping a plate is a true accident,and so too the injury arising from it hence the difficulty of describing that conduct as the active employment of force.ibid.but the same is not true of reckless behavior acts undertaken with awareness of their substantial risk of causing injury in our contrasting hypo,hurling the plate.the harm such conduct causes is the result of a deliberate decision to endanger another no more an accident than if the substantial risk were practically certain.see supra,at comparing reckless and knowing acts.and indeed,leocal itself recognized the distinction between accidents and recklessness,specifically reserving the issue whether the definition in embraces reckless conduct,see,at as we now hold a a does 
in sum,congress definition of a misdemeanor crime of violence contains no exclusion for convictions based on reckless behavior.a person who assaults another recklessly use s force,no less than one who carries out that same action knowingly or intentionally.the relevant text thus supports prohibiting petitioners,and others with similar criminal records,from possessing firearms.
so too does the relevant history.as explained earlier,congress enacted g in to bar those domestic abusers convicted of assault or battery misdemeanors just like those convicted of felonies from owning guns.see supra,at castleman,at,slip,at,hayes,at.then,as now,a significant majority of jurisdictions states plus the district of columbia defined such misdemeanor offenses to include the reckless infliction of bodily harm.see brief for united states collecting statutes.that agreement was no coincidence.several decades earlier,the model penal code had taken the position that a mens rea of recklessness should generally suffice to establish criminal liability,including for assault.see,comments,at purpose,knowledge,and recklessness are properly the basis for such liability defining assault to include purposely,knowingly,or recklessly caus ing bodily injury states quickly incorporated that view into their misdemeanor assault and battery statutes.so in linking g to those laws,congress must have known it was sweeping in some persons who had engaged in reckless conduct.see,united states bailey,pet,story,congress must be presumed to have legislated under this known state of the laws and indeed,that was part of the point to apply firearms restrictions to those abusers,along with all others,whom the states ordinary misdemeanor assault laws covered.
what is more,petitioners reading risks rendering g broadly inoperative in the jurisdictions with assault laws extending to recklessness that is,inapplicable even to persons who commit that crime knowingly or intentionally.consider maine statute,which in typical fashion makes it a misdemeanor to intentionally,knowingly or recklessly injure another.me.stat,tit,a.assuming that provision defines a single crime which happens to list alternative mental states and accepting petitioners view that a a requires at least a knowing mens rea then,under descamps united states,no conviction obtained under maine statute could qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.see,at slip,at if a state crime sweeps more broadly than the federally defined one,a conviction for the state offense can not count as a predicate,no matter what mens rea the defendant actually had.so in the jurisdictions like maine,petitioners reading risks allowing domestic abusers of all mental states to evade g firearms ban.in castleman,we declined to construe a a so as to render g ineffective in states.see,at slip,at.all the more so here,where petitioners view would jeopardize g force in several times that many.
petitioners respond that we should ignore the assault and battery laws actually on the books when congress enacted g.in construing the statute,they urge,we should look instead to how the common law defined those crimes in an earlier age.see brief for petitioners.and that approach,petitioners claim,would necessitate reversing their convictions because the common law required a mens rea greater than recklessness.at.
but we see no reason to wind the clock back so far.once again congress passed g to take guns out of the hands of abusers convicted under the misdemeanor assault laws then in general use in the states.see supra,at.and by that time,a substantial majority of jurisdictions,following the model penal code lead,had abandoned the common law approach to mens rea in drafting and interpreting their assault and battery statutes.indeed,most had gone down that road decades before.that was the backdrop against which congress was legislating.nothing suggests that,in enacting g,congress wished to look beyond that real world to a precursor that had largely expired.to the contrary,such an approach would have undermined congress aim by tying the ban on firearms possession not to the laws under which abusers are prosecuted but instead to a legal anachronism 
and anyway,we would not know how to resolve whether recklessness sufficed for a battery conviction at common law.recklessness was not a word in the common law standard lexicon,nor an idea in its conceptual framework only in the mid to did courts begin to address reckless behavior in those terms.see hall,assault and battery by the reckless motorist,crim.the common law traditionally used a variety of overlapping and,frankly,confusing phrases to describe culpable mental states among them,specific intent,general intent,presumed intent,willfulness,and malice.see,morissette united states,model penal code,comment,at.whether and where conduct that we would today describe as reckless fits into that obscure scheme is anyone guess neither petitioners citations,nor the government competing ones,have succeeded in resolving that counterfactual question.and that indeterminacy confirms our conclusion that congress had no thought of incorporating the common law treatment of mens rea into a a.that provision instead corresponds to the ordinary misdemeanor assault and battery laws used to prosecute domestic abuse,regardless of how their mental state requirements might or,then again,might not conform to the common law 
the federal ban on firearms possession applies to any person with a prior misdemeanor conviction for the use of physical force against a domestic relation.a a.that language,naturally read,encompasses acts of force undertaken recklessly,with conscious disregard of a substantial risk of harm.and the backdrop to that provision,which included misdemeanor assault statutes covering reckless conduct in a significant majority of jurisdictions,indicates that congress meant just what it said.each petitioner possession of a gun,following a conviction under maine law for abusing a domestic partner,therefore violates g.we accordingly affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.
it is so ordered.
thomas,dissenting 
stephen voisine and william armstrong,iii,petitioners united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
justice thomas,with whom justice sotomayor joins as to parts i and ii,dissenting.
federal law makes it a crime for anyone previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to possess a firearm in or affecting commerce.g.a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence includes an offense that has,as an element,the use or attempted use of physical force committed by certain close family members of the victim.a a ii.in this case,petitioners were convicted under g because they possessed firearms and had prior convictions for assault under maine statute prohibiting intentionally,knowingly or recklessly caus ing bodily injury or physical contact to another person.me.stat,tit,a.the question presented is whether a prior conviction under has,as an element,the use of physical force,such that the conviction can strip someone of his right to possess a firearm.in my view,does not qualify as such an offense,and the majority errs in holding otherwise.i respectfully dissent.
to qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,the maine assault statute must have as an element the use of physical force.a a ii.because mere recklessness is sufficient to sustain a conviction under,a conviction does not necessarily involve the use of physical force,and thus,does not trigger g prohibition on firearm possession.
three features of a a ii establish that the use of physical force requires intentional conduct.first,the word use in that provision is best read to require intentional conduct.as the majority recognizes,the noun use means the act of employing something.ante,at quoting dictionaries.a use is t he act of employing a thing for any purpose.oxford english dictionary ed.to use something,in other words,is to employ the thing for its instrumental value,to employ the thing to accomplish a further goal.see united states castleman,slip,at.a use,therefore,is an inherently intentional act that is,an act done for the purpose of causing certain consequences or at least with knowledge that those consequences will ensue.see restatement second of torts,defining intentional acts.
we have routinely defined use in ways that make clear that the conduct must be intentional.in bailey united states,for example,we held that the phrase use of a firearm required active employment of the firearm,such as brandishing,displaying,bartering,striking with,and,most obviously,firing or attempting to fire a firearm.at,emphasis deleted.we have similarly held that the use of force requires more than negligent or merely accidental conduct.leocal ashcroft.we concluded that w hile one may,in theory,actively employ something in an accidental manner,it is much less natural to say that a person actively employs physical force against another person by accident.ibid.thus,shooting a gun would be using a firearm in relation to a crime.bailey,supra,at.recklessly leaving a loaded gun in one trunk,which then discharges after being jostled during the car ride,would not.the person who placed that gun in the trunk might have acted recklessly or negligently,but he did not actively employ the gun in a crime.
second,especially in a legal context,force generally connotes the use of violence against another.black law dictionary,for example,defines force to mean p ower,violence,or pressure directed against a person or thing.black law dictionary ed.other dictionaries offer similar definitions,random house dictionary of the english language def.ed.force,when used in law,means unlawful violence threatened or committed against persons or property oxford english dictionary def.i c unlawful violence offered to persons or things and violence,when used in a legal context,also implies an intentional act.see black law dictionary violence is the u njust or unwarranted use of force,usu.accompanied by fury,vehemence,or outrage physical force unlawfully exercised with the intent to harm when a person talks about using force against another,one thinks of intentional acts punching,kicking,shoving,or using a weapon.conversely,one would not naturally call a car accident a use of force,even if people were injured by the force of the accident.as justice holmes observed,e ven a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked.holmes,the common law.
third,context confirms that use of physical force connotes an intentional act.section a a ii prohibitions also include the threatened use of a deadly weapon.in that neighboring prohibition,use most naturally means active employment of the weapon.and it would be odd to say that use in that provision refers to active employment an intentional act when threatening someone with a weapon,but use here is satisfied by merely reckless conduct.see sorenson secretary of treasury,the same words in a statute presumptively have the same meaning.thus,the use of physical force against a family member refers to intentional acts of violence against a family member.
on this interpretation,maine assault statute likely does not qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence and thus does not trigger the prohibition on possessing firearms,g.the maine statute appears to lack,as a required element,the use or attempted use of physical force.maine statute punishes at least some conduct that does not involve the use of physical force.section criminalizes recklessly caus ing bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another person.by criminalizing all reckless conduct,the maine statute captures conduct such as recklessly injuring a passenger by texting while driving resulting in a crash.petitioners charging documents generically recited the statutory language they did not charge intentional,knowing,and reckless harm as alternative counts.accordingly,maine statute appears to treat intentionally,knowingly,or recklessly causing bodily injury or an offensive touching as a single,indivisible offense that is satisfied by recklessness.see mathis united states,ante,at.so petitioners prior assault convictions do not necessarily have as an element the use of physical force against a family member.these prior convictions,therefore,do not qualify as a misdemeanor crime involving domestic violence under federal law,and petitioners convictions accordingly should be reversed.at the very least,to the extent there remains uncertainty over whether maine assault statute is divisible,the court should vacate and remand for the first circuit to determine that statutory interpretation question in the first instance.
to illustrate where i part ways with the majority,consider different mental states with which a person could create and apply force first,a person can create force intentionally or recklessly for example,a person can intentionally throw a punch or a person can crash his car by driving recklessly.second,a person can intentionally or recklessly harm a particular person or object as a result of that force.for example,a person could throw a punch at a particular person thereby intentionally applying force to that person or a person could swing a baseball bat too close to someone thereby recklessly applying force to that person.
these different mental states give rise to three relevant categories of conduct.a person might intentionally create force and intentionally apply that force against an object,punching a punching bag.a person might also intentionally create force but recklessly apply that force against an object,practicing a kick in the air,but recklessly hitting a piece of furniture.or a person could recklessly create force that results in damage,such as the car crash example.
the question before us is what mental state suffices for a use of physical force against a family member.in my view,a use of physical force most naturally refers to cases where a person intentionally creates force and intentionally applies that force against a family member.it also includes at least some cases where a person intentionally creates force but recklessly applies it to a family member.but i part ways with the majority conclusion that purely reckless conduct meaning,where a person recklessly creates force constitutes a use of physical force.in my view,it does not,and therefore,the use of physical force is narrower than most state assault statutes,which punish anyone who recklessly causes physical injury.
to identify the scope of the use of physical force,consider three different types of intentional and reckless force resulting in physical injury.
the paradigmatic case of battery a person intentionally unleashes force and intends that the force will harm a particular person.this might include,for example,punching or kicking someone.both the majority and i agree that these cases constitute a use of physical force under a a ii.
this first category includes all cases where a person intentionally creates force and desires or knows with a practical certainty that that force will cause harm.this is because the law traditionally treats conduct as intended in two circumstances.first,conduct is intentional when the actor desires to produce a specific result.lafave,substantive criminal law a,ed.but conduct is also traditionally deemed intentional when a person acts knowingly that is,he knows with practical certainty that a result will follow from his conduct.see also restatement second of torts,comment b,at if the actor knows that the consequences are certain,or substantially certain,to result from his act,and still goes ahead,he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the result 
to illustrate,suppose a person strikes his friend for the purpose of demonstrating a karate move.the person has no desire to injure his friend,but he knows that the move is so dangerous that he is practically certain his friend will be injured.under the common law,the person intended to injure his friend,even though he acted only with knowledge that his friend would be injured rather than the desire to harm him.thus,even when a person acts knowingly rather than purposefully,this type of conduct is still a use of physical force.
the second category involves a person who intentionally unleashes force that recklessly causes injury.the majority gives two examples 
the angry plate thrower a person throws a plate in anger against the wall near where his wife is standing.ante,at.the plate shatters,and a shard injures her.ibid.
the door slammer a person slams the door shut with his girlfriend following close behind with the effect of catch ing her fingers in the jamb.ibid.
the angry plate thrower and the door slammer both intentionally unleashed physical force,but they did not intend to direct that force at those whom they harmed.thus,they intentionally employed force,but recklessly caused physical injury with that force.the majority believes that these cases also constitute a use of physical force,and i agree.the angry plate thrower has used force against the plate,and the door slammer has used force against the door.
the more difficult question is whether this use of physical force comes within a a ii,which requires that the use of physical force be committed by someone having a familial relationship with the victim.the natural reading of that provision is that the use of physical force must be against a family member.in some cases,the law readily transfers the intent to use force from the object to the actual victim.take the angry plate thrower if a husband throws a plate at the wall near his wife to scare her,that is assault.if the plate breaks and cuts her,it becomes a battery,regardless of whether he intended the plate to make contact with her person.see keeton,dobbs,keeton,owens,prosser and keeton on law of torts,ed.prosser and keeton.similarly,if one person intends to harm a second person but instead unintentionally harms a third,the first person criminal or tortious intent toward the second applies to the third as well.black law dictionary defining doctrine see also lafave,supra,c,at.thus,where a person acts in a violent and patently unjustified manner,the law will often impute that the actor intended to cause the injury resulting from his conduct,even if he actually intended to direct his use of force elsewhere.because we presume that congress legislates against the backdrop of the common law,see astoria fed.sav.loan solimino,these cases would qualify as the use of physical force against a family member 
finally,and most problematic for the majority approach,a person could recklessly unleash force that recklessly causes injury.consider two examples 
the dad knowing that he should not be texting and driving,a father sends a text message to his wife.the distraction causes the father to rear end the car in front of him.his son,who is a passenger,is injured.
the reckless policeman a police officer speeds to a crime scene without activating his emergency lights and siren and careens into another car in an intersection.that accident causes the police officer car to strike another police officer,who was standing at the intersection.see seaton state.app.
in these cases,both the unleashing of the force the car crash and the resulting harm the physical injury were reckless.under the majority reading of a a ii,the husband use d physical force against his son,and the police officer use d physical force against the other officer.
but this category is where the majority and i part company.these examples do not involve the use of physical force under any conventional understanding of use because they do not involve an active employment of something for a particular purpose.see supra,at.in the second category,the actors intentionally use violence against property this is why the majority can plausibly argue that they have used force,even though that force was not intended to harm their family members.see supra,at discussing transferred intent.but when an individual does not engage in any violence against persons or property that is,when physical injuries result from purely reckless conduct there is no use of physical force.
the use of physical force against a family member includes cases where a person intentionally commits a violent act against a family member.and the term includes at least some cases where a person engages in a violent act that results in an unintended injury to a family member.but the term does not include nonviolent,reckless acts that cause physical injury or an offensive touching.accordingly,the majority definition is overbroad.
in reaching its contrary conclusion,the majority confuses various concepts.first,and as discussed,the majority decides that a person who acts recklessly has used physical force against another.ante,at.but that fails to appreciate the distinction between intentional and reckless conduct.a use of physical force requires the intent to cause harm,and the law will impute that intent where the actor knows with a practical certainty that it will cause harm.but the law will not impute that intent from merely reckless conduct.second,and perhaps to rein in its overly broad conception of a use of force,the majority concludes that only volitional acts constitute uses of force,ante,at,and that mere accident s do not,ante,at.these portions of the majority analysis conflate volitional conduct with intentional mens rea and misapprehends the relevant meaning of an accident.
the majority blurs the distinction between recklessness and intentional wrongdoing by overlooking the difference between the mens rea for force and the mens rea for causing harm with that force.the majority says that use does not demand that the person applying force have the purpose or practical certainty that it will cause harm namely,knowledge,as compared with the understanding that it is a substantial and unjustifiable risk that it will do so the standard for recklessness ante,at.put in the language of mens rea,the majority is saying that purposeful,knowing,and reckless applications of force are all equally uses of force.
but the majority fails to explain why mere recklessness in creating force as opposed to recklessness in causing harm with intentional force is sufficient.the majority gives the angry plate thrower and the door slammer as examples of reckless conduct that are uses of physical force,but those examples involve persons who intentionally use force that recklessly causes injuries.ibid.reckless assault,however,extends well beyond intentional force that recklessly causes injury.in states where the model penal code has influence,reckless assault includes any recklessly caused physical injury.see ali,model penal code a.this means that the reckless policeman and the dad are as guilty of assault as the angry plate thrower.see,seaton,at see also people grenier,app.div,upholding an assault conviction where a drunk driver injured his passengers in a car accident.
the majority examples are only those in which a person has intentionally used force,meaning that the person acts with purpose or knowledge that force is involved.ante,at.as a result,the majority overlooks the critical distinction between conduct that is intended to cause harm and conduct that is not intended to cause harm.violently throwing a plate against a wall is a use of force.speeding on a roadway is not.that reflects the fundamental difference between intentional and reckless wrongdoing.an intentional wrong is designed to inflict harm.see restatement second of torts,at.a reckless wrong is not while an act to be reckless must be intended by the actor,the actor does not intend to cause the harm which results from it.comment f,at.
all that remains of the majority analysis is its unsupported conclusion that recklessness looks enough like knowledge,so that the former suffices for a use of force just as the latter does.ante,at.that overlooks a crucial distinction between a practical certainty and a substantial risk.when a person acts with practical certainty,he intentionally produces a result.as explained above,supra,at,when a person acts with knowledge that certain consequences will result,the law imputes to that person the intent to cause those consequences.and the requirement of a practical certainty reflects that,in ordinary life,people rarely have perfect certitude of the facts that they know.but as the probability decreases,the actor conduct loses the character of intent,and becomes mere recklessness.restatement second of torts,comment b,at.and the distinction between intentional and reckless conduct is key for defining use.when a person acts with a practical certainty that he will employ force,he intends to cause harm he has actively employed force for an instrumental purpose,and that is why we can fairly say he uses force.in the case of reckless wrongdoing,however,the injury the actor has caused is just an accidental byproduct of inappropriately risky behavior he has not actively employed force.
in sum,use requires the intent to employ the thing being used.and in law,that intent will be imputed when a person acts with practical certainty that he will actively employ that thing.merely disregarding a risk that a harm will result,however,does not supply the requisite intent.
to limit its definition of use,the majority adds two additional requirements.the conduct must be volitional,and it can not be merely accident al.ante,at.these additional requirements will cause confusion,and neither will limit the breadth of the majority adopted understanding of a use of physical force.
first,the majority requires that the us
