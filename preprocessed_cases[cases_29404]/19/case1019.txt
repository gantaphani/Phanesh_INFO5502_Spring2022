using standard investigative informants,controlled drug buys,and enforcement agents uncovered an conspiracy centered in maine.a narcotic,oxycontin is an product often prescribed to treat chronic pain.putting the operation out of business,agents arrested arthur michael kinsella,a dealer who had smuggled oxycontin into maine.later released on bail,kinsella skipped a hearing and so became a fugitive from justice.shipped back to maine by canadian authorities,kinsella faced charges of conspiring to possess and distribute oxycodone,possessing oxycodone with intent to distribute,and willfully failing to appear in court as required.see and a,and a.
acting on kinsella motion,judge now chief judge woodcock severed the oxycodone counts from the count for trial purposes.after separate juries convicted kinsella across the board,judge woodcock sentenced him to months in prison and months of supervised release.kinsella now challenges his convictions and sentence on several fronts.for openers he argues that multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of his rights.the first incident revolves around the prosecutor questioning of a cooperating witness,christopher hitchcock.caught pushing oxycontin for kinsella,hitchcock cut a deal with the government,concluded his case on favorable woodcock sentenced him to months,well short of the statutory testified against kinsella at the drug trial.kinsella lawyer aggressively confronted hitchcock on,using the plea agreement and light sentence to attack his credibility.during the government redirect,however,hitchcock revealed that judge woodcock had sentenced him.speculating that jurors hearing this must have concluded that judge woodcock had already found hitchcock else would he have imposed such a lenient sentence kinsella insists that justice demands that he get a new trial on the drug counts.he also asserts that certain comments by prosecutors during closing arguments warrant reversal on review.turning to sentencing,kinsella contends that judge woodcock erred in his calculation.after a studied review of the briefs and the record,we affirm kinsella convictions and sentence.
background 
we present the facts in the light most favorable to the guilty verdicts,consistent with record support.see,united states bunchan,cir.
how the charges arose 
the oxycontin conspiracy 
in december,agents with the federal drug enforcement administration dea heard that gregory panther was selling oxycontin pills in maine.hoping to work their way up the ladder,agents had an informant make a controlled buy from panther in march.panther actions led to his arrest in june arrest that also netted panther dealer,richard hopkins.
deciding to cooperate,hopkins identified christopher hitchcock as his supplier and said hitchcock had a canadian supplier.at the agent request,hopkins made a series of recorded calls to hitchcock in the fall of.speaking in code,hopkins asked hitchcock for all the oxycontin that he could get.hitchcock tracked down kinsella,got oxycontin pills,and sold them to hopkins in december.each pill had a cdn stamp on one side indicating that it had been manufactured in canada and an mark on the other suggesting that it was an tablet.
his interest piqued,fred luce,a dea member,then subpoenaed hitchcock phone records.perusing the papers,luce noticed a lot of calls on the day of the controlled buy between hitchcock and kinsella,often following calls between hopkins and hitchcock.hopkins later asked hitchcock for more pills,and hitchcock called kinsella to score some more.the deal never happened,however,because agents arrested hitchcock in february.
seeing the writing on the wall,hitchcock agreed to help the government arrest and convict kinsella.hitchcock had known kinsella for years.they both frequented a bangor,maine racetrack,and they trusted each other.hitchcock had even bailed kinsella out of a previous scrape with the law.
for a year to a year and a half before his february arrest,hitchcock served as a for kinsella and hopkins.every weeks,hitchcock got pills from kinsella his sole supplier and sold them to hopkins his sole customer at around a pill.conceding that he had trouble remembering exact dates,hitchcock said that sometimes more than weeks passed between transactions,and that one time kinsella handed him pills to sell.turning the drug money over to kinsella,hitchcock occasionally got and a free meal for his work.
with hitchcock on board,dea agents contacted the royal canadian mounted police to see what information they had on kinsella.getting his canadian license plate number,agents pieced together that kinsella minivan had crossed the border into maine a couple of hours before the december drug deal.phone records revealed that kinsella and hitchcock had called each other right around the time the deal transpired.that is not called each other a lot,times,in fact,between july right around the time hopkins fingered hitchcock as his supplier and february when agents arrested hitchcock.agents had hitchcock call kinsella over the next month or so to set up another deal.during these recorded conversations,the two used code words.birthday party meant drug deal.more people meant more pills.how much a dinner plate meant how much per pill.
looking to do another deal in march,kinsella asked hitchcock on tape whether it was cool or what.yeah,hitchcock said,should be no problem.i assume there going to be or at most,kinsella said later.we got to go to,though,he added.hitchcock and agent luce knew what kinsella was doing he was confirming that he would hand hitchcock oxycontin pills to sell at a price of per pill.convinced that they had a meeting of the minds,kinsella told hitchcock that they should meet up at a bangor burger king at on march.
armed with this information,the dea asked local police to help nab kinsella before he got to the burger king.at about on march,a police officer spotted kinsella minivan,saw him tailgating another vehicle,and pulled him over.admitting to the moving violation,kinsella told the officer he had come from canada to pick his sister up at the bangor airport.in fact,his sister had left maine and flown back home some hours earlier.kinsella also said that he had no illegal drugs and was not taking any prescription medicines.a search of his minivan,however,turned up a leather organizer tucked in between the front seats.finding a prescription bottle in kinsella name inside,the officer counted green pills,each marked cdn on one side and on the other.doing an,kinsella now said that the pills were his.he also handed over his cell phone,which had hitchcock number saved in the address book.
arrested and booked that night,kinsella wound up in jail.calling his mother,kinsella asked her to give hitchcock phone number to his brother,rick kinsella.t ell rick to tell hitchcock what happened,kinsella said.kinsella apparently wanted hitchcock to bail him out.calling rick the next day,kinsella heard that no one had gotten in touch with hitchcock.d o call him no more,kinsella told rick.h e would have the money to bail me out anyway.kinsella jailers recorded each call.
a magistrate judge eventually released kinsella on personal recognizance in april.the release order forbade kinsella from leaving maine,required him to report to a pretrial services officer pso,and commanded him to appear at scheduled proceedings.the order also alerted him to the penalties he might incur if he violated these terms.driving all this home at a meeting three days later,pso wade maddox gave kinsella a business card with contact information and told him to check in with probation every week.
that same month,a federal grand jury indicted kinsella on two counts.count charged that kinsella conspired to possess and distribute substances from january to june.see a and.count alleged that kinsella possessed with intent to distribute substances on march,date of his arrest.see a.kinsella pleaded not guilty at his arraignment.
claiming that he needed to return to canada for medical treatment,kinsella asked the magistrate judge in may to modify his release conditions so he could live there.he promised that he would not miss any court hearings.releasing him on bail,the magistrate judge still required kinsella to appear at scheduled proceedings and to stay in touch with the pso.kinsella promised he would but did not keep his word after the grand jury returned a superseding indictment extending the conspiratorial period to december,kinsella stopped calling probation though pso maddox did not turn him in and missed a scheduled.kinsella had known about the,his lawyer,matthew erickson,had told him,stressing that kinsella had to be kinsella stayed in canada anyway.
declaring him a fugitive from justice,the magistrate judge signed a warrant for kinsella arrest.erickson called kinsella that day and learned that kinsella had made no effort to cross the border into the united states.mentioning the arrest warrant,erickson told kinsella that an indictment for failing to appear would no doubt it did,three months later.apparently unmoved by all this,kinsella chose not to turn himself in.
canadian authorities placed kinsella in custody in october.challenging his extradition under that country laws,kinsella lost an appeal and returned to the united states in september,in cuffs and escorted by mounties.facing a superseding indictment that added a count to the old drug charges,kinsella asked judge woodcock to sever the drug counts from the count for trial.granting the motion,judge woodcock ordered a trial on the count first,followed by a trial on the drug charges.
how the trials unfolded 
thanks to some pretrial stipulations,the only issue at play during the trial was whether kinsella had willfully failed to appear at the there was enough for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had.kinsella repeated pledges to return for scheduled proceedings practically leapt from the pages of the transcripts,which the lawyers had stipulated into evidence.the jury also heard from pso maddox,who testified about discussing the release conditions with kinsella,handing him a card with a number to use in checking in with probation,and hearing nothing from him leading up to and following his at the scheduled.attorney erickson testified about notifying kinsella of the date and time of the,reminding him he had to be there,giving him a on the arrest warrant and the charge after his,and hearing how he had made no effort to cross the border to make the and was bent on fighting extradition.cinching matters,a deputy marshal testified about how the mounties hauled a kinsella back to the united states two years after he had skipped the.
ultimately,though,kinsella does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence against him.instead he attacks the prosecutor closing argument,which,he says,represented an improper appeal to the jurors emotions.after judge woodcock instructed the jury that the government had the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that closing arguments are not evidence,the prosecutor began his summation with this statement 
this case is important because we all can appreciate the need for defendants who are charged with crimes to appear in court.our courts have a very important function in the united states,and they can not carry out their responsibilities if defendants in criminal cases are allowed to ignore the promises that they make to judges,to disobey court orders,and to fail to appear in violation of the law.
defense counsel did not object.building to a crescendo,the prosecutor later stressed that a person who shows up to a hearing two hours or even two days late may not be willful,but a person who fails to call his pso,who fails to,who fights extradition and then only returns in cuffs years after his has willfully failed to appear in court.the jury must have found kinsella guilty after deliberating for about minutes.
the drug trial 
a trial on the drug charges followed,and the evidence against kinsella was strong phone records,recorded calls,and testimony from hitchcock,agent luce,and the arresting officer helped nail down his guilt.kinsella does not contend that the evidence could not support conviction.instead his claims target the prosecutor questioning of hitchcock and the prosecutor closing argument,so we highlight here only those facts needed to put these issues into proper perspective.
throughout the trial,defense counsel never missed an opportunity to paint hitchcock as a witness who had set kinsella up to avoid a sentence.hitchcock needed he would not be left holding the bag,kinsella lawyer said in her opening statement.pulling no punches,defense counsel asked hitchcock on whether he had cooperated with the government so he would have to do as much time.yes,hitchcock said,conceding,too,that he was testifying for the prosecution as part of his plea agreement and that he could have received a rather than a sentence had he not cooperated.hitchcock also admitted that he would do anything to get his old life back.
on redirect the prosecutor tried to focus on the sentencing process.asking hitchcock to recall defense counsel questions about the sentence and the cooperation agreement with the government,the prosecutor queried do you remember where you were sentenced,where your sentence took place right here,hitchcock said,in this courthouse.the prosecutor then this is the allegedly offending hitchcock recalled who had sentenced him.judge woodcock,hitchcock replied.and who decided what your sentence was the prosecutor inquired.the judge,hitchcock said.kinsella lawyer neither objected to the prosecutor questions nor moved to strike hitchcock responses.instead she confirmed with kinsella on that the judge had decided his sentence after the government had agreed to ask for less time.
before closing arguments,judge woodcock cautioned the jurors to consider hitchcock testimony with great care.cooperating witnesses,he said,are not always sometimes spin lies about what others have done to save themselves jail time,so the jurors had to consider whether hitchcock had an ax to grind against kinsella or had received any reward for cooperating with the prosecution.hitchcock guilty plea was fair game in assessing his credibility,judge woodcock said,but the jurors could not consider his plea as evidence against kinsella in any way.judge woodcock also told them that counsel arguments are not evidence and that they were the sole triers of fact and determiners of witness credibility.
in closing argument the prosecutor hammered home the evidence against controlled drug buys,hitchcock pinning kinsella to the crimes,the coded conversations about oxycontin,kinsella agreeing to slip hitchcock or so oxycontin pills on march at a bangor burger king,kinsella lying to a police officer that evening about having to drive to a bangor airport to pick up his sister,the officer seizing pills from him after kinsella lied about having no pills.regarding the recorded jailhouse calls,the prosecutor said 
kinsella knows chris hitchcock he knows the number and he wants someone to call chris.first and foremost,if kinsella can the oxy,theoretically,he could get some money if he needed to make bail or anything else of that nature.but he knows chris he knows the number and he provides the same number that been called all along.
there was,in fact,no evidence that kinsella had tried to deal oxycontin from jail.but defense counsel did not object.instead she argued in her closing that sloppy investigative work caused the police to arrest an innocent man.hitchcock had told a pack of lies to avoid a sentence,defense counsel said.hitchcock needed a patsy someone he could roll over kinsella would do just fine.not so,the prosecutor said in his rebuttal closing argument.there no cheating here,and there no conspiracy to frame kinsella.after about five hours of deliberations,the jury convicted kinsella on the counts.
kinsella filed a timely motion.see.b.his lead argument was that the prosecutor crossed the line by prompting hitchcock to say that judge woodcock had sentenced comment kinsella insists suggested to the jury that the judge who had given hitchcock a sentence out of a possible maximum sentence of years had believed every word hitchcock said on the stand.calling kinsella claim odd and elusive,judge woodcock ruled that the prosecutor never tried to put a stamp of judicial approval on hitchcock testimony and never even intimated that the jury should find one.the prosecutor simply wanted to rehabilitate hitchcock,judge woodcock stressed.invoking the saying once burned,twice shy,judge woodcock found that this evidence implied that hitchcock would think twice before perjuring himself in front of a judge who had already sentenced him to prison.finding no caselaw to bolster the fanciful notion that the prosecutor had somehow vouched for the judge knowledge of hitchcock credibility,judge woodcock denied kinsella motion.
how the sentence worked out 
acting under the federal sentencing guidelines,judge woodcock set out to compute the relevant guideline sentencing range.defense counsel and the prosecutor started sparring over whether each oxycontin pill contained or milligrams of oxycodone.testing a randomly selected sample of oxycontin tablets taken from kinsella,a dea chemist had put the number at milligrams.believing that that issue might not matter depending on what other findings he made,judge woodcock decided to focus first on the length of the conspiracy and the amount of drugs involved.
the probation office presentence investigation report had noted that the conspiracy spanned.and,after commenting that hitchcock had peddled kinsella drugs for months,the report pegged the conspiracy length at months.kinsella asked judge woodcock to find a conspiracy.but he never asked the judge to the judge never the period fit on the.finding hitchcock completely credible,judge woodcock put the conspiracy length at months because he thought that hitchcock good faith estimate about a month conspiracy was somewhat sketchy.
zeroing in on hitchcock kinsella had handed him pills every weeks,though sometimes they went more than weeks between deals and deal involved woodcock settled on numbers favorable to kinsella total transactions during the year,involving pills each and involving,which netted tablets.but he quickly added that he easily could have picked less transaction every weeks or so,for example,with a deal added to the mix.
in any event,if each pill weighed milligrams,judge woodcock said,then kinsella was responsible for grams of oxycodone x milligrams or grams,which converted into a marijuana equivalent of kilograms,which resulted in a base offense level of.see ussg c,cmt.b directing courts to convert quantities of certain drugs into equivalent units of marijuana for sentencing purposes,and cmt.e laying out the drug equivalency tables.even if the pills weighed milligrams apiece,kinsella base offense level would still be,defense counsel conceded after the judge that issue dropped out of consideration.judge woodcock then added levels for obstruction of justice,resulting in a total offense level of.given the lack of any meaningful criminal history,judge woodcock calculations produced a guideline sentencing range of months.the judge then sentenced him to months in prison plus three years of supervised release.
further details will be noted as needed.
with pretty strong cases against him,kinsella does not attack the adequacy of the evidence underlying either conviction.instead he contends that three instances of alleged prosecutorial on the prosecutor redirect of hitchcock and comments at each him of his rights.he also insists that judge woodcock erred in his calculation and therefore selected an overly harsh sentence.we are not persuaded.
prosecutorial misconduct 
in our adversarial system of justice,litigants must alert trial courts to.united states griffin,cir.the reasons behind this rule are simple.a timely objection lets the trial judge correct any errors to avoid needless reversals and remands.see,united states dominguez benitez.it also deters sandbagging lawyers from hiding objections below so that they can surface them on appeal if the jury does not acquit.see,united states taylor,cir.like most rules,this rule has an exception a defendant can pursue an unpreserved claim on appeal under the standard.see,united states eisom,cir.that standard has three essential factors and one discretionary component.the essentials are error that is obvious and affected the outcome of the defendant case.see,united states riccio,cir.even if a defendant can show all of this,we have the discretion not to intervene if we conclude that the error does not distort the fairness or integrity of lower court proceedings in some extreme way.see,united states moran,cir.
because kinsella trial lawyer failed to preserve the issues through timely objections,the standard controls.the only slight wrinkle is that defense counsel did raise the issue in a motion.but that is still an unpreserved claim,so the rule applies here too.see united states brandao,cir.ultimately,though,we see no reason to upset either verdict.united states shoup,cir noting that a ppellate reversal for plain error is extremely rare,adding that a defendant is not entitled to a perfect trial.
redirect of trial 
kinsella complains about the prosecutor prompting hitchcock to say on redirect that judge woodcock had sentenced him in the same bangor kinsella says conveyed to the jury that judge woodcock had already accepted hitchcock allegations as gospel.to back up his claim,kinsella contends that judge woodcock once burned,twice shy hitchcock would not perjure himself before the judge who had sentenced that the jury could infer that hitchcock told the truth because the judge had already heard his story and would spot any lies.we see no error here,plain or otherwise.
at every turn,kinsella counsel urged the jury to conclude that hitchcock was a liar who did the government bidding under the plea agreement to skirt a sentence.to counteract this implication,the prosecutor used redirect to correct any impression that the government had decided hitchcock rightly so.
contrary to kinsella contention,we are not certain that the prosecutor question do you remember who sentenced you sought to elicit the judge name rather than the fact that a judge,not the government,had selected hitchcock sentence.regardless,the prosecutor never so much as hinted that judge woodcock had already heard hitchcock narrative or had found him credible,and the judge later instruction that hitchcock may have lied to save himself undermines kinsella claim.also,the prosecutor did not follow up on the defense recross of again intimated that hitchcock light sentence flowed from his cooperation did not touch on this supposedly improper issue during closing arguments.finally,we see no problem with judge woodcock once burned,twice shy statement the plea into the prosecutor right to charge hitchcock with perjury if he testified falsely,and one can properly conclude that a witness who has already agreed to testify against others would likely not jeopardize the potential benefits of providing such it is testifying untruthfully united states carr,cir.viewed in this light,we believe the prosecutor did not overstep his bounds here.see united states sanchez,cir not error for the prosecutor to stress during and closing argument that the trial judge,judge young,not the government,would ultimately determine the sentence of each cooperating witness,holding that the prosecutor actions were invited by defense counsel characterization of the sentencing process and did not stray beyond the limits of fair advocacy.consequently,there is no error at all,let alone plain error 
closing trial 
kinsella also accuses the prosecutor of misconduct during closing argument in the trial.as he sees things,the prosecutor talked about issues having nothing to do with his guilt or innocence,riling up the jurors by saying that this is an important case because our courts can not function if criminal defendants can ignore promises made to judges,disregard court orders,and fail to appear as required.kinsella trial lawyer did not object,so we review for plain error,asking the usual questions,including whether kinsella has shown both error and prejudice.see,united states olano.he has not.
prosecutors can talk about the importance of the case in summation.united states cotter,cir emphasis added discussing the ba
