wilfredo appeals from the district court denial of his motion to reduce sentence pursuant to c.under the unique circumstances of this case,we conclude that the prudent course is to remand for the district court to apply its own administrative directive.
in may,rodríguez pled guilty to participating in a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute between fifteen and fifty kilograms of cocaine.see a,b a ii.rodríguez,who was an american airlines employee at the time,utilized commercial flights to transport large amounts of cocaine from puerto rico to the continental united states.rodríguez plea agreement indicates that he was the leader of the drug trafficking conspiracy,which continued for approximately ten years and involved more than kilograms of cocaine.in october,the district court,consistent with the parties joint recommendation,sentenced rodríguez to months imprisonment.
in november,rodríguez filed a motion to reduce his sentence,citing an april amendment to the sentencing guidelines amendment,which was given retroactive effect by the sentencing commission.amendment reduced the base offense level bol for certain drug crimes by two levels,effective november.see app.c,amend.at the time of his sentencing,rodríguez guideline sentencing range gsr was based on the bol of.under amendment,however,rodríguez bol would be.see c.
amendment,as expected,generated thousands of sentence reduction motions.indeed,in the district of puerto rico alone,more than such motions were decided before the end of.see sentencing comm n,drug guidelines amendment retroactivity data report,table.on november,just five days after amendment effective date,the puerto rico district court issued an administrative directive ad outlining a procedure for handling the impending onslaught of motions.under ad,all motions to reduce sentence based on amendment are automatically referred to a magistrate judge for initial screening.at this preliminary stage,the magistrate judge evaluates only the defendant potential eligibility for a sentence reduction.a defendant is not eligible if,for example,the relevant amendment does not apply to him or does not lower his gsr.see a.if the magistrate judge determines that a given defendant may be eligible,the government,defense counsel,and probation officer shall meet to discuss the case in an attempt to reach a stipulation.in the event that the participants are unable to agree,they are directed to file memoranda with the district court.the court is then tasked with resolving the issue.ad expressly provides that it is not intended to confer individual rights to litigants,nor limit the discretion of judicial officers.
in the present case,on november,the district judge sua sponte denied rodríguez motion before the magistrate judge had the opportunity to make an eligibility determination pursuant to ad.the court explained that rodríguez was the maximum leader of an elaborate drug trafficking organization that operated for many years packaging and transporting over kilos of cocaine.about a month later,the magistrate judge,to whom the motion had automatically been referred under ad,issued a report and recommendation indicating that rodríguez may be eligible for a sentence reduction and therefore the matter is referred to a united states district judge.on december,the district court,in a brief text order,rejected the report and recommendation,stating that rodríguez motion has been denied and citing its own prior order.on appeal,rodríguez challenges the district court orders denying his motion for sentence reduction,arguing,among other things,that the court failed to apply its own administrative directive.
the parties first dispute whether rodríguez has filed a timely notice of appeal.under fed.app.b,such a notice must,absent an extension,be filed within fourteen days of the judgment or order being appealed.in his opening brief,rodríguez cited a february,form for selection of counsel reflecting rodríguez request to proceed pro se to establish the timeliness of his appeal.as the government points out,however,that document was filed well over fourteen days after both of the relevant district court orders,entered on november and december,respectively.the government moved for summary dismissal,but we reserved the issue of timeliness for the merits panel and directed the parties to address in their response and reply briefs whether any filings other than the february form might have provided timely and sufficient notice.
as requested,the government preemptively argued in its brief that no other documents filed by rodríguez were both timely under rule and specified the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed,as required by fed.app.c b.in so arguing,the government discussed a december,form for selection of counsel.that document listed the applicable district court docket number and requested that hector be appointed to represent rodríguez on appeal.at the time of this filing,however,rodríguez had another appeal pending in this court stemming from the same district court case.in that appeal,the details of which are not relevant here,rodríguez had challenged the district court denial of his motion for relief under.as the government notes,other than listing the district court docket number,rodríguez december filing contained no information about the judgment or order being appealed.see fed.app.c b.accordingly,the clerk office docketed the form in rodríguez appeal.we construed the document as a motion for appointment of counsel in that appeal and proceeded to deny the motion.
ultimately,we need not decide whether the december form satisfied rule.even assuming that it did not,rodríguez subsequently clarified his intent to appeal the district court denial of his motion for sentence reduction in two pro se letters dated january and january,respectively the first of these documents was filed less than fourteen days after the district court december order rejecting the magistrate judge report and recommendation.this ruling was an appealable final order.see united states akinola,cir.while not expressly styled as a notice of appeal,the january letter plainly evidence d rodríguez intention to appeal the denial of his motion to reduce sentence.campiti matesanz,cir.accordingly,the document satisfies the liberal construction of rule that we afford pro se litigants.see delong dickhaut,cir.campiti,at 
in light of the unique circumstances presented by this appeal,remand to the district court for it to apply ad is the prudent course.we have ordered similar remands in at least two prior decisions.see united states ahrendt,cir.united states godin,cir.godin and ahrendt involved challenges to the district court refusal to group certain prior offenses for purposes of calculating the gsr.when the defendants had been sentenced,the applicable guideline provided that prior offenses were to be counted separately unless they a occurred on the same occasion,b were part of a single common scheme or plan,or c were consolidated for trial or sentencing.ahrendt,at quoting a cmt.in both cases,we concluded that the district court had correctly applied that guideline provision.while the appeals were pending,however,the sentencing commission adopted a amendment under which prior offenses were to be counted as one if the sentences were imposed on the same day.id.at quoting a emphasis omitted.in both godin and ahrendt,the defendants prior offenses would have been grouped together under this amended provision.we recognized that,because the amendment was,neither defendant was entitled to a remand because neither could show that an error occurred at sentencing.id.at.notwithstanding the lack of error,we deemed it prudent to remand,to allow the sentencing judge the opportunity to consider the commission current thinking,as reflected in the amendment,godin,at.
we think that the present appeal calls for a similar result.on november,facing the prospect of thousands of sentence reduction motions,the district of puerto rico wisely issued ad to assure the orderly and consistent processing of those filings.rodríguez moved to reduce his sentence less than two weeks later.indee
