rosalind herman was convicted,after a jury trial,of conspiracy,willful violation of the investment advisers act,wire fraud,and corruptly impeding the administration of internal revenue laws.these charges arose from a scheme in which herman and a solicited funds for purported investment in a hedge fund management company.rather than investing the money they obtained,totaling more than million,herman and her confederate used it for personal expenses.herman also allegedly defrauded the internal revenue service by claiming false business deductions and failing to file tax returns in some years,resulting in almost million in unreported income.after the jury returned its guilty verdict,the district court sentenced herman to months imprisonment.on appeal,herman raises two narrow claims,one relating to her convictions and a second challenging her sentence.because we find each of these claims unavailing,we affirm.
we begin with herman challenge to her convictions,which is predicated entirely upon purported deficiencies in the district court instructions on the reasonable doubt standard.because herman failed to object to the instructions below,we review only for plain error.see united states van anh,cir.in order to satisfy this demanding standard,herman must establish that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected her substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at first alteration in original citation omitted.herman claim falters on the first element.we perceive no error,much less plain error,in the district court reasonable doubt instructions.
as an initial matter,we have repeatedly noted that reasonable doubt does not require definition.united states,cir.thus,an instruction which uses the words reasonable doubt without further definition adequately apprises the jury of the proper burden of proof.united states ademaj,cir.citation omitted see also victor nebraska,t he constitution neither prohibits trial courts from defining reasonable doubt nor requires them to do so as a matter of course.where,however,the court does undertake to define the term,it can not employ a definition that creates a reasonable likelihood of leading the jury to believe that it can convict on some lesser standard of proof.van anh,at citation omitted.with that said,the constitution does not require any particular form of words.victor,at.the district court,thus,retains significant discretion in formulating its instructions,so long as it correctly conve ys the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.id.citation omitted.
here,herman takes issue with the following passage from the court instructions 
t he burden of proof here is not common sense,of course you can use your common sense,the burden of proof here is proof beyond a reasonable doubt,and there must be no guesswork,no speculation,no maybe this happened,perhaps,possibly,it could have,not even that it likely that this or that happened,it has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
herman makes five specific arguments as to why the reasonable doubt instructions were deficient.four are easily disposed of.first,while herman correctly notes that the court was not required to define reasonable doubt,neither was it prohibited from doing so.see victor,at.second,once it decided to provide a definition,the court was not bound to use one of the specific formulations that herman now proposes.see id.third,the mere fact that the district court gave a negative definition,explaining reasonable doubt by reference to what it is not,does not,in itself,require reversal.united states devincent,cir.fourth,the court allusion to the jury use of common sense,while perhaps unnecessary,did not constitute error.united states munson,cir.
herman fifth claim of instructional error is the most substantial,but it too ultimately fails.herman posits that,by presenting a choice between guesswork and speculation on the one hand,and reasonable doubt on the other,the court effectively reduced the government burden of proof.this is because the instructions could have led the jury to believe that it could return a guilty verdict so long as it found the government proof was.unfortunately for herman,we have previously upheld the use of language very similar to that at issue here.see united states burnette,cir.the jury must never find the defendant guilty on mere suspicion,conjecture or guess,vacated on other grounds,united states whiting,cir.a defendant is never to be convicted on the basis of mere conjecture,surmise or guesswork.
any suggestion that the jury may have been misled is further undermined by the court repeated emphasis that proof beyond a reasonable doubt was required for conviction.indeed,the court mentioned the reasonable doubt standard no fewer than nine times in its instructions to the jury.and it introduced the concept on the very first day of trial,when it made clear that herman sat before the jury as an innocent woman who could only be convicted based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.in this context,we perceive no reasonable likelihood that the language cited by herman led the jury to apply a lesser standard of proof.see van anh,at holding that instruction adequately communicated the government burden where the court mentioned that burden ten times and stressed the presumption of innocence.
we turn now to herman claim of sentencing error.the parties do not contest the district court calculation of the guideline sentencing range gsr as to months.after arriving at this gsr,the court proceeded to vary downward to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants.it ultimately imposed an incarcerative sentence of months,a full two years below the bottom of the gsr.
herman now argues that,notwithstanding this sentence,the court erred by refusing to grant,in addition,a downward departure on two alternative bases herman own physical impairments,see and her responsibilities caring for family members,see id.herman characterizes her claim as a challenge to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.see united states del valle rodr√≠guez,cir.the substantive dimension of our sentencing review focuses on the duration of the sentence in light of the totality of the circumstances.in any event,whether the issue is framed as substantive or procedural,we review the district court discretionary refusal to depart from the gsr for reasonableness.united states anonymous defendant,cir.see also united states maguire,cir.d iscretionary refusals to vary or depart are open to reasonableness review in accordance with an abuse of discretion standard.and herman faces an even steeper climb than most defendants seeking to establish sentencing error.this is because i t is a rare sentence that will prove vulnerable to a defendant claim of substantive unreasonableness.united states king,cir.we apply these principles in turn to each of herman purported grounds for departure.
the guidelines provide that a n extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to depart downward from the gsr.we have,however,clarified that d epartures based upon health problems are discouraged and can only be justified if the medical problems are present in unusual kind or degree.united states leblanc,cir.citation omitted.thus,in order to be entitled to a departure,a defendant must establish that her life would be threatened or shortened by virtue of being incarcerated or that the bureau of prisons would be unable to adequately accommodate her medical needs.id.at.
here,the evidence of herman physical impairment falls well short of this bar.herman cites portions of the presentence investigation report psr indicating that she is tall but weighs only pounds she claimed to have been diagnosed with malnourishment and dehydration during her spring trial and she reported suffering from tachycardia an elevated heart rate,resulting in blood pressure fluctuations and difficulty breathing.herman,who was years old at the time of sentencing,conclusorily asserts that,in light of these conditions,she is unlikely to survive imprisonment.but the psr also indicated that herman does not regularly see a
