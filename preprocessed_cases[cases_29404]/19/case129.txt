arizona prisoners may raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel only in state collateral proceedings,not on direct review.in petitioner martinez first state collateral proceeding,his counsel did not raise such a claim.on federal habeas review with new counsel,martinez argued that he received ineffective assistance both at trial and in his first state collateral proceeding.he also claimed that he had a constitutional right to an effective attorney in the collateral proceeding because it was the first place to raise his claim of ineffective assistance at trial.the district court denied the petition,finding that arizona preclusion rule was an adequate and independent ground barring federal review,and that under coleman thompson,the attorney errors in the postconviction proceeding did not qualify as cause to excuse the procedural default.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed.
where,under state law,claims must be raised in an collateral proceeding,a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing those claims if,in the collateral proceeding,there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.
a given that the precise question here is whether ineffective assistance in an collateral proceeding on an claim may provide cause for a procedural default in a federal habeas proceeding,this is not the case to resolve the question left open in coleman whether a prisoner has a constitutional right to effective counsel in collateral proceedings.however,to protect prisoners with potentially legitimate claims,it is necessary to recognize a narrow exception to coleman unqualified statement that an attorney ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default,namely,that inadequate assistance of counsel at collateral proceedings may establish cause.
b a federal court can hear martinez claim only if he can establish cause to excuse the procedural default and prejudice from a violation of federal law.coleman held that a postconviction attorney negligence does not qualify as,because the attorney is the prisoner agent,and the principal bears the risk of his agent negligent conduct,maples thomas,ante,at.however,in coleman,counsel alleged error was on appeal from an collateral proceeding.thus,his claims had been addressed by the state habeas trial court.this marks a key difference between collateral proceedings and other collateral proceedings.here,where the collateral proceeding is the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise the claim,the collateral proceeding is the equivalent of a prisoner direct appeal as to that claim because the state habeas court decides the claim merits,no other court has addressed the claim,and defendants are generally ill equipped to represent themselves where they have no brief from counsel and no court opinion addressing their claim.halbert michigan.an attorney errors during an appeal on direct review may provide cause to excuse a procedural default for if the attorney appointed by the state is ineffective,the prisoner has been denied fair process and the opportunity to comply with the state procedures and obtain an adjudication on the merits of his claim.without adequate representation in an collateral proceeding,a prisoner will have similar difficulties vindicating a substantial claim.the same would be true if the state did not appoint an attorney for the collateral proceeding.a prisoner inability to present an claim is of particular concern because the right to effective trial counsel is a bedrock principle in this nation justice system.
allowing a federal habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assistance at trial when an attorney errors or an attorney absence caused a procedural default in an collateral proceeding acknowledges,as an equitable matter,that a collateral proceeding,if undertaken with no counsel or ineffective counsel,may not have been sufficient to ensure that proper consideration was given to a substantial claim.it thus follows that,when a state requires a prisoner to raise a i claim of ineffective assistance at trial in a collateral proceeding,a prisoner may establish cause for a procedural default of such claim in two circumstances where the state courts did not appoint counsel in the collateral proceeding for an claim and where appointed counsel in the collateral proceeding,where that claim should have been raised,was ineffective under strickland washington.to overcome the default,a prisoner must also demonstrate that the underlying claim is substantial.most jurisdictions have procedures to ensure counsel is appointed for substantial claims.it is likely that such attorneys are qualified to perform,and do perform,according to prevailing professional norms.and where that is so,states may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.
c this limited qualification to coleman does not implicate stare decisis concerns.coleman holding remains true except as to collateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance at trial.the holding in this case should not put a significant strain on state resources.a state facing the question of cause for an apparent default may answer that the claim is insubstantial.the limited circumstances recognized here also reflect the importance of the right to effective assistance at trial.other claims may not implicate the same fundamentals of the adversary system.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of does not speak to the question presented here,and thus does not bar martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for a procedural default.
whether martinez attorney in his first collateral proceeding was ineffective and whether his claim is substantial,as well as the question of prejudice,are questions that remain open for a decision on remand.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
the state of arizona does not permit a convicted person alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel to raise that claim on direct review.instead,the prisoner must bring the claim in state collateral proceedings.in the instant case,however,petitioner postconviction counsel did not raise the claim in the first collateral proceeding,and,indeed,filed a statement that,after reviewing the case,she found no meritorious claims helpful to petitioner.on federal habeas review,and with new counsel,petitioner sought to argue he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and in the first phase of his state collateral proceeding.because the state collateral proceeding was the first place to challenge his conviction on grounds of ineffective assistance,petitioner maintained he had a constitutional right to an effective attorney in the collateral proceeding.while petitioner frames the question in this case as a constitutional one,a more narrow,but still dispositive,formulation is whether a federal habeas court may excuse a procedural default of an claim when the claim was not properly presented in state court due to an attorney errors in an collateral proceeding.
a jury convicted petitioner,luis mariano martinez,of two counts of sexual conduct with a minor under the age of.the prosecution introduced a videotaped forensic interview with the victim,martinez stepdaughter.it also put in evidence the victim nightgown,with traces of martinez dna.as part of his defense,martinez introduced evidence of the victim recantations,including testimony from the victim grandmother and mother and a second videotaped interview in which the victim denied any abuse.the victim also denied any abuse when she testified at trial.app.to pet.for cert.to explain the inconsistencies,a prosecution expert testified that recantations of accusations are caused often by reluctance on the part of the victim mother to lend support to the child claims.pet.for cert.after considering the conflicting evidence,the jury convicted martinez.he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for years.app.to pet.for cert.
the state appointed a new attorney to represent martinez in his direct appeal.pet.for cert.she made numerous arguments on martinez behalf,including a claim that the evidence was insufficient and that newly discovered evidence warranted a new trial.app.to pet.for cert.arizona law,however,did not permit her to argue on direct appeal that trial counsel was ineffective.state spreitz.arizona instead requires claims of ineffective assistance at trial to be reserved for state collateral proceedings.
while martinez direct appeal was pending,the attorney began a state collateral proceeding by filing a notice of relief.martinez schriro.rule crim.proc.a.despite initiating this proceeding,counsel made no claim trial counsel was ineffective and later filed a statement asserting she could find no colorable claims at all,at.state smith.
the state trial court hearing the collateral proceeding gave martinez days to file a pro se petition in support of postconviction relief and to raise any claims he believed his counsel overlooked,at see smith,supra,at,at.martinez did not respond.he later alleged that he was unaware of the ongoing collateral proceedings and that counsel failed to advise him of the need to file a pro se petition to preserve his rights.the state trial court dismissed the action for postconviction relief,in effect affirming counsel determination that martinez had no meritorious claims,at.the arizona court of appeals affirmed martinez conviction,and the arizona supreme court denied review,at.
about a year and a half later,martinez,now represented by new counsel,filed a second notice of postconviction relief in the arizona trial court,at.martinez claimed his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to challenge the prosecution evidence.he argued,for example,that his trial counsel should have objected to the expert testimony explaining the victim recantations or should have called an expert witness in rebuttal.martinez also faulted trial counsel for not pursuing an exculpatory explanation for the dna on the nightgown.app.to brief in opposition to.martinez petition was dismissed,in part in reliance on an arizona rule barring relief on a claim that could have been raised in a previous collateral proceeding,at see.rule crim.proc.a.martinez,the theory went,should have asserted the claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in his first notice for postconviction relief.the arizona court of appeals agreed.it denied martinez relief because he failed to raise his claims in the first collateral proceeding,at.the arizona supreme court declined to review martinez appeal.
martinez then sought relief in united states district court for the district of arizona,where he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,again raising the claims.martinez acknowledged the state courts denied his claims by relying on a state procedural rule,which,under the doctrine of procedural default,would prohibit a federal court from reaching the merits of the claims.see,wainwright sykes.he could overcome this hurdle to federal review,martinez argued,because he had cause for the default his first postconviction counsel was ineffective in failing to raise any claims in the first notice of postconviction relief and in failing to notify martinez of her actions.see,at.
on the magistrate judge recommendation,the district court denied the petition,ruling that arizona preclusion rule was an adequate and independent ground to bar federal review.app.to pet.for cert.martinez had not shown cause to excuse the procedural default,the district court reasoned,because under coleman thompson,an attorney errors in a postconviction proceeding do not qualify as cause for a default.see,at.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed.the court of appeals relied on general statements in coleman that,absent a right to counsel in a collateral proceeding,an attorney errors in the proceeding do not establish cause for a procedural default.expanding on the district court opinion,the court of appeals,citing coleman,noted the general rule that there is no constitutional right to counsel in collateral proceedings,at.the court of appeals recognized that coleman reserved ruling on whether there is an exception to this rule in those cases where state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction.at quoting coleman,supra,at.it concluded,nevertheless,that the controlling cases established no basis for the exception.certiorari was granted.
coleman thompson,supra,left open,and the court of appeals in this case addressed,a question of constitutional law whether a prisoner has a right to effective counsel in collateral proceedings which provide the first occasion to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial.these proceedings can be called,for purposes of this opinion,collateral proceedings.coleman had suggested,though without holding,that the constitution may require states to provide counsel in collateral proceedings because in these cases state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction.at.as coleman noted,this makes the collateral proceeding a prisoner one and only appeal as to an claim,at emphasis deleted internal quotation marks omitted,and this may justify an exception to the constitutional rule that there is no right to counsel in collateral proceedings.see,at douglas california,holding states must appoint counsel on a prisoner first appeal.
this is not the case,however,to resolve whether that exception exists as a constitutional matter.the precise question here is whether ineffective assistance in an collateral proceeding on a claim of ineffective assistance at trial may provide cause for a procedural default in a federal habeas proceeding.to protect prisoners with a potentially legitimate claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel,it is necessary to modify the unqualified statement in coleman that an attorney ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.this opinion qualifies coleman by recognizing a narrow exception inadequate assistance of counsel at collateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner procedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at trial.
federal habeas courts reviewing the constitutionality of a state prisoner conviction and sentence are guided by rules designed to ensure that judgments are accorded the finality and respect necessary to preserve the integrity of legal proceedings within our system of federalism.these rules include the doctrine of procedural default,under which a federal court will not review the merits of claims,including constitutional claims,that a state court declined to hear because the prisoner failed to abide by a state procedural rule.see,coleman,supra,at sykes,supra,at.a state court invocation of a procedural rule to deny a prisoner claims precludes federal review of the claims if,among other requisites,the state procedural rule is a nonfederal ground adequate to support the judgment and the rule is firmly established and consistently followed.see,walker martin,slip,at beard kindler,slip,at.the doctrine barring procedurally defaulted claims from being heard is not without exceptions.a prisoner may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of federal law.see coleman,at.there is no dispute that arizona procedural bar on successive petitions is an independent and adequate state ground.thus,a federal court can hear martinez claim only if he can establish cause to excuse the procedural default.
coleman held that n egligence on the part of a prisoner postconviction attorney does not qualify as.maples thomas,s,slip,at.coleman reasoned that because the attorney is the prisoner agent under principles of agency law,the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his agent.maples,supra,at slip,at.
coleman,however,did not present the occasion to apply this principle to determine whether attorney errors in collateral proceedings may qualify as cause for a procedural default.the alleged failure of counsel in coleman was on appeal from an collateral proceeding,and in that proceeding the prisoner claims had been addressed by the state habeas trial court.see,at.
as coleman recognized,this marks a key difference between collateral proceedings and other kinds of collateral proceedings.when an attorney errs in collateral proceedings,it is likely that no state court at any level will hear the prisoner claim.this court on direct review of the state proceeding could not consider or adjudicate the claim.see,fox film muller,murdock memphis,wall.coleman,supra,at.and if counsel errors in an collateral proceeding do not establish cause to excuse the procedural default in a federal habeas proceeding,no court will review the prisoner claims.
the same is not true when counsel errs in other kinds of postconviction proceedings.while counsel errors in these proceedings preclude any further review of the prisoner claim,the claim will have been addressed by one court,whether it be the trial court,the appellate court on direct review,or the trial court in an collateral proceeding.see,coleman,supra,at.
where,as here,the collateral proceeding is the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial,the collateral proceeding is in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner direct appeal as to the claim.this is because the state habeas court looks to the merits of the clai m of ineffective assistance,no other court has addressed the claim,and defendants pursuing review are generally ill equipped to represent themselves because they do not have a brief from counsel or an opinion of the court addressing their claim of error.halbert michigan,see douglas,at.
as coleman recognized,an attorney errors during an appeal on direct review may provide cause to excuse a procedural default for if the attorney appointed by the state to pursue the direct appeal is ineffective,the prisoner has been denied fair process and the opportunity to comply with the state procedures and obtain an adjudication on the merits of his claims.see,at evitts lucey,douglas,supra,at.without the help of an adequate attorney,a prisoner will have similar difficulties vindicating a substantial claim.claims of ineffective assistance at trial often require investigative work and an understanding of trial strategy.when the issue can not be raised on direct review,moreover,a prisoner asserting an claim in an collateral proceeding can not rely on a court opinion or the prior work of an attorney addressing that claim.halbert,at.to present a claim of ineffective assistance at trial in accordance with the state procedures,then,a prisoner likely needs an effective attorney.
the same would be true if the state did not appoint an attorney to assist the prisoner in the collateral proceeding.the prisoner,unlearned in the law,may not comply with the state procedural rules or may misapprehend the substantive details of federal constitutional law,at describing the educational background of the prison population.while confined to prison,the prisoner is in no position to develop the evidentiary basis for a claim of ineffective assistance,which often turns on evidence outside the trial record.
a prisoner inability to present a claim of trial error is of particular concern when the claim is one of ineffective assistance of counsel.the right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our justice system.it is deemed as an obvious truth the idea that any person haled into court,who is too poor to hire a lawyer,can not be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.gideon wainwright.indeed,the right to counsel is the foundation for our adversary system.defense counsel tests the prosecution case to ensure that the proceedings serve the function of adjudicating guilt or innocence,while protecting the rights of the person charged.see,powell alabama,the defendant requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.without it,though he be not guilty,he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence effective trial counsel preserves claims to be considered on appeal,see,fed.rule crim.proc.b,and in federal habeas proceedings,edwards carpenter.
this is not to imply the state acted with any impropriety by reserving the claim of ineffective assistance for a collateral proceeding.see massaro united states.claims often depend on evidence outside the trial record.direct appeals,without evidentiary hearings,may not be as effective as other proceedings for developing the factual basis for the claim.ibid.abbreviated deadlines to expand the record on direct appeal may not allow adequate time for an attorney to investigate the claim.see primus,structural reform in criminal defense,cornell,and most rules give between and days from the time of conviction to file a request to expand the record on appeal.thus,there are sound reasons for deferring consideration of claims until the stage,but this decision is not without consequences for the state ability to assert a procedural default in later proceedings.by deliberately choosing to move claims outside of the process,where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed,the state significantly diminishes prisoners ability to file such claims.it is within the context of this state procedural framework that counsel ineffectiveness in an collateral proceeding qualifies as cause for a procedural default.
the rules for when a prisoner may establish cause to excuse a procedural default are elaborated in the exercise of the court discretion.mccleskey zant,see also coleman,supra,at sykes,at reed ross,fay noia,overruled in part by sykes,supra.these rules reflect an equitable judgment that only where a prisoner is impeded or obstructed in complying with the state established procedures will a federal habeas court excuse the prisoner from the usual sanction of default.see,strickler greene,reed,supra,at.allowing a federal habeas court to hear a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel when an attorney errors or the absence of an attorney caused a procedural default in an collateral proceeding acknowledges,as an equitable matter,that the collateral proceeding,if undertaken without counsel or with ineffective counsel,may not have been sufficient to ensure that proper consideration was given to a substantial claim.from this it follows that,when a state requires a prisoner to raise an claim in a collateral proceeding,a prisoner may establish cause for a default of an claim in two circumstances.the first is where the state courts did not appoint counsel in the collateral proceeding for a claim of ineffective assistance at trial.the second is where appointed counsel in the collateral proceeding,where the claim should have been raised,was ineffective under the standards of strickland washington.to overcome the default,a prisoner must also demonstrate that the underlying claim is a substantial one,which is to say that the prisoner must demonstrate that the claim has some merit.cockrell,describing standards for certificates of appealability to issue.
most jurisdictions have in place procedures to ensure counsel is appointed for substantial claims.some states,including arizona,appoint counsel in every first collateral proceeding.see,alaska stat.c.rule crim.proc.c.stat.a me.rules crim.proc,c stat.ann.a.rule b laws lexis.code ann.some states appoint counsel if the claims require an evidentiary hearing,as claims of ineffective assistance often do.see.rule crim.proc.code crim.proc,c west.rule crim.proc.a rule civ.proc.d.other states appoint counsel if the claims have some merit to them or the state habeas trial court deems the record worthy of further development.see.rule crim.proc.b.rule crim.proc.b.super.rule crim.proc.e indiana rule remedies proc,a.stat.ann.dist.rule crim.proc.hust state,idaho,hardin arkansas,per curiam jensen state,nd,wu united states,kostal people.it is likely that most of the attorneys appointed by the courts are qualified to perform,and do perform,according to prevailing professional norms and,where that is so,the states may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.
this limited qualification to coleman does not implicate the usual concerns with upsetting reliance interests protected by stare decisis principles,montejo louisiana.coleman held that an attorney negligence in a postconviction proceeding does not establish cause,and this remains true except as to collateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.coleman itself did not involve an occasion when an attorney erred in an collateral proceeding with respect to a claim of ineffective trial counsel and in the years since coleman was decided,we have not held coleman applies in circumstances like this one.
the holding here ought not to put a significant strain on state resources.when faced with the question whether there is cause for an apparent default,a state may answer that the claim is insubstantial,it does not have any merit or that it is wholly without factual support,or that the attorney in the collateral proceeding did not perform below constitutional standards.
this is but one of the differences between a constitutional ruling and the equitable ruling of this case.a constitutional ruling would provide defendants a freestanding constitutional claim to raise it would require the appointment of counsel in collateral proceedings it would impose the same system of appointing counsel in every state and it would require a reversal in all state collateral cases on direct review from state courts if the states system of appointing counsel did not conform to the constitutional rule.an equitable ruling,by contrast,permits states a variety of systems for appointing counsel in collateral proceedings.and it permits a state to elect between appointing counsel in collateral proceedings or not asserting a procedural default and raising a defense on the merits in federal habeas proceedings.in addition,state collateral cases on direct review from state courts are unaffected by the ruling in this case.
the rule of coleman governs in all but the limited circumstances recognized here.the holding in this case does not concern attorney errors in other kinds of proceedings,including appeals from collateral proceedings,second or successive collateral proceedings,and petitions for discretionary review in a state appellate courts.see,at carrier,at.it does not extend to attorney errors in any proceeding beyond the first occasion the state allows a prisoner to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial,even though that collateral proceeding may be deficient for other reasons.
in addition,the limited nature of the qualification to coleman adopted here reflects the importance of the right to the effective assistance of trial counsel and arizona decision to bar defendants from raising claims on direct appeal.our holding here addresses only the constitutional claims presented in this case,where the state barred the defendant from raising the claims on direct appeal.
arizona contends that the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,bars martinez from asserting attorney error as cause for a procedural default.aedpa refers to attorney error in collateral proceedings,but it does not speak to the question presented in this case.section i provides that the ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during federal or state collateral proceedings shall not be a ground for relief.cause,however,is not synonymous with a ground for relief.a finding of cause and prejudice does not entitle the prisoner to habeas relief.it merely allows a federal court to consider the merits of a claim that otherwise would have been procedurally defaulted.in this case,for example,martinez ground for relief is his claim,a claim that aedpa does not bar.martinez relies on the ineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney to excuse his failure to comply with arizona procedural rules,not as an independent basis for overturning his conviction.in short,while i precludes martinez from relying on the ineffectiveness of his postconviction attorney as a ground for relief,it does not stop martinez from using it to establish cause.holland florida,slip,at.
where,under state law,claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must be raised in an collateral proceeding,a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if,in the collateral proceeding,there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.
in this case martinez attorney in the collateral proceeding filed a notice akin to an anders brief,in effect conceding that martinez lacked any meritorious claim,including his claim of ineffective assistance at trial.see anders california.martinez argued before the federal habeas court that filing the anders brief constituted ineffective assistance.the court of appeals did not decide whether that was so.rather,it held that because martinez did not have a right to an attorney in the collateral proceeding,the attorney errors in the collateral proceeding could not establish cause for the failure to comply with the state rules.thus,the court of appeals did not determine whether martinez attorney in his first collateral proceeding was ineffective or whether his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is substantial.and the court did not address the question of prejudice.these issues remain open for a decision on remand.
the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

let me get this straight out of concern for the values of federalism to preserve the ability of our states to provide prompt justice and in light of our longstanding holding that there is no constitutional right to counsel in state collateral review the court,in what it portrays as an admirable exercise of judicial restraint,abstains from holding that there is a constitutional right to counsel in state habeas.after all,that would have meant,in a case such as the one before us,that failing to provide assistance of counsel,or providing assistance of counsel that falls below the strickland standard,would constitute cause for excusing procedural default.see strickland washington.instead of taking that radical step,the court holds that,for equitable reasons,in a case such as the one before us,failing to provide assistance of counsel,or providing assistance of counsel that falls below the strickland standard,constitutes cause for excusing procedural default.the result,of course,is precisely the same.
ah,but perhaps the explanation of why the court action today amounts to praiseworthy is this it pronounces this excuse from the usual rule of default only in state habeas raising an claim.but it could have limited its invention of a new constitutional right to counsel in precisely the same fashion and with precisely the same consequences.moreover,no one really believes that the newly announced equitable rule will remain limited to cases.there is not a dime worth of difference in principle between those cases and many other cases in which initial state habeas will be the first opportunity for a particular claim to be raised claims of newly discovered prosecutorial misconduct,for example,see brady maryland,claims based on newly discovered exculpatory evidence or newly discovered impeachment of prosecutorial witnesses,and claims asserting ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.the court soothing assertion,ante,at,that its holding addresses only the constitutional claims presented in this case,insults the reader intelligence 
moreover,even if today holding could against all logic be restricted to claims,it would have essentially the same practical consequences as a holding that counsel is constitutionally required.despite the court suggestion to the contrary,see ante,at,the rule it adopts calls into question the common state practice of not appointing counsel in all first collateral proceedings,see ante,at.it does not,to be sure,call into question the lawfulness of that practice only its sanity.for if the prisoner goes through state collateral proceedings without counsel,and fails to raise an claim which is,because of that failure,defaulted,the default will not preclude federal habeas review of the merits of that claim.and since ineffective assistance of trial counsel is a monotonously standard claim on federal habeas has a duly convicted defendant ever been effectively represented,whoever advises the state would himself be guilty of ineffective assistance if he did not counsel the appointment of counsel in all cases lest the failure to raise that claim in the state be excused and the state be propelled into federal habeas review of the adequacy of representation that occurred many years ago which is to say that the court pretended avoidance of requiring states to counsel is a sham 
of course even the appointment of counsel will not guarantee that the state criminal proceeding can be concluded without federal retrial.appointment of counsel may,as i have said,avoid federal review of the adequacy of representation that occurred years ago,at the original trial.but since,under today opinion,the condition for exclusion of federal habeas is the very same condition that would apply if appointment of counsel were constitutionally required,it will remain to be determined in federal habeas review whether the counsel was effective.thus,as a consequence of today decision the states will always be forced to litigate in federal habeas,for all defaulted claims and who knows what other claims,either the validity of the defaulted claim where counsel was not appointed,or the effectiveness of counsel where counsel was appointed.the court notes that many states already provide for the appointment of counsel in first collateral challenges as though this proves that what the court forces the states to do today is eminently reasonable.but what the court fails to point out is that currently,when counsel does not raise an claim,that is the end of the matter the issue has been procedurally defaulted.by virtue of today opinion,however,all those cases can and where capital punishment is at issue assuredly will proceed to federal habeas on the issue of whether counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the issue.that is the meaning of the court supposedly comforting statement 
it is likely that most of the attorneys appointed by the courts are qualified to perform,and do perform,according to prevailing professional norms and,where that is so,the states may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.ante,at emphasis added.
to be more precise,the court should have said where that is so,and where federal habeas courts have finally rejected claims that it is not so,the states may enforce a procedural default in federal habeas proceedings.
i can not possibly imagine the basis for the court confidence,ante,at,that all this will not put a significant strain on state resources.the principal escape route from federal habeas existence of an adequate and state ground has been closed whether counsel appointed for state collateral review raises the claim or not,federal habeas review will proceed.in practical effect,that may not make much difference in noncapital cases except for the squandering of state taxpayers money the defendant will stay in prison,continuing to serve his sentence,while federal habeas review grinds on.but in capital cases,it will effectively reduce the sentence,giving the defendant as many more years to live,beyond the lives of the innocent victims whose life he snuffed out,as the process of federal habeas may consume.i guarantee that an assertion of ineffective assistance of trial counsel will be made in all capital cases from this date on,causing because of today holding execution of the sentence to be deferred until either that claim,or the claim that appointed counsel was ineffective in failing to make that claim,has worked its way through the federal system.
the court would have us believe that today holding is no more than a limited qualification to coleman thompson.ante,at.it is much more than that a repudiation of the longstanding principle governing procedural default,which coleman and other cases consistently applied.coleman itself involved a habeas petitioner contention that his attorney failure to file a timely notice of appeal in his state habeas proceeding,which resulted in procedural default of the claims raised in that proceeding,was cause to excuse that default in federal habeas,at.the petitioner in that case contended that whether a violation of his constitutional right to effective counsel had occurred was of no consequence,so long as the attorney conduct fell short of the effectiveness standard set forth in strickland.see,at.whereas coleman flatly repudiated that claim as being inconsistent with our precedent,see,today majority wholeheartedly embraces it,ante,at.
rejection of the argument in coleman was compelled by our jurisprudence pertaining to cause for excusing procedural default,and in particular murray carrier.see coleman,supra,at.involved the failure of a defendant attorney to raise a claim on direct appeal,at.this failure did not constitute cause,we explained,because it was not an objective factor external to the defense.at emphasis added.this requirement reflects the judgment that states should not be forced to undergo federal habeas review of a defaulted claim unless a factor not attributable to the prisoner obstructed his compliance with state procedures.see,at.
although this externality requirement has been the north star of our jurisprudence,today opinion does not whisper its name no doubt because it is impossible to say that martinez procedural default was caused by a factor external to his defense.coleman and carrier set forth in clear terms when it is that attorney error constitutes an external factor attorney error by does not,because when an attorney acts or fails to act in furtherance of the litigation,he is acting as the petitioner agent.coleman,supra,at carrier,supra,at.any other rule would be inconsistent with our system of representative litigation,under which each party is deemed bound by the acts of his.irwin department of veterans affairs,internal quotation marks omitted.but when attorney error amounts to constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel,that error is imputed to the state for the state has failed to comply with the constitutional requirement to provide effective counsel,rendering the error external to the petitioner.coleman,supra,at carrier,supra,at.accordingly,as martinez himself appears to recognize,see brief for petitioner,our cases require that absent a determination that arizona violated the constitution by failing to provide effective counsel,attorney error can not provide cause to excuse his procedural default.rather than apply that rule here,the court adopts the very approach coleman explicitly addressed and rejected.
the court essentially disclaims any need to give full consideration to the principle of stare decisis because coleman did not involve an collateral proceeding for a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.see ante,at.that is rather like saying that marbury madison,cranch,does not establish our authority to review the constitutionality of a new federal statute because it involved a different enactment.just as the reasoning of marbury was categorical,so was the
