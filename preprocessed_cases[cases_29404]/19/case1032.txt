in united states weikert,cir,we rejected a supervised releasee fourth amendment challenge to the statutory requirement that he submit a blood sample for purposes of creating a dna profile and entering it into a centralized government database.applying a totality of the circumstances test,we concluded that the extraction of a blood sample and creation of a dna profile from an individual on supervised release were not unreasonable searches under the fourth amendment.in this case,appellant martin boroian poses a question left unanswered in weikert.although acknowledging that the government lawfully obtained his dna sample and profile during his term of probation,boroian challenges the government retention and use of his dna profile and sample now that he has successfully completed his term of probation.in particular,he contends that the government retention and periodic matching of his dna profile against other profiles in the database is an unreasonable fourth amendment search.he further argues that the analysis of his blood sample is an unreasonable search and contends,for the first time on appeal,that the retention of his blood sample is an unreasonable continuing seizure.
we conclude that the alleged present use of boroian dna is,the retention and matching of his lawfully obtained profile against other profiles in the government not constitute a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.boroian has not sufficiently alleged any other present or imminent uses of his dna profile to support an argument that his profile is being subjected to a new search.we further conclude that he has failed to allege any present or imminent analysis of his dna sample,thereby providing no factual basis for the argument that a future analysis of his sample would constitute a separate fourth amendment search.we do not address his continuing seizure challenge to the retention of his sample,deeming that argument waived.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.see.b.
statutory framework 
the dna analysis backlog elimination act of dna act,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of,and,requires individuals who have been convicted of a qualifying federal offense and who are incarcerated or on parole,probation,or supervised release to provide government authorities with a dna sample a b,a.although the extracted dna sample may be a tissue,fluid,or other bodily sample,see id.c,it is typically a blood sample,see united states kincade,cir en banc.
the dna act authorizes the government to use such means as are reasonably necessary to detain,restrain,and collect a dna sample from an individual who refuses to cooperate in the collection of the sample.a a.a probationer refusal to comply with the dna collection procedure is a violation of an express condition of probation,a,and is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year imprisonment and a fine of up to,a.
once collected,a qualified federal offender sample is analyzed by the federal bureau of investigation fbi to create a dna profile.b,c weikert,at.the dna profile is then loaded into the fbi combined dna index system codis,a centralized system that includes offender profiles obtained through federal,state and territorial dna collection programs,as well as forensic profiles drawn from crime scene evidence.a weikert,at codis is a system linking databases maintained at the local,state,and national level.dna initiative,levels of the database,last visited.profiles from the local and state databases,as well as profiles collected and analyzed by the fbi,are entered into the national database subject to the requirements of the dna act.id.
codis enables law enforcement officials to check if a given profile matches other profiles contained in the national database.see weikert,at.as of june,the national database contained over million offender profiles and over forensic profiles,and the fbi credited the system with producing more than matches assisting in over investigations.see federal bureau of investigation,statistics,last visited.under the dna act,with limited exceptions the fbi retains qualified federal offenders dna profiles and dna samples even after they have completed their term of probation or supervised release.
factual and procedural background 
on july,boroian,a resident of massachusetts,was convicted in the united states district court for the district of vermont of one count of making a false statement in violation of a,a qualifying federal offense under the dna act.the court sentenced him to one year of probation and imposed a special assessment.on june,about a month before boroian term of probation was to expire,the united states probation office for the district of massachusetts ordered him to submit to the drawing of a blood sample for dna analysis pursuant to the dna act.
shortly before the end of his term of probation,boroian filed a pro se complaint seeking an order directing defendants to withdraw their demand that he submit to dna testing.however,not wishing to suffer the adverse consequences of failing to comply with the probation office order,he submitted on june,to collection of his dna sample as required.he successfully completed his term of probation on july.
on march,boroian,now represented by appointed counsel,filed an amended complaint alleging that under the dna act,his dna profile and dna sample would be retained by the government in perpetuity for the purpose of facilitat ing the investigation and prosecution of past and future crimes.he claimed that the government retention and analysis of his dna profile and sample after completion of his probation term,without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity,violated the fourth amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.he sought an order that his dna profile be expunged and his dna sample destroyed.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss boroian complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,see.b,and the district court granted the motion in a written order.as to boroian dna profile,the court concluded that the government retention and periodic accessing of his lawfully obtained dna profile was not a new search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.as to his dna sample,the court held that although a new analysis of the sample could constitute a separate search under the fourth amendment,boroian complaint contained no factual allegations of a present or imminent analysis of the sample.this timely appeal followed.
we review the grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,accepting as true all facts in the complaint and making all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.gorelik costin,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell twombly.although not equivalent to a probability requirement,the plausibility standard asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.id.quoting twombly,at.
a.the fourth amendment and weikert 
the fourth amendment provides that the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated const.amend iv.a fourth amendment search occurs when the government infringes an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable.united states jacobsen,see also kyllo united states,u,explaining that a fourth amendment search does not occur unless the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search and society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable internal quotation marks omitted.
in weikert,we rejected a fourth amendment challenge to the collection and analysis of dna samples from qualified federal offenders on supervised release.addressing the threshold question of whether a search or seizure had occurred,we reasoned that the extraction of blood for dna profiling constituted a search under the fourth amendment,and that the creation of the dna profile and entry of that profile into codis represented a further intrusion into the individual privacy.id.at.turning to the question of whether the search was reasonable,we recognized the government important interests in monitoring and rehabilitating supervised releasees,solving crimes,and exonerating innocent individuals through the use of codis,and concluded that those interests outweighed the individual privacy interest given his status as a supervised releasee,the relatively minimal inconvenience occasioned by the blood draw,and the coding of genetic information that,by statute,may be used only for purposes of identification.id.at.thus,under the totality of the circumstances,we held that neither the extraction of a blood sample nor the creation of a dna profile and its entry into codis was unreasonable under the fourth amendment.id.at.
however,we limited our holding in weikert to the collection and profiling of the dna of an individual currently on supervised release,emphasizing that supervised releasees have a lesser expectation of privacy than offenders who have completed their term of release.id.at.boroian now poses a question expressly left open in weikert whether it is also constitutional for the government to retain and access a qualified federal offender dna profile in codis after his or her term of supervised release or probation has ended.id.at.we first address boroian fourth amendment challenge to the government retention and use of his dna profile,and then separately address his challenge to the government retention of his blood sample.
b.the dna profile 
the creation and use of the profile 
under the dna act,dna profiles currently function as identification records not unlike fingerprints,photographs,or social security numbers.to create a dna profile,the fbi uses short tandem repeat str technology to analyze repeating sequences found at thirteen specific regions,or loci,on an individual dna.see weikert,at kincade,at.each of the targeted loci are found on junk dna dna that differs from one individual to the next and thus can be used for purposes of identification but which was purposely selected because it is not associated with any known physical or medical characteristics and do es not control or influence the expression of any trait.weikert,at quoting.i,at,wl letter of robert raben,assistant attorney general,to the honorable henry hyde,chairman,house judiciary committee.thus,the resulting dna profile provide s a kind of genetic fingerprint,which uniquely identifies an individual,but does not provide a basis for determining or inferring anything else about the person.id.at quoting.i,at.this genetic fingerprint,represented as a series of digits,see tracey maclin,is obtaining an arrestee dna a valid special needs search under the fourth amendment what should and will the supreme court do,med.ethics,is then loaded into codis without any associated information other than an agency identifier for the agencies submitting the dna profile the specimen identification number and the name of the dna personnel associated with the dna analysis.weikert,at quoting.i,at.
codis is a powerful identification and investigation tool,permitting state and local forensic laboratories to exchange and compare dna profiles electronically in an attempt to link evidence from crime scenes for which there are no suspects to dna samples of convicted offenders on file in the system.i,at,wl.codis is currently used to run a weekly comparison of all dna profiles in the national database and automatically return the resulting profile matches to the laboratories that submitted them.see united states dep t of justice,dna initiative,http last visited.
the dna act restricts the use of retained dna profiles to limited purposes,including by criminal justice agencies for law enforcement identification purposes,in judicial proceedings if otherwise admissible,and for criminal defense purposes.b the unauthorized disclosure or use of a dna profile is punishable by a fine of up to or imprisonment of up to one year,id.c,and by cancellation of the user access to the codis database,id.c.
the reasonable expectation of privacy 
given the dna act stringent limitations on the creation and use of dna profiles,codis currently functions much like a traditional fingerprint database,permitting law enforcement to match one identification record against others contained in the database.see,johnson quander,codis functions much like an fingerprint database albeit more efficiently banks united states,cir statutory restrictions allow the government to use an offender dna profile in substantially the same way that the government uses fingerprint and photographic identify offenders,to solve past and future crimes,and to combat recidivism.nicholas goord,cir w e see the intrusion on privacy effected by the statute as similar to the intrusion wrought by the maintenance of fingerprint records.
it is well established that identification records of convicted felons,such as fingerprints or mugshots,are routinely retained by the government after their sentences are complete and may be expunged only in narrowly defined circumstances.see a requiring the attorney general to acquire,collect,classify and preserve criminal identification records emphasis added united states coloian,cir discussing limited grounds for expungement of criminal records united states amerson,cir i t is well established that the state need not destroy records of as fingerprints,photographs,convicted felons,once their sentences are up.
other precedents hold that the government matching of a lawfully obtained identification record against other records in its lawful possession does not infringe on an individual legitimate expectation of privacy.see,united states,cir running computerized check of individual lawfully obtained license plate and driver license identification numbers in government databases,which revealed information about subject car ownership,driver status,and criminal record,was not a search under the fourth amendment willan columbia county,cir police query of fbi computerized national crime records database to reveal record of mayoral candidate earlier conviction in another state was not a fourth amendment search.
these practices and precedents on the retention and matching of offenders identification records inescapably inform a convicted offender reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to his or her dna profile.as with the matching of records in a fingerprint database,the government use of codis to match boroian profile against other profiles in the database is limited to a comparison of the identification records already in its lawful possession and does not reveal any new,private or intimate information about boroian.moreover,the government comparison of boroian dna profile with other profiles in codis is precisely the use for which the profile was initially lawfully created and entered into codis under the dna act.
boroian suggests that the government does not need his dna profile for identification purposes because it already has other means of identification,such as his fingerprints and social security number.however,the fact that the government may lawfully retain and access these more traditional means of identifying boroian only emphasizes that the government retention and matching of his dna profile does not intrude on boroian legitimate expectation of privacy.at present,boroian dna profile simply functions as an additional,albeit more technologically advanced,means of identification.
therefore,we join the other courts to have addressed the issue in holding that the government retention and matching of boroian profile against other profiles in codis does not violate an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable,and thus does not constitute a separate search under the fourth amendment see johnson,at w e conclude that accessing the dna snapshots contained in the codis database does not independently implicate the fourth amendment.accord wilson collins,cir stating that claim based on the government retention and use of dna profile does not implicate the fourth amendment amerson,at acknowledgi
