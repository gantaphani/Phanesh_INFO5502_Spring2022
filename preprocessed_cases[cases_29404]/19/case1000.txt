a jury convicted durrell williams on numerous drug and gun charges.the district court sentenced him to years in prison.on appeal williams contends that his attorney was given inadequate time to prepare for trial and that the government evidence was insufficient to convict him.he also asserts that his sentence was unreasonable and suffered from computational errors.after careful review,we affirm in all respects.
an sting nabbed williams for heading a drug and gun conspiracy in portland,maine.we briefly describe the scheme.originally from queens,a borough of new york city,williams moved to portland at some point in or to sell crack cocaine.there he met maine native joshua hebert and other middlemen who facilitated distribution.williams also sold directly to users,sometimes from his apartment,sometimes in a car driven by his sherina howard,with whom he lived,and from time to time on his bicycle.he used part of his drug proceeds to purchase handguns.his main gun supplier was wade collett,a licensee of red wheel enterprises in falmouth,maine.because williams was a felon,he employed intermediaries as straw purchasers to buy guns on his behalf.at times,hebert would purchase a gun from collett,create a false bill of sale that identified someone other than williams,and then convey the gun to williams instead of the individual identified on the bill of sale.at other times,williams would accompany another associate to collett gun shop.there williams would tell the individual which gun to buy,that person would ask to borrow money from williams,and collett would process the transaction knowing the gun was for williams.during the course of the conspiracy,williams traveled to queens numerous times in order to,obtain more crack and sell the guns he had acquired in maine.
in june,williams and collett were indicted on several gun charges in federal district court in maine.collett entered into a plea agreement,but williams did not.the government later filed a superceding indictment,again charging williams with the gun violations,as well as charging williams and hebert with a conspiracy involving fifty or more grams of cocaine base.like collett,hebert agreed to plead guilty,but a second round of plea negotiations with williams failed.williams trial was scheduled to begin on january,but was later rescheduled to february due to defense counsel illness.in,it became clear that counsel illness would prevent him from continuing to represent williams.the court,with williams consent,appointed another lawyer from the same firm.although new counsel sarah churchill had already met with williams,she was away on a vacation at the time of the appointment.the court continued trial until february,so that churchill would have an additional week to prepare.in doing so,however,the court admonished that i want to get this matter tried.williams has been sitting there for some time.
on february,churchill filed another motion to continue trial.she cited the voluminous material the government had produced,consisting of six compact disks containing approximately pages of written material and two compact disks which contain hours of recording of telephone calls,and suggested that more time was necessary to ensure that proper can occur.the court denied the motion in a paperless order,but invited churchill to request additional time s hould counsel a pprehend during t rial there exists any prejudice from this order.
after a trial,the jury convicted williams on all counts.the court sentenced him to months on the drug charge,to be served concurrently with lesser time he received on the gun charges.williams appealed 
ii.discussion 
motion to continue trial 
williams argues that four weeks was not enough time for churchill to prepare for trial in light of the materials she needed to review.williams also argues that additional time could have improved churchill impeachment of some of the government witnesses.in particular,williams the first time on more time might have allowed churchill to obtain a record showing that williams was incarcerated in new york from september to may in connection with an unrelated charge.according to williams,if obtained that record would have discredited several of the government witnesses,all of whom we are told testified that williams was in maine during that period.
we review the district court denial of a motion to continue for abuse of discretion.united states,cir.each case must be evaluated on its own facts.united states torres,cir.relevant factors in our analysis include the reasons contemporaneously presented in support of the request,the amount of time needed for effective preparation,the complexity of the case,the extent of inconvenience to others if a continuance is granted,and the likelihood of injustice or unfair prejudice attributable to the denial of a continuance.united states,cir citing united states saccoccia,cir.to show abuse,the aggrieved party must establish that the court exhibited an unreasonable and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.id.quoting united states,cir.identifying prejudice from the ruling is essential.id.citing saccoccia,at.
williams has not shown that an abuse occurred.attorney churchill moved for a continuance on the basis of a broad assertion that the material she needed to pages of documents and hours of recorded telephone voluminous.other than volume,no specific explanation has been provided as to why those particular materials justified additional time.on the basis of this broad assertion alone,we are reluctant to the district court conclusion that four weeks was adequate,especially in light of the court previous continuance to accommodate her.see,at denial of continuance no abuse when counsel had about a month to review approximately pages of documents.
we note that the case against williams was not overly complex.although the superceding indictment contained thirteen counts against williams and involved nearly forty discrete allegations,they all pertained to one conspiracy involving a limited number of individuals and two related schemes pedestrian drug activity and gun transactions which were themselves substantially similar.the trial was short,lasting only three days from opening arguments to verdict.see,united states waldman,cir denial of continuance not an abuse in case involving a count indictment and trial.moreover,churchill did not shoulder that burden alone a colleague,who presumably took part in trial preparation,was present throughout trial and about half of the government witnesses.united states hurley,cir denial of continuance no abuse in part because counsel benefitted from work of counsel.
additionally,we discern no unfair prejudice.williams prejudice argument on appeal focuses on the purported existence of a record of his incarceration that,he claims,churchill could have obtained if only the court had allowed the continuance.none of this,however,was presented to the district court in the first instance.although sometimes prejudice might become clear through hindsight alone,see,at,this is not one of those cases.according to the appellant brief,churchill learned shortly before trial that at least one government witness would testify that williams was in maine as early as.churchill then attempted to obtain a record of williams incarceration for impeachment purposes,but that attempt failed for reasons that remain unclear.the salient point,though,is the court open and express invitation to renew the motion to continue when presented with cognizable never sought a continuance to obtain the record that williams now invokes.
in any event,we also reject the prejudice hypothesis on its merits.in united states bruck,a case involving roughly comparable circumstances,we affirmed the denial of a continuance to develop psychological evidence.cir.recognizing the defendant history of psychological illness,the district court had ordered a psychological examination,which concluded that the defendant was competent to stand trial.id.at.on the eve of trial,the defense sought a continuance to obtain additional evidence showing that the defendant was insane.id.the court den
