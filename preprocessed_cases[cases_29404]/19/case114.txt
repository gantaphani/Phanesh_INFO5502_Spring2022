respondent valencia gonzales,a death row inmate in arizona,sought federal habeas relief.his counsel moved to stay the proceedings,contending that gonzales mental incompetence prevented him from rationally communicating with or assisting counsel,and that gonzales was thus entitled to a stay because,under the ninth circuit rohan decision,what is now a requires a stay when a petitioner is adjudged incompetent.the district court denied a stay,finding that the claims before it were record based or resolvable as a matter of law and thus would not benefit from gonzales input.gonzales thereafter sought a writ of mandamus in the ninth circuit.applying rohan and its recent decision in nash which gave habeas petitioners a right to competence even on appeals the court granted the writ,concluding that gave gonzales the right to a stay pending a competency determination.
respondent sean carter,a death row inmate in ohio,initiated federal habeas proceedings but eventually moved for a competency determination and stay of the proceedings.the district court granted the motion and found carter incompetent to assist counsel.applying the ninth circuit rohan test,it determined that carter assistance was required to develop four of his exhausted claims.it thus dismissed his habeas petition without prejudice and prospectively tolled the statute of limitations.on appeal,the sixth circuit,relying in part on rees peyton,rees i,located a statutory right to competence in,and found that a court could employ that provision whenever a capital habeas petitioner seeks to forgo his petition.it thus ordered that carter petition be stayed indefinitely with respect to any claims requiring his assistance.
section does not provide a state prisoner a right to suspension of his federal habeas proceedings when he is adjudged incompetent.
a the assertion of such a right lacks any basis in the provision text.section guarantees federal habeas petitioners on death row the right to federally funded counsel,a,and sets out various requirements that appointed counsel must meet,b e,but it does not direct district courts to stay proceedings when petitioners are found incompetent.the assertion is also difficult to square with the court constitutional precedents.if the sixth amendment right carried with it an implied right to competence,the right to competence at trial would flow from that amendment,not from the right to due process,see cooper oklahoma.but while the benefits flowing from the right to counsel at trial could be affected if an incompetent defendant is unable to communicate with his attorney,this court has never said that the right to competence derives from the right to counsel.and the court will not assume or infer that congress intended to depart from such precedent and locate a right to competence in federal habeas proceedings within the right to counsel.see merck reynolds.
b the ninth circuit identified its rule in rohan,concluding there that a petitioner mental incompetency could eviscerate the statutory right to counsel in federal habeas proceedings.but given the,nature of proceedings,counsel can generally provide effective representation to a habeas petitioner regardless of the petitioner competence.rees i,supra,rees peyton,and rees superintendent of the.state penitentiary,s,which involved an incompetent death row inmate attempt to withdraw his certiorari petition,offer no support for federal habeas petitioners seeking to stay district court proceedings or for the ninth circuit opinions in rohan,nash,or this case.the ninth circuit interpretation is also not supported by mcfarland scott,in which this court held that a district court could stay an execution after a capital prisoner had invoked his right to counsel but before he had filed his habeas petition.in contrast,gonzales is seeking to stay the district court proceedings,and he sought a stay more than six years after initiating his habeas petition,certainly ample time for his attorney to research and present the claims.
section also does not provide a statutory right to competence during federal habeas proceedings.the sixth circuit based its conclusion largely on a misreading of rees i,which did not recognize such a right.moreover,does not even apply to habeas proceedings.by its terms,it applies only to trial proceedings prior to sentencing and at any time after the commencement of probation or supervised release.federal habeas proceedings,however,commence after sentencing,and federal habeas petitioners are incarcerated,not on probation.furthermore,like the rest of title generally,applies exclusively to federal defendants,not to state prisoners like carter.finally,a authorizes a district court to grant a motion for a competency determination if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant mental incompetence renders him unable to understand the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense,while a habeas proceeding is a civil action against a warden,in which the petitioner collaterally attacks his conviction in an earlier state trial.
for purposes of resolving these cases,it is sufficient to address the outer limits of the district court discretion to issue stays it is unnecessary to determine the precise contours of that discretion.in gonzales case,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a stay after finding that gonzales claims were all record based or resolvable as a matter of law,regardless of his competence.review of a petitioner claims subject to d is limited to the record before the state court that heard the case on the merits.any evidence that gonzales might have would be inadmissible.in carter case,three of his claims do not warrant a stay because they were adjudicated on the merits in state postconviction proceedings and thus subject to review under d.thus,extrarecord evidence that he might have concerning these claims would be inadmissible.it is unclear from the record whether he exhausted his fourth claim.if it was exhausted,it too would be record based.but even if it was both unexhausted and not procedurally defaulted,an indefinite stay would be inappropriate,since such a stay would permit petitioners to frustrate the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of goal of finality by dragging out indefinitely their federal habeas review.rhines weber.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
these two cases present the question whether the incompetence of a state prisoner requires suspension of the prisoner federal habeas corpus proceedings.we hold that neither nor provides such a right and that the courts of appeals for the ninth and sixth circuits both erred in holding that district courts must stay federal habeas proceedings when petitioners are adjudged incompetent.
ernest valencia gonzales was convicted by an arizona jury of felony murder,armed robbery,aggravated assault,burglary,and theft.the convictions arose from gonzales repeated stabbing of darrel and deborah wagner in front of their son during a burglary of the wagners home.darrel wagner died from the stabbing,while deborah wagner survived but spent five days in intensive care.the trial court sentenced gonzales to death on the murder charge and to various prison terms for the other crimes.
after exhausting state remedies,gonzales filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court on november.while the petition was pending,gonzales appointed counsel moved to stay the proceedings,contending that gonzales was no longer capable of rationally communicating with or assisting counsel.he argued that mental incompetence entitled gonzales to a stay under ninth circuit precedent.see rohan woodford.in rohan,the ninth circuit held that the federal statute guaranteeing state capital prisoners a right to counsel in federal habeas proceedings,q b ed.now codified as a,could not be faithfully enforced unless courts ensure that a petitioner is competent,at.rohan thus concluded that where an incompetent capital habeas petitioner raises claims that could potentially benefit from his ability to communicate rationally,refusing to stay proceedings pending restoration of competence denies him his statutory right to assistance of counsel,whether or not counsel can identify with precision the information sought.at.
applying rohan,the district court denied a stay after concluding that the claims properly before it were record based or resolvable as a matter of law and thus would not benefit from gonzales input.the court found it to determine whether gonzales was incompetent,though it did find that he possessed at least a limited capacity for rational communication.gonzales schriro,supp.
gonzales thereafter filed an emergency petition for a writ of mandamus in the ninth circuit.while gonzales petition was pending,the ninth circuit decided nash ryan,which held that habeas petitioners have a right to competence on appeal,even though appeals are entirely record based,at while an appeal is,that does not mean that a habeas petitioner in a capital case is relegated to a nonexistent role.meaningful assistance of appellate counsel may require rational communication between counsel and a habeas petitioner applying nash and rohan,the court granted the writ of mandamus,concluding that even though gonzales exhausted claims are or legal in nature,he is entitled to a stay pending a competency determination under.in re gonzales.
we granted certiorari to determine whether provides a statutory right to competence in federal habeas proceedings.
sean carter was convicted by an ohio jury of murder,aggravated robbery,and rape,and sentenced to death for anally raping his adoptive grandmother,veader prince,and stabbing her to death.after exhausting his appeals,carter initiated federal habeas proceedings on march,in the northern district of ohio.carter eventually filed a third amended petition,along with a motion requesting a competency and a stay of the proceedings.the district court granted the motion.
following several psychiatric evaluations and a determination,the district court found carter incompetent to assist counsel.applying the ninth circuit test in rohan,it determined that carter assistance was required to develop four of his exhausted claims.as a result,the court dismissed his habeas petition without prejudice and prospectively tolled the statute of limitations.carter bradshaw,supp.the state appealed.
the sixth circuit acknowledged that f ederal habeas petitioners facing the death penalty for state criminal convictions do not enjoy a constitutional right to competence.carter bradshaw.it nevertheless located a statutory right to competence in,relying,in part,on this court decision in rees peyton,per curiam rees i,at.the sixth circuit explained 
by applying section to habeas actions,rees addresses the situation where a habeas petitioner awaiting the death penalty may seek to forego any collateral attacks on his conviction or sentence,and defines a statutory right for the petitioner to be competent enough to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him,and assist properly in his defense.at.
the court concluded that a nytime a capital habeas petitioner affirmatively seeks to forego his habeas petition,whether by action or inaction,a district court may employ section.at.
the court therefore amended the district court judgment and ordered that carter petition be stayed with respect to any claims that required his assistance,at.judge rogers dissented,arguing that there was no constitutional or statutory basis for the court decision,at.
we granted certiorari to determine whether provides a statutory right to competence in federal habeas proceedings.
both the ninth and sixth circuits have concluded that death row inmates pursuing federal habeas are entitled to a suspension of proceedings when found incompetent.the ninth circuit located this right in,while the sixth circuit located it in.neither section provides such a right.
section a guarantees federal habeas petitioners on death row the right to federally funded counsel the statute provides that petitioners who are financially unable to obtain adequate representation shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys.appointed attorneys are required to have experience in death penalty litigation,b d,and,once appointed,are directed to represent the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings,e.the statute also gives district courts the power to authorize funding for investigative,expert,or other services as are reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant.f.but does not direct district courts to stay proceedings when habeas petitioners are found incompetent 
in addition to lacking any basis in the statutory text,the assertion that the right to counsel implies a right to competence is difficult to square with our constitutional precedents.the right to counsel is located in the sixth amendment.in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.if the right to counsel carried with it an implied right to competence,the right to competence at trial would flow from the sixth amendment.but w e have repeatedly and consistently recognized that the criminal trial of an incompetent defendant violates due process,not the sixth amendment.cooper oklahoma,quoting medina california,emphasis added see also drope missouri,t he failure to observe procedures adequate to protect a defendant right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent to stand trial deprives him of his due process right to a fair trial citing pate robinson.
it stands to reason that the benefits flowing from the right to counsel at trial could be affected if an defendant is unable to communicate with his attorney.for example,an incompetent defendant would be unable to assist counsel in identifying witnesses and deciding on a trial strategy.for this reason,a defendant may not be put to trial unless he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.cooper,supra,at quoting dusky united states,per curiam.notwithstanding the connection between the right to competence at trial and the right to counsel at trial,we have never said that the right to competence derives from the right to counsel.we will not assume or infer that congress intended to depart from our precedents and locate a right to competence in federal habeas proceedings within the right to counsel.we normally assume that,when congress enacts statutes,it is aware of relevant judicial precedent.merck reynolds,slip,at.
the ninth circuit located a statutory right to competence in,at citing rohan,and nash.because rohan is the ninth circuit controlling precedent,we briefly address that decision.
in rohan,a habeas petitioner asserted a right to based both on the due process clause and on q b ed.after discussing the history of the common law,which prohibited the indictment,trial and execution of mentally incompetent defendants the court of appeals stated that the petitioner due process claim raised substantial constitutional.rohan,at.this conclusion is puzzling in light of the ninth circuit acknowledgment that there is no constitutional right to counsel on habeas,at citing murray giarratano,plurality opinion,and that there is no due process right to collateral review at all,at citing united states maccollom,plurality opinion.the ninth circuit was simply incorrect in suggesting that,in this case,there might be a constitutional concern much less a substantial one raised by the petitioner due process claim.
invoking the canon of constitutional avoidance,the ninth circuit gave the petitioner the practical benefit of a due process right to competence in federal habeas proceedings through its interpretation of q b,at.in analyzing that statute,the rohan court relied on a ninth circuit en banc opinion in calderon united states dist.court for central dist.of,kelly v,overruled in unrelated part,woodford garceau,which held that a prisoner incompetence is grounds for equitably tolling the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa statute of limitations for filing habeas petitions.the rohan court purported to be bound by the rationale of kelly v that a prisoner incompetence could eviscerate the statutory right to counsel,kelly v,supra,at and concluded that i f a petitioner statutory rights depend on his ability to communicate rationally,compelling him to pursue relief while incompetent is no less an infringement than dismissing his late petition.at.
we are not persuaded by the ninth circuit assertion that a habeas petitioner mental incompetency could the statutory right to counsel in federal habeas proceedings.given the,nature of most federal habeas proceedings,counsel can generally provide effective representation to a habeas petitioner regardless of the petitioner competence.indeed,where a claim is adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,d ed,counsel should,in most circumstances,be able to identify whether the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,without any outside the record.see cullen pinholster,slip,at r eview under d is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.this language requires an examination of the decision at the time it was made.it follows that the record under review is limited to the record in existence at that same time,the record before the state court attorneys are quite capable of reviewing the record,identifying legal errors,and marshaling relevant arguments,even without their clients assistance.
rohan also cited rees i,in support of its conclusion,at.in rees i,a state inmate on death row filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in district court,alleging that the conviction violated his constitutional rights,at.the district court denied his petition,and the court of appeals affirmed.ibid.shortly after rees counsel filed a petition for certiorari with this court,rees directed his counsel to withdraw the petition and to forgo any further proceedings.counsel advised the court that he could not accede to these instructions without a psychiatric evaluation of rees,because there was some doubt as to rees mental competency.ibid.in response,the court directed the district court to determine rees mental competence,at.after the district court conducted a hearing and found rees incompetent,the court issued a order directing that the petition for certiorari be held without action.rees peyton,rees ii when rees died several decades later,the court dismissed the petition.rees superintendent of.state penitentiary,rees iii.
the ninth circuit concluded that t he record in rees ii shows that incompetence is grounds for staying habeas proceedings.rohan,supra,at.this conclusion is unwarranted.rees i concerned whether an incompetent habeas petitioner may withdraw his certiorari petition,and it provides no clear answer even to that question.likewise,the unique,order in rees ii offered no rationale for the decision to hold rees petition.as a result,rees offers no support for federal habeas petitioners seeking to stay district court proceedings or for the ninth circuit opinions in rohan,nash,or this case 
gonzales barely defends the ninth circuit interpretation of he offers a single,halfhearted argument in support of the ninth circuit opinion based on our statement in mcfarland scott,that the right to counsel necessarily includes a right for that counsel meaningfully to research and present a defendant habeas claims.but mcfarland was addressing whether a district court could issue a stay of execution after a capital prisoner had filed a request for counsel but before he had filed his habeas petition,at.we held that a district court may stay a capital prisoner execution once the prisoner has invoked his statutory right to counsel,at.mcfarland has no relevance here where gonzales is not seeking a stay of execution,but rather a stay of the district court proceedings.moreover,gonzales moved for a stay more than six years after initiating his habeas petition.this was certainly ample time for his attorney to research and present the claims.
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that does not provide federal habeas petitioners with a statutory right to competence 
the sixth circuit reached the same conclusion as the ninth circuit but located the statutory right to competence during habeas proceedings in.relying largely on rees i,the sixth circuit concluded that provides a statutory right to competence,at.but as discussed,part,supra,rees i did not recognize a statutory right to competence in federal proceedings moreover,does not even apply to such proceedings.section a provides 
at any time after the commencement of a prosecution for an offense and prior to the sentencing of the defendant,or at any time after the commencement of probation or supervised release and prior to the completion of the sentence,the defendant or the attorney for the government may file a motion for a hearing to determine the mental competency of the defendant.the court shall grant the motion,or shall order such a hearing on its own motion,if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.
by its own terms,applies only to trial proceedings prior to sentencing and at any time after the commencement of probation or supervised release.federal habeas proceedings,however,commence after sentencing,and federal habeas petitioners,by definition,are incarcerated,not on probation.
furthermore,like the rest of title generally,applies exclusively to federal defendants and probationers subject to prosecution by the united states.carter is not,and does not claim to be,a federal defendant.rather,he is a state prisoner challenging the basis of his conviction in a federal civil action.see blair martel,by its own terms,does not apply unless a federal criminal defendant is on trial or is released on probation 
finally,a authorizes the district court to grant a motion for a competency determination if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant mental incompetence renders him unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.emphasis added.see also d a habeas proceeding under,however,is not a proceedin g against the habeas petitioner this,on the other hand,is a civil action against the warden of the state prison.and,a federal habeas petitioner does not mount a defense to the government prosecution.rather,the petitioner collaterally attacks his conviction at an earlier state trial.accordingly,the statutory right to competence provided in is simply inapplicable to federal habeas proceedings.
we would address carter arguments in defense of the sixth circuit decision,but,there are none.carter brief informed us that t his court need not consider the statutory argument with which the petitioner brief begins,that there is no statutory right under to be competent in habeas proceedings.brief for respondent in.apparently,carter found the sixth circuit reasoning indefensible.we agree.
both gonzales and carter argued at length in their briefs and at oral argument that district courts have the equitable power to stay proceedings when they determine that habeas petitioners are mentally incompetent neither petitioner disputes that d istrict courts ordinarily have authority to i
