on june,orlando maldonado pled guilty to counts related to his role in a conspiracy to distribute in excess of kilograms of cocaine and was sentenced to months imprisonment,reflecting a mandatory minimum imposed by statute.b a ii.however,the mandatory minimum was subject to a safe harbor exception.maldonado claims that the district court miscalculated his criminal history,depriving him of this exception and potentially a somewhat lower sentence.the facts are not complicated.
before entering into a plea agreement in the drug case,maldonado requested that a report psr be prepared.the psr deemed maldonado responsible for three transactions involving kilograms of cocaine,producing a base offense level of,which was reduced to after a three level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.c.the psr also assessed maldonado two criminal history points,one point for each of two prior massachusetts offenses a conviction for driving under the influence in and a conviction for attaching plates in.
the attaching plates is the focus of this for affixing license plates owned by another individual to maldonado own car.ch.this offense was detected after maldonado was pulled over in a routine traffic stop and produced a registration for his car that did not match the vehicle license plate number.the state prosecution was continued without a finding cwof after maldonado admitted to sufficient facts at a disposition hearing in november the effect was six months unsupervised probation and eventual dismissal of the case,but it counts as a conviction.f united states reyes,cir per curiam.
after pleading guilty to the instant drug offense,maldonado asked the district court to determine his eligibility for f safety valve adjustment this exempts a defendant from mandatory minimum sentences if certain conditions are being that the defendant not have more than criminal history point.maldonado argued that attaching plates was a minor offense that,under section c of the guidelines,should not generate a criminal history point.
the district court disagreed and imposed the mandatory minimum sentence from which maldonado now appeals.had the court not counted the conviction,maldonado could have qualified for the safety valve exception if he had made the required truthful proffer to the prosecutor of information concerning the crime.this would have eliminated the mandatory minimum and,as his adjusted offense level under the guidelines equated to a range of to months,his sentence might well have been lower.maldonado had a number of convictions for other offenses,but few apart from the recent drug transactions leading to his present conviction were very significant.
under the guidelines,prior misdemeanor convictions are counted in a defendant criminal history score except when each of three conditions is satisfied the sentence imposed for the prior conviction is less than one year probation or days imprisonment the prior offense is dissimilar to the offense for which the defendant is now being prosecuted and the prior offense is or is similar to one of the following offenses,which we call the listed offenses 
careless or reckless driving 
contempt of court 
disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace 
driving without a license or with a revoked or suspended license 
false information to a police officer 
hindering or failure to obey a police officer 
insufficient funds check 
leaving the scene of an accident 
prostitution 
resisting arrest 
trespassing.
c.section c lists a number of offenses that are never counted,such as minor traffic infractions,but attaching plates is not on that list.
the first two conditions for exclusion of the attaching plates offense are satisfied maldonado received only six months probation for his attaching plates offense,and attaching plates is clearly dissimilar to the drug offenses for which he is now being sentenced.whether maldonado would satisfy the proffer requirement of providing truthful information was never determined,because the court accepted the psr recommendation that attaching plates was not similar to one of the listed offenses.that ruling is the only one before us on this appeal.
this issue turns on the application of general standards to particular facts,but it implicates our reading of the guideline and raises what may be a recurring question so in maldonado favor we review the ruling de novo rather than affording deference to the district court view conceivably,in a different case,application of this guideline could involve disputed facts as to which deference would certainly be due to the district judge findings,but no such disputes are apparent here.
the guidelines application notes provide some limited assistance in determining whether a prior offense is similar to a listed offense 
in determining whether an unlisted offense is similar to an offense listed in subdivision c or c,the court should use a common sense approach that includes consideration of relevant factors such as i a comparison of punishments imposed for the listed and unlisted offenses ii the perceived seriousness of the offense as indicated by the level of punishment iii the elements of the offense iv the level of culpability involved and v the degree to which the commission of the offense indicates a likelihood of recurring criminal conduct.
cmt.see also united states hardeman,cir.this portion of the application notes became effective on november,app.c,amend.supp,subsequent to the conduct in this case,but prior to maldonado sentencing however,it reflects criteria that a court could employ with or without the application note.
maldonado argues that attaching plates is similar to two listed offenses driving without a license or with a revoked or suspended license,and providing false information to a police officer.both driving without a license or with a revoked or suspended license and providing false information to a police officer resemble the attaching plates offense in that all three involve affirmative misrepresentation to the authorities,either explicit or implied.two of the three are related directly to motor vehicle operation and the third lying to the police often so.
the government responds here,as it did in the district court,that the massachusetts crime of attaching plates includes as an element the intention to conceal identity,which implies a fraudulent purpose and differentiates it from the relevant listed offenses.the attaching plates statute states that 
any person who attaches or permits to be attached to a motor vehicle or trailer a number plate assigned to another motor vehicle or trailer with intent to conceal the identity of such motor vehicle or trailer,shall be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than ten days,or both.
laws ch,emphasis added.
if this underscored language were taken to require some additional malign purpose beyond knowledge that the plates were for a different example,to conceal the identity of a stolen car in aid of a car would surely be worse than the usual driving without a license offense.the district judge did not explain his ruling but the psr used a fraud and deception label for the attaching plates offense,echoing the government position,and it may well have been the district judge thinking.
but it turns on citations provided by neither despite the ominous phrasing,massachusetts treats any deliberate,and not otherwise wicked,affixing of another plates as constituting the offense.in one remarkable case,a youngster was convicted of attaching plates after driving a repaired truck with an improper plate to the residence of a teacher at his school this was so even though the teacher had wrongly assured him that to do so was all right.middlesex reg l vocational technical sch.dist.comm.superior court.
in another case,a used car dealer stated that he had been stopped and cited by police many times for driving an unregistered and uninsured vehicle with attached plates because he had no access to dealer plates in demonstrating vehicles for sale.commonwealth daley.in other words,intent to conceal apparently means only that one knew that the attached plate did not belong t
