raymond challenges the procedural reasonableness of a sentence imposed following his guilty plea for illegal possession of a machine gun.he also brings an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.after careful consideration,we affirm his sentence and dismiss his ineffective assistance claim without prejudice.
on september,police officers stopped fuentes,who was driving his honda accord in reverse in the middle of a street,near a known drug trafficking point in san juan,puerto rico while one officer issued a ticket to fuentes,a canine trained to detect narcotics,accompanied by another officer,marked two separate locations on fuentes vehicle.fuentes fled the scene and was not arrested.
officers subsequently sealed fuentes vehicle,transported it to police headquarters,and obtained a search warrant.a subsequent search of the vehicle revealed a secret compartment near the center of the dashboard.from the compartment,officers seized a glock pistol modified to fire automatically,several gun magazines,and rounds of ammunition.on september,a grand jury returned a sealed indictment charging fuentes with illegal possession of a machine gun,in violation of o and a.
fuentes was arrested about a year later,in july.he initially pled not guilty,and a trial was scheduled.but he ultimately moved to change his plea mere days before the trial was set to begin,and entered a straight plea that is,without a plea agreement to the sole charge in the indictment.
fuentes presentence report psr,to which he did not object,indicated that his criminal history category was i,and that his base offense level bol was eighteen,pursuant to a.however,because fuentes accepted responsibility,his total offense level tol was reduced to sixteen,see.a,thus setting the applicable guidelines sentencing range gsr at to months.at the sentencing hearing,fuentes recommended a sentence of months,while the government asked for sixty.after reviewing the facts of this case and expressing a heightened need for community deterrence,the judge sentenced fuentes to months imprisonment,followed by months of supervised release.
on appeal,fuentes challenges the reasonableness of his sentence on two grounds.he contends that the district court erred by failing to apply an additional reduction to his tol for acceptance of responsibility under b.he also argues that the district court reliance on certain community factors did not justify the upward variance.finally,fuentes brings an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.we address each in turn.
sentencing challenges 
we review criminal sentences under a deferential standard.united states martin,cir.quoting gall united states.in applying this standard,we examine a sentence procedural and substantive reasonableness.united states dávila gonzález,cir.here,fuentes assigns only procedural errors to his sentence.see martin,at noting that failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range is procedural united states narváez soto,cir.treating a challenge about purportedly impermissible sentencing considerations as procedural.unpreserved procedural challenges engender plain error review.dávila gonzález,at.in these circumstances,we will reverse the district court only upon a showing that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.
first,fuentes argues that while the district court appropriately reduced his tol by two levels under a for acceptance of responsibility,it erred by not reducing the tol by an additional level under b.section b provides,in relevant part if the defendant qualifies for a decrease under subsection a,the bol determined prior to the operation of subsection a is level or greater,and upon motion of the government decrease the offense level by additional level.b emphasis added.the government did not make such a motion,and fuentes did not request it either in opposition to the psr or during sentencing.
we need not decide as the government suggests whether fuentes waived or merely forfeited his challenge by failing to raise it below,as his claim falters on plain error review.see,united states,cir.the district court did not commit an error,plain or otherwise,in not granting the additional reduction sua sponte.as we have previously held in,at,not only does the plain text of b provide that the government must first make a motion for the reduction but the relevant commentary for this section also emphasizes the government discretion to refuse to do so 
because the government is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has assisted authorities in a manner that avoids preparing for trial,an adjustment under subsection b may only be granted upon a formal motion by the government at the time of sentencing.
at quoting b cmt.accordingly,the district court did not err in not awarding the additional reduction.
discerning no error on this front,we proceed to fuentes next challenge,which he preserved below.fuentes maintains that the court decision to impose a variant sentence lacked factual support,because it was heavily premised on the court concern with general violence in the community.for instance,he points to the sentencing court statement that it was sick and tired of violent crimes and guns.he posits that the court went too far in speculat ing about the lives of violent criminals,at the expense of failing to consider facts specific to his case 
when a court imposes a variant sentence,its reasons for doing so should typically be rooted either in the nature and circumstances of the offense or the characteristics of the offender.united states,cir.quoting martin,at.while fuentes is correct that the court had an eye towards community deterrence in fashioning his sentence,we have repeatedly explained that d eterrence is widely recognized as an important factor in the sentencing calculus.united states díaz arroyo,cir.quoting,at alteration in original see also a b.indeed,community context can inform and contextualize the relevant need for deterrence,at.the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing its assessment that there was an arsenal of weapons out there in the streets to bear on its conclusion that a strong deterrent was warranted in this case.
although i t is possible for a sentencing judge to focus too much on the community and too little on the individual,id.at,that did not happen here.the sentencing court identified several factors,beyond the need for general deterrence,to support its view that fuentes offense was out of line with a heartland case for which the calculated gsr would have been appropriate.among these were the fact that fuentes modified firearm was housed in a secret compartment,and that it was found with extended magazines and rounds of ammunition,some of which was suitable for an rifle.moreover,the court found it significant that fuentes traffic stop occurred near a known drug trafficking area,and that he fled the scene.the sentencing judge discussion of these facts blunts fuentes claim that community factors improperly shaded his variant sentence 
ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
finally,we decline to address fuentes claims that his counsel was ineffective for failing to ask for the additional reduction in fuentes tol and for apparently conce ding that fuentes had no other purpose than to use the weapon to commit crimes.unless counsel prejudicially deficient performance is manifestly apparent from the record,we do not entertain ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal.united states,cir.quoting united states wyatt,cir.such an extraordinary circumstance is not apparent in the record before us.united states hicks,cir.quoting united states martins,cir.thus,we dismiss this claim without prejudice,leaving fuentes free to raise it in a collateral proceeding under.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm fuentes sentence and dismiss his claim without prejudice.
we draw these facts to which fuentes did not object from the colloquy and transcript of the sentencing hearing.
although there are some excepti
