petitioner richard marvin thompson thompson is a lawful permanent resident who was convicted of a deportable offense.thompson contends that he has derivative citizenship from his father naturalization and therefore can not be deported.former section a of the immigration and nationality act provides that a child derives citizenship from the naturalization of one parent if the naturalized parent has legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents the naturalization occurs before the child turns eighteen years old and the child is a lawful permanent resident either at the time of or after the naturalization.a repealed.
in his petition for review,thompson argues the board of immigration appeals bia incorrectly rejected his argument that his parents were in a marriage and legally separated within the meaning of former section a when they ceased cohabitation.but thompson has not proven that his parents relationship or separation was legally recognized.as a result,we deny thompson petition.
thompson was born in to jamaican parents in jamaica.sometime after thompson birth,thompson father moved to the united states and,in,became a naturalized citizen.in,thompson father petitioned for thompson to immigrate to the united states.later that year,at the age of fourteen,thompson was admitted as a lawful permanent resident and moved to the united states to live with his father.thompson remained in the custody of his father until he reached adulthood.
in,thompson pleaded guilty to one count of assault in violation of section of the connecticut general statutes and received a sentence of five years imprisonment,suspended,and three years probation.the parties do not dispute that this qualified as a removable offense under either a a iii an aggravated felony or a a i a crime of moral turpitude committed within five years after admission and for which a sentence of one year or more of imprisonment could be imposed.
by,the government had detained thompson and initiated deportation proceedings against him.thompson then filed an n application for citizenship with customs and immigration services uscis,claiming that he derived citizenship from his father naturalization.uscis denied thompson application,explaining that because thompson parents were never legally married,they could not have legally separated as required by section a.an immigration judge adopted uscis reasoning fully and ordered thompson be removed to jamaica.
thompson appealed the removal order to the bia.in his appeal,thompson asserted that his parents were common law spouses in jamaica who legally separated when they ceased cohabitation.the bia rejected this argument on the grounds that thompson had not proven that jamaica recognized marriage at the time of his birth and that the cessation of cohabitation did not qualify as a legal separation.based on these conclusions,the bia affirmed the removal order.
ii.discussion 
thompson citizenship claim depends on former section a,which reads 
a child born outside of the united states of alien parents becomes a citizen of the united states upon fulfillment of the following conditions 
the naturalization of the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents and if 
such naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years and 
such child is residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years.
a repealed the parties do not dispute that thompson meets subsections and requirements.what the parties do dispute is whether thompson meets subsection requirement that his father had legal custody of thompson following a legal separation from thompson mother.
we have previously held that the term having legal custody as used in former section a is a question of federal statutory interpretation.fierro reno,cir.but because l egal relationships between parents and children are typically governed by state law,there being no federal law of domestic relations,the term legal custody as used in former section a should be taken presumptively to mean legal custody under the law of the state in question.id.at quoting de sylva ballentine.based on the same reasoning,we believe legal separation as used in former section a presumptively incorporates the wedlock rules of the state or,in thompson case,country in which the legal relationship originated and terminated.see also wedderburn ins,cir looking to jamaican law to determine marital status of petitioner parents.
simply put,thompson claim of citizenship under former section a fails because he can not prove his parents were in a legally recognized relationship from which they could legally separate.as thompson points out,jamaica property rights of spouses act property act,defines the term spouse as including persons who cohabitated together as if they were in law husband and wife for a period of not less than five years.property rights of spouses act,pt.i,act jam.but thompson fails to explain how a law enacted in,and with an operational date of,helps us understand whether a relationship that must have ended by the year thompson father became a united states citizen was legally recognized.wedderburn,at recognizing the petitioners diligent search did not find any jamaican law proving that jamaica recognized marriages as of.in fact,part v of the property act states that it does not affect any legal proceeding in respect of property instituted or any remedy in respect of any such legal proceeding acquired,accrued or incurred prior to its other words,by its terms,it is not retroactive.property rights of spouses act,pt,act.without a legally recognized relationship,thompson parents could not have legally separated as required by section a.
thompson failure to prove that jamaica recognized marriages while his parents were in a relationship is dispositive of his claim.but even if the property act applied retroactively,we note that thomson has adduced no evidence showing his parents were spouses within its definition.because the government proved that thompson was born abroad,thompson had the burden of proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence his derivative citizenship.leal santos mukasey,cir.the only evidence of this fact in the administrative record is thompson bare assertion in his bia appeal although this court may consider evidence outside of the administrative record,batista ashcroft,cir,thompson has not provided any additional evidence on appeal.for example,there are no affidavits from either of thompson parents stating that they lived together at the time of his birth.thompson himself only provided this assertion through filings by his counsel thus the factual basis for thompson claim is also suspect.
finally,even if thompson parents were in a marriage,thompson has failed to provide any details factual or legal showing that they legally separated.thompson argument is entirely premised on the idea that spouses legally separate when they cease cohabitation.thompson has failed to cite any authority,federal or jamaican,that supports his purported definition of legal separation and we have not found any.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,thompson petition for review is denied.
the child citizenship act of,stat,repealed this provision.the bia has interpreted the child citizenship act as applying only to individuals who turned eighteen after its effective date.in re rodr√≠guez tejedor,wl bia.thompson turned eighteen before the child citizenship act effective date and never argued either at the administrative level or in his petition to this court that the child citizenship act new provisions should apply to his case.
in his bia brief,thompson directs the bia to look at a c opy of submission evidencing common law marriage relationship previously submitted to dhs on june.this submission was not included in the administrative record nor separately submitted to this court.moreover,uscis denial of thompson citizenship application states it requested tho
