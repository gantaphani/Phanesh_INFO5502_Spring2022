petitioner the orleans parish district attorney office concedes that,in prosecuting respondent thompson for attempted armed robbery,prosecutors violated brady maryland,by failing to disclose a crime lab report.because of his robbery conviction,thompson elected not to testify at his later murder trial and was convicted.a month before his scheduled execution,the lab report was discovered.a reviewing court vacated both convictions,and thompson was found not guilty in a retrial on the murder charge.he then filed suit against the district attorney office under,alleging,inter alia,that the brady violation was caused by the office deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train prosecutors to avoid such constitutional violations.the district court held that,to prove deliberate indifference,thompson did not need to show a pattern of similar brady violations when he could demonstrate that the need for training was obvious.the jury found the district attorney office liable for failure to train and awarded thompson damages.the fifth circuit affirmed by an equally divided court.
held a district attorney office may not be held liable under for failure to train its prosecutors based on a single brady violation.
a plaintiffs seeking to impose liability on local governments must prove that their injury was caused by action pursuant to official municipal policy,which includes the decisions of a government lawmakers,the acts of its policymaking officials,and practices so persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.monell new york city of social.a local government decision not to train certain employees about their legal duty to avoid violating citizens rights may rise to the level of an official government policy for purposes,but the failure to train must amount to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the untrained employees come into contact.canton harris.deliberate indifference in this context requires proof that city policymakers disregarded the known or obvious consequence that a particular omission in their training program would cause city employees to violate citizens constitutional rights.board of comm rs of bryan cty.brown.
b a pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees is ordinarily necessary to demonstrate deliberate indifference.bryan,supra,at.without notice that a course of training is deficient,decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a training program that will cause violations of constitutional rights.thompson does not contend that he proved a pattern of similar brady violations,and four reversals by louisiana courts for dissimilar brady violations in the years before the robbery trial could not have put the district attorney office on notice of the need for specific training.
c thompson mistakenly relies on the liability hypothesized in canton,contending that the brady violation in his case was the obvious consequence of failing to provide specific brady training and that this obviousness showing can substitute for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish municipal culpability.in canton,the court theorized that if a city armed its police force and deployed them into the public to capture fleeing felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly force,the failure to train could reflect the city deliberate indifference to the highly predictable consequence,namely,violations of constitutional rights.failure to train prosecutors in their brady obligations does not fall within the narrow range of canton hypothesized liability.the obvious need for specific legal training present in canton scenario police academy applicants are unlikely to be familiar with constitutional constraints on deadly force and,absent training,can not obtain that knowledge is absent here.attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the tools to interpret and apply legal principles,understand constitutional limits,and exercise legal judgment.they receive training before entering the profession,must usually satisfy continuing education requirements,often train on the job with more experienced attorneys,and must satisfy licensing standards and ongoing ethical obligations.prosecutors not only are equipped but are ethically bound to know what brady entails and to perform legal research when they are uncertain.thus,recurring constitutional violations are not the obvious consequence of failing to provide prosecutors with formal training.the nuance of the allegedly necessary training also distinguishes the case from the example in canton.here,the prosecutors were familiar with the general brady rule.thus,thompson can not rely on the lack of an ability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies the canton hypothetical,but must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular brady evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case.that sort of nuance simply can not support an inference of deliberate indifference here.contrary to the holding below,it does not follow that,because brady has gray areas and some brady decisions are difficult,prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing to train them amounts,as it must,to a decision by the city itself to violate the constitution.canton,at,concurring in part and dissenting in part.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
the orleans parish district attorney office now concedes that,in prosecuting respondent john thompson for attempted armed robbery,prosecutors failed to disclose evidence that should have been turned over to the defense under brady maryland.thompson was convicted.because of that conviction thompson elected not to testify in his own defense in his later trial for murder,and he was again convicted.thompson spent years in prison,including years on death row.one month before thompson scheduled execution,his investigator discovered the undisclosed evidence from his armed robbery trial.the reviewing court determined that the evidence was exculpatory,and both of thompson convictions were vacated.
after his release from prison,thompson sued petitioner harry connick,in his official capacity as the orleans parish district attorney,for damages under stat.thompson alleged that connick had failed to train his prosecutors adequately about their duty to produce exculpatory evidence and that the lack of training had caused the nondisclosure in thompson case.the jury awarded thompson million,and the court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed by an evenly divided en banc court.we granted certiorari to decide whether a district attorney office may be held liable under for failure to train based on a single brady violation.we hold that it can not.
in early,john thompson was charged with the murder of raymond liuzza,in new orleans.publicity following the murder charge led the victims of an unrelated armed robbery to identify thompson as their attacker.the district attorney charged thompson with attempted armed robbery.
as part of the robbery investigation,a crime scene technician took from one of the victims pants a swatch of fabric stained with the robber blood.approximately one week before thompson armed robbery trial,the swatch was sent to the crime laboratory.two days before the trial,assistant district attorney bruce whittaker received the crime lab report,which stated that the perpetrator had blood type b.there is no evidence that the prosecutors ever had thompson blood tested or that they knew what his blood type was.whittaker claimed he placed the report on assistant district attorney james williams desk,but williams denied seeing it.the report was never disclosed to thompson counsel.
williams tried the armed robbery case with assistant district attorney gerry deegan.on the first day of trial,deegan checked all of the physical evidence in the case out of the police property room,including the swatch.deegan then checked all of the evidence but the swatch into the courthouse property room.the prosecutors did not mention the swatch or the crime lab report at trial,and the jury convicted thompson of attempted armed robbery.
a few weeks later,williams and special prosecutor eric dubelier tried thompson for the liuzza murder.because of the armed robbery conviction,thompson chose not to testify in his own defense.he was convicted and sentenced to death.state thompson,so.in the years following thompson murder conviction,state and federal courts reviewed and denied his challenges to the conviction and sentence.see state ex rel.thompson cain,so.thompson cain.the state scheduled thompson execution for may.
in late april,thompson private investigator discovered the crime lab report from the armed robbery investigation in the files of the new orleans police crime laboratory.thompson was tested and found to have blood type o,proving that the blood on the swatch was not his.thompson attorneys presented this evidence to the district attorney office,which,in turn,moved to stay the execution and vacate thompson armed robbery conviction the louisiana court of appeals then reversed thompson murder conviction,concluding that the armed robbery conviction unconstitutionally deprived thompson of his right to testify in his own defense at the murder trial.state thompson.app,so.in,the district attorney office retried thompson for liuzza murder the jury found him not guilty.
thompson then brought this action against the district attorney office,connick,williams,and others,alleging that their conduct caused him to be wrongfully convicted,incarcerated for years,and nearly executed.the only claim that proceeded to trial was thompson claim under that the district attorney office had violated brady by failing to disclose the crime lab report in his armed robbery trial.see brady.thompson alleged liability under two theories the brady violation was caused by an unconstitutional policy of the district attorney office and the violation was caused by connick deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train the prosecutors in his office in order to avoid such constitutional violations.
before trial,connick conceded that the failure to produce the crime lab report constituted a brady violation see record.accordingly,the district court instructed the jury that the only issue was whether the nondisclosure was caused by either a policy,practice,or custom of the district attorney office or a deliberately indifferent failure to train the office prosecutors.record.
although no prosecutor remembered any specific training session regarding brady prior to,it was undisputed at trial that the prosecutors were familiar with the general brady requirement that the state disclose to the defense evidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused.prosecutors testified that office policy was to turn crime lab reports and other scientific evidence over to the defense.they also testified that,after the discovery of the undisclosed crime lab report in,prosecutors disagreed about whether it had to be disclosed under brady absent knowledge of thompson blood type.
the jury rejected thompson claim that an unconstitutional office policy caused the brady violation,but found the district attorney office liable for failing to train the prosecutors.the jury awarded thompson million in damages,and the district court added more than million in attorney fees and costs.
after the verdict,connick renewed his objection which he had raised on summary judgment that he could not have been deliberately indifferent to an obvious need for more or different brady training because there was no evidence that he was aware of a pattern of similar brady violations.the district court rejected this argument for the reasons that it had given in the summary judgment order.in that order,the court had concluded that a pattern of violations is not necessary to prove deliberate indifference when the need for training is so obvious.no.civ.ed,app.to pet.for cert,wl.relying on canton harris,the court had held that thompson could demonstrate deliberate indifference by proving that the da office knew to a moral certainty that assistan t district attorneys would acquire brady material,that without training it is not always obvious what brady requires,and that withholding brady material will virtually always lead to a substantial violation of constitutional rights.app.to pet.for cert,wl.
a panel of the court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed.the panel acknowledged that thompson did not present evidence of a pattern of similar brady violations,but held that thompson did not need to prove a pattern,at.according to the panel,thompson demonstrated that connick was on notice of an obvious need for brady training by presenting evidence that attorneys,often fresh out of law school,would undoubtedly be required to confront brady issues while at the da office,that erroneous decisions regarding brady evidence would result in serious constitutional violations,that resolution of brady issues was often unclear,and that training in brady would have been helpful.at.
the court of appeals sitting en banc vacated the panel opinion,granted rehearing,and divided evenly,thereby affirming the district court.per curiam.in four opinions,the divided en banc court disputed whether thompson could establish municipal liability for failure to train the prosecutors based on the single brady violation without proving a prior pattern of similar violations,and,if so,what evidence would make that showing.we granted certiorari.
the brady violation conceded in this case occurred when one or more of the four prosecutors involved with thompson armed robbery prosecution failed to disclose the crime lab report to thompson counsel.under thompson theory,he bore the burden of proving both that connick,the policymaker for the district attorney office,was deliberately indifferent to the need to train the prosecutors about their brady disclosure obligation with respect to evidence of this type and that the lack of training actually caused the brady violation in this case.connick argues that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because thompson did not prove that he was on actual or constructive notice of,and therefore deliberately indifferent to,a need for more or different brady training.we agree 
title provides in relevant part 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress.
a municipality or other local government may be liable under this section if the governmental body itself subjects a person to a deprivation of rights or causes a person to be subjected to such deprivation.see monell new york city of social.but,under,local governments are responsible only for their own illegal acts.pembaur cincinnati,citing monell,at.they are not vicariously liable under for their employees actions.see,at canton,at board of comm rs of bryan cty.brown,collecting cases.
plaintiffs who seek to impose liability on local governments under must prove that action pursuant to official municipal policy caused their injury.monell,at see,at.official municipal policy includes the decisions of a government lawmakers,the acts of its policymaking officials,and practices so persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law.see pembaur,supra,at adickes kress.these are action s for which the municipality is actually responsible.pembaur,supra,at.
in limited circumstances,a local government decision not to train certain employees about their legal duty to avoid violating citizens rights may rise to the level of an official government policy for purposes of.a municipality culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its most tenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train.see oklahoma city tuttle,plurality opinion a policy of inadequate training is far more nebulous,and a good deal further removed from the constitutional violation,than was the policy in monell to satisfy the statute,a municipality failure to train its employees in a relevant respect must amount to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the untrained employees come into contact.canton,at.only then can such a shortcoming be properly thought of as a city policy or custom that is actionable under.at.
d eliberate indifference is a stringent standard of fault,requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.bryan,at.thus,when city policymakers are on actual or constructive notice that a particular omission in their training program causes city employees to violate citizens constitutional rights,the city may be deemed deliberately indifferent if the policymakers choose to retain that program,at.the city policy of inaction in light of notice that its program will cause constitutional violations is the functional equivalent of a decision by the city itself to violate the constitution.canton,at,concurring in part and dissenting in part.a less stringent standard of fault for a claim would result in de facto respondeat superior liability on municipalities.at see also pembaur,supra,at opinion of brennan,m unicipal liability under attaches where and only where a deliberate choice to follow a course of action is made from among various alternatives by the relevant officials 
a pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees is ordinarily necessary to demonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train.bryan,at.policymakers continued adherence to an approach that they know or should know has failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees may establish the conscious disregard for the consequences of their action the deliberate indifference necessary to trigger municipal liability.at.without notice that a course of training is deficient in a particular respect,decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a training program that will cause violations of constitutional rights.
although thompson does not contend that he proved a pattern of similar brady violations,at,vacated,en banc,he points out that,during the ten years preceding his armed robbery trial,louisiana courts had overturned four convictions because of brady violations by prosecutors in connick office those four reversals could not have put connick on notice that the office brady training was inadequate with respect to the sort of brady violation at issue here.none of those cases involved failure to disclose blood evidence,a crime lab report,or physical or scientific evidence of any kind.because those incidents are not similar to the violation at issue here,they could not have put connick on notice that specific training was necessary to avoid this constitutional violation 
instead of relying on a pattern of similar brady violations,thompson relies on the liability that this court hypothesized in canton.he contends that the brady violation in his case was the obvious consequence of failing to provide specific brady training,and that this showing of obviousness can substitute for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish municipal culpability.
in canton,the court left open the possibility that,in a narrow range of circumstances,a pattern of similar violations might not be necessary to show deliberate indifference.bryan,supra,at.the court posed the hypothetical example of a city that arms its police force with firearms and deploys the armed officers into the public to capture fleeing felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly force.canton,supra,at.given the known frequency with which police attempt to arrest fleeing felons and the predictability that an officer lacking specific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens rights,the court theorized that a city decision not to train the officers about constitutional limits on the use of deadly force could reflect the city deliberate indifference to the highly predictable consequence,namely,violations of constitutional rights.bryan,supra,at.the court sought not to foreclose the possibility,however rare,that the unconstitutional consequences of failing to train could be so patently obvious that a city could be liable under without proof of a pattern of violations.
failure to train prosecutors in their brady obligations does not fall within the narrow range of canton hypothesized liability.the obvious need for specific legal training that was present in the canton scenario is absent here.armed police must sometimes make decisions with consequences.there is no reason to assume that police academy applicants are familiar with the constitutional constraints on the use of deadly force.and,in the absence of training,there is no way for novice officers to obtain the legal knowledge they require.under those circumstances there is an obvious need for some form of training.in stark contrast,legal t raining is what differentiates attorneys from average public employees.at opinion of clement.
attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the tools to interpret and apply legal principles,understand constitutional limits,and exercise legal judgment.before they may enter the profession and receive a law license,all attorneys must graduate from law school or pass a substantive examination attorneys in the vast majority of jurisdictions must do both.see.state bar lsba,articles of incorporation.stat.ann,ch,west supp.as amended through.these threshold requirements are designed to ensure that all new attorneys have learned how to find,understand,and apply legal rules.united states cronic,noting that the presumption that the lawyer is competent to provide the guiding hand that the defendant needs applies even to young and inexperienced lawyers in their first jury trial and even when the case is complex.
nor does professional training end at graduation.most jurisdictions require attorneys to satisfy requirements.see,lsba,articles of incorporation,rule b effective.sup.rule xxx effective.even those few jurisdictions that do not impose mandatory requirements mandate that attorneys represent their clients competently and encourage attorneys to engage in continuing study and education.see.rule conduct and comment west.before louisiana adopted requirements,it imposed similar general competency requirements on its state bar.lsba,articles of incorporation,ec,dr west effective.
attorneys who practice with other attorneys,such as in district attorney offices,also train on the job as they learn from more experienced attorneys.for instance,here in the orleans parish district attorney office,junior prosecutors were trained by senior prosecutors who supervised them as they worked together to prepare cases for trial,and trial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.senior attorneys also circulated court decisions and instructional memoranda to keep the prosecutors abreast of relevant legal developments.
in addition,attorneys in all jurisdictions must satisfy character and fitness standards to receive a law license and are personally subject to an ethical regime designed to reinforce the profession standards.see,lsba,articles of incorporation,see generally,code of professional responsibility.trial lawyers have a duty to bring to bear such skill and knowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial testing process.strickland washington.prosecutors have a special duty to seek justice,not merely to convict.lsba,articles of incorporation,ec aba standards for criminal justice c ed.among prosecutors unique ethical obligations is the duty to produce brady evidence to the defense.see,lsba,articles of incorporation,ec aba model rule of conduct d an attorney who violates his or her ethical obligations is subject to professional discipline,including sanctions,suspension,and disbarment.see,lsba,articles of incorporation,dr aba model rule of conduct.
in light of this regime of legal training and professional responsibility,recurring constitutional violations are not the obvious consequence of failing to provide prosecutors with formal training about how to obey the law.bryan,at.prosecutors are not only equipped but are also ethically bound to know what brady entails and to perform legal research when they are uncertain.a district attorney is entitled to rely on prosecutors professional training and ethical obligations in the absence of specific reason,such as a pattern of violations,to believe that those tools are insufficient to prevent future constitutional violations in the usual and recurring situations with which the prosecutors must deal.canton,at.a licensed attorney making legal judgments,in his capacity as a prosecutor,about brady material simply does not present the same highly predictable constitutional danger as canton untrained officer.
a second significant difference between this case and the example in canton is the nuance of the allegedly necessary training.the canton hypothetical assumes that the armed police officers have no knowledge at all of the constitutional limits on the use of deadly force.but it is undisputed here that the prosecutors in connick office were familiar with the general brady rule.thompson complaint therefore can not rely on the utter lack of an ability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies the canton hypothetical,but rather must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular brady evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case.that sort of nuance simply can not support an inference of deliberate indifference here.as the court said in canton,i n virtually every instance where a person has had his or her constitutional rights violated by a city employee,a plaintiff will be able to point to something the city could have done to prevent the unfortunate incident.at citing tuttle,at plurality opinion.
thompson suggests that the absence of any formal training sessions about brady is equivalent to the complete absence of legal training that the court imagined in canton.but liability is concerned with the substance of the training,not the particular instructional format.the statute does not provide plaintiffs or courts carte blanche to micromanage local governments throughout the united states.
we do not assume that prosecutors will always make correct brady decisions or that guidance regarding specific brady questions would not assist prosecutors.but showing merely that additional training would have been helpful in making difficult decisions does not establish municipal liability.p rov ing that an injury or accident could have been avoided if an employee had had better or more training,sufficient to equip him to avoid the particular conduct will not suffice.canton,supra,at.the possibility of liability that the court left open in canton is not this case 
the dissent rejects our holding that canton hypothesized liability does not,as a legal matter,encompass failure to train prosecutors in their brady obligation.it would instead apply the canton hypothetical to this case,and thus devotes almost all of its opinion to explaining why the evidence supports liability under that theory but the dissent attempt to address our holding by pointing out that not all prosecutors will necessarily have enrolled in criminal procedure class misses the point.see post,at.the reason why the canton hypothetical is inapplicable is that attorneys,unlike police officers,are equipped with the tools to find,interpret,and apply legal principles.
by the end of its opinion,however,the dissent finally reveals that its real disagreement is not with our holding today,but with this court precedent.the dissent does not see any reason,post,at,for the court conclusion in bryan county that a pattern of violations is ordinarily necessary to demonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train,at,at explaining why a pattern of violations is ordinarily necessary.but post,at describing our reliance on bryan county as imply ing a new limitation on.as our precedent makes clear,proving that a municipality itself actually caused a constitutional violation by failing to train the offending employee presents difficult problems of proof,and we must adhere to a stringent standard of fault,lest municipal liability under collapse into respondeat superior bryan county,at,see canton,at.
the district court and the court of appeals panel erroneously believed that thompson had proved deliberate indifference by showing the obviousness of a need for additional training.they based this conclusion on connick awareness that prosecutors would confront brady issues while at the district attorney office inexperienced prosecutors were expected to understand brady requirements brady has gray areas that make for difficult choices and erroneous decisions regarding brady evidence would result in constitutional violations,at app.to pet.for cert,wl.this is insufficient.
it does not follow that,because brady has gray areas and some brady decisions are difficult,prosecutors will so obviously make wrong decisions that failing to train them amounts to a decision by the city itself to violate the constitution.canton,at,concurring in part and dissenting in part.to prove deliberate indifference,thompson needed to show that connick was on notice that,absent additional specified training,it was highly predictable that the prosecutors in his office would be confounded by those gray areas and make incorrect brady decisions as a result.in fact,thompson had to show that it was so predictable that failing to train the prosecutors amounted to conscious disregard for defendants brady rights.see bryan,at canton,supra,at.he did not do so.
the role of a prosecutor is to see that justice is done.berger united states.it is as much a prosecutor duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.ibid.by their own admission,the prosecutors who tried thompson armed robbery case failed to carry out that responsibility.but the only issue before us is whether connick,as the policymaker for the district attorney office,was deliberately indifferent to the need to train the attorneys under his authority.
we conclude that this case does not fall within the narrow range of liability hypothesized in canton as a possible exception to the pattern of violations necessary to prove deliberate indifference in actions alleging failure to train.the district court should have granted connick judgment as a matter of law on the claim because thompson did not prove a pattern of similar violations that would establish that the policy of inaction was the functional equivalent of a decision by the city itself to violate the constitution.canton,supra,at opinion of.
the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit is reversed.
it is so ordered.
harry connick,district attorney,et,petitioners john thompson 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice scalia,with whom justice alito joins,concurring.
i join the court opinion in full.i write separately only to address several aspects of the dissent.
the dissent lengthy excavation of the trial record is a puzzling exertion.the question presented for our review is whether a municipality is liable for a single brady violation by one of its prosecutors,even though no pattern or practice of prior violations put the municipality on notice of a need for specific training that would have prevented it.see brady maryland.that question is a legal one whether a brady violation presents one of those rare circumstances we hypothesized in canton footnote,in which the need for training in constitutional requirements is so obvious ex ante that the municipality failure to provide that training amounts to deliberate indifference to constitutional violations.see canton harris.
the dissent defers consideration of this question until page of its opinion.it first devotes considerable space to allegations that connick prosecutors misunderstood brady when asked about it at trial,see post,at opinion of ginsburg,and to supposed gaps in the brady guidance provided by connick office to prosecutors,including deficiencies unrelated to the specific brady violation at issue in this case in a policy manual published by connick office three years after thompson trial,see post,at.none of that is relevant.thompson theory at trial was not based on a pervasive culture of indifference to brady,but rather on the inevitability of mistakes over enough iterations of criminal trials.the district court instructed the jury it could find connick deliberately indifferent if 
first the district attorney was certain that prosecutors would confront the situation where they would have to decide which evidence was required by the constitution to be provided to an accused second the situation involved a difficult choice,or one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling,such that additional training,supervision,or monitoring was clearly needed and third the wrong choice by a prosecutor in that situation will frequently cause a deprivation of an accused constitutional rights.app.
that theory of deliberate indifference would repeal the law of in favor of the law of large numbers.brady mistakes are inevitable.so are all species of error routinely confronted by prosecutors authorizing a bad warrant losing a claim crossing the line in closing argument or eliciting hearsay that violates the confrontation clause.nevertheless,we do not have de facto respondeat superior liability,canton,at,for each such violation under the rubric of simply because the municipality does not have a professional educational program covering the specific violation in sufficient depth were thompson theory the law,there would have been no need for canton footnote to confine its hypothetical to the extreme circumstance of arming police officers with guns without telling them about the constitutional limitations upon shooting fleeing felons the district court instructions cover every recurring situation in which citizens rights can be violated.
that result can not be squared with our admonition that liability is available only in limited circumstances,at,and that a pattern of violations is ordinarily necessary to establish municipal culpability and causation,board of comm rs of bryan cty.brown.these restrictions are indispensable because without them,failure to train would become a talismanic incantation producing municipal liability i n virtually every instance where a person has had his or her constitutional rights violated by a city employee which is what monell rejects.canton,at.worse,it would engage the federal courts in an endless exercise of municipal programs,thereby diminishing the autonomy of state and local governments.ibid.
perhaps for that reason,the dissent does not seriously contend that thompson theory of recovery was proper.rather,it accuses connick of acquiescing in that theory at trial.see post,at.the accusation is false.connick central claim was and is that liability for a brady violation can not be premised on a single incident,but requires a pattern or practice of previous violations.he pressed that argument at the summary judgment stage but was rebuffed.at trial,when connick offered a jury instruction to the same effect,the trial judge effectively told him to stop bringing up the subject 
connick counsel also,as part of that definition in that same location,your honor,we would like to include language that says that deliberate indifference to training requires a pattern of similar violations and proof of deliberate indifference requires more than a single isolated act.thompson counsel that not the law,your honor.the court no,i not giving that.that was in your motion for summary judgment that i denied.tr.
nothing more is required to preserve a claim of error.see fed.rule civ.proc.d b 
but in any event,to recover from a municipality under,a plaintiff must satisfy a rigorous standard of causation,bryan,at he must demonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.at.thompson can not meet that standard.the withholding of evidence in his case was almost certainly caused not by a failure to give prosecutors specific training,but by miscreant prosecutor gerry deegan willful suppression of evidence he believed to be exculpatory,in an effort to railroad thompson.according to deegan colleague michael riehlmann,in deegan confessed to him in the same conversation in which deegan revealed he had only a few months to live that he had suppressed blood evidence in the armed robbery trial of john thompson that in some way exculpated the defendant.app.see also,at deegan told me that he had failed to inform the defense of exculpatory information i have no reason to disbelieve that account,particularly since riehlmann testimony hardly paints a flattering picture of himself riehlmann kept silent about deegan misconduct for another five years,as a result of which he incurred professional sanctions.see in re riehlmann,so.and if riehlmann story is true,then the moving force,bryan,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted,behind the suppression of evidence was deegan,not a failure of continuing legal education.
the dissent suspends disbelief about this,insisting that with proper brady training,surely at least one of the prosecutors in thompson trial would have turned over the lab report and blood swatch.post,at.but training must consist of more than mere broad encomiums of brady we have made clear that the identified deficiency in a city training program must be closely related to the ultimate injury.canton,supra,at.so even indulging the dissent assumption that thompson prosecutors failed to disclose the lab report in good faith in a way that could be prevented by training what sort of training would have prevented the nondisclosure of a blood report not known to be exculpatory 
perhaps a better question to ask is what legally accurate training would have prevented it.the dissent suggestion is to instruct prosecutors to ignore the portion of brady limiting prosecutors disclosure obligations to evidence that is favorable to an accused,at.instead,the dissent proposes that connick could have communicated to orleans parish prosecutors,in no uncertain terms,that,i f you have physical evidence that,if tested,can establish the innocence of the person who is charged,you have to turn it over.post,at,quoting tr.of oral arg.though labeled a training suggestion,the dissent proposal is better described as a sub silentio expansion of the substantive law of brady.if any of our cases establishes such an obligation,i have never read it,and the dissent does not cite it 
since thompson trial,however,we have decided a case that appears to say just the opposite of the training the dissent would require in arizona youngblood,we held that unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police,failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.we acknowledged that brady makes the good or bad faith of the state irrelevant when the state fails to disclose to the defendant material exculpatory evidence,but concluded that the due process clause requires a different result when we deal with the failure of the state to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests,the results of which might have exonerated the defendant.at.perhaps one day we will recognize a distinction between failures to preserve from destruction evidence whose inculpatory or exculpatory character is unknown,and failures to turn such evidence over to the defense.but until we do so,a failure to train prosecutors to observe that distinction can not constitute deliberate indifference.
by now the reader has doubtless guessed the secret of this case there was probably no brady violation at all except for deegan which,since it was a,knowing violation,could not possibly be attributed to lack of training the dissent surely knows this,which is why it leans heavily on the fact that connick conceded that brady was violated.i can honor that concession in my analysis of the case because even if it extends beyond deegan deliberate actions,it remains irrelevant to connick training obligations.for any brady violation apart from deegan was surely on the very frontier of our brady jurisprudence connick could not possibly have been on notice decades ago that he was required to instruct his prosecutors to respect a right to untested evidence that we had not and still have not recognized.as a consequence,even if i accepted the dissent conclusion that liability could be premised on a single brady error,i could not agree that the lack of an accurate training regimen caused the violation connick has conceded.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice ginsburg,with whom justice breyer,justice sotomayor,and justice kagan join,dissenting.
in brady maryland,this court held that due process requires the prosecution to turn over evidence favorable to the accused and material to his guilt or punishment.that obligation,the parties have stipulated,was dishonored in this case consequently,john thompson spent years in prison,of them isolated on death row,before the truth came to light he was innocent of the charge of attempted armed robbery,and his subsequent trial on a murder charge,by prosecutorial design,was fundamentally unfair.
the court holds that the orleans parish district attorney office district attorney office or office can not be held liable,in a civil rights action under,for the grave injustice thompson suffered.that is so,the court tells us,because thompson has shown only an aberrant brady violation,not a routine practice of giving short shrift to brady requirements.the evidence presented to the jury that awarded compensation to thompson,however,points distinctly away from the court assessment.as the trial record in the action reveals,the conceded,prosecutorial transgressions were neither isolated nor atypical.
from the top down,the evidence showed,members of the district attorney office,including the district himself,misperceived brady compass and therefore inadequately attended to their disclosure obligations.throughout the pretrial and trial proceedings against thompson,the team of four engaged in prosecuting him for armed robbery and murder hid from the defense and the court exculpatory information thompson requested and had a constitutional right to receive.the prosecutors did so despite multiple opportunities,spanning nearly two decades,to set the record straight.based on the prosecutors conduct relating to thompson trials,a fact trier could reasonably conclude that inattention to brady was standard operating procedure at the district attorney office.
what happened here,the court opinion obscures,was no momentary oversight,no single incident of a lone officer misconduct.instead,the evidence demonstrated that misperception and disregard of brady disclosure requirements were pervasive in orleans parish.that evidence,i would hold,established persistent,deliberately indifferent conduct for which the district attorney office bears responsibility under.
i dissent from the court judgment mindful that brady violations,as this case illustrates,are not easily detected.but for a chance discovery made by a defense team investigator weeks before thompson scheduled execution,the evidence that led to his exoneration might have remained under wraps.the prosecutorial concealment thompson encountered,however,is bound to be repeated unless municipal agencies bear responsibility made tangible by liability for adequately conveying what brady requires and for monitoring staff compliance.failure to train,this court has said,can give rise to municipal liability under where the failure amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the untrained employees come into contact.canton harris.that standard is well met in this case.
i turn first to a contextual account of the brady violations that infected thompson trials.
in the early morning hours of december,an assailant shot and killed raymond liuzza,son of a prominent new orleans business executive,on the street fronting the victim home.only one witness saw the assailant.as recorded in two contemporaneous police reports,that eyewitness initially described the assailant as,six feet tall,with close cut hair.record,thompson is five feet eight inches tall and,at the time of the murder,styled his hair in a large afro.at.the police reports of the witness immediate identification were not disclosed to thompson or to the court.
while engaged in the murder investigation,the orleans parish prosecutors linked thompson to another violent crime committed three weeks later.on december,an assailant attempted to rob three siblings at gunpoint.during the struggle,the perpetrator blood stained the oldest child pant leg.that blood,preserved on a swatch of fabric cut from the pant leg by a crime scene analyst,was eventually tested.the test conclusively established that the perpetrator blood was type,at.thompson blood is type his prosecutors failed to disclose the existence of the swatch or the test results.
one month after the liuzza murder,richard perkins,a man who knew thompson,approached the liuzza family.perkins did so after the family announcement of a reward for information leading to the murderer conviction.police officers surreptitiously recorded the conversations as documented on tape,perkins told the family,i do mind helping you catch the perpetrator,but i would like you to help me and,you know,i help you.at.once the family assured perkins,we on your side,we want to try and help you,at,perkins intimated that thompson and another man,kevin freeman,had been involved in liuzza murder.perkins thereafter told the police what he had learned from freeman about the murder,and that information was recorded in a police report.based on perkins account,thompson and freeman were arrested on murder charges.
freeman was six feet tall and went by the name kojak because he kept his hair so closely trimmed that his scalp was visible.unlike thompson,freeman fit the eyewitness initial description of the liuzza assailant height and hair style.as the court notes,ante,at,freeman became the key witness for the prosecution at thompson trial for the murder of liuzza.
after thompson arrest for the liuzza murder,the father of the armed robbery victims saw a newspaper photo of thompson with a large afro hairstyle and showed it to his children.he reported to the district attorney office that the children had identified thompson as their attacker,and the children then picked that same photo out of a photographic lineup.record.indicting thompson on the basis of these questionable identifications,the district attorney office did not pause to test the pant leg swatch dyed by the perpetrator blood.this lapse ignored or overlooked a prosecutor notation that the office may wish to do a blood test.at.
the murder trial was scheduled to begin in.armed with the later indictment against thompson for robbery,however,the prosecutors made a strategic choice they switched the order of the two trials,proceeding first on the robbery indictment,at.their aim was twofold.a robbery conviction gained first would serve to inhibit thompson from testifying in his own defense at the murder trial,for the prior conviction could be used to impeach his credibility.in addition,an armed robbery conviction could be invoked at the penalty phase of the murder trial in support of the prosecution plea for the death penalty,at.
recognizing the need for an effective prosecution team,petitioner harry connick,district attorney for the parish of orleans,appointed his,eric dubelier,as special prosecutor in both cases.dubelier enlisted jim williams to try the armed robbery case and to assist him in the murder case.gerry deegan assisted williams in the armed robbery case.bruce whittaker,the fourth prosecutor involved in the cases,had approved thompson armed robbery indictment 
during pretrial proceedings in the armed robbery case,thompson filed a motion requesting access to all materials and information favorable to the defendant and material and relevant to the issue of guilt or punishment,as well as any results or reports of scientific tests or experiments.at.prosecutorial responses to this motion fell far short of brady compliance 
first,prosecutors blocked defense counsel inspection of the pant leg swatch stained by the robber blood.although dubelier april response stated,inspection to be permitted,at,the swatch was signed out from the property room at the next day,and was not returned until noon on april,the day before trial,at.thompson attorney inspected the evidence made available to him and found no blood evidence.no one told defense counsel about the swatch and its recent removal from the property room,at tr.but ante,at,thompson attorney had access to the evidence locker where the swatch was recorded as evidence.
second,dubelier or whittaker ordered the crime laboratory to rush a pretrial test of the swatch.tr.whittaker received the lab report,addressed to his attention,two days before trial commenced.immediately thereafter,he placed the lab report on williams desk.record.although the lab report conclusively identified the perpetrator blood type,at,the district attorney office never revealed the report to the defense 
third,deegan checked the swatch out of the property room on the morning of the first day of trial,but the prosecution did not produce the swatch at trial,at.deegan did not return the swatch to the property room after trial,and the swatch has never been found.tr.of oral arg.
b ased solely on the descriptions provided by the three victims,record,the jury convicted thompson of attempted armed robbery.the court sentenced him to years without possibility of parole the maximum available sentence.
prosecutors continued to disregard brady during the murder trial,held in may,at which the prosecution strategy achieved its aim by prosecuting thompson for armed robbery first and withholding blood evidence that might have exonerated thompson of that charge the district attorney office disabled thompson from testifying in his own defense at the murder trial as earlier observed,see supra,at,impeaching use of the prior conviction would have severely undermined thompson credibility.and because thompson was effectively stopped from testifying in his own defense,the testimony of the witnesses against him gained force.the prosecution failure to reveal evidence that could have impeached those witnesses helped to seal thompson fate.
first,the prosecution undermined thompson efforts to impeach perkins.perkins testified that he volunteered information to the police with no knowledge of reward money.record.because prosecutors had not produced the audiotapes of perkins conversations with the liuzza family or a police summary of the tapes,thompson attorneys could do little to cast doubt on perkins credibility.in closing argument,the prosecution emphasized that thompson presented no direct evidence that reward money had motivated any of the witnesses,at.
second,the prosecution impeded thompson impeachment of key witness kevin freeman.it did so by failing to disclose a police report containing perkins account of what he had learned from freeman about the murder.see supra,at.freeman trial testimony was materially inconsistent with that report.tr,record.lacking any knowledge of the police report,thompson could not point to the inconsistencies.
third,and most vital,the eyewitness initial description of the assailant hair,see supra,at,was of prime relevance,for it suggested that freeman,not thompson,murdered liuzza,see supra,at.the materiality of the eyewitness contemporaneous description of the murderer should have been altogether apparent to the prosecution.failure to produce the police reports setting out what the eyewitness first said not only undermined efforts to impeach that witness and the police officer who initially interviewed him.the omission left defense counsel without knowledge that the prosecutors were restyling the killer close cut hair into an afro.
prosecutors finessed the discrepancy between the eyewitness initial description and thompson appearance.they asked leading questions prompting the eyewitness to agree on the stand that the perpetrator hair was afro type,yet straight back.record.corroboratively,the police officer after refreshing his recollection by reviewing material at the prosecution table gave artful testimony.he characterized the witness initial description of the perpetrator hair as black and short,afro style.at emphasis added.as prosecutors well knew,nothing in the withheld police reports,which described the murderer hair simply as close cut,portrayed a perpetrator with an afro or hair.
the jury found thompson guilty of murder.having prevented thompson from testifying that freeman was the killer,the prosecution delivered its ultimate argument.because thompson was already serving a sentence for attempted armed robbery,the prosecution urged,the only way to punish him for murder was to execute him.the strategy worked as planned thompson was sentenced to death.
thompson discovered the prosecutors misconduct through a serendipitous series of events.in,nine years after thompson convictions,deegan,the assistant prosecutor in the armed robbery trial,learned he was terminally ill.soon thereafter,deegan confessed to his friend michael riehlmann that he had suppressed blood evidence in the armed robbery case,at.deegan did not heed riehlmann counsel to reveal what he had done.for five years,riehlmann,himself a former orleans parish prosecutor,kept deegan confession to himself,at.
on april,the state of louisiana scheduled thompson execution,at.in an effort to save his life,thompson attorneys hired a private investigator.deep in the crime lab archives,the investigator unearthed a microfiche copy of the lab report identifying the robber blood type.the copy showed that the report had been addressed to whittaker.see supra,at.thompson attorneys contacted whittaker,who informed riehlmann that the lab report had been found.riehlmann thereupon told whittaker that deegan had failed to turn over stuff that might have been exculpatory.tr.riehlmann prepared an affidavit describing deegan disclosure that he had intentionally suppressed blood evidence in the armed robbery trial of john thompson.record.
thompson lawyers presented to the trial court the crime lab report showing that the robber blood type was b,and a report identifying thompson blood type as o.this evidence proved thompson innocent of the robbery.the court immediately stayed thompson execution,at,and commenced proceedings to assess the newly discovered evidence.
connick sought an abbreviated hearing.a full hearing was unnecessary,he urged,because the office had confessed error and had moved to dismiss the armed robbery charges.see,at.the court insisted on a public hearing.given the history of this case,the court said,it was not willing to accept the representations that connick and his office made in their motion to dismiss.at.after a full day hearing,the court vacated thompson attempted armed robbery conviction and dismissed the charges.before doing so,the court admonished 
a ll day long there have been a number of young assistant sitting in this courtroom watching this,and i hope they take home and take to heart the message that this kind of conduct can not go on in this parish if this criminal justice system is going to work.at.
the district attorney office then initiated grand jury proceedings against the prosecutors who had withheld the lab report.connick terminated the grand jury after just one day.he maintained that the lab report would not be brady material if prosecutors did not know thompson blood type.tr.supra,at.and he told the investigating prosecutor that the grand jury w ould make his job more difficult.tr.in protest,that prosecutor tendered his resignation.
thereafter,the louisiana court of appeal reversed thompson murder conviction.state thompson,so.the unlawfully procured robbery conviction,the court held,had violated thompson right to testify and thus fully present his defense in the murder trial,at.the merits of several brady claims arising out of the murder trial,the court observed,had therefore become moot.so,at see also record but ante,at,suggesting that there were no brady violations in the murder prosecution because no court had adjudicated any violations 
undeterred by his assistants disregard of thompson rights,connick retried him for the liuzza murder.thompson defense was bolstered by evidence earlier unavailable to him ten exhibits the prosecution had not disclosed when thompson was first tried.the newly produced items included police reports describing the assailant in the murder case as having close cut hair,the police report recounting perkins meetings with the liuzza family,see supra,at,audio recordings of those meetings,and a supplemental police report.after deliberating for only minutes,the jury found thompson not guilty.
on may,having served more than years in prison for crimes he did not commit,thompson was released.
on july,thompson commenced a civil action under alleging that connick,other officials of the orleans parish district attorney office,and the office itself,had violated his constitutional rights by wrongfully withholding brady evidence.thompson sought to hold connick and the district attorney office liable for failure adequately to train prosecutors concerning their brady obligations.such liability attaches,i agree with the court,only when the failure amount s to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the untrained employees come into contact.ante,at quoting canton harris.i disagree,however,with the court conclusion that thompson failed to prove deliberate indifference.
having weighed all the evidence,the jury in the case found for thompson,concluding that the district attorney office had been deliberately indifferent to thompson brady rights and to the need for training and supervision to safeguard those rights.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to thompson,as appropriate in light of the verdic t rendered by the jury,patrick burget,i see no cause to upset the district court determination,affirmed by the fifth circuit,that ample evidence adduced at trial supported the jury verdict.record.
over years ago,we observed that a municipality failure to provide training may be so egregious that,even without notice of prior constitutional violations,the failure could properly be characterized as deliberate indifference to constitutional rights.canton,at.i n light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees,canton recognized,it may happen that the need for more or different training is so obvious,and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights,that the policymakers can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.at.thompson presented convincing evidence to satisfy this standard.
thompson suit proceeded to a jury trial on two theories of liability first,the orleans parish office official brady policy was unconstitutional and second,connick was deliberately indifferent to an obvious need to train his prosecutors about their brady obligations.connick brady policy directed prosecutors to turn over what was required by state and federal law,but no more.brief for petitioners.the jury thus understandably rejected thompson claim that the official policy itself was unconstitutional.ante,at.
the jury found,however,that connick was deliberately indifferent to the need to train prosecutors about brady command.on the special verdict form,the jury answered yes to the following question 
was the brady violation in the armed robbery case or any infringements of john thompson rights in the murder trial substantially caused by connick failure,through deliberate indifference,to establish policies and procedures to protect one accused of a crime from these constitutional violations record.
consistent with the question put to the jury,and without objection,the court instructed the jurors y ou are not limited to the nonproduced blood evidence and the resulting infringement of thompson right to testify at the murder trial.you may consider all of the evidence presented during this trial.tr.record but ante,at,ante,at scalia,concurring maintaining that the case involves a single brady violation.that evidence included a stipulation that in his retrial for the liuzza murder,thompson had introduced ten exhibits containing relevant information withheld by the prosecution in.see supra,at.
abundant evidence supported the jury finding that additional brady training was obviously necessary to ensure that brady violations would not occur connick,the office sole policymaker,misunderstood brady.other leaders in the office,who bore direct responsibility for training less experienced prosecutors,were similarly uninformed about brady.prosecutors in the office received no brady training.the office shirked its responsibility to keep prosecutors abreast of relevant legal developments concerning brady requirements.as a result of these multiple shortfalls,it was hardly surprising that brady violations in fact occurred,severely undermining the integrity of thompson trials.
connick was the office sole policymaker,and his testimony exposed a flawed understanding of a prosecutor brady obligations.first,connick admitted to the jury that his earlier understanding of brady,conveyed in prior sworn testimony,had been too narrow.tr.second,connick confessed to having withheld a crime lab report one time as a prosecutor and i got indicted by the attorney over here for doing it.at.third,even at trial connick persisted in misstating brady requirements.for example,connick urged that there could be no brady violation arising out of the inadvertent conduct of an assistant under pressure with a lot of case load.tr.the court,however,correctly instructed the jury that,in determining whether there has been a brady violation,the good or bad faith of the prosecution does not matter.tr.
the testimony of other leaders in the district attorney office revealed similar misunderstandings.those misunderstandings,the jury could find,were in large part responsible for the gross disregard of brady rights thompson experienced.dubelier admitted that he never reviewed police files,but simply relied on the police to flag any potential brady information.tr.the court,however,instructed the jury that an individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to others acting on the government behalf in the case,including the police.at record.williams was asked whether brady material includes documents in the possession of the district attorney that could be used to impeach a witness,to show that he lying he responded simply,and mistakenly,no.tr.the testimony of individuals in the orleans parish district attorney office,thompson expert explained exposed complete errors as to what brady required prosecutors to do.at.dubelier had no understanding of his obligations under brady whatsoever,at,the expert observed,and williams is still not sure what his obligations were under brady,at.but ante,at i t was undisputed at trial that the prosecutors were familiar with the general brady requirement that the state disclose to the defense evidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused.
the jury could attribute the violations of thompson rights directly to prosecutors misapprehension of brady.the prosecution had no obligation to produce the hair police reports,williams maintained,because newspaper reports had suggested that witness descriptions were not consistent with thompson appearance.therefore,williams urged,the defense already had everything.tr.dubelier tendered an alternative explanation for the nondisclosure.in dubelier view,the descriptions were not inconsistent with thompson appearance,as portrayed in a police photograph showing thompson hair extending at least three inches above his forehead,at record.williams insisted that he had discharged the prosecution duty to disclose the blood evidence by mentioning,in a motion hearing,that the prosecution intended to obtain a blood sample from thompson.tr.during the armed robbery trial,williams told one of the victims that the results of the blood test made on the swatch had been inconclusive.at.and he testified in the action that the lab report was not brady material because i did know what the blood type of thompson was.tr.but see supra,at,district court instructed the jury that the lab report was brady material.
connick should have comprehended that orleans parish prosecutors lacked essential guidance on brady and its application.in fact,connick has effectively conceded that brady training in his office was inadequate.tr.of oral arg.connick explained to the jury that prosecutors offices must make very clear to new prosecutors what their responsibility i s under brady and must not giv e them a lot of leeway.tr.but the jury heard ample evidence that connick office gave prosecutors no brady guidance,and had installed no procedures to monitor brady compliance.
in,connick acknowledged,many of his prosecutors were coming fresh out of law school,and the office h uge turnover allowed attorneys with little experience to advance quickly to supervisory positions.see tr.by,dubelier and williams were two of the highest ranking attorneys in the office,at,yet neither man had even five years of experience as a prosecutor,see supra,at,record tr.
dubelier and williams learned the prosecutorial craft in connick office,and,as earlier observed,see supra,at,their testimony manifested a woefully deficient understanding of brady.dubelier and williams told the jury that they did not recall any brady training in the office.tr.
connick testified that he relied on supervisors,including dubelier and williams,to ensure prosecutors were familiar with their brady obligations.tr.yet connick did not inquire whether the supervisors themselves understood the importance of teaching newer prosecutors about brady.riehlmann could not recall that he was ever trained or instructed by anybody about his brady obligations,on the job or otherwise.tr.whittaker agreed it was possible for inexperienced lawyers,just a few weeks out of law school with no training,to bear responsibility for decisions on whether material was brady material and had to be produced.at.
thompson expert characterized connick supervision regarding brady as the blind leading the blind.tr.for example,in trial attorneys sometimes went to connick with brady questions,and he would tell them how to proceed.tr.but connick acknowledged that he had stopped reading law books and looking at opinions when he was first elected district attorney in,at.
as part of their training,prosecutors purportedly attended a pretrial conference with the office chief of trials before taking a case to trial.connick intended the practice to provide both training and accountability.but it achieved neither aim in thompson prosecutions,for dubelier and williams,as senior prosecutors in the office,were free to take cases to trial without pretrying them,and that is just how they proceeded in thompson prosecutions,at record.but ante,at t rial chiefs oversaw the preparation of the cases.
prosecutors confirmed that training in the district attorney office,overall,was deficient.soon after connick retired,a survey of assistant district attorneys in the office revealed that more than half felt that they had not received the training they needed to do their jobs.tr.
thompson,it bears emphasis,is not complaining about the absence of formal training sessions.tr.of oral arg.but ante,at.his complaint does not demand that brady compliance be enforced in any particular way.he asks only that brady obligations be communicated accurately and genuinely enforced because that did not happen in the district attorney office,it was inevitable that prosecutors would misapprehend brady.had brady importance been brought home to prosecutors,surely at least one of the four officers who knew of the swatch and lab report would have revealed their existence to defense counsel and the court 
louisiana did not require continuing legal education at the time of thompson trials.tr.but ante,at.primary responsibility for keeping prosecutors au courant with developments in the law,therefore,resided in the district attorney office.over the course of connick tenure as district attorney,the jury learned,the office chief of appeals circulated memoranda when appellate courts issued important opinions.tr.
the office policy manual was a compilation of memoranda on criminal law and practice circulated to prosecutors from,when connick became district attorney,through,at.the manual contained four sentences,nothing more,on brady this slim instruction,the jury learned,was notably inaccurate,incomplete,and dated.tr.but ante,at senior attorneys also circulated court decisions and instructional memoranda to keep the abreast of relevant legal developments.for example,the manual did not acknowledge what giglio united states,made plain impeachment evidence is brady material prosecutors are obligated to disclose 
in sum,the evidence permitted the jury to reach the following conclusions.first,connick did not ensure that prosecutors in his office knew their brady obligations he neither confirmed their familiarity with brady when he hired them,nor saw to it that training took place on his watch.second,the need for brady training and monitoring was obvious to connick.indeed he so testified.third,connick cavalier approach to his staff knowledge and observation of brady requirements contributed to a culture of inattention to brady in orleans parish.
as earlier noted,see supra,at,connick resisted an effort to hold prosecutors accountable for brady compliance because he felt the effort would make his job more difficult.tr.he never disciplined or fired a single prosecutor for violating brady.tr.the jury was told of this court decision in kyles whitley,a capital case prosecuted by connick office that garnered attention because it featured so many instances of the state failure to disclose exculpatory evidence.at stevens,concurring.when questioned about kyles,connick told the jury he was satisfied with his office practices and saw no need,occasioned by kyles,to make any changes.tr.in both quantity and quality,then,the evidence canvassed here was more than sufficient to warrant a jury determination that connick and the prosecutors who served under him were not merely negligent regarding brady.rather,they were deliberately indifferent to what the law requires.
in canton,this court spoke of circumstances in which the need for training may be so obvious,and the lack of training so likely to result in constitutional violations,that policymakers who do not provide for the requisite training can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need for such training,at.this case,i am convinced,belongs in the category canton marked out.
canton offered an illustration.c ity policymakers know to a moral certainty that their police officers will be required to arrest fleeing felons.those policymakers,canton observed,equip police officers with firearms to facilitate such arrests.ibid.the need to instruct armed officers about constitutional limitations on the use of deadly force,canton said,is so obvious,that failure to train the officers could properly be characterized as deliberate indifference to constitutional rights.ibid.
the district court,tracking canton language,instructed the jury that thompson could prevail on his deliberate indifference claim only if the evidence persuaded the jury on three points.first,connick was certain that prosecutors would confront the situation where they would have to decide which evidence was required by the constitution to be provided to the accused.tr.second,the situation involved a difficult choice,or one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling,such that additional training,supervision or monitoring was clearly needed.ibid.third,the wrong choice by a prosecutor in that situation would frequently cause a deprivation of an accused constitutional rights.record see canton,at,and walker new york,
petitioners used this formulation of the failure to train standard in pretrial and submissions,record,and in their own proposed jury instruction on deliberate indifference nor do petitioners dispute that connick kn e w to a moral certainty that his prosecutors would regularly face brady decisions.see canton,at.
the jury,furthermore,could reasonably find that brady rights may involve choices so difficult that connick obviously knew or should have known prosecutors needed more than perfunctory training to make the correct choices.see canton,at,and as demonstrated earlier,see supra,at,even at trial prosecutors failed to give an accurate account of their brady obligations.and,again as emphasized earlier,see supra,at,the evidence permitted the jury to conclude that connick should have known brady training in his office bordered on zero.see tr.of oral arg.moreover,connick understood that newer prosecutors needed very clear guidance and should not be left to grapple with brady on their own.tr.it was thus obvious to him,the jury could find,that constitutional rights would be in jeopardy if prosecutors received slim to no brady training.
based on the evidence presented,the jury could conclude that brady errors by untrained prosecutors would frequently cause deprivations of defendants constitutional rights.the jury learned of several brady oversights in thompson trials and heard testimony that connick office had one of the worst brady records in the country.tr.because prosecutors faced considerable pressure to get convictions,at,and were instructed to turn over what was required by state and federal law,but no more,brief for petitioners,the risk was all too real that they would err by withholding rather than revealing information favorable to the defense.
in sum,despite justice scalia protestations to the contrary,ante,at,the brady violations in thompson prosecutions were not singular and they were not aberrational.they were just what one would expect given the attitude toward brady pervasive in the district attorney office.thompson demonstrated that no fewer than five prosecutors the four trial prosecutors and riehlmann disregarded his brady rights.he established that they kept from him,year upon year,evidence vital to his defense.their conduct,he showed with equal force,was a foreseeable consequence of lax training in,and absence of monitoring of,a legal requirement fundamental to a fair trial 
unquestionably,a municipality that leaves police officers untrained in constitutional limits on the use of deadly weapons places lives in jeopardy.canton,at.but as this case so vividly shows,a municipality that empowers prosecutors to press for a death sentence without ensuring that those prosecutors know and honor brady rights may be no less deliberately indifferent to the risk to innocent lives.
brady,this court has long recognized,is among the most basic safeguards brigading a criminal defendant fair trial right.see cone bell,slip,at.see also united states bagley,marshall,dissenting.vigilance in superintending prosecutors attention to brady requirement is all the more important for this reason a brady violation,by its nature,causes suppression of evidence beyond the defendant capacity to ferret out.because the absence of the withheld evidence may result in the conviction of an innocent defendant,it is unconscionable not to impose reasonable controls impelling prosecutors to bring the information to light.
the court nevertheless holds canton example inapposite.it maintains that professional obligations,ethics rules,and training including training set attorneys apart from other municipal employees,including rookie police officers.ante,at.connick had every incentive at trial to attempt to establish that he could reasonably rely on the professional education and status of his staff.ante,at.but the jury heard and rejected his argument to that effect.tr.
the court advances connick argument with greater clarity,but with no greater support.on what basis can one be confident that law schools acquaint students with prosecutors unique obligation under brady whittaker told the jury he did not recall covering brady in his criminal procedure class in law school.tr.dubelier alma mater,like most other law faculties,does not make criminal procedure a required course 
connick suggested that the bar examination ensures that new attorneys will know what brady demands.tr.research indicates,however,that from to the present,brady questions have not accounted for even of the total points in the criminal law and procedure section of any administration of the louisiana bar examination a person sitting for the louisiana bar examination,moreover,need pass only five of the exam nine sections one can qualify for admission to the profession with no showing of even passing knowledge of criminal law and procedure.
the majority suggestion that lawyers do not need brady training because they are equipped with the tools to find,interpret,and apply legal principles,ante,at,blinks reality and is belied by the facts of this case.see brief for former federal civil rights officials and prosecutors as amici curiae.connick himself recognized that his prosecutors,because of their inexperience,were not so equipped.indeed,understanding and complying with brady obligations are not easy tasks,and the appropriate way to resolve brady issues is not always.brief for former federal civil rights officials and prosecutors as amici curiae.brady compliance,therefore,is too much at risk,and too fundamental to the fairness of our criminal justice system,to be taken for granted,and training remains critical.at.
the majority further suggests that a prior pattern of similar violations is necessary to show deliberate indifference to defendants brady rights.see ante,at,and,the text of contains no such limitation nor is there any reason to imply such a limitation a district attorney deliberate indifference might be shown in several ways short of a prior pattern this case is one such instance.connick,who himself had been indicted for suppression of evidence,created a tinderbox in orleans parish in which brady violations were nigh inevitable.and when they did occur,connick insisted there was no need to change anything,and opposed efforts to hold prosecutors accountable on the ground that doing so would make his job more difficult.
a district attorney aware of his office high turnover rate,who recruits prosecutors fresh out of law school and promotes them rapidly through the ranks,bears responsibility for ensuring that training takes place.in short,the buck stops with him as the court recognizes,the duty to produce brady evidence to the defense is a mong prosecutors unique ethical obligations.ante,at.the evidence in this case presents overwhelming support for the conclusion that the orleans parish office slighted its responsibility to the profession and to the state system of justice by providing no brady training.connick was not entitled to rely on prosecutors professional training,ante,at,for connick himself should have been the principal insurer of that training.
for the reasons stated,i would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals for the fifth circuit.like that court and,before it,the district court,i would uphold the jury verdict awarding damages to thompson for the gross,deliberately indifferent,and violation of his fair trial right.
after thompson discovered the crime lab report,former assistant district attorney michael riehlmann revealed that deegan had confessed to him in that he had intentionally suppressed blood evidence in the armed robbery trial of john thompson that in some way exculpated the defendant.record see also,at.deegan apparently had been recently diagnosed with terminal cancer when he made his confession.following a disciplinary complaint by the district attorney office,the supreme court of louisiana reprimanded riehlmann for failing to disclose deegan admission earlier.in re riehlmann,so.
thompson testified in his own defense at the second trial and presented evidence suggesting that another man committed the murder.that man,the government key witness at the first murder trial,had died in the interval between the first and second trials.
because connick conceded that the failure to disclose the crime lab report violated brady,that question is not presented here,and we do not address it.
the district court rejected connick proposed deliberate indifference jury instruction which would have required thompson to prove a pattern of similar violations for the same reasons as the summary judgment motion.tr.record see also tr.of oral arg.
because we conclude that thompson failed to prove deliberate indifference,we need not reach causation.thus,we do not address whether the alleged training deficiency,or some other cause,was the moving force,canton harris,quoting monell new york city of social,and polk county dodson,that actually caused the failure to disclose the crime lab report,canton,supra,at.
the same can not be said for the dissent,however.affirming the verdict in favor of thompson would require finding both that he proved deliberate indifference and that he proved causation.perhaps unsurprisingly,the dissent has not conducted the second step of the analysis,which would require showing that the failure to provide particular training which the dissent never clearly identifies actually caused the flagrant and quite possibly intentional misconduct that occurred in this case.see post,at opinion of ginsburg,assuming that,h ad brady importance been brought home to prosecutors,the violation at issue surely would not have occurred.the dissent believes that evidence that the prosecutors allegedly misapprehen ded brady proves causation.post,at.of course,if evidence of a need for training,by itself,were sufficient to prove that the lack of training actually caused the violation at issue,no causation requirement would be necessary because every plaintiff who satisfied the deliberate indifference requirement would necessarily satisfy the causation requirement.
thompson had every incentive at trial to attempt to establish a pattern of similar violations,given that the jury instruction allowed the jury to find deliberate indifference based on,among other things,prosecutors history of mishandling similar situations.record.
thompson also asserts that this case is not about a single incident because up to four prosecutors may have been responsible for the nondisclosure of the crime lab report and,according to his allegations,withheld additional evidence in his armed robbery and murder trials.but contemporaneous or subsequent conduct can not establish a pattern of violations that would provide notice to the cit y and the opportunity to conform to constitutional dictates.canton,at,concurring in part and dissenting in part.moreover,no court has ever found any of the other brady violations that thompson alleges occurred in his armed robbery and murder trials.
the louisiana state bar code of professional responsibility included a broad understanding of the prosecutor duty to disclose in 
with respect to evidence and witnesses,the prosecutor has responsibilities different from those of a lawyer in private practice the prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of available evidence,known to him,that tends to negate the guilt of the accused,mitigate the degree of the offense,or reduce the punishment.further,a prosecutor should not intentionally avoid pursuit of evidence merely because he believes it will damage the prosecution case or aid the accused.lsba,articles of incorporation,ec see also aba model rule of conduct d the prosecutor in a criminal case shall make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense 
in addition to these ethical rules,the louisiana code of criminal procedure,with which louisiana prosecutors are no doubt familiar,in required prosecutors,upon order of the court,to permit inspection of evidence favorable to the defendant which is material and relevant to the issue of guilt or punishment,code crim.proc,west added,as well as any results or reports of scientific tests or experiments,made in connection with or material to the particular case if those reports are exculpatory or intended for use at trial.
contrary to the dissent assertion,see post,at,citing post,at,a prosecutor youth is not a specific reason not to rely on professional training and ethical obligations.see supra,at citing united states cronic.
thompson also argues that he proved deliberate indifference by direct evidence of policymaker fault and so,presumably,did not need to rely on circumstantial evidence at all.brief for respondent.in support,thompson contends that connick created a culture of indifference in the district attorney office,at,as evidenced by connick own allegedly inadequate understanding of brady,the office unwritten brady policy that was later incorporated into a handbook,and an officewide restrictive discovery policy,brief for respondent.this argument is essentially an assertion that connick office had an unconstitutional policy or custom.the jury rejected this claim,and thompson does not challenge that finding.
the dissent spends considerable time finding new brady violations in thompson trials.see post,at.how these violations are relevant even to the dissent own legal analysis is a mystery.post,at.the dissent does not list these violations among the a bundant evidence that it believes supports the jury finding that brady training was obviously necessary.post,at.nor does the dissent quarrel with our conclusion that contemporaneous or subsequent conduct can not establish a pattern of violations.the only point appears to be to highlight what the dissent sees as sympathetic,even if legally irrelevant,facts.
in any event,the dissent findings are highly suspect.in finding two of the new violations,the dissent belatedly tries to reverse the court of appeals decision that those brady claims were without merit.compare thompson cain,rejecting brady claims regarding the audiotapes and the perkins police report,with post,at concluding that these were brady violations.there is no basis to the dissent suggestion that materially new facts have called the court of appeals decision into question.state thompson.app,so,noting thompson admission that some of his current brady claims ha ve been rejected by both the louisiana supreme court and the federal courts regarding the swatch,which the dissent asserts prosecutors blocked the defense from inspecting by sending it to the crime lab for testing,post,at,thompson counsel conceded at oral argument that trial counsel had access to the evidence locker where the swatch was recorded as evidence.see tr.of oral arg,record,evidence card identifying one piece of victims sic right pants leg,among the evidence in the evidence locker and indicating that some evidence had been checked out tr.testimony from thompson counsel that he w ent down to the evidence room and checked all of the evidence at,testimony that evidence card was available to the public,would have been available to thompson counsel,and would have been seen by thompson counsel because it was stapled to the evidence bag in the normal process moreover,the dissent can not seriously believe that the jury could have found brady violations indisputably,questions of law.see post,at.
although the dissent acknowledges that deliberate indifference liability and respondeat superior liability are not one and the same,the opinion suggests that it believes otherwise.post,at,see,post,at asserting that the buck stops with the district attorney post,at suggesting municipal liability attaches when the prosecutors themselves are deliberately indifferent to what the law requires we stand by the longstanding rule reaffirmed by a unanimous court earlier this term that to prove a violation of,a plaintiff must prove that the municipality own wrongful conduct caused his injury,not that the municipality is ultimately responsible for the torts of its employees.los angeles county humphries,ante,at see humphries,ante,at,citing monell,at.

i do not share the dissent confidence that this result will be avoided by the instruction requirement that more likely than not the brady material would have been produced if the prosecutors involved in his underlying criminal cases had been properly trained,supervised or monitored regarding the production of brady evidence.post,at,quoting tr.how comforting that assurance is depends entirely on what proper training consists of.if it is not limited to training in aspects of brady that have been repeatedly violated,but includes as the dissent would have it include here training that would avoid any violation,the assurance is no assurance at all.
the dissent contention that t he instruction connick proposed resembled the charge given by the district court,post,at,disregards his requested instruction concerning the necessity of a pattern of prior violations.it is meaningless to say that after the court rejected connick categorical position,as it did,he did not assail the district court formulation of the deliberate indifference instruction,post,at.the requirement was part of connick requested formulation of deliberate indifference to prove deliberate indifference,a plaintiff must demonstrate at least a pattern of similar violations arising from training that is so clearly inadequate as to be obviously likely to result in a constitutional violation.record,doc,emphasis added.
what the dissent does cite in support of its theory comes from an unexpected source connick testimony about what qualifies as brady material.see post,at.or connick could have told prosecutors what he told the jury when he was asked whether a prosecutor must disclose a crime lab report to the defense,even if the does not know the defendant blood type under the law,it qualifies as brady material.quoting tr.given the effort the dissent has expended persuading us that connick understanding of brady is profoundly misguided,its newfound trust in his expertise on the subject is,to the say the least,surprising.
the dissent only response to this is that the jury must have found otherwise,since it was instructed that f or liability to attach because of a failure to train,the fault must be in the training program itself,not in any particular prosecutor.post,at,quoting tr.but this instruction did not require the jury to find that deegan did not commit a,knowing violation it merely prevented the jury from finding that,if he did so,connick was liable for a failure to train.i not only agree with that it is part of my point.

the majority endorses the fifth circuit conclusion that,when thompson was tried for murder,no brady violation occurred with respect to these audio tapes b ecause defense counsel had knowledge of such evidence and could easily have requested access from the prosecution.thompson cain,ante,at.the basis for that asserted knowledge is a mystery.the recordings secretly made did not come to light until long after thompson trials.

connick did not dispute that failure to disclose the swatch and the crime lab report violated brady.see tr.but ante,at,limiting connick concession,as connick himself did not,to failure to disclose the crime lab report.
in justice scalia contrary view,t here was probably no brady violation at all,or,if there was any violation of thompson rights,it was surely on the very frontier of our brady jurisprudence,such that connick could not possibly have been on notice of the need to train.ante,at.connick counsel,however,saw the matter differently.a ny reasonable prosecutor would have recognized blood evidence as brady material,he said,indeed the proper response was obvious to all.record.
the majority assails as highly suspect the suggestion that prosecutors violated brady by failing to disclose the swatch.see ante,at.but the parties stipulated in thompson action,and the jury was so informed,that,p rior to the armed robbery trial,thompson and his attorneys were not advised of the existence of the blood evidence,that the evidence had been tested,or that a blood type was determined definitively from the swatch.tr.consistent with this stipulation,thompson trial counsel testified that he spoke to t he clerk who maintain ed the evidence and learned that t hey did have any blood evidence.at.and the district court instructed the jury,with no objection from connick,that the nonproduced blood evidence violated thompson constitutional rights as a matter of law.at.
justice scalia questions petitioners concession that brady was violated when the prosecution failed to inform thompson of the blood evidence.he considers the evidence outside brady because the prosecution did not endeavor to test thompson blood,and therefore avoided knowing that the evidence was in fact exculpatory.ante,at.such a do ask,do tell view of a prosecutor brady obligations garners no support from precedent.see also supra,at,infra,at.

the louisiana court of appeal concluded,and connick does not dispute,that thompson would have testified in the absence of the attempted armed robbery conviction.state thompson,so.but ante,at,thompson elected not to testify.
thompson argued that the state failed to produce police reports and other information which would have identified eye and whose testimony would have exonerated him and inculpated freeman,and would have shown that perkins,who stated he heard thompson admit to committing the murder,had been promised reward money for his testimony.thompson,so,at.in leaving these arguments unaddressed,the louisiana court of appeal surely did not defer to the fifth circuit earlier assessment of those claims,made on an anemic record,in thompson cain.nor did the louisiana court of appeal suggest that thompson was belatedly tr ying to reverse the fifth circuit decision.but ante,at.
the court notes that in thompson cain,the fifth circuit rejected brady claims raised by thompson,characterizing one of those claims as without merit.ante,at,quoting thompson,at see supra,at.the court,however,overlooks the date of that fifth circuit decision.it was rendered before revelation of the brady violations in the armed robbery trial,before thompson had the opportunity for discovery in his suit,and before thompson or any court was aware of the close cut hair police reports.see thompson,at.it is these later revelations,not the little thompson knew in,that should count.for example,the fifth circuit,in,believed that perkins statement recorded in the police report did not differ from freeman trial testimony.at.but evidence put before the jury in in the trial showed that the police report,in several material respects,was inconsistent with freeman trial testimony.tr.
connick has never suggested to this court that the jury in the trial was bound by the fifth circuit brady rulings.that court afford ed great deference to the state trial court findings,made after a relief hearing.thompson,at.the jury in the trial,of course,had far more extensive and accurate information on which to reach its decision.moreover,as earlier noted,the same trial court that made the findings was,in,outraged by the subsequently discovered brady violations and by connick reluctance to bring those violations to light.see supra,at.certainly that judge would not have wanted the jury that assessed connick deliberate indifference in the trial to defer to findings he earlier made on a notably incomplete record.
the court permitted thompson to introduce evidence of other brady violations,but because the blood evidence alone proved the violation of thompson constitutional rights,the court declined specifically to ask the jury whether this other stuff was also brady.tr.the court allowed thompson to submit proof of other violations to sho w the cumulative nature and impact o
