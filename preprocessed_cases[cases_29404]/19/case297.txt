michael mccue,the father of phillip mccue mccue and the personal representative of mccue estate,brought this action after mccue tragic death resulting from his encounter with the five bangor police officers named as defendants.on the night of their encounter,the officers sought to take mccue into protective custody due to his erratic behavior believed to be caused by ingestion of bath salts.in an attempt to restrain mccue,who initially resisted,the officers placed mccue in a,prone position for a disputed period of minutes while two officers exerted weight on his back and shoulders.mccue was declared dead shortly after this intervention.an expert witness for the plaintiff attributed the likely cause of death to prolonged restraint in the prone position under the weight of multiple officers,in the face of a hypermetabolic state of excited delirium.
the plaintiff brought suit against the city of bangor and the five officers in their individual and official capacities.the plaintiff asserted violations of his son federal constitutional rights,as well as various state law tort claims.the district court granted the defendants summary judgment motion on the basis of qualified immunity on all claims,with two exceptions it denied the five officers claims of qualified immunity as to the alleged use of excessive force after mccue ceased resisting and also denied immunity under the maine tort claims act mtca,me.stat.tit,as to the assault and battery claim.the court denied summary judgment on these issues because it found,following a magistrate judge recommendation,that there remained material disputed issues of fact as to these claims.
the defendants appeal,arguing that they are entitled to pretrial qualified immunity on these remaining claims of excessive force and assault and battery.the plaintiff counters that we do not have jurisdiction over the defendants interlocutory appeal,as there are material factual issues in dispute about the time at which mccue ceased resisting and the degree of force the officers continued to use against him after that point.we agree with the plaintiff that we lack appellate jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal under johnson jones,d.we dismiss the appeal.
we have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal of a denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity only insofar as the appeal rests on legal,rather than factual grounds.cady walsh,cir.citing johnson,at.we thus summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the plaintiff.the record also contains video footage of a portion of mccue encounter with the defendants through the car video.as the supreme court has instructed us to independently watch and take into account such footage in assessing the credibility of each party version of the facts,scott harris,d,we intersperse our observations of the footage where appropriate.
on september,mccue was in the common area of an apartment building located at first street in bangor,maine.witnesses described him as ranting and raving,yelling and screaming,and stomping and kicking at doors.fearing that the building manager,who had gone to investigate the situation,was in danger,a resident of the building called the bangor police department.officer kimberly donnell responded to the call.upon her arrival,donnell met with the caller,who led her to the second floor of the apartment building.when donnell reached the second floor,mccue screamed something and then jumped over a banister in the third floor hallway and landed approximately eight feet below on the stairway that led to the second floor.mccue then put his shoulder or elbow through the stairway wall and created a hole a little larger than a softball.he also threw a beer bottle in donnell direction and screamed an obscenity before running past donnell and leaving the building.
donnell called for backup,and officer wade betters responded to her request.the two followed mccue in a police car and attempted to speak to him upon making contact with him at a nearby fire station.mccue began pacing and continued yelling,so the officers issued a disorderly conduct warning,as well as a warning to stay out of the roadway.after asking officer ryan jones who is not a defendant in this suit to monitor mccue,donnell and betters returned to first street to obtain more information.there,they learned that mccue was a bath salts user and that he might have used bath salts that evening.upon leaving the building,the officers again encountered mccue,who had fled from jones.mccue yelled,hurled profanities at donnell and betters,gestured to them,and challenged them to chase him.
based on mccue behavior and pursuant to the bangor police department policy,entitled response to mental illness and involuntary commitment,betters decided that mccue should be taken into protective custody for a professional evaluation.under the relevant policy,an officer is required to take an individual into protective custody when the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the individual seems mentally ill and presents a threat of immediate and substantial physical harm to himself or third persons.the policy defines threat of imminent and substantial physical harm to encompass a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm to someone including the person experiencing a mental health crisis of serious,violent behavior or placing others in reasonable fear of serious physical harm,impairment to such an extent that a person is unable to avoid harm or protect themselves from harm.if an officer determines that an individual must be taken into protective custody,the officer must bring that person to a hospital for professional evaluation.
officers christopher blanchard,david farrar,and joshua kuhn,all defendants,heard betters report that mccue should be taken into protective custody.farrar and kuhn located mccue running in the roadway.they left their cruiser to speak with him,but mccue either responded unintelligibly or snarled at the officers before running off again.in the process,mccue darted into the road,on main street,in front of jones vehicle.betters and kuhn,driving separate vehicles,unsuccessfully attempted to box mccue in and prevent him from running into traffic again.farrar and kuhn subsequently pursued mccue on foot and apprehended him when he tripped and fell on main street.mccue was on the ground on his stomach when farrar and kuhn reached him.a bangor fire department fire engine pulled across main street and parked there to block off traffic.in the fire engine were three paramedics and one emergency medical technician.other emergency personnel from the bangor fire department were also standing nearby.
kuhn initially placed his chest on mccue shoulder and asked mccue to give up his hands,but mccue refused.even after kuhn placed his finger on a pressure point under mccue nose to gain pain compliance and even after farrar struck mccue a few times on his arms,mccue refused to comply and kept his hands underneath his body.mccue swore at the officers and threatened to kill them.only after donnell arrived on the scene and tased mccue did mccue give his hands up.that enabled the officers to handcuff his arms behind his back.
after securing mccue arms,the officers turned their efforts toward securing his legs.by this point,both blanchard and betters had arrived on the scene.donnell placed herself on mccue legs because mccue continued to kick,resist,growl,swear,and make unintelligible exclamations at the officers.the car video from blanchard vehicle captures this behavior.the parties agree that the car video footage begins at some point after mccue was first held to the ground.indeed,when car arrived on the scene,three officers were already attempting to restrain mccue,with donnell already holding down his legs.
the car video,from to,captures mccue kicking his legs,flailing his upper body,and shouting an expletive at the officers.after that point,between two and five officers continued to hold mccue down.upon viewing the video,the magistrate judge observed that t wo officers kuhn and farrar applied what could be viewed as significant weight to mccue shoulders and neck for a period of time,perhaps as much as four to five minutes,while other officers attempted to secure his feet.on our own viewing of the video,we agree with the magistrate judge observation.specifically,after mccue outburst around,the car video depicts one officer placing his knee on mccue neck while another sits on his back.the officer knee remains on mccue neck even after mccue twice shouts in distress that the officers are hurting his neck,from around to of the video.around,mccue again shouts something unintelligible about his neck.
following the outburst,although mccue continues to growl and mutter intermittently until around of the video,he does not seem to kick or flail as noticeably as he did at the mark.it is difficult,if not impossible,to tell from the footage whether and how much mccue continued to resist,and how much pressure the officers exerted on his upper body.
as blanchard attended to mccue legs,his hand became trapped between mccue ankles,and blanchard sustained a serious hand injury.blanchard rapidly punched mccue leg ten times to free his hand.blanchard and donnell then successfully restrained mccue ankles with flex cuffs,after which the officers tied together the ankle and wrist cuffs in a position known as a restraint or hog tie using a dog leash retrieved from a police vehicle.at some point after mccue wrists and ankles were restrained but before he was placed in a restraint,blanchard punched mccue in his lower back,buttocks,or thigh region.it is undisputed that the officers placed mccue in the restraint to restrain and control him in order to transport him to the hospital for an evaluation.between the time period when the officers secured the ankles around of the video and when they completed the hog tie around,at least two large officers continued to exert pressure on mccue neck and upper body,sometimes kneeling and sitting on his back.by the time the officers lifted mccue from the ground,at,his body was limp and he could have been unconscious.
at some point after lifting mccue off the ground and transporting him to a police vehicle a few yards away,the officers observed that mccue was unresponsive.one officer exclaims around of the car video that mccue might not be conscious right now.seconds later,the car video captures an officer statement that mccue is in a state of excited delirium.then,an officer comments that the last thing we need is for him to die from excited delirium in the back of the car.another video the car video,shot from betters vehicle was visually obstructed by the parked fire truck but clearly picked up the audio of the officers conversation.it also confirms these statements regarding excited delirium.
during or immediately after making these statements,the officers called for medical assistance,and two firemen from the parked fire truck,as well as other emergency responders,arrived shortly thereafter.they were unable to resuscitate mccue.one of the plaintiff expert witnesses attributed the likely cause of death to prolonged prone restraint under the weight of multiple officers,in the face of a hypermetabolic state of excited delirium.the witness elaborated that mccue inability to hyperventilate and compensate for metabolic acidosis in his state of excited delirium led to his cardiopulmonary arrest.
most of the officers were trained at the maine criminal justice academy,which provided limited information about the risk of positional asphyxia resulting from prone restraint.officers were instructed that,after arrest,suspects should be placed in a seated position,not in a position on their stomachs,in the police vehicle.blanchard,who was trained at the police academy in vermont and also received military police training with the united states army,had been taught that a suspect who has been in a restraint for an extended period of time should be monitored for signs of asphyxia.no officer was advised against placing weight on the upper back or shoulders of a prone suspect.
on july,the plaintiff filed his first amended complaint in the district of maine and named as defendants the city of bangor and the five officers in their individual and official capacities.the complaint raised claims under that the defendants had lacked probable cause to seize mccue,that they had used excessive force against mccue throughout their encounter,and that they had been deliberately indifferent to mccue medical needs.the complaint also alleged various state law tort claims assault and battery,wrongful death,negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress,and respondeat superior and vicarious liability.the defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity for the claims and immunity under the mtca for the corresponding state law claims.
on september,the magistrate judge issued a recommended decision granting in part and denying in part the defendants motion.the recommendation concluded that the entire claim against the city of bangor should be adjudicated in the city favor.as for the individual defendants,the magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment in their favor on the claims based on probable cause and deliberate indifference toward mccue medical needs.the magistrate judge also recommended summary judgment in favor of the individual defendants with regard to the claim alleging excessive force,except as to the claim that the officers used excessive force after mccue had ceased resisting.correspondingly,the magistrate judge recommended judgment in favor of the individual defendants on the state law assault claim,except as to the claim that the officers used excessive force after mccue had ceased resisting 
as to excessive force,the magistrate judge found that there existed a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants used excessive force after mccue ceased resisting.mccue,wl,at.the magistrate judge emphasized that,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting injury,the record could support a finding that defendants continued to employ significant force after mccue ceased resisting and no longer posed a threat to the officers or himself.id.at alteration in original quoting saucier katz,d,receded from on other grounds by pearson callahan,d.furthermore,the magistrate judge found that these disputed facts were material because,a t the time of mccue apprehension,the law was clearly established that use of a significant level of force after a subject has ceased resisting violates the fourth amendment.id.at citing,inter alia,jennings jones,cir.
after reviewing de novo all of the magistrate judge determinations,the district court adopted the recommended decision in full.this appeal followed.the only issue before us is the pretrial denial of qualified immunity as to the plaintiff allegation that the officers used excessive force after mccue had ceased resisting,as well as the corresponding denial of immunity under the mtca for the state law assault claim.
federal claim and appellate jurisdiction 
we generally hear appeals only from final orders and decisions.see cady,at.an order denying a motion for summary judgment is generally not a final decision within the meaning of and is thus generally not immediately appealable.plumhoff rickard,d.but that rule does not apply in certain instances where the summary judgment motion is based on a claim of qualified immunity.id.at.because qualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability,id.quoting pearson,at,pretrial orders denying qualified immunity generally fall within the collateral order doctrine,id.a pretrial denial of qualified immunity may be immediately appealable in some instances.cady,at.
in johnson,the supreme court limited the circumstances in which we can hear such interlocutory appeals to those in which all material facts are taken as undisputed and the issue on appeal is one of law.mlodzinski lewis,cir.accordingly,a district court pretrial rejection of a qualified immunity defense is not immediately appealable to the extent that it turns on either an issue of fact or an issue perceived by the trial court to be an issue of fact.cady,at quoting stella kelley,cir.see also stella,at a summary judgm
