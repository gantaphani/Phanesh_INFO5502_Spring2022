allison was convicted after a jury trial of counts of theft of government property and one count of aggravated identity theft.she argues that her convictions must be vacated because the evidence at trial was insufficient to support them and because the district court abused its discretion in denying her request to continue her trial to a later date.we affirm.
we recite the evidence introduced at trial in the light most favorable to the prosecution,as is required when a criminal defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support her conviction.see united states pena,cir.
in,the internal revenue service received tax returns purporting to be filed by individuals.each return showed that the filer was due a tax refund.the returns were not what they claimed to be.they had not in fact been filed by the individuals whose names and security numbers appeared in them.nevertheless,the irs approved tax refund checks for each of the tax returns.each check was to be paid from the funds of the united states treasury.
the treasury checks ranged in value from to.each check was issued to the individual on the corresponding tax return and sent to the address in the continental united states provided in that return.that address was also typed on the front of each check.
the treasury checks were eventually submitted for deposit into the banco popular account of la casa de los motores and junker correa,a business in puerto rico that sells used automobile parts.the checks were submitted by junker correa owner,gonzález,on days from november to may.the first of the checks were deposited into junker correa account the check was held by the bank and not deposited.
each check was endorsed twice.the first endorsement purported to be the signature of the individual in whose name the check had been issued.the second was an endorsement to junker correa.
the individuals in whose names the checks were issued never received the checks,never endorsed the checks,and never spent the checks.nor had they ever been to junker correa.
the jury found gonzález guilty on all counts they were asked to decide counts of theft of government property,all charged in violation of,and one count of aggravated identity theft,in violation of.each of the counts of theft of government property alleged that gonzález had stolen the value of one of the treasury checks.the aggravated identity theft count was charged in connection with just one of the checks.gonzález appeals.
we review gonzález challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.united states,cir.w e examine the evidence,both direct and circumstantial,in the light most favorable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence,including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom,would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged count or crime.united states,cir.per curiam quoting united states,cir.and,when we do,we conclude that the evidence was sufficient in this case.
we begin with the counts of theft of government property.each count corresponds to the submission for deposit by gonzález of one of the treasury checks.
gonzález does not dispute that there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the checks were fraudulently obtained from the federal government through the filing of false returns.gonzález also does not dispute that the evidence showed that she submitted the checks for deposit into junker correa bank account.
but gonzález does contend that the evidence was not sufficient because it revealed that she,too,was a victim of the fraudulent scheme,as she simply deposited checks received by her business.and so she contends that the jury could not have found her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt given that,in light of the evidence,it was equally possible that she submitted the checks for deposit on a mistaken understanding of their pedigree as that she submitted them knowing that they were fraudulent.
gonzález is correct that the government needed to prove that she acted with the specific intent to steal a thing of value from the united states,and the government does not argue otherwise.see united states,cir.holding that although does not expressly require specific intent,the supreme court has held that congress,in codifying the common law crimes described in,intended to incorporate the common law requirement of specific intent as an element of the crime citing morissette united states.and the government put forth no evidence regarding how gonzález came to possess the fraudulent checks.but the government contends that the evidence in the record is still sufficient to support a finding that gonzález acted with the requisite intent,and we agree.
in support of her challenge,gonzález points to the evidence that when banco popular began investigating the treasury checks,she produced eleven invoices that showed that customers had purchased items from junker correa with the checks.gonzález further contends that the invoices were credible because they were detailed and distinctive.for example,she points to the fact that one invoice stated that the customer had given a tip.and she points to the evidence that shows that she went to banco popular when the bank did not accept one of the checks and that she was a willing participant in banco popular investigation of the problem with that check unlikely behavior,she contends,for someone who knew the check to be fraudulent.
but the question in resolving a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is not whether the evidence was such that a juror could have voted to acquit.the question is whether the evidence was such that a reasonable juror could not have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.and there are critical holes in gonzález story that,along with the other evidence,provide sufficient support for what the jury did.
gonzález told the bank that she had an invoice for each of the checks and copies of forms of identification which she referred to as ids for each person who had paid with one of those checks.and yet she did not produce a single id.gonzález insists that she failed to produce the ids because her business was hectic and her records sloppy,and she argues that the evidence shows as much.but a reasonable juror could reject that argument and find that she failed to produce the ids for a different reason,namely that there were no such customers.
moreover,the invoices that gonzález did produce,while containing the kind of detail one would expect from real invoices such as the tip,also claimed that some of the customers had used treasury checks to pay for items that cost significantly less than the value of the checks.in one case,the difference exceeded four thousand dollars.some of the invoices did claim that customers waited several days to receive the substantial change owed.if so,the customers were apparently trusting junker correa to return the large difference and then accepting that difference by cash or check.but junker correa bank account statements did not show cash withdrawals consistent with such large cash refunds.for those reasons,too,a reasonable juror could reject the view that the invoices were real records of past transactions rather than inventions of exchanges that never occurred.
to believe that gonzález did not know the checks were fraudulent,a juror would have to believe that junker correa,despite never before having received payment from a customer in the form of treasury check,suddenly,in one period,received an inundation of such payments.a juror would also have to believe the customers chose this unusual form of payment even though it required them to trust gonzález to refund them thousands of dollars at some future point in time.and a juror would also have to believe that it just happened to be the case that at the same time that customers began paying with those checks,gonzález decided to begin transferring large sums of money from the junker correa account to her personal account something that she had done on very few occasions in the several years before the treasury checks appeared
