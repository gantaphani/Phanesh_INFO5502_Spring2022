after pleading guilty to drug charges,petitioner pepper was sentenced under the federal sentencing guidelines to months imprisonment,a nearly percent downward departure from the low end of the guidelines range based in part on his substantial assistance,followed by five years of supervised release.in pepper i,the eighth circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in light of,inter alia,united states booker.pepper,who had begun serving his supervised release,testified at his resentencing hearing that he was no longer a drug addict,having completed a drug treatment program while in prison that he was enrolled in community college and had achieved very good grades and that he was working part time.pepper father testified that he and his son were no longer estranged,and pepper probation officer testified that a sentence would be reasonable in light of pepper substantial assistance,postsentencing rehabilitation,and demonstrated low recidivism risk.the district court again sentenced pepper to months,granting a percent downward departure based on pepper substantial assistance and a further downward variance based on,inter alia,pepper rehabilitation since his initial sentencing.in pepper ii,the eighth circuit again reversed and remanded for resentencing,concluding that pepper postsentencing rehabilitation could not be considered as a factor supporting a downward variance,and directing that the case be assigned to a different district judge.after this court vacated and remanded the pepper ii judgment in light of gall united states,the eighth circuit,in pepper iii,reversed and remanded once more.at the second resentencing hearing,pepper informed the new district judge that he was still in school,was about to be promoted at his job,and had married and was supporting his new family.noting the nearly identical remand language of pepper ii and pepper iii,the court observed that it was not bound to reduce pepper range by percent for substantial assistance.instead,it found him entitled to a percent reduction and refused to grant a further downward variance for,inter alia,postsentencing rehabilitation.it imposed a prison term and months of supervised release.in pepper iv,the eighth circuit once again rejected pepper postsentencing rehabilitation argument.it also rejected his claim that the law of the case from pepper ii and pepper iii required the district court to reduce the applicable guidelines range by at least percent.
when a defendant sentence has been set aside on appeal,a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant postsentencing rehabilitation,and such evidence may,in appropriate cases,support a downward variance from the guidelines range.
a consistent with the principle that the punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime,williams new york,this court has observed a consistent and uniform policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law,at,particularly the fullest information possible concerning the defendant life and characteristics,at.that principle is codified at,which provides that n o limitation shall be placed on the information a sentencing court may consider concerning the defendant background,character,and conduct,and at a,which specifies that sentencing courts must consider,among other things,a defendant history and characteristics,a.the guidelines,which booker made effectively advisory,at,should be the starting point and the initial benchmark,but district courts may impose sentences within statutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all of the a factors,subject to appellate review for reasonableness,gall united states.this sentencing framework applies both at initial sentencing and at any subsequent resentencing after a sentence has been set aside on appeal.
b postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may support a downward variance from the advisory guidelines range.the plain language of makes clear that there is n o limitation on background,character,and conduct information,and it makes no distinction between an initial sentencing and a subsequent resentencing.in addition,postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may be highly relevant to several a factors that district courts are required to consider at sentencing.the extensive evidence of pepper rehabilitation since his initial sentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appropriate sentence here.most fundamentally,that evidence provides the most picture of his history and characteristics.a.at the time of his initial sentencing,he was an unemployed drug addict who was estranged from his family and sold drugs.by his second resentencing,he had been for nearly five years,was attending college,was a top employee slated for promotion,had a relationship with his father,and was married and supporting a family.his postsentencing conduct also sheds light on the likelihood that he will engage in future criminal conduct,a central factor that sentencing courts must consider.see a b c.
c the contrary arguments advanced by amicus appointed to defend the judgment are unpersuasive.
while g which prohibits a district court at resentencing from imposing a sentence outside the guidelines range except upon a ground it relied upon at the prior sentencing effectively precludes a court from considering postsentencing rehabilitation,that provision is invalid after booker.like the provisions invalidated in booker b and e g requires district courts effectively to treat the guidelines as mandatory in an entire set of cases.thus,the proper remedy is to invalidate the provision.while applying g at resentencing would not always result in a sixth amendment violation,this court rejects a partial invalidation that would leave the guidelines effectively mandatory in some cases and advisory in others.the fact that g permits a resentencing court on remand to impose a sentence where the prior sentence expressly relied on a departure upheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the constitutional infirmity.and the argument that any constitutional infirmity in g can be remedied by invalidating j b is rejected.
this court finds unpersuasive amicus arguments focusing on congress sentencing objectives under a.contrary to amicus contention,g does not reflect a congressional purpose to preclude consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence.thus,that provision has no bearing on this court analysis of whether a permits consideration of such evidence.nor is the consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation inconsistent with the sentencing factor in a which directs sentencing courts to consider any pertinent policy statement of the sentencing commission particularly as the pertinent policy statement in this case is based on unconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the relevant sentencing statutes.consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation is also not inconsistent with a which requires courts to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentenc ing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct as any disparity arises only from the normal trial and sentencing process.the differences in procedural opportunity that may result because some defendants are inevitably sentenced in error and must be resentenced are not the kinds of unwarranted sentencing disparities that congress sought to eliminate under a.
d on remand,the district court should consider and give appropriate weight to the postsentencing rehabilitation evidence,as well as any additional evidence concerning pepper conduct since his last sentencing.
because the eighth circuit in pepper iii set aside pepper entire sentence and remanded for de novo resentencing,the district court was not bound by the law of the case doctrine to apply the same percent departure applied by the original sentencing judge.to avoid undermining a district court original sentencing intent,an appellate court when reversing one part of a sentence may vacate the entire sentence so that,on remand,the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan to satisfy a sentencing factors.greenlaw united states.that is what the eighth circuit did here.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
this court has long recognized that sentencing judges exercise a wide discretion in the types of evidence they may consider when imposing sentence and that h ighly relevant if not essential to the selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant life and characteristics.williams new york.congress codified this principle at,which provides that n o limitation shall be placed on the information a sentencing court may consider concerning the defendant background,character,and,and at a,which sets forth certain factors that sentencing courts must consider,including the history and characteristics of the defendant,a.the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit concluded in this case that the district court,when resentencing petitioner after his initial sentence had been set aside on appeal,could not consider evidence of petitioner rehabilitation since his initial sentencing.that conclusion conflicts with longstanding principles of federal law and congress express directives in and a.although a separate statutory provision,g,prohibits a district court at resentencing from imposing a sentence outside the federal sentencing guidelines range except upon a ground it relied upon at the prior sentencing thus effectively precluding the court from considering postsentencing rehabilitation for purposes of imposing a sentence that provision did not survive our holding in united states booker,and we expressly invalidate it today.
we hold that when a defendant sentence has been set aside on appeal,a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant postsentencing rehabilitation and that such evidence may,in appropriate cases,support a downward variance from the federal sentencing guidelines range.separately,we affirm the court of appeals ruling that the law of the case doctrine did not require the district court in this case to apply the same percentage departure from the guidelines range for substantial assistance that had been applied at petitioner prior sentencing.
in october,petitioner jason pepper was arrested and charged with conspiracy to distribute grams or more of methamphetamine in violation of.after pleading guilty,pepper appeared for sentencing before judge mark bennett of the district court for the northern district of iowa.pepper sentencing range under the guidelines was to months the government moved for a downward departure pursuant to ussg based on pepper substantial assistance and recommended a percent downward departure the district court,however,sentenced pepper to a prison term,resulting in an approximately percent downward departure from the low end of the guidelines range,to be followed by five years of supervised release.the government appealed pepper sentence,and in june,the court of appeals for the eighth circuit reversed and remanded for resentencing in light of our intervening decision in booker and for another reason not relevant here.see united states pepper,pepper i.pepper completed his sentence three days after pepper i was issued and began serving his term of supervised release.
in may,the district court conducted a resentencing hearing and heard from three witnesses.in his testimony,pepper first recounted that while he had previously been a drug addict,he successfully completed a drug treatment program while in prison and he no longer used any drugs.app.pepper then explained that since his release from prison,he had enrolled at a local community college as a student and had earned a in all of his classes in the prior semester,at.pepper also testified that he had obtained employment within a few weeks after being released from custody and was continuing to work while attending school,at.pepper confirmed that he was in compliance with all the conditions of his supervised release and described his changed attitude since his arrest.see,at m y life was basically headed to either where i guess where i ended up,in prison,or death.now i have some optimism about my life,about what i can do with my life.i glad that i got this chance to try again i guess you could say at a decent life.my life was going nowhere before,and i think it going somewhere now

finally,pepper probation officer testified that,in his view,a sentence would be reasonable in light of pepper substantial assistance,postsentencing rehabilitation,and demonstrated low risk of recidivism,at.the probation officer also prepared a sentencing memorandum that further set forth the reasons supporting his recommendation for a sentence.
the district court adopted as its findings of fact the testimony of the three witnesses and the probation officer sentencing memorandum.the court granted a percent downward departure based on pepper substantial assistance,reducing the bottom of the guidelines range from to months.the court then granted a further percent downward variance based on,inter alia,pepper rehabilitation since his initial sentencing,at the court sentenced pepper to months of imprisonment,concluding that it would not advance any purpose of federal sentencing policy or any other policy behind the federal sentencing guidelines to send this defendant back to prison.at.
the government again appealed pepper sentence,and the court of appeals again reversed and remanded for resentencing.see united states pepper,pepper ii.the court concluded that,while it was a close call,it could not say the district court abused its discretion by granting the percent downward departure for substantial assistance,at.the court found the further percent downward variance,however,to be an abuse of discretion,at.in doing so,the court held that pepper rehabilitation was an impermissible factor to consider in granting a downward variance.at.the court stated that evidence of postsentencing is not relevant and will not be permitted at resentencing because the district court could not have considered that evidence at the time of the original sentencing,and permitting courts to consider rehabilitation at resentencing would create unwarranted sentencing disparities and inject blatant inequities into the sentencing process.ibid the court of appeals directed that the case be assigned to a different district judge for resentencing.ibid.
after the court of appeals mandate issued,pepper case was reassigned on remand to chief judge linda reade.in july,chief judge reade issued an order on the scope of the remand from pepper ii,stating that t he court will not consider itself bound to reduce pepper advisory sentencing guidelines range by pursuant to ussg.united states pepper,wl,nd iowa.in the meantime,pepper petitioned this court for a writ of certiorari,and in january,we granted the petition,vacated the judgment in pepper ii,and remanded the case to the court of appeals for further consideration in light of gall united states.see pepper united states.
on remand,the court of appeals held that gall did not alter its prior conclusion that rehabilitation is an impermissible factor to consider in granting a downward variance.pepper iii.the court again reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing.

in december,chief judge reade issued a sentencing memorandum.noting that the remand language of pepper iii was nearly identical to the language in pepper ii,the court again observed that it was not bound to reduce pepper advisory sentencing guidelines range by for substantial assistance and concluded that pepper was entitled only to a percent downward departure because the assistance was timely,helpful and important but in no way extraordinary.sealed sentencing memorandum in nd iowa,doc.the court also rejected pepper request for a downward variance based on,inter alia,his postsentencing rehabilitation,at.
the district court reconvened pepper resentencing hearing in january.the court decision to grant a percent downward departure for substantial assistance resulted in an advisory guidelines range of to months.the court also granted the government motion under rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure to account for investigative assistance pepper provided after he was initially sentenced.the court imposed a term of imprisonment,to be followed by months of supervised release 
the court of appeals affirmed pepper sentence.pepper iv.as relevant here,the court of appeals rejected pepper argument that the district court erred in refusing to consider his postsentencing rehabilitation.the court acknowledged that pepper made significant progress during and following his initial period of imprisonment and commend ed pepper on the positive changes he has made in his life,but concluded that pepper argument was foreclosed by circuit precedent holding that rehabilitation is not a permissible factor to consider in granting a downward variance.at citing united states jenners,united states mcmannus.
the court of appeals also rejected pepper claim that the scope of the remand and the law of the case from pepper ii and pepper iii required the district court to reduce the applicable guidelines range by at least percent pursuant to ussg.the court noted that its remand orders in pepper ii and pepper iii were general remand s for resentencing,which did not place any limitations on the discretion of the newly assigned district court judge in resentencing.at.the court further noted that,although issues decided by an appellate court become law of the case on remand to the sentencing court,its earlier decisions merely held that a percent downward departure for substantial assistance was not an abuse of discretion,not that the district court would be bound by the percent departure previously granted,at.
we granted pepper petition for a writ of certiorari,to decide two questions whether a district court,after a defendant sentence has been set aside on appeal,may consider evidence of a defendant postsentencing rehabilitation to support a downward variance when resentencing the defendant,a question that has divided the courts of appeals and whether the resentencing court was required,under the law of the case doctrine,to apply the same percentage departure from the guidelines range for substantial assistance that had been applied at pepper prior sentencing.because the united states has confessed error in the court of appeals ruling on the first question,we appointed an amicus curiae to defend the court of appeals judgment we now vacate the eighth circuit ruling on the first question and affirm its ruling on the second.
it has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate,sometimes magnify,the crime and the punishment to ensue.koon united states.underlying this tradition is the principle that the punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime.williams,at see also pennsylvania ex rel.sullivan ashe,for the determination of sentences,justice generally requires consideration of more than the particular acts by which the crime was committed and that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and propensities of the offender 
consistent with this principle,we have observed that both before and since the american colonies became a nation,courts in this country and in england practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law.williams,at.in particular,we have emphasized that h ighly relevant if not essential to the selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant life and characteristics.at.permitting sentencing courts to consider the widest possible breadth of information about a defendant ensures that the punishment will suit not merely the offense but the individual defendant.wasman united states.
in,congress codified the longstanding principle that sentencing courts have broad discretion to consider various kinds of information at ed.united states watts,per curiam.section ed.provided 
no limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background,character,and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the united states may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.emphasis added.
in the sentencing reform act of sra,et,congress effected fundamental changes to federal sentencing by creating the federal sentencing commission and introducing the guidelines scheme.in doing so,however,congress recodified without change at.the sentencing commission,moreover,expressly incorporated in the guidelines 
in determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range,or whether a departure from the guidelines is warranted,the court may consider,without limitation,any information concerning the background,character and conduct of the defendant,unless otherwise prohibited by law.see.ussg emphasis added.
both congress and the sentencing commission thus expressly preserved the traditional discretion of sentencing courts to conduct an inquiry broad in scope,largely unlimited either as to the kind of information they may consider,or the source from which it may come.united states tucker,
the sra did constrain sentencing courts discretion in important respects,most notably by making the guidelines mandatory,see b,supp.iv,and by specifying various factors that courts must consider in exercising their discretion,see a.in our seminal decision in booker,we held that where facts found by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence increased the applicable guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory in those circumstances violated the sixth amendment right of criminal defendants to be tried by a jury and to have every element of an offense proved by the government beyond a reasonable doubt,at.our remedial opinion in booker invalidated two offending provisions in the sra,see,at invalidating b,e,and instructed the district courts to treat the guidelines as effectively advisory,at.
our opinions make clear that,although a sentencing court must give respectful consideration to the guidelines,booker permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well.kimbrough united states,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.accordingly,although the guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark,district courts may impose sentences within statutory limits based on appropriate consideration of all of the factors listed in a,subject to appellate review for reasonableness.gall,at.this sentencing framework applies both at a defendant initial sentencing and at any subsequent resentencing after a sentence has been set aside on appeal.see g a district court to which a case is remanded shall resentence a defendant in accordance with section see also dillon united states,slip,at distinguishing between proceedings under c,which do not implicate the interests identified in booker,and plenary resentencing proceedings,which do.
in light of the federal sentencing framework described above,we think it clear that when a defendant sentence has been set aside on appeal and his case remanded for resentencing,a district court may consider evidence of a defendant rehabilitation since his prior sentencing and that such evidence may,in appropriate cases,support a downward variance from the advisory guidelines range.
preliminarily,congress could not have been clearer in directing that n o limitation be placed on the information concerning the background,character,and conduct of a defendant that a district court may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.the plain language of makes no distinction between a defendant initial sentencing and a subsequent resentencing after a prior sentence has been set aside on appeal.we have recognized that the broad language of does not provide any basis for the courts to invent a blanket prohibition against considering certain types of evidence at sentencing.watts,at.a categorical bar on the consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence would directly contravene congress expressed intent in.
in addition,evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of the a factors that congress has expressly instructed district courts to consider at sentencing.for example,evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation may plainly be relevant to the history and characteristics of the defendant.a.such evidence may also be pertinent to the need for the sentence imposed to serve the general purposes of sentencing set forth in a in particular,to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or other correctional treatment in the most manner.a b d see mcmannus,at melloy,concurring in assessing deterrence,protection of the public,and rehabilitation,a b c d,there would seem to be no better evidence than a defendant conduct postsentencing rehabilitation may also critically inform a sentencing judge overarching duty under a to impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary to comply with the sentencing purposes set forth in a.
as the original sentencing judge recognized,the extensive evidence of pepper rehabilitation since his initial sentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appropriate sentence in this case.most fundamentally,evidence of pepper conduct since his release from custody in june provides the most picture of pepper history and characteristics.a see united states bryson,a court duty is always to sentence the defendant as he stands before the court on the day of sentencing at the time of his initial sentencing in,pepper was a drug addict who was unemployed,estranged from his family,and had recently sold drugs as part of a methamphetamine conspiracy.by the time of his second resentencing in,pepper had been for nearly five years,had attended college and achieved high grades,was a top employee at his job slated for a promotion,had a relationship with his father,and was married and supporting his wife daughter.there is no question that this evidence of pepper conduct since his initial sentencing constitutes a critical part of the history and characteristics of a defendant that congress intended sentencing courts to consider.a.
pepper postsentencing conduct also sheds light on the likelihood that he will engage in future criminal conduct,a central factor that district courts must assess when imposing sentence.see a b c gall,at gall rehabilitation lends strong support to the conclusion that imprisonment was not necessary to deter gall from engaging in future criminal conduct or to protect the public from his future criminal acts citing a b c.as recognized by pepper probation officer,pepper steady employment,as well as his successful completion of a drug treatment program and his condition,also suggest a diminished need for educational or vocational training or other correctional treatment.a d.finally,pepper exemplary postsentencing conduct may be taken as the most accurate indicator of his present purposes and tendencies and significantly to suggest the period of restraint and the kind of discipline that ought to be imposed upon him.ashe,at.accordingly,evidence of pepper postsentencing rehabilitation bears directly on the district court overarching duty to impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing.a.
in sum,the court of appeals ruling prohibiting the district court from considering any evidence of pepper postsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing conflicts with longstanding principles of federal sentencing law and contravenes congress directives in and a.
amicus nevertheless advances two principal arguments in defense of the court of appeals ruling g,which restricts the discretion of a resentencing court on remand to impose a sentence,effectively forecloses consideration of a defendant postsentencing rehabilitation and permitting district courts to consider postsentencing rehabilitation would defeat congress objectives under a.we are not persuaded.
amicus main argument relies on g,a provision that the court of appeals did not cite below.that provision states that when a sentence is set aside on appeal,the district court to which the case is remanded 
shall not impose a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range except upon a ground that a was specifically and affirmatively included in the written statement of reasons required by section c in connection with the previous sentencing of the defendant prior to the appeal and b was held by the court of appeals,in remanding the case,to be a permissible ground of departure.
in operation,g restricts the discretion of a district court on remand by precluding the court from imposing a sentence outside the guidelines range except upon a ground of departure that was expressly relied upon in the prior sentencing and upheld on appeal.amicus thus correctly contends that,on its face,g effectively forecloses a resentencing court from considering evidence of a defendant postsentencing rehabilitation for purposes of imposing a sentence because,as a practical matter,such evidence did not exist at the time of the prior sentencing.as the government concedes,however,g is invalid after booker.
as we have explained,booker held that where judicial factfinding increases a defendant applicable sentencing guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory in those circumstances would violate the defendant sixth amendment right to be tried by a jury and to have every element of an offense proved by the government beyond a reasonable doubt.see supra,at.we recognized in booker that,although the sra permitted departures from the applicable guidelines range in limited circumstances departures are not available in every case,and in fact are unavailable in most.at.because in those instances,the judge is bound to impose a sentence within the guidelines range,we concluded that the availability of departures in certain circumstances does not avoid the constitutional issue.ibid.
to remedy the constitutional problem,we rendered the guidelines effectively advisory by invalidating two provisions of the sra b,supp.iv,which generally required sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable guidelines range,and e ed.and supp.iv,which prescribed the standard of appellate review,including de novo review of guidelines departures,at.we invalidated these provisions even though we recognized that mandatory application of the guidelines would not always result in a sixth amendment violation indeed,although the government suggested in booker that we render the guidelines advisory only in cases in which the constitution prohibits judicial factfinding,we rejected that proposal,reasoning that congress would not have authorized a mandatory system in some cases and a system in others,given the administrative complexities that such a system would create.at see dillon,at slip,at the incomplete remedy we rejected in booker would have required courts to treat the guidelines differently in similar proceedings,leading potentially to unfair results and considerable administrative challenges 
we did not expressly mention g in booker but the rationale we set forth in that opinion for invalidating b and e applies equally to g.as with those provisions,g requires district courts effectively to treat the guidelines as mandatory in an entire set of cases.specifically,g precludes a district court on remand from imposing a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range except upon a ground of departure that was expressly relied upon by the court at the prior sentencing and upheld by the court of appeals.in circumstances in which the district court did not rely upon such a departure ground at the prior sentencing,g would require the court on remand to impose a sentence within the applicable guidelines range,thus rendering the guidelines effectively mandatory.because in a large set of cases,judicial factfinding will increase the applicable guidelines range beyond that supported solely by the facts established by the jury verdict or guilty plea,requiring a sentencing judge on remand to apply the guidelines range,as g does,will often result in a sixth amendment violation for the reasons we explained in booker.accordingly,as with the provisions in booker,the proper remedy here is to invalidate g.
the sentencing proceeding at issue in booker itself illustrates why g can not withstand sixth amendment scrutiny.the district court in booker increased the defendant guidelines range based on a finding that it,rather than the jury,made,at.after we held that the guidelines must be treated as advisory,we remanded the case for resentencing,at.had g remained valid after booker,the district court on remand would have been required to sentence within the guidelines range because it did not depart from the guidelines at the original sentencing.accordingly,the resentencing judge in booker would have been required under g to impose a guidelines sentence based on facts concerning drug quantity,the precise result that booker forbids.
the same result would occur in any sentencing in which a district court erroneously refuses to impose a sentence outside the guidelines range based on a misunderstanding of its authority to depart under or vary from the guidelines.reply brief for united states.for example,if g remained valid,there would be no remedy at resentencing if a district court erroneously believed the guidelines were presumptively reasonable,see nelson united states,per curiam slip,at,or if it mistakenly thought that a sentence required extraordinary circumstances,see gall,at,or if it incorrectly concluded that it could not vary from the guidelines based on a policy disagreement with their disparate treatment of crack and powder cocaine,see kimbrough,at.in such cases,the district court at the initial sentencing proceeding will necessarily have imposed a sentence within the guidelines range,and thus g would require the imposition of a guidelines sentence on remand.see reply brief for petitioner describing further categories of cases where the booker remedy would be entirely unavailable if g were valid 
to be sure,applying g at resentencing would not always result in a sixth amendment violation.for example,where the applicable guidelines range rests solely on facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,application of g at resentencing would not render the sentence constitutionally infirm.but,as explained above,that possibility was equally true with respect to the sentencing provisions we invalidated in booker.see supra,at.as with those provisions,we can not assume that congress,if faced with the statute invalidity in key applications,would have preferred to apply the statute in as many other instances as possible.at.just as we rejected a system in booker that would have made the guidelines mandatory in some cases and advisory in others,we reject a partial invalidation of g that would leave us with the same result.
the fact that g permits a resentencing court on remand to impose a sentence in cases where the prior sentence expressly relied upon a departure upheld by the court of appeals also does not cure the constitutional infirmity.as explained above,we observed in booker that the availability of departures from the applicable guidelines ranges in specified circumstances does not avoid the constitutional issue.at.because departures are not available in every case,and in fact are unavailable in most,we held that remedying the sixth amendment problem required invalidation of b.that same remedial approach requires us to invalidate g 
amicus contends that any constitutional infirmity in g can be remedied by invalidating j b rather than g.brief for amicus curiae in support of judgment below.section j b provides that a ground of departure is permissible for purposes of g b only if it is,inter alia,authorized under section b.in booker,we noted that statutory to the sra provisions we invalidated were also constitutionally infirm,at.because j b incorporates a to b,one of the provisions we invalidated in booker,amicus suggests that invalidating j b would cure any constitutional defect in g b.as the government explains,however,even if j b were invalidated and a district court could depart on any ground at an initial sentencing,the district court would not be able to depart on any new ground at resentencing so long as g remains in force.because amicus proposed solution would still result in the guidelines being effectively mandatory at resentencing in an entire set of cases,it fails to remedy the fundamental constitutional defect of g.
amicus next cluster of arguments focuses on congress sentencing objectives under a.preliminarily,amicus contends that even if g is constitutionally invalid,that provision reflects a congressional policy determination that only information available at the time of original sentencing should be considered,and that this policy determination should inform our analysis of whether a permits consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence.this argument,however,is based on a faulty premise.
contrary to amicus contention,g does not reflect a congressional purpose to preclude consideration of evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing.to be sure,g has the incidental effect of limiting the weight a sentencing court may place on postsentencing rehabilitation by precluding the court from resentencing outside the guidelines range on a ground of departure on which it did not previously rely.but on its face,nothing in g prohibits a district court from considering postsentencing developments including postsentencing rehabilitation in selecting a sentence within the applicable guidelines range.section g also does not apply to resentencings that occur for reasons other than when a sentence is overturned on appeal and the case is remanded,when a sentence is set aside on collateral review under.in such circumstances,g does not restrict a district court at all,much less with respect to consideration of postsentencing developments.accordingly,because we see no general congressional policy reflected in g to preclude resentencing courts from considering postsentencing information that provision has no bearing on our analysis of whether a permits consideration of evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation.
as we explained above,evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation may be highly relevant to several of the sentencing factors that congress has specifically instructed district courts to consider.see supra,at discussing a,a,a b d.amicus,however,argues that consideration of postsentencing is inconsistent with two sentencing factors a,which directs sentencing courts to consider any pertinent policy statement of the sentencing commission,and a,which requires courts to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentenc ing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.
with regard to a,amicus points to the sentencing commission policy statement in ussg,which provides that p rehabilitative efforts,even if exceptional,undertaken by a defendant after imposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant offense,are not an appropriate basis for a downward departure when resentencing the defendant for that offense.according to amicus,that policy statement is clear and unequivocal,and as an exercise of the sentencing commission core function,should be given effect.brief for amicus curiae in support of judgment below.
to be sure,we have recognized that the commission continues to fil l an important institutional role because i t has the capacity courts lack to base its determinations on empirical data and national experience,guided by a professional staff with appropriate expertise.kimbrough,at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we have instructed that district courts must still give respectful consideration to the guidelines and their accompanying policy statements,at.as amicus acknowledges,however,our decisions make clear that a district court may in appropriate cases impose a sentence based on a disagreement with the commission views.see,at.that is particularly true where,as here,the commission views rest on wholly unconvincing policy rationales not reflected in the sentencing statutes congress enacted.
the commentary to ussg expresses the commission view that departures based on postsentencing rehabilitation would be inconsistent with the policies established by congress under b governing good time credit and other statutory provisions for reducing the time to be served by an imprisoned person and inequitably benefit only those who gain the opportunity to be resentenced de novo.with regard to the first proffered rationale,a sentencing reduction based on postsentencing rehabilitation can hardly be said to be inconsistent with the policies underlying an award of good time credit under b because the two serve distinctly different penological interests indeed,the difference between the two is reflected most obviously in the fact that the bop has no authority to award good time credit where,as in this case,the defendant good behavior occurs after a sentence has already been served the commission second proffered rationale fares no better.to be sure,allowing district courts to consider evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation may result in disparate treatment between those defendants who are sentenced properly and those who must be resentenced.but that disparity arises not because of arbitrary or random sentencing practices,but because of the ordinary operation of appellate sentencing review.
in a closely related vein,amicus argues that consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation is inconsistent with a,which requires sentencing courts to consider the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.the court of appeals also rested its holding on this ground,reasoning that allowing postsentencing rehabilitation evidence to influence defendant sentence would be grossly unfair to the vast majority of defendants who receive no review of any positive rehabilitative efforts.at quoting mcmannus,at.but amicus points to no evidence,nor are we aware of any,suggesting that congress enacted a out of a concern with disparities resulting from the normal trial and sentencing process the differences in procedural opportunity that may result because some defendants are inevitably sentenced in error and must be resentenced are not the kinds of unwarranted sentencing disparities that congress sought to eliminate under a.united states labonte,disparity arising from exercise of prosecutorial discretion not unwarranted united states rhodes,cadc distinguishing between prisoners whose convictions are reversed on appeal and all other prisoners hardly seems unwarranted 
as the government explains,moreover,the logic of the court of appeals approach below,that rehabilitation is not relevant because the district court could not have considered that evidence at the time of the original sentencing,at internal quotation marks omitted would require sentencing courts categorically to ignore not only postsentencing rehabilitation,but any postsentencing information,including,for example,evidence that a defendant had committed postsentencing offenses.our precedents,however,provide no basis to support such a categorical bar.see,wasman,at a sentencing authority may justify an increased sentence by affirmatively identifying relevant conduct or events that occurred subsequent to the original sentencing proceedings north carolina pearce.indeed,even the court of appeals below does not accept the logical consequence of its approach as it permits district courts to consider postsentencing conduct that would support a higher sentence.see united states stapleton.nothing in a and,however,remotely suggests that congress intended district courts to consider only postsentencing evidence detrimental to a defendant while turning a blind eye to favorable evidence of a defendant postsentencing rehabilitation.united states jones,obviously,the discretion that booker accords sentencing judges to impose sentences can not be an escalator that only goes up 
finally,we note that a and a describe only two of the seven sentencing factors that courts must consider in imposing sentence.at root,amicus effectively invites us to elevate two a factors above all others.we reject that invitation.see gall,at instructing sentencing courts to consider all of the a factors emphasis added.
for the reasons stated above,we hold that the court of appeals erred in categorically precluding the district court from considering evidence of pepper postsentencing rehabilitation after his initial sentence was set aside on appeal.district courts may consider evidence of a defendant postsentencing rehabilitation at resentencing and such evidence may,in appropriate cases,support a downward variance from the advisory guidelines range 
the government informs us that,in granting pepper motion for release pending disposition of this appeal,see,supra,the district court stated that it would not have exercised its discretion to grant pepper a downward variance based on postsentencing rehabilitation.that statement,however,was made in light of the court of appeals erroneous views regarding postsentencing rehabilitation evidence.because we expressly reject those views today,it is unclear from the record whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence had it properly considered the extensive evidence of pepper postsentencing rehabilitation.on remand,the district court should consider and give appropriate weight to that evidence,as well as any additional evidence concerning pepper conduct since his last sentencing in january.accordingly,we vacate the eighth circuit judgment in respect to pepper sentence and remand the case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
the second question presented in this case merits only a brief discussion.as noted above,the original sentencing judge in this case granted pepper a percent downward departure pursuant to ussg based on pepper substantial assistance and sentenced him to months imprisonment.when the court of appeals vacated that sentence in pepper ii,and again in pepper iii,the case was reassigned on remand to chief judge reade.in resentencing pepper,chief judge reade ruled that she was not bound by the prior sentencing judge decision to grant a percent downward departure and instead granted only a percent downward departure,which the court of appeals upheld in pepper iv.pepper argues that the law of the case doctrine required chief judge reade to apply the same percent departure granted by the original sentencing judge.we disagree.
preliminarily,we note that the mandates in pepper ii and pepper iii were general remand s for resentencing,which did not place any limitations on the discretion of the newly assigned district court judge in resentencing pepper.at.in his merits briefs to this court,pepper does not challenge the scope or validity of the court of appeals mandate ordering de novo resentencing,and thus has abandoned any argument that the mandate itself restricted the district court from imposing a different substantial assistance departure the only question before us is whether the law of the case doctrine required chief judge reade to adhere to the original sentencing judge decision granting a percent downward departure.
although we have described the law of the case a s an amorphous concept,a s most commonly defined,the doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.arizona california.this doctrine directs a court discretion,it does not limit the tribunal power.ibid.accordingly,the doctrine does not apply if the court is convinced that its prior decision is clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.agostini felton,quoting arizona,at,alteration in original.
pepper argues that,because the original sentencing judge decision to grant the percent departure was never set aside by the court of appeals or this court,it constituted the law of the case.as such,pepper contends that chief judge reade should not have disturbed that ruling absent compelling justification for overturning it.brief for petitioner.according to pepper,because chief judge reade identified no such justification,the law of the case doctrine required her to adhere to the percent departure granted by the original sentencing judge.
as the government explains,however,the court of appeals in pepper iii set aside pepper entire sentence and remanded for a de novo resentencing.see,at.thus,even assuming,arguendo,that the original sentencing court decision to impose a percent departure was at one point law of the case,pepper iii effectively wiped the slate clean.to be sure,pepper iii vacated pepper sentence on grounds unrelated to the substantial assistance departure,but that fact does not affect our conclusion.a criminal sentence is a package of sanctions that the district court utilizes to effectuate its sentencing intent.united states stinson,per curiam.because a district court original sentencing intent may be undermined by altering one portion of the calculus,united states white,an appellate court when reversing one part of a defendant sentence may vacate the entire sentence so that,on remand,the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan to satisfy the sentencing factors in a,greenlaw united states.that is precisely what the eighth circuit did here.
accordingly,because the court of appeals in pepper iii remanded for de novo resentencing,we conclude that chief judge reade was not bound by the law of the case doctrine to apply the same percent departure that had been applied at pepper prior sentencing.
for the reasons stated above,the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit is vacated in part and affirmed in part,and the case is remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice breyer,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
i join part iii of the court opinion as to the second question presented.as to the first question presented,i agree with the court conclusion.and i agree with its opinion to the extent that it is consistent with this concurrence.
like the majority,i believe booker requires us to hold g unconstitutional.see ante,at united states booker,see also apprendi new jersey.and,like the majority,i believe that the law does not require a sentencing court to follow a guideline policy statement that forbids taking account of postsentencing rehabilitation.united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual ussg.i would emphasize,however,that this conclusion does not leave a sentencing court free to disregard the guidelines at will.to the contrary,the law permits the court to disregard the guidelines only where it is reasonable for a court to do so.booker,supra,at gall united states,kimbrough united states.and an appellate court must be guided by the basic sentencing objectives of the statutes that create the guidelines in determining whether,in disregarding the guidelines,the sentencing court has acted unreasonably.
the guideline in question consists of a policy statement that sets forth an exception to normal guideline rules.normally,the guidelines authorize a sentencing judge to consider a departure from an ordinary guidelines sentence in any case where conduct significantly differs from the norm to which a particular guideline linguistically applies.ussg ch,pt,b discussing the guidelines general approach to departures.the policy statement at issue is one of a handful of guideline rules that nonetheless forbid departure.it says that a defendant p rehabilitative efforts,even if exceptional,are not an appropriate basis for a downward departure when resentencing.ussg.the policy statement thereby adds rehabilitative efforts to such factors as race,sex,national origin,creed,religion,and socioeconomic status,which the guidelines absolutely prohibit the sentencing judge from taking into account.ussg ch,pt,b.
can a sentencing court,despite this policy statement,take account of postsentencing rehabilitation in the particular circumstances that this case presents i can not find the answer to this question in the language of the sentencing statutes,in sentencing traditions,in the case of williams new york,or in this court use of the word advisory.as the majority points out,a sentencing statute forbids any limitation on the information concerning the background,character,and conduct that a court may consider.ante,at quoting emphasis deleted.but this provision must refer to all relevant information.see ussg and comment.generally incorporating,but noting that there are certain factors that should not be considered for any purpose.if the guideline policy statement absolute prohibition on consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation were legally binding,then information on that score like information about race,religion,sex,or national origin would fall outside the scope of this provision,for it would not be relevant.thus,reference to the statute begs the question.
nor can i find much help in the majority reference to a sentencing tradition that considers every convicted person as an individual.ante,at quoting koon united states.that is because individualized sentencing is not the only relevant tradition.a just legal system seeks not only to treat different cases differently but also to treat like cases alike.fairness requires sentencing uniformity as well as efforts to recognize relevant sentencing differences.indeed,when congress enacted the sentencing statutes before us,it focused upon the unfair way in which federal sentencing failed to treat similar offenders similarly.and congress wrote statutes designed primarily though not exclusively to bring about greater uniformity in sentencing.see,booker,supra,at.the statutes do so in large part through the creation of a system of guidelines written by a sentencing commission,which congress intended the courts to follow.see mistretta united states,sentencing commission constitutional rita united states,a identifying relevant factors in sentencing,including uniformity.
the williams case is similarly unhelpful.that is because congress in the sentencing reform act of the law before us disavowed the individualized approach to sentencing that that case followed.williams emphasized the importance of a sentencing court legal power to tailor punishment ability to fit the circumstances of each individual offender,at emphasizing modern concepts individualizing punishment but congress,concerned that individualized sentencing had gone too far,wrote a new sentencing law designed to help correct disparities among similar defendants sentenced by different judges.see,sentencing disparities are unfair both to offenders and to the public at disparities can be traced directly to the unfettered discretion the law confers on those judges and parole authorities responsible for imposing and implementing the sentence 
booker description of the guidelines as advisory offers somewhat greater assistance but only if that word is read in light of the sixth amendment analysis that precedes it.this court has held that the sixth amendment forbids congress through the commission to create guidelines that both require judges without juries to find sentencing facts and also tie those facts to the mandatory imposition of particular sentences,at,see also apprendi,at sixth amendment requires jury findings in respect to factual matters that require judge to increase sentence blakely washington,same in respect to a state mandatory guidelines.in light of this sixth amendment prohibition,the court,believing that congress would not have intended to introduce new juries into each sentencing proceeding,excised the few particular provisions of the sentencing statutes that specified that application of the guidelines was mandatory.booker,at.the court believed that the relevant statutes remained workable without those few provisions,that their excision could further congress basic sentencing intentions,and that excision was more likely to do so than invalidation of the entire statutory scheme.with an occasional exception such as the statutory provision we strike down today,there is no reason to think that the sentencing statutes as limited in booker run afoul of the sixth amendment.ibid.
booker made clear that the remaining statutory provisions,while leading us to call the guidelines advisory rather than mandatory do not give a sentencing judge carte blanche to apply,or not to apply,the guidelines as that judge chooses.rather,the district courts,while not bound to apply the guidelines,must consult those guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.at.moreover,booker held that appellate court review of sentencing is valid.booker explained that the statutory language,the structure of the sentencing reform act,and the sound administration of justice,taken together,require appellate courts to apply reasonableness standard s of review,at,internal quotation marks omitted.reasonableness standards,we added,are not foreign to sentencing law.at.and the act has long required their use in important sentencing circumstances both on review of departures and on review of sentences imposed where there was no applicable guideline.ibid.see also,at appellate courts will apply a practical standard of review already familiar to appellate courts review for unreasonable ness at c ourts of appeals will review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness 
we have also indicated that,in applying reasonableness standards,the appellate courts should take account of sentencing policy as embodied in the statutes and guidelines,as well as of the comparative expertise of trial and appellate courts.thus,in kimbrough,we observed that in light of the discrete institutional strengths of the sentencing commission and sentencing judges,a district court decision to vary from the advisory guidelines may attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a particular case outside the heartland to which the commission intends individual guidelines to apply.at quoting rita,supra,at.we noted,however,that while the guidelines are no longer binding,closer review may be in order when the sentencing judge varies from the guidelines based solely on the judge view that the guidelines range fails properly to reflect a considerations even in a case.at.
unlike the majority,i would decide the question kimbrough left open.and i would follow its suggested framework for evaluating reasonableness.as suggests,doing so takes proper account of the comparative institutional abilities of trial courts,appellate courts,and the sentencing commission.the trial court typically better understands the individual circumstances of particular cases before it,while the commission has comparatively greater ability to gather information,to consider a broader national picture,to compare sentences attaching to different offenses,and ultimately to write more coherent overall standards that reflect nationally uniform,not simply local,sentencing policies.
applying kimbrough suggested framework,i would reason very much as does the majority.the first question is whether a sentencing judge might sometimes take account of a resentenced offender postsentencing rehabilitation despite a guideline policy statement that says never.i would find that it is reasonable for the judge to disregard the guidelines absolute prohibition,despite the commission comparatively greater abilities.that is because the guideline policy statement itself runs counter to ordinary guideline sentencing policy,which rarely forbids departures and then for very strong policy reasons.supra,at.see ussg ch,pt,b.
the commission offers no convincing justification for creating this exception with respect to postsentencing rehabilitation.the commission commentary says that for a judge at resentencing to lower a sentence for this reason reflecting good behavior while the case is on appeal would conflict with the use of other mechanisms,such as credits,for that purpose.but how is that so a defendant,after sentencing but while his case is on appeal,may or may not be entitled to good time.that may depend upon whether he remains on bail or upon particular rules.regardless,the resentencing judge can take account of any such matter.see also ante,at.
the commission commentary also suggests it would be inequitable to allow an offender who is being resentenced to receive any kind of credit for his good behavior,say while his case was on appeal.but why is that so after all,the guidelines permit a judge to take account of an offender good behavior after arrest but before initial sentencing.that time period could last longer than the time taken up on appeal.why should pretrial behavior count but appeal time behavior not count like the majority,i find this justification for the policy statement unconvincing.see ante,at.
the second question is whether,given the sentencing court power to disregard the policy statement forbidding departures based on postsentencing rehabilitation,the facts and circumstances here could warrant a departure or variance for that reason.and the answer,in my view,is yes.this case presents unusual rehabilitative circumstances.as the majority observes by the time of his second resentencing in,pepper had been for nearly five years,had attended college and achieved high grades,was a top employee at his job slated for a promotion,had reestablished a relationship with his father,and was married and supporting his wife daughter.ante,at.these are facts and circumstances,and they are of the kind that should lead appellate courts to show their greatest respect for a sentencing decision,including a departure or variance,that rests upon them.
in sum,the sentencing statutes,as we have interpreted them,require courts of appeals to review sentences for reasonableness,including sentences that depart or vary from a specific guideline.the appellate courts should review those decisions more closely when they rest upon disagreement with guidelines policy.kimbrough,at.they should review those decisions with greater deference when they rest upon circumstances that place the case outside a specific guideline heartland.see rita,at koon,at.
by interpreting the sentencing statutes in this way,we can remain faithful to congress basic intent in writing them despite the need to invalidate statutory provisions that conflict with the sixth amendment.the statutes create a sentencing commission with authority to develop sentencing policy embodied in the guidelines.the guidelines are to further the statutes basic objective,namely greater sentencing uniformity,whil
