carlos luis alvira sanchez alleges that the district court in this case made several errors in accepting and entering his guilty plea.alvira sanchez made no objections to any of those purported errors at the time,nor did he thereafter seek to withdraw his plea,even after he was sentenced.he now asks that we vacate the acceptance of his plea.although several of alvira sanchez claims of error are meritorious,no shortcoming in the district court acceptance of his plea caused him any harm.accordingly,we deny alvira sanchez request for reversal.at the same time,because the parties agree that alvira sanchez is entitled to seek a sentencing reduction under amendment to the drug quantity table of the united states guidelines,we remand solely for consideration of that request.
background 
on october,law enforcement officers entered a residence located roughly feet from a school to arrest alvira sanchez on two outstanding warrants.on entry,officers found,among other things,a loaded zombie rifle,approximately grams of cocaine,approximately grams of cocaine base,approximately grams of marijuana,and drug paraphernalia.on october,alvira sanchez was charged with four counts possession of a firearm in a school zone,in violation of q possession of cocaine in a school zone,with intent to distribute,in violation of possession of marijuana in a school zone,with intent to distribute,in violation of and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c.
on february,alvira sanchez came before the court to enter a straight guilty plea,a plea not the product of a plea bargain on all counts.after verifying alvira sanchez competence to plead,the court explained that pleading guilty waived the right to trial by jury,the presumption of innocence,the right to a public trial,and the right to remain silent.the court next listed the elements of each of the four charged crimes and verified alvira sanchez understanding.the court did not,however,expressly inform alvira sanchez of his right to persist in a plea of not guilty.see.b b.
turning to the penalties,the court stated that the gun counts may require a consecutive sentence.the court then described the penalties regarding the drugs as,in relevant part,i mprisonment of not more than years,s upervised release of at least three years,and the payment of a special monetary assessment,and the penalties regarding the gun as,in relevant part,at least five years,statutory minimum not more than life imprisonment,supervised release that can go as high as five years,and the payment of a special monetary assessment.the court concluded by explaining that parole would not be available,that the court was not bound by the recommendations of the united states sentencing guidelines ussg,and that alvira sanchez would serve a term of supervised release that will never be more than five years.the court did not,however,inform alvira sanchez that any sentence imposed for count possession of a firearm in a school zone,up to a maximum of five years,was statutorily mandated to run consecutively to any other sentence,or that count would carry its own concurrent term of supervised release and special monetary assessment.after alvira sanchez accepted the government factual proffer,the court entered his plea and ordered a presentence investigation report psr.
the psr as ultimately amended grouped counts and calculated a total offense level of for those counts for criminal history,the psr listed five prior arrests,including one arrest for pending criminal charges and three arrests for past dismissed charges.the psr also noted that alvira sanchez had pled guilty to four unlisted juvenile offenses.the psr concluded that alvira sanchez fell within criminal history category chc i,corresponding to a recommended sentence of months for grouped counts.count carried a mandatory minimum sentence of months.it was mandatory that any sentences imposed for counts and run consecutively to all other sentences,and to each other.
alvira sanchez appeared thereafter for sentencing.he requested a guidelines sentence of months months for grouped counts,plus the mandatory consecutive month sentence for count.the court granted his subsidiary request that it treat the pending charges listed in the psr criminal history section as allegations,but it declined to do the same for the previously dismissed charges,seeing no logical,reasonable explanation,legal or factual or otherwise as to why the charges had been dismissed.looking at the entirety of the psr criminal history section,the court said that you can tell a mile away that alvira sanchez has been involved for a substantial part of his life in the business of drug dealing and firearms.
turning to its obligation to sentence alvira sanchez under,the court said that even though we have not mentioned a by name,it is obvious that all this discussion surrounds a,the sentencing factors.expressing concern for puerto rico high crime rate and the real need for deterrence of criminal conduct,the court sentenced alvira sanchez to months for count,months for counts,and months for count,with all sentences to be served consecutively for a total of months.in addition,the court imposed concurrent terms of supervised release of three years count,six years count,four years count,and five years count.finally,the court imposed a monetary assessment for each count,for a total of.unhappy with his sentence,alvira sanchez now asks that we vacate the sentence and allow him to withdraw his plea,or that we remand for a new sentence.
ii.analysis 
a.the plea.standard of review 
because alvira sanchez raised no objection to his plea colloquy below,he bears the burden of showing that an error occurred that the error was clear or obvious that the error impaired his substantial rights and that the error seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.
the consequences of count 
before entering a guilty plea,a court must ensure that the defendant understands any maximum possible penalty,including imprisonment,fine,and term of supervised release.b h.here,rather than explaining the consequences of the gun counts counts and separately,the district court said merely,in relevant part,r egarding the gun,the statutory penalty is at least five years,statutory minimum not more than life imprisonment supervised release that can go as high as five years plus the payment of a special monetary assessment that consecutive.the court accurately stated the penalties for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime count.see c a i a a b a.the court did not,however,indicate that possession of a firearm in a school zone count carried the potential for a separate term of imprisonment not more than five years,required to run consecutively,see a,and its own concurrent term of supervised release,see a.
the government argues that the court statement that the gun counts may require a consecutive sentence was adequate notice,but alvira sanchez is correct that nothing in that formulation served to inform him that the gun counts carried the potential for separate multiple sentences rather than a single sentence,and that the consecutive nature of those sentences was mandatory as opposed to permissive,and that they must be consecutive not only to all counts,but also to each other.failure to explain correctly the interaction of the consecutive sentences on the two counts was thus obviously erroneous.united states santiago,cir government conceded that failure to inform defendant that sentences must run consecutively was an obvious error.
that error,though,did not affect alvira sanchez substantial rights.given that count does not require any minimum sentence,see a,and that alvira sanchez already knew he risked up to a year term for counts and a consecutive life sentence for count,there is no reason to think that the risk of an additional year term would have affected alvira sanchez willingness to plead.he does not allege as much.see united states romero galindez,cir finding no plain error where district court understated the supervised release period by two years at the change of plea hearing because,inter alia,the discrepancy was but a small fraction of the penalty defendant was facing.
the same analysis holds for the district court failure to describe accurately count term of supervised release.alvira sanchez knew that he faced a potential term of supervised release under count that would never be more than five years.because supervised release terms must run concurrently,see u.e,and because no authorized term of supervised release under exceeds five years,any term of supervised release under count could not have increased alvira sanchez total exposure.alvira sanchez nevertheless argues that the number of concurrent supervised release terms being served is consequential,as it could affect the consequences should he violate his conditions of release.alvira sanchez fails,however,to allege that such an indirect and potential ramification of the plea would have affected his decision to plead guilty,had he been properly informed of count concurrent supervised release term.nor would such an allegation be remotely persuasive.
nor did the failure to inform alvira sanchez of count potential for an added monetary assessment likely affect his decision to plead.the court mentioned a monetary assessment in connection with the gun charges and did not specify any dollar amount.alvira sanchez elected to plead without knowing what his financial liability might be.it is not likely that the omission impaired alvira sanchez substantial rights because it is not likely that he would have reversed course had he known that he faced two assessments of unknown value in connection with the gun charges,rather than one.
the right to persist in pleading not guilty 
alvira sanchez complains for the first time on appeal that the district court never in so many words confirmed that he understood that,as federal rule of criminal procedure b b states in a straightforward manner,he had the right to plead not guilty,or having already so pleaded,to persist in that plea.rather,the district court asked alvira sanchez if he understood that he was waiving the right that you have to put the government through the burden of proving you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt without you having to prove your innocence.whether this description of the right was,by itself,an insufficient circumlocution or,instead,a practical elaboration that might stand on its own,we need not decide rather,the transcript as a whole makes clear that alvira sanchez knew that he was not compelled to persist in pleading guilty.united states cotal crespo,cir finding plea colloquy adequate when it was clear from context,inter alia,that the defendants understood that they had the right to persist in their innocence and go to trial,but cautioning that for the sake of judicial economy and fundamental fairness,the best way to ensure that rule is complied with is to explicitly comply with rule.
notably,the district court asked alvira sanchez toward the conclusion of the colloquy,do you still want to plead thereby implying that it was still alvira sanchez choice whether or not to plead.even alvira sanchez brief on appeal implicitly concedes this point by arguing that the court explanation at the hearing of the criminal charges against him affected his decision to plead guilty.accordingly,even if we were to assume that the lack of an express reference to the right to persist in a plea of not guilty was error,such an error could not have affected alvira sanchez substantial rights.united states borrero acevedo,cir it is defendant burden on plain error review to show that but for the error he would otherwise not have pled guilty.if the record contains no evidence in defendant favor,his claim fails.
b.the monetary assessment and supervised release 
alvira sanchez briefly argues that the supervised release term and monetary assessment sentences imposed for count were contrary to statute.a reads in relevant part,except for the authorization of a term of imprisonment of not more than years made in this paragraph,for the purpose of any other law a violation of section q possession of a firearm in a school zone shall be deemed to be a misdemeanor.thus reading his q count count to be a misdemeanor,alvira sanchez asserts that the maximum permitted supervised release term under b is year,and the maximum permitted monetary assessment under a a iii is.
but the statutory language is not as clear as alvira sanchez contends.a classifies an offense as a class d felony if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is less than ten years but five or more years.one could construe a as establishing that a q offense is a misdemeanor except where misdemeanor and felony are distinguished by their authorized terms of imprisonment.this may not be the most persuasive reading,but this circuit has never addressed the question.some courts have taken alvira sanchez reading.see united states rivera concepcion,ccc,wl,at but see id.at stating amount of monetary assessment for q violation as.others,however,have at least implicitly understood a q violation to constitute a class d felony for sentencing purposes.see hough united states,cv fdw,wl,at three years supervised release for q violation.the statute imprecise language and the fact that other courts have fallen prey to the same error,if error indeed there was here,demonstrate that any misconstruction on the part of the district court was not obviously erroneous.united states richard,cir declining to resolve a question of statutory interpretation on plain error review because the law in this circuit was not obvious when the district court imposed its sentence.
c.the government factual proffer 
alvira sanchez argues that it was plain error for the district court to accept his guilty plea despite the fact that the government proffered no facts showing that he possessed a firearm outside his residence.see q b prohibition on possessing a firearm in a school zone does not apply on private property not part of school grounds.however,the question relevant to the sufficiency of the evidence in a plea proffer is not whether a jury would,or even would be likely,to convict it is whether there is enough evidence so that the plea has a rational basis in facts.united states gandia maysonet,cir.many crimes are proved by reasonably probative circumstantial evidence,and a rational jury could conclude due to the nature of the seized gun and evidence of alvira sanchez involvement in the drug trade that he did not keep his gun dutifully at home.other juries appear to have inferred q violations based on guns found at private residences.see,united states nieves castaño,cir.
even if the district court did commit error by accepting the government proffer,the error was not obvious.a proffer establishes a sufficient factual basis for a guilty plea if it touches all the elements of the crime.see united states piper,cir the district court need not gratuitously explore points removed from the elements of the offense.alvira sanchez points to no circuit precedent establishing whether possession outside the home is an element of a q offense,or whether possession inside the home is an affirmative defense.if the latter,then the government had no obligation to proffer evidence to rebut an anticipated defense.and even if the former,the law is sufficiently unsettled that any error in accepting the government proffer was not obvious.richard,at no obvious error when law in circuit unsettled.
if a defendant is sentenced to a prison term based on a sentencing range that the sentencing commission later lowers,a district court may reduce the defendant sentence if such a reduction is consistent with the commission policy statements.c.amendment,effective november,reduced by two levels the offense levels associated with certain drug quantities.the parties agree that amendment reduced alvira sanchez base offense level on his drug counts counts from to.this amendment reduces alvira sanchez recommended sentencing range for grouped counts from months to months.in light of the sentencing commission policy statement authorizing a court to consider reducing a defendant sentence if amendment reduces the guideline range
