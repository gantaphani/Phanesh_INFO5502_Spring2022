in,in the course of a burglary,fernando belmontes bludgeoned steacy mcconnell to death,striking her in the head to times with a steel dumbbell bar.see people belmontes,cal.after the murder,belmontes and his accomplices stole mcconnell stereo,sold it for,and used the money to buy beer and drugs for the night,at,at.
belmontes was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in state court.unsuccessful on direct appeal and state collateral review,belmontes sought federal habeas relief,which the district court denied.the court of appeals reversed,finding instructional error,but we overturned that decision.ayers belmontes,see also brown belmontes.on remand,the court of appeals again ruled for belmontes,this time finding that belmontes suffered ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial.the district court had previously denied relief on that ground,finding that counsel for belmontes had performed deficiently under ninth circuit precedent,but that belmontes could not establish prejudice under strickland washington.belmontes calderon,civ.dfl jfm ed,app.to pet.for cert.the court of appeals agreed that counsel performance was deficient,but disagreed with the district court with respect to prejudice,determining that counsel errors undermined confidence in the penalty phase verdict.belmontes ayers.we disagree with the court of appeals as to prejudice,grant the state petition for certiorari,and reverse.
belmontes argues that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to investigate and present sufficient mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial.to prevail on this claim,belmontes must meet both the deficient performance and prejudice prongs of strickland,at.to show deficient performance,belmontes must establish that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.at.in light of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel and the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant,the performance inquiry necessarily turns on whether counsel assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.at.at all points,j udicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.at.
the challenge confronting belmontes lawyer,john schick,was very specific.substantial evidence indicated that belmontes had committed a prior murder,and the prosecution was eager to introduce that evidence during the penalty phase of the mcconnell trial.the evidence of the prior murder was extensive,including eyewitness testimony,belmontes own admissions,and belmontes possession of the murder weapon and the same type of ammunition used to kill the victim.record,deposition of john schick,exhs.
the evidence,furthermore,was potentially devastating.it would have shown that two years before steacy mcconnell death,police found jerry howard body in a secluded area.howard had been killed execution style,with a bullet to the back of the head.the authorities suspected belmontes,but on the eve of trial the state witnesses refused to cooperate belmontes mother had begged one not to testify.the prosecution therefore believed it could not prove belmontes guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt.what the prosecution could prove,even without the recalcitrant witnesses,was that belmontes possessed the gun used to murder howard.so the state offered,and belmontes accepted,a plea to accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter.record deposition of john schick,exhs.
but belmontes had not been shy about discussing the murder,boasting to several people that he had killed howard.steven cartwright informed the district attorney that belmontes had confessed to the murder.a police informant told detectives that belmontes bragged about the murder,stating that he was mad at howard because the night before,he had quite a lot of dope and would share it with him.after double jeopardy protection set in and he had been released on parole,belmontes admitted his responsibility for the murder to his counselor at the california youth authority,charles sapien.during his time in confinement,belmontes had always denied that he was the one who shot jerry howard.but because sapien had been square with belmontes,belmontes decided to level with sapien upon his release,telling sapien that he had wasted that guy.record deposition of john schick,exhs.
schick understood the gravity of this aggravating evidence,and he built his mitigation strategy around the overriding need to exclude it.california evidentiary rules,schick knew,offered him an argument to exclude the evidence,but those same rules made clear that the evidence would come in for rebuttal if schick opened the door.record see also people rodriguez,cal,people harris,cal.schick thus had grave concerns that,even if he succeeded initially in excluding the prior murder evidence,it would still be admitted if his mitigation case swept too broadly.accordingly,schick decided to proceed cautiously,structuring his mitigation arguments and witnesses to limit that possibility.deposition of john schick,see strickland,supra,at restricting testimony on respondent character to what had come in at the plea colloquy ensured that contrary character and psychological evidence and respondent criminal history,which counsel had successfully moved to exclude,would not come in 
as schick expected,the prosecution was ready to admit this evidence during the sentencing phase.schick moved to exclude the evidence,arguing that the state should be allowed to tell the jury only that belmontes had been convicted of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter nothing more.record.schick succeeded in keeping the prosecution from presenting the damaging evidence in its sentencing case in chief,but his client remained at risk the trial court indicated the evidence would come in for rebuttal or impeachment if schick opened the door,at.
this was not an empty threat.in one instance,schick elicited testimony that belmontes was not a violent person.the state objected and,out of earshot of the jury,argued that it should be able to rebut the testimony with the howard murder evidence,at.the court warned schick that it was going to have to allow the prosecution to go into the whole background if schick continued his line of questioning,at.schick acquiesced,and the court struck the testimony.ibid.
the court warning reinforced schick understanding that he would have to tailor his mitigation case carefully to preserve his success in excluding the howard murder evidence.with that cautionary note in mind,schick put on nine witnesses he thought could advance a case for mitigation,without opening the door to the prior murder evidence.see,at.
the court of appeals determined that in spite of these efforts,schick performance was constitutionally deficient under circuit precedent.belmontes,at.the state challenges that conclusion,but we need not resolve the point,because we agree with the district court that belmontes can not establish prejudice.
to establish prejudice,belmontes must show a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.that showing requires belmontes to establish a reasonable probability that a competent attorney,aware of the available mitigating evidence,would have introduced it at sentencing,and that had the jury been confronted with this mitigating evidence,there is a reasonable probability that it would have returned with a different sentence.wiggins smith.
the ninth circuit determined that a reasonably competent lawyer would have introduced more mitigation evidence,on top of what schick had already presented.for purposes of our prejudice analysis,we accept that conclusion and proceed to consider whether there is a reasonable probability that a jury presented with this additional mitigation evidence would have returned a different verdict.
in evaluating that question,it is necessary to consider all the relevant evidence that the jury would have had before it if schick had pursued the different path not just the mitigation evidence schick could have presented,but also the howard murder evidence that almost certainly would have come in with it.see strickland,supra,at.thus,to establish prejudice,belmontes must show a reasonable probability that the jury would have rejected a capital sentence after it weighed the entire body of mitigating evidence including the additional testimony schick could have presented against the entire body of aggravating evidence including the howard murder evidence.belmontes can not meet this burden.
we begin with the mitigating evidence schick did present during the sentencing phase.that evidence was substantial.the same ninth circuit panel addressing the same record in belmontes first habeas appeal agreed,recognizing the substantial nature of the mitigating evidence schick presented.belmontes woodford.it reiterated the point several times.see,at.
all told,schick put nine witnesses on the stand over a span of two days,and elicited a range of testimony on belmontes behalf.a number of those witnesses highlighted belmontes terrible childhood.they testified that his father was an alcoholic and extremely abusive.belmontes grandfather described the house where belmontes spent much of his childhood as a chicken coop.belmontes did not do well in school he dropped out in the ninth grade.his younger sister died when she was only months old.and his grandmother died tragically when she drowned in her swimming pool.see record.
family members also testified that,despite these difficulties,belmontes maintained strong relationships with his grandfather,grandmother,mother,and sister,at.and belmontes best friend offered the insights of a close friend and confidant,at.
schick also called witnesses who detailed belmontes religious conversion while in state custody on the accessory charge.these witnesses told stories about belmontes efforts advising other inmates in his detention center religious program,to illustrate that he could live a productive and meaningful life in prison.they described his success working as part of a firefighting crew,detailing his rise from lowest man on the team to second in command.belmontes assistant chaplain even said that he would use belmontes as a regular part of his prison counseling program if the jury handed down a life sentence,at.
belmontes himself bolstered these accounts by testifying about his childhood and religious conversion,both at sentencing and during allocution.belmontes described his childhood as pretty hard,but took responsibility for his actions,telling the jury that he did not want to use his background as a crutch,to say i am in a situation now because of that.at.
on remand from this court,the court of appeals addressing belmontes ineffective assistance claim for the first time changed its view of this evidence.instead of finding schick mitigation case substantial,as it previously had,belmontes,at,the ninth circuit this time around labeled it cursory,belmontes,at.compare also belmontes,at,labeling the mitigation evidence schick presented substantial with belmontes,at,labeling the same evidence insubstantial more evidence,the court of appeals now concluded,would have made a difference in particular,more evidence to humanize belmontes,as that court put it no fewer than times in its opinion.belmontes,at,and.the court determined that the failure to put on this evidence prejudiced belmontes.
there are two problems with this conclusion some of the evidence was merely cumulative of the humanizing evidence schick actually presented adding it to what was already there would have made little difference.other evidence proposed by the ninth circuit would have put into play aspects of belmontes character that would have triggered admission of the powerful howard evidence in rebuttal.this evidence would have made a difference,but in the wrong direction for belmontes.in either event,belmontes can not establish strickland prejudice.
first,the cumulative evidence.in the court of appeals view,belmontes should have presented more humanizing evidence about belmontes difficult childhood and highlighted his positive attributes.at.as for his difficult childhood,schick should have called witnesses to testify that when belmontes was five years old,his sister died of a brain tumor,that he exhibited symptoms of depression after her death,that his grandmother suffered from alcoholism and prescription drug addiction,and that both his immediate and extended family lived in a state of constant strife.ibid.as for his positive attributes,schick should have produced testimony about belmontes strong character as a child in the face of adversity.ibid.schick should have illustrated that belmontes was kind,responsible,and likeable that he got along well with his siblings and was respectful towards his grandparents despite their disapproval of his mixed racial background and that he participated in community activities,kept up in school and got along with his teachers before an illness,and made friends easily.ibid.
but as recounted above and recognized by the state courts and,originally,this very panel,schick did put on substantial mitigation evidence,much of it targeting the same humanizing theme the ninth circuit highlighted.compare,with record death of sister,at,difficult childhood,at family member addictions,at,family strife and abuse,at,strong character as a child,at close relationship with siblings,at close relationship with grandparents,at participation in community religious events see also,belmontes traverse to respondent return to pet.for writ of habeas corpus in ed cal,c ounsel presentation was arguably adequate only with respect to evidence of humanizing petitioner the sentencing jury was thus well acquainted with belmontes background and potential humanizing features.schriro landrigan.additional evidence on these points would have offered an insignificant benefit,if any at all.
the ninth circuit also determined that both the evidence schick presented and the additional evidence it proposed would have carried greater weight if schick had submitted expert testimony.such testimony could make connections between the various themes in the mitigation case and explain to the jury how they could have contributed to belmontes involvement in criminal activity.belmontes,at.see also ibid.discussing expert federal habeas testimony on importance of expert testimony.but the body of mitigating evidence the ninth circuit would have required schick to present was neither complex nor technical.it required only that the jury make logical connections of the kind a layperson is well equipped to make.the jury simply did not need expert testimony to understand the humanizing evidence it could use its common sense or own sense of mercy.
what is more,expert testimony discussing belmontes mental state,seeking to explain his behavior,or putting it in some favorable context would have exposed belmontes to the howard evidence.see darden wainwright,any attempt to portray petitioner as a nonviolent man would have opened the door for the state to rebut with evidence of petitioner prior convictions.similarly,if defense counsel had attempted to put on evidence that petitioner was a family man,they would have been faced with his admission at trial that,although still married,he was spending the weekend furlough with a girlfriend 
if,for example,an expert had testified that belmontes had a high likelihood of a nonviolent adjustment to a prison setting,as belmontes suggested an expert might,see brief for appellant in,the question would have immediately arisen what was his propensity toward violence to begin with does evidence of another murder alter your view expert testimony explaining why the jury should feel sympathy,as opposed simply to facts that might elicit that response,would have led to a similar rejoinder is such sympathy equally appropriate for someone who committed a second murder any of this testimony from an expert perspective would have made the howard evidence fair game.
many of belmontes other arguments fail for the same reason.he argues that the jury should have been told that he suffered an extended bout with rheumatic fever,which led to emotional instability,impulsi
