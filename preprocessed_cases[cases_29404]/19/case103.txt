held the judgment is affirmed.
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court with respect to parts i,and iv,concluding that in investigations,the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant.
a the principle that a warrantless search of the person is reasonable only if it falls within a recognized exception,see,united states robinson,applies here,where the search involved a compelled physical intrusion beneath mcneely skin and into his veins to obtain a blood sample to use as evidence in a criminal investigation.one recognized exception applies when the exigencies of the situation make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that a warrantless search is objectively reasonable.kentucky king.this court looks to the totality of circumstances in determining whether an exigency exits.see brigham city stuart.applying this approach in schmerber,the court found a warrantless blood test reasonable after considering all of the facts and circumstances of that case and carefully basing its holding on those specific facts,including that alcohol levels decline after drinking stops and that testing was delayed while officers transported the injured suspect to the hospital and investigated the accident scene.
b the state nonetheless seeks a per se rule,contending that exigent circumstances necessarily exist when an officer has probable cause to believe a person has been driving under the influence of alcohol because bac evidence is inherently evanescent.though a person blood alcohol level declines until the alcohol is eliminated,it does not follow that the court should depart from careful assessment of exigency.when officers in investigations can reasonably obtain a warrant before having a blood sample drawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of the search,the fourth amendment mandates that they do so.see mcdonald united states.circumstances may make obtaining a warrant impractical such that the alcohol dissipation will support an exigency,but that is a reason to decide each case on its facts,as in schmerber,not to accept the considerable overgeneralization that a per se rule would reflect,richards wisconsin.blood testing is different in critical respects from other cases.unlike a situation where,a suspect has control over easily disposable evidence,see cupp murphy,bac evidence naturally dissipates in a gradual and relatively predictable manner.moreover,because an officer must typically take a dwi suspect to a medical facility and obtain a trained medical professional assistance before having a blood test conducted,some delay between the time of the arrest or accident and time of the test is inevitable regardless of whether a warrant is obtained.the state rule also fails to account for advances in the years since schmerber was decided that allow for the more expeditious processing of warrant applications,particularly in contexts like investigations where the evidence supporting probable cause is simple.the natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood may support an exigency finding in a specific case,as it did in schmerber,but it does not do so categorically.
c because the state sought a per se rule here,it did not argue that there were exigent circumstances in this particular case.the arguments and the record thus do not provide the court with an adequate framework for a detailed discussion of all the relevant factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of acting without a warrant.it suffices to say that the metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream and the ensuing loss of evidence are among the factors that must be considered in deciding whether a warrant is required.
justice sotomayor,joined by justice scalia,justice ginsburg,and justice kagan,concluded in part iii that other arguments advanced by the state and amici in support of a per se rule are unpersuasive.their concern that a approach to exigency will not provide adequate guidance to law enforcement officers may make the desire for a rule understandable,but the fourth amendment will not tolerate adoption of an overly broad categorical approach in this context.a,totality of the circumstances,approach is hardly unique within this court fourth amendment jurisprudence.see,illinois wardlow.they also contend that the privacy interest implicated here is minimal.but motorists diminished expectation of privacy does not diminish their privacy interest in preventing a government agent from piercing their skin.and though a blood test conducted in a medical setting by trained personnel is less intrusive than other bodily invasions,this court has never retreated from its recognition that any compelled intrusion into the human body implicates significant,constitutionally protected privacy interests.finally,the government general interest in combating drunk driving does not justify departing from the warrant requirement without showing exigent circumstances that make securing a warrant impractical in a particular case.

on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of missouri 
justice sotomayor announced the judgment of the court and delivered the opinion of the court with respect to parts i,and iv,and an opinion with respect to parts and iii,in which justice scalia,justice ginsburg,and justice kagan join.
in schmerber california,this court upheld a warrantless blood test of an individual arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol because the officer might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency,in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant,under the circumstances,threatened the destruction of evidence.at internal quotation marks omitted.the question presented here is whether the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream presents a per se exigency that justifies an exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in all cases.we conclude that it does not,and we hold,consistent with general fourth amendment principles,that exigency in this context must be determined case by case based on the totality of the circumstances.
while on highway patrol at approximately,a missouri police officer stopped tyler mcneely truck after observing it exceed the posted speed limit and repeatedly cross the centerline.the officer noticed several signs that mcneely was intoxicated,including mcneely bloodshot eyes,his slurred speech,and the smell of alcohol on his breath.mcneely acknowledged to the officer that he had consumed a couple of beers at a bar,app,and he appeared unsteady on his feet when he exited the truck.after mcneely performed poorly on a battery of tests and declined to use a portable device to measure his blood alcohol concentration bac,the officer placed him under arrest.
the officer began to transport mcneely to the station house.but when mcneely indicated that he would again refuse to provide a breath sample,the officer changed course and took mcneely to a nearby hospital for blood testing.the officer did not attempt to secure a warrant.upon arrival at the hospital,the officer asked mcneely whether he would consent to a blood test.reading from a standard implied consent form,the officer explained to mcneely that under state law refusal to submit voluntarily to the test would lead to the immediate revocation of his driver license for one year and could be used against him in a future prosecution.see.ann.stat,west.mcneely nonetheless refused.the officer then directed a hospital lab technician to take a blood sample,and the sample was secured at approximately subsequent laboratory testing measured mcneely bac at percent,which was well above the legal limit of percent.see.
mcneely was charged with driving while intoxicated dwi,in violation of he moved to suppress the results of the blood test,arguing in relevant part that,under the circumstances,taking his blood for chemical testing without first obtaining a search warrant violated his rights under the fourth amendment.the trial court agreed.it concluded that the exigency exception to the warrant requirement did not apply because,apart from the fact that a s in all cases involving intoxication,mcneely blood alcohol was being metabolized by his liver,there were no circumstances suggesting the officer faced an emergency in which he could not practicably obtain a warrant.cir.cape giradeau,div.ii,app.to pet.for cert.on appeal,the missouri court of appeals stated an intention to reverse but transferred the case directly to the missouri supreme court.no.ed june,at.
the missouri supreme court affirmed.per curiam.recognizing that this court decision in schmerber california,provide d the backdrop to its analysis,the missouri supreme court held that schmerber directs lower courts to engage in a totality of the circumstances analysis when determining whether exigency permits a nonconsensual,warrantless blood draw.at.the court further concluded that schmerber requires more than the mere dissipation of evidence to support a warrantless blood draw in an case.at.according to the court,exigency depends heavily on the existence of additional special facts,such as whether an officer was delayed by the need to investigate an accident and transport an injured suspect to the hospital,as had been the case in schmerber,at.finding that this was unquestionably a routine dwi case in which no factors other than the natural dissipation of suggested that there was an emergency,the court held that the nonconsensual warrantless blood draw violated mcneely fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches of his person,at.
we granted certiorari to resolve a split of authority on the question whether the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream establishes a per se exigency that suffices on its own to justify an exception to the warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in investigations see.we now affirm.
the fourth amendment provides in relevant part that t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause.our cases have held that a warrantless search of the person is reasonable only if it falls within a recognized exception.see,united states robinson.that principle applies to the type of search at issue in this case,which involved a compelled physical intrusion beneath mcneely skin and into his veins to obtain a sample of his blood for use as evidence in a criminal investigation.such an invasion of bodily integrity implicates an individual most personal and expectations of privacy.winston lee,see also skinner railway labor executives.
we first considered the fourth amendment restrictions on such searches in schmerber,where,as in this case,a blood sample was drawn from a defendant suspected of driving while under the influence of alcohol,at.noting that s earch warrants are ordinarily required for searches of dwellings,we reasoned that absent an emergency,no less could be required where intrusions into the human body are concerned,even when the search was conducted following a lawful arrest,at.we explained that the importance of requiring authorization by a neutral and detached magistrate before allowing a law enforcement officer to invade another body in search of evidence of guilt is indisputable and great.ibid.quoting johnson united states.
as noted,the warrant requirement is subject to exceptions.one exception,and the one at issue in this case,applies when the exigencies of the situation make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that a warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the fourth amendment.kentucky king,slip,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.a variety of circumstances may give rise to an exigency sufficient to justify a warrantless search,including law enforcement need to provide emergency assistance to an occupant of a home,michigan fisher,per curiam,engage in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect,united states santana,or enter a burning building to put out a fire and investigate its cause,michigan tyler.as is relevant here,we have also recognized that in some circumstances law enforcement officers may conduct a search without a warrant to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.see cupp murphy,ker california,plurality opinion.while these contexts do not necessarily involve equivalent dangers,in each a warrantless search is potentially reasonable because there is compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.tyler,at.
to determine whether a law enforcement officer faced an emergency that justified acting without a warrant,this court looks to the totality of circumstances.see brigham city stuart,finding officers entry into a home to provide emergency assistance plainly reasonable under the circumstances illinois mcarthur,concluding that a warrantless seizure of a person to prevent him from returning to his trailer to destroy hidden contraband was reasonable i n the circumstances of the case before us due to exigency cupp,at holding that a limited warrantless search of a suspect fingernails to preserve evidence that the suspect was trying to rub off was justified o n the facts of this case see also richards wisconsin,rejecting a per se exception to the requirement for felony drug investigations based on presumed exigency,and requiring instead evaluation of police conduct in a particular case we apply this finely tuned approach to fourth amendment reasonableness in this context because the police action at issue lacks the traditional justification that a warrant provides.atwater lago vista.absent that established justification,the nature of the reasonableness inquiry,ohio robinette,demands that we evaluate each case of alleged exigency based on its own facts and circumstances.importing united states,
our decision in schmerber applied this totality of the circumstances approach.in that case,the petitioner had suffered injuries in an automobile accident and was taken to the hospital,at.while he was there receiving treatment,a police officer arrested the petitioner for driving while under the influence of alcohol and ordered a blood test over his objection,at.after explaining that the warrant requirement applied generally to searches that intrude into the human body,we concluded that the warrantless blood test in the present case was nonetheless permissible because the officer might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency,in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant,under the circumstances,threatened the destruction of evidence.at quoting preston united states.
in support of that conclusion,we observed that evidence could have been lost because the percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops,as the body functions to eliminate it from the system.at.we added that p articularly in a case such as this,where time had to be taken to bring the accused to a hospital and to investigate the scene of the accident,there was no time to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant.at.given these special facts,we found that it was appropriate for the police to act without a warrant,at.we further held that the blood test at issue was a reasonable way to recover the evidence because it was highly effective,involve d virtually no risk,trauma,or pain,and was conducted in a reasonable fashion by a physician in a hospital environment according to accepted medical practices.ibid.and in conclusion,we noted that our judgment that there had been no fourth amendment violation was strictly based on the facts of the present record.at.
thus,our analysis in schmerber fits comfortably within our case law applying the exigent circumstances exception.in finding the warrantless blood test reasonable in schmerber,we considered all of the facts and circumstances of the particular case and carefully based our holding on those specific facts.
the state properly recognizes that the reasonableness of a warrantless search under the exigency exception to the warrant requirement must be evaluated based on the totality of the circumstances.brief for petitioner.but the state nevertheless seeks a per se rule for blood testing in cases.the state contends that whenever an officer has probable cause to believe an individual has been driving under the influence of alcohol,exigent circumstances will necessarily exist because bac evidence is inherently evanescent.as a result,the state claims that so long as the officer has probable cause and the blood test is conducted in a reasonable manner,it is categorically reasonable for law enforcement to obtain the blood sample without a warrant.
it is true that as a result of the human body natural metabolic processes,the alcohol level in a person blood begins to dissipate once the alcohol is fully absorbed and continues to decline until the alcohol is eliminated.see skinner,at schmerber,at.testimony before the trial court in this case indicated that the percentage of alcohol in an individual blood typically decreases by approximately percent to percent per hour once the alcohol has been fully absorbed.app.more precise calculations of the rate at which alcohol dissipates depend on various individual characteristics such as weight,gender,and alcohol tolerance and the circumstances in which the alcohol was consumed.see stripp,forensic and clinical issues in alcohol analysis,in forensic chemistry handbook kobilinsky ed.regardless of the exact elimination rate,it is sufficient for our purposes to note that because an individual alcohol level gradually declines soon after he stops drinking,a significant delay in testing will negatively affect the probative value of the results.this fact was essential to our holding in schmerber,as we recognized that,under the circumstances,further delay in order to secure a warrant after the time spent investigating the scene of the accident and transporting the injured suspect to the hospital to receive treatment would have threatened the destruction of evidence,at.
but it does not follow that we should depart from careful assessment of exigency and adopt the categorical rule proposed by the state and its amici.in those investigations where police officers can reasonably obtain a warrant before a blood sample can be drawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of the search,the fourth amendment mandates that they do so.see mcdonald united states,we can not excuse the absence of a search warrant without a showing by those who seek exemption from the constitutional mandate that the exigencies of the situation made the search imperative we do not doubt that some circumstances will make obtaining a warrant impractical such that the dissipation of alcohol from the bloodstream will support an exigency justifying a properly conducted warrantless blood test.that,however,is a reason to decide each case on its facts,as we did in schmerber,not to accept the considerable overgeneralization that a per se rule would reflect.richards,at.
the context of blood testing is different in critical respects from other cases in which the police are truly confronted with a now or never situation.roaden kentucky.in contrast to,for example,circumstances in which the suspect has control over easily disposable evidence,see georgia randolph,cupp,at,bac evidence from a suspect naturally dissipates over time in a gradual and relatively predictable manner.moreover,because a police officer must typically transport a suspect to a medical facility and obtain the assistance of someone with appropriate medical training before conducting a blood test,some delay between the time of the arrest or accident and the time of the test is inevitable regardless of whether police officers are required to obtain a warrant.see state shriner,meyer,dissenting.this reality undermines the force of the state contention,endorsed by the dissent,see post,at opinion of thomas,that we should recognize a categorical exception to the warrant requirement because bac evidence is actively being destroyed with every minute that passes.brief for petitioner.consider,for example,a situation in which the warrant process will not significantly increase the delay before the blood test is conducted because an officer can take steps to secure a warrant while the suspect is being transported to a medical facility by another officer.in such a circumstance,there would be no plausible justification for an exception to the warrant requirement.
the state proposed per se rule also fails to account for advances in the years since schmerber was decided that allow for the more expeditious processing of warrant applications,particularly in contexts like investigations where the evidence offered to establish probable cause is simple.the federal rules of criminal procedure were amended in to permit federal magistrate judges to issue a warrant based on sworn testimony communicated by telephone.see stat.as amended,the law now allows a federal magistrate judge to consider information communicated by telephone or other reliable electronic means.fed.rule crim.proc.states have also innovated.well over a majority of states allow police officers or prosecutors to apply for search warrants remotely through various means,including telephonic or radio communication,electronic communication such as,and video conferencing and in addition to developments,jurisdictions have found other ways to streamline the warrant process,such as by using warrant applications for investigations 
we by no means claim that telecommunications innovations have,will,or should eliminate all delay from the process.warrants inevitably take some time for police officers or prosecutors to complete and for magistrate judges to review.telephonic and electronic warrants may still require officers to follow formalities designed to create an adequate record,such as preparing a duplicate warrant before calling the magistrate judge.see fed.rule crim.proc.b.and improvements in communications technology do not guarantee that a magistrate judge will be available when an officer needs a warrant after making a arrest.but technological developments that enable police officers to secure warrants more quickly,and do so without undermining the neutral magistrate judge essential role as a check on police discretion,are relevant to an assessment of exigency.that is particularly so in this context,where bac evidence is lost gradually and relatively predictably 
of course,there are important countervailing concerns.while experts can work backwards from the bac at the time the sample was taken to determine the bac at the time of the alleged offense,longer intervals may raise questions about the accuracy of the calculation.for that reason,exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless blood sample may arise in the regular course of law enforcement due to delays from the warrant application process.but adopting the state per se approach would improperly ignore the current and future technological developments in warrant procedures,and might well diminish the incentive for jurisdictions to pursue progressive approaches to warrant acquisition that preserve the protections afforded by the warrant while meeting the legitimate interests of law enforcement.state rodriguez,ut.
in short,while the natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood may support a finding of exigency in a specific case,as it did in schmerber,it does not do so categorically.whether a warrantless blood test of a suspect is reasonable must be determined case by case based on the totality of the circumstances.
in an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part,the chief justice agrees that the state proposed per se rule is overbroad because f or exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless search there must be no time to secure a warrant.post,at quoting tyler,at.but the chief justice then goes on to suggest his own categorical rule under which a warrantless blood draw is permissible if the officer could not secure a warrant or reasonably believed he could not secure a warrant in the time it takes to transport the suspect to a hospital or similar facility and obtain medical assistance.post,at.although we agree that delay inherent to the process is relevant to evaluating exigency,see supra,at,we decline to substitute the chief justice modified per se rule for our traditional totality of the circumstances analysis.
for one thing,making exigency completely dependent on the window of time between an arrest and a blood test produces odd consequences.under the chief justice rule,if a police officer serendipitously stops a suspect near an emergency room,the officer may conduct a nonconsensual warrantless blood draw even if all agree that a warrant could be obtained with very little delay under the circumstances perhaps with far less delay than an average ride to the hospital in the jurisdiction.the rule would also distort law enforcement incentives.as with the state per se rule,the chief justice rule might discourage efforts to expedite the warrant process because it categorically authorizes warrantless blood draws so long as it takes more time to secure a warrant than to obtain medical assistance.on the flip side,making the requirement of independent judicial oversight turn exclusively on the amount of time that elapses between an arrest and bac testing could induce police departments and individual officers to minimize testing delay to the detriment of other values.the chief justice correctly observes that t his case involves medical personnel drawing blood at a medical facility,not police officers doing so by the side of the road.post,at.but the chief justice does not say that roadside blood draws are necessarily unreasonable,and if we accepted the chief justice approach,they would become a more attractive option for the police.
the remaining arguments advanced in support of a per se exigency rule are unpersuasive.
the state and several of its amici,including the united states,express concern that a approach to exigency will not provide adequate guidance to law enforcement officers deciding whether to conduct a blood test of a suspect without a warrant.the chief justice and the dissent also raise this concern.see post,at,opinion of roberts,post,at opinion of thomas.while the desire for a rule is understandable,the fourth amendment will not tolerate adoption of an overly broad categorical approach that would dilute the warrant requirement in a context where significant privacy interests are at stake.moreover,a approach is hardly unique within our fourth amendment jurisprudence.numerous police actions are judged based on,totality of the circumstances analyses rather than according to categorical rules,including in situations that are more likely to require police officers to make difficult judgments.see,illinois wardlow,whether an officer has reasonable suspicion to make an investigative stop and to pat down a suspect for weapons under terry ohio,robinette,at whether valid consent has been given to search tennessee garner,whether force used to effectuate a seizure,including deadly force,is reasonable.as in those contexts,we see no valid substitute for careful evaluation of reasonableness here 
next,the state and the united states contend that the privacy interest implicated by blood draws of suspects is relatively minimal.that is so,they claim,both because motorists have a diminished expectation of privacy and because our cases have repeatedly indicated that blood testing is commonplace in society and typically involves virtually no risk,trauma,or pain.schmerber,at.see also post,at,and opinion of thomas.
but the fact that people are accorded less privacy in automobiles because of th e compelling governmental need for regulation,california carney,does not diminish a motorist privacy interest in preventing an agent of the government from piercing his skin.as to the nature of a blood test conducted in a medical setting by trained personnel,it is concededly less intrusive than other bodily invasions we have found unreasonable.see winston,at surgery to remove a bullet rochin california,induced vomiting to extract narcotics capsules ingested by a suspect violated the due process clause.for that reason,we have held that medically drawn blood tests are reasonable in appropriate circumstances.see skinner,at upholding warrantless blood testing of railroad employees involved in certain train accidents under the special needs doctrine schmerber,at.we have never retreated,however,from our recognition that any compelled intrusion into the human body implicates significant,constitutionally protected privacy interests.
finally,the state and its amici point to the compelling governmental interest in combating drunk driving and contend that prompt bac testing,including through blood testing,is vital to pursuit of that interest.they argue that is particularly so because,in addition to laws that make it illegal to operate a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol,all states and the district of columbia have enacted laws that make it per se unlawful to operate a motor vehicle with a bac of over percent.see national highway traffic safety admin.nhtsa,alcohol and highway safety a review of the state of knowledge,nhtsa review to enforce these provisions,they reasonably assert,accurate bac evidence is critical.see also post,at opinion of roberts,post,at opinion of thomas.
no one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving problem or the states interest in eradicating it.michigan of state police sitz.certainly we do not.while some progress has been made,drunk driving continues to exact a terrible toll on our society.see nhtsa,traffic safety facts,data,reporting that people were killed in driving crashes in,an average of one fatality every minutes.
but the general importance of the government interest in this area does not justify departing from the warrant requirement without showing exigent circumstances that make securing a warrant impractical in a particular case.to the extent that the state and its amici contend that applying the traditional fourth amendment analysis to determine whether an exigency justified a warrantless search will undermine the governmental interest in preventing and prosecuting offenses,we are not convinced.
as an initial matter,states have a broad range of legal tools to enforce their laws and to secure bac evidence without undertaking warrantless nonconsensual blood draws.for example,all states have adopted implied consent laws that require motorists,as a condition of operating a motor vehicle within the state,to consent to bac testing if they are arrested or otherwise detained on suspicion of a offense.see nhtsa review supra,at describing missouri implied consent law.such laws impose significant consequences when a motorist withdraws consent typically the motorist driver license is immediately suspended or revoked,and most states allow the motorist refusal to take a bac test to be used as evidence against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.see nhtsa review see also south dakota neville,holding that the use of such an adverse inference does not violate the fifth amendment right against.
it is also notable that a majority of states either place significant restrictions on when police officers may obtain a blood sample despite a suspect refusal often limiting testing to cases involving an accident resulting in death or serious bodily injury or prohibit nonconsensual blood tests altogether among these states,several lift restrictions on nonconsensual blood testing if law enforcement officers first obtain a search warrant or similar court order bullcoming new mexico,slip,at noting that the blood test was obtained pursuant to a warrant after the petitioner refused a breath test.we are aware of no evidence indicating that restrictions on nonconsensual blood testing have compromised enforcement efforts in the states that have them.and in fact,field studies in states that permit nonconsensual blood testing pursuant to a warrant have suggested that,although warrants do impose administrative burdens,their use can reduce rates and improve law enforcement ability to recover bac evidence.see nhtsa,use of warrants for breath test refusal case studies.
to be sure,states may choos e to protect privacy beyond the level that the fourth amendment requires.virginia moore.but state restrictions on nonconsensual blood testing provide further support for our recognition that compelled blood draws implicate a significant privacy interest.they also strongly suggest that our ruling today will not severely hamper effective law enforcement.garner,at.
the state argued before this court that the fact that alcohol is naturally metabolized by the human body creates an exigent circumstance in every case.the state did not argue that there were exigent circumstances in this particular case because a warrant could not have been obtained within a reasonable amount of time.in his testimony before the trial court,the arresting officer did not identify any other factors that would suggest he faced an emergency or unusual delay in securing a warrant.app.he testified that he made no effort to obtain a search warrant before conducting the blood draw even though he was sure a prosecuting attorney was on call and even though he had no reason to believe that a magistrate judge would have been unavailable,at.the officer also acknowledged that he had obtained search warrants before taking blood samples in the past without difficulty,at.he explained that he elected to forgo a warrant application in this case only because he believed it was not legally necessary to obtain a warrant,at.based on this testimony,the trial court concluded that there was no exigency and specifically found that,although the arrest took place in the middle of the night,a prosecutor was readily available to apply for a search warrant and a judge was readily available to issue a warrant.app.to pet.for cert.
the missouri supreme court in turn affirmed that judgment,holding first that the dissipation of alcohol did not establish a per se exigency,and second that the state could not otherwise satisfy its burden of establishing exigent circumstances,at.in petitioning for certiorari to this court,the state challenged only the first holding it did not separately contend that the warrantless blood test was reasonable regardless of whether the natural dissipation of alcohol in a suspect blood categorically justifies dispensing with the warrant requirement.see pet.for cert.
here and in its own courts the state based its case on an insistence that a driver who declines to submit to testing after being arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol is always subject to a nonconsensual blood test without any precondition for a warrant.that is incorrect.
although the missouri supreme court referred to this case as unquestionably a routine dwi case,at,the fact that a particular stop is routine in the sense that it does not involve special facts,such as the need for the police to attend to a car accident,does not mean a warrant is required.other factors present in an ordinary traffic stop,such as the procedures in place for obtaining a warrant or the availability of a magistrate judge,may affect whether the police can obtain a warrant in an expeditious way and therefore may establish an exigency that permits a warrantless search.the relevant factors in determining whether a warrantless search is reasonable,including the practical problems of obtaining a warrant within a timeframe that still preserves the opportunity to obtain reliable evidence,will no doubt vary depending upon the circumstances in the case.
because this case was argued on the broad proposition that cases present a per se exigency,the arguments and the record do not provide the court with an adequate analytic framework for a detailed discussion of all the relevant factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of acting without a warrant.it suffices to say that the metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream and the ensuing loss of evidence are among the factors that must be considered in deciding whether a warrant is required.no doubt,given the large number of arrests for this offense in different jurisdictions nationwide,cases will arise when anticipated delays in obtaining a warrant will justify a blood test without judicial authorization,for in every case the law must be concerned that evidence is being destroyed.but that inquiry ought not to be pursued here where the question is not properly before this court.having rejected the sole argument presented to us challenging the missouri supreme court decision,we affirm its judgment.
we hold that in investigations,the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant.
the judgment of the missouri supreme court is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

i join parts i,and iv of the opinion for the court.
for the reasons stated below this case does not call for the court to consider in detail the issue discussed in part and the separate opinion by the chief justice.
as to part iii,much that is noted with respect to the statistical and survey data will be of relevance when this issue is explored in later cases.the repeated insistence in part iii that every case be determined by its own circumstances is correct,of course,as a general proposition yet it ought not to be interpreted to indicate this question is not susceptible of rules and guidelines that can give important,practical instruction to arresting officers,instruction that in any number of instances would allow a warrantless blood test in order to preserve the critical evidence.
states and other governmental entities which enforce the driving laws can adopt rules,procedures,and protocols that meet the reasonableness requirements of the fourth amendment and give helpful guidance to law enforcement officials.and this court,in due course,may find it appropriate and necessary to consider a case permitting it to provide more guidance than it undertakes to give today.
as the opinion of the court is correct to note,the instant case,by reason of the way in which it was presented and decided in the state courts,does not provide a framework where it is prudent to hold any more than that always dispensing with a warrant for a blood test when a driver is arrested for being under the influence of alcohol is inconsistent with the fourth amendment.
opinion of roberts,
missouri,petitioner tyler mcneely 
on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of missouri 
chief justice roberts,with whom justice breyer and justice alito join,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
a police officer reading this court opinion would have no idea no idea what the fourth amendment requires of him,once he decides to obtain a blood sample from a drunk driving suspect who has refused a breathalyzer test.i have no quarrel with the court totality of the circumstances approach as a general matter that is what our cases require.but the circumstances in drunk driving cases are often typical,and the court should be able to offer guidance on how police should handle cases like the one before us.
in my view,the proper rule is straightforward.our cases establish that there is an exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement.that exception applies when there is a compelling need to prevent the imminent destruction of important evidence,and there is no time to obtain a warrant.the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream constitutes not only the imminent but ongoing destruction of critical evidence.that would qualify as an exigent circumstance,except that there may be time to secure a warrant before blood can be drawn.if there is,an officer must seek a warrant.if an officer could reasonably conclude that there is not,the exigent circumstances exception applies by its terms,and the blood may be drawn without a warrant.
the fourth amendment provides 
the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.
that language does not state that warrants are required prior to searches,but this court has long held that warrants must generally be obtained.see kentucky king,slip,at.we have also held that bodily intrusions like blood draws constitute searches and are subject to the warrant requirement.see schmerber california.
however,the ultimate touchstone of the fourth amendment is reasonableness,brigham city stuart,and thus the warrant requirement is subject to certain reasonable exceptions,king,at slip,at.one of those exceptions is known as the exigent circumstances exception,which applies when the exigencies of the situation make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that a warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the fourth amendment.ibid.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
within the exigent circumstances exception,we have identified several sets of exigent circumstances excusing the need for a warrant.for example,there is an emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement.in brigham city,supra,at,we held that law enforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.there is also a fire exception to the warrant requirement.in michigan tyler,we held that a burning building clearly presents an exigency of sufficient proportions to render a warrantless entry reasonable.and there is a hot exception to the warrant requirement as well.in united states santana,and warden.penitentiary hayden,we recognized the right of police,who had probable cause to believe that an armed robber had entered a house a few minutes before,to make a warrantless entry to arrest the robber and to search for weapons.santana,supra,at.in each of these cases,the requirement that we base our decision on the totality of the circumstances has not prevented us from spelling out a general rule for the police to follow.
the exigency exception most on point here is the one for imminent destruction of evidence.we have affirmed on several occasions that law enforcement officers may make a warrantless entry onto private property to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.brigham city,supra,at citing ker california,plurality opinion see also,king,supra,at slip,at.for example,in ker,the police had reason to believe that the defendant was in possession of marijuana and was expecting police pursuit.we upheld the officers warrantless entry into the defendant home,with the plurality explaining that the drugs could be quickly and easily destroyed or distributed or hidden before a warrant could be obtained at that time of night.at.
as an overarching principle,we have held that if there is a compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant,the warrant requirement may be excused.tyler,supra,at.the question here is whether and how this principle applies in the typical case of a police officer stopping a driver on suspicion of drunk driving.
the reasonable belief that critical evidence is being destroyed gives rise to a compelling need for blood draws in cases like this one.here,in fact,there is not simply a belief that any alcohol in the bloodstream will be destroyed it is a biological certainty.alcohol dissipates from the bloodstream at a rate of percent to percent per hour.stripp,forensic and clinical issues in alcohol analysis,in forensic chemistry handbook kobilinsky ed.evidence is literally disappearing by the minute.that certainty makes this case an even stronger one than usual for application of the exigent circumstances exception.
and that evidence is important.a serious and deadly crime is at issue.according to the department of transportation,in,one person died every minutes due to drinking and driving.national highway traffic safety admin.nhtsa,traffic safety facts,data.no surprise then that drinking and driving is punished severely,including with jail time.see generally of justice,bureau of justice statistics,maruschak,special report,dwi offenders under correctional supervision.mcneely,for instance,faces up to four years in prison.see app.citing.ann.stat,west.
evidence of a driver blood alcohol concentration bac is crucial to obtain convictions for such crimes.all states and the district of columbia have laws providing that it is per se illegal to drive with a bac of percent or higher.most states also have laws establishing additional penalties for drivers who drive with a high bac,often defined as percent or above.nhtsa,digest of impaired driving and selected beverage control laws,pp.vii.bac evidence clearly matters.and when drivers refuse breathalyzers,as mcneely did here,a blood draw becomes necessary to obtain that evidence.
the need to prevent the imminent destruction of bac evidence is no less compelling because the incriminating alcohol dissipates over a limited period of time,rather than all at once.as noted,the concentration of alcohol can make a difference not only between guilt and innocence,but between different crimes and different degrees of punishment.the officer is unlikely to know precisely when the suspect consumed alcohol or how much all he knows is that critical evidence is being steadily lost.fire can spread gradually,but that does not lessen the need and right of the officers to respond immediately.see tyler,supra.
mcneely contends that there is no compelling need for a warrantless blood draw,because if there is some alcohol left in the blood by the time a warrant is obtained,the state can use math and science to work backwards and identify a defendant bac at the time he was driving.see brief for respondent.but that not good enough.we have indicated that exigent circumstances justify warrantless entry when drugs are about to be flushed down the toilet.see,king,at slip,at.we have not said that,because there could well be drug paraphernalia elsewhere in the home,or because a defendant might testify to the amount of drugs involved,the drugs themselves are not crucial and there is no compelling need for warrantless entry.
the same approach should govern here.there is a compelling need to search because alcohol the nearly conclusive evidence of a serious crime is dissipating from the bloodstream.the need is no less compelling because the police might be able to acquire evidence some other way 
for exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless search,however,there must also be no time to secure a warrant.tyler,at see schmerber,at warrantless search legal when there was no time to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant in this respect,obtaining a blood sample from a suspected drunk driver differs from other exigent circumstances cases.
importantly,there is typically delay between the moment a drunk driver is stopped and the time his blood can be drawn.drunk drivers often end up in an emergency room,but they are not usually pulled over in front of one.in most exigent circumstances situations,police are just outside the door to a home.inside,evidence is about to be destroyed,a person is about to be injured,or a fire has broken out.police can enter promptly and must do so to respond effectively to the emergency.but when police pull a person over on suspicion of drinking and driving,they can not test his blood right away there is a obstacle to their search,in the form of a trip to the hospital and perhaps a wait to see a medical.in this case,for example,approximately minutes elapsed between the time the police stopped mcneely and the time his blood was drawn.app.
as noted,the fact that alcohol dissipates gradually from the bloodstream does not diminish the compelling need for a search critical evidence is still disappearing.but the fact that the dissipation persists for some time means that the police although they may not be able to do anything about it right away may still be able to respond to the ongoing destruction of evidence later on.
there might,therefore,be time to obtain a warrant in many cases.as the court explains,police can often request warrants rather quickly these days.at least states provide for electronic warrant applications.see ante,at,and.in many states,a police officer can call a judge,convey the necessary information,and be authorized to affix the judge signature to a warrant.see.rule crim.proc.b alaska stat.idaho code,lexis.rules crim.proc.and supp.code ann.see generally nhtsa,use of warrants for breath test refusal case studies,overview of procedures in arizona,michigan,oregon,and utah.utah has an procedure where a police officer enters information into a system,the system notifies a prosecutor,and upon approval the officer forwards the information to a magistrate,who can electronically a warrant to the officer.utah,cross boundary collaboration.judges have been known to issue warrants in as little as five minutes.bergreen,faster warrant system hailed,salt lake tribune.and in one county in kansas,police officers can warrant requests to judges ipads judges have signed such warrants and them back to officers in less than minutes.benefiel,dui search warrants prosecuting dui refusals,kansas prosecutor,spring.the police are presumably familiar with the mechanics and time involved in the warrant process in their particular jurisdiction.
in a case such as this,applying the exigent circumstances exception to the general warrant requirement of the fourth amendment seems straightforward if there is time to secure a warrant before blood can be drawn,the police must seek one.if an officer could reasonably conclude that there is not sufficient time to seek and receive a warrant,or he applies for one but does not receive a response before blood can be drawn,a warrantless blood draw may ensue.see tyler,supra,at see also illinois rodriguez,in order to satisfy the reasonableness requirement of the fourth amendment,what is generally demanded of the many factual determinations that must regularly be made by police officer s conducting a search or seizure under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement is not that they always be correct,but that they always be reasonable terry ohio,police must,whenever practicable,obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure 
requiring police to apply for a warrant if practicable increases the likelihood that a neutral,detached judicial officer will review the case,helping to ensure that there is probable cause for any search and that any search is reasonable.we have already held that forced blood draws can be constitutional that such searches can be reasonable but that does not change the fact that they are significant bodily intrusions.see schmerber,at upholding a warrantless forced blood draw but noting the importance of informed,detached and deliberate determinations of the issue whether or not to invade another body in search of evidence of guilt as indisputable and great requiring a warrant whenever practicable helps ensure that when blood draws occur,they are indeed justified.
at the same time,permitting the police to act without a warrant to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence is well established in fourth amendment law.there is no reason to preclude application of that exception in drunk driving cases simply because it may take the police some time to be able to respond to the undoubted destruction of evidence,or because the destruction occurs continuously over an uncertain period.
and that is so even in situations where police have requested a warrant but do not receive a timely response.an officer who reasonably concluded there was no time to secure a warrant may have blood drawn from a suspect upon arrival at a medical facility.there is no reason an officer should be in a worse position,simply because he sought a warrant prior to his arrival at the hospital.
the court resists the foregoing,contending that the question presented somehow inhibits such a focused analysis in this case.see ante,at.it does not.the question presented is whether a warrantless blood draw is permissible under the fourth amendment based upon the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream.pet.for cert.i.the majority answers it depends,and so do i.the difference is that the majority offers no guidance,merely instructing courts and police officers to consider the totality of the circumstances.i believe more meaningful guidance can be provided about how to handle the typical cases,and nothing about the question presented prohibits affording that guidance.
a plurality of the court also expresses concern that my approach will discourage state and local efforts to expedite the warrant application process.see ante,at.that is not plausible police and prosecutors need warrants in a wide variety of situations,and often need them quickly.they certainly would not prefer a slower process,just because that might obviate the need to ask for a warrant in the occasional drunk driving case in which a blood draw is necessary.the plurality suggestion also overlooks the interest of law enforcement in the protection a warrant provides.
the court is correct when it says that every case must be considered on its particular facts.but the pertinent facts in drunk driving cases are often the same,and the police should know how to act in recurring factual situations.simply put,when a drunk driving suspect fails field sobriety tests and refuses a breathalyzer,whether a warrant is required for a blood draw should come down to whether there is time to secure one.
schmerber itself provides support for such an analysis.the court there made much of the fact that there was no time to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant.at.it did so in an era when cell phones and were unknown.it follows quite naturally that if cell phones and mean that there is time to contact a magistrate and secure a warrant,that must be done.at the same time,there is no need to jettison the exception for the imminent destruction of evidence,when the officers are in a position to do something about it.
because the missouri courts did not apply the rule i describe above,and because this court should not do so in the first instance,i would vacate and remand for further proceedings in the missouri courts.

justice thomas,dissenting.
this case requires the court to decide whether the fourth amendment prohibits an officer from obtaining a blood sample without a warrant when there is probable cause to believe that a suspect has been driving under the influence of alcohol.because the body natural metabolization of alcohol inevitably destroys evidence of the crime,it constitutes an exigent circumstance.as a result,i would hold that a warrantless blood draw does not violate the fourth amendment.
the fourth amendment states that t he right of the people to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause.before a search occurs,a warrant must generally be secured,kentucky king,slip,at,but this presumption may be overcome in some circumstances because t he ultimate touchstone of the fourth amendment is reasonableness.ibid.quoting brigham city stuart,alteration in original.
the presence of exigent circumstances is one such exception to the warrant requirement.exigency applies when the needs of law enforcement are so compelling that a warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the fourth amendment.at slip,at quoting mincey arizona,second alteration in original.thus,when exigent circumstances are present,officers may take actions that would typically require a warrant,such as entering a home in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect,at slip,at.as relevant in this case,officers may also conduct a warrantless search when they have probable cause to believe that failure to act would result in imminent destruction of evidence.ibid.quoting brigham city,supra,at.
once police arrest a suspect for drunk driving,each passing minute eliminates probative evidence of the crime.the human liver eliminates alcohol from the bloodstream at a rate of approximately percent to percent per hour,ante,at,with some heavy drinkers as high as percent per hour,brief for petitioner citing medical studies,depending on,among other things,a person sex,weight,body type,and drinking history.ante,at brief for united states as amicus curiae.the court has acknowledged this fact since schmerber california,we are told that the percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops,as the body functions to eliminate it from the system in that case,the court recognized that destruction of evidence is inherent in cases and held that an officer investigating a crime might reasonably believe that he is confronted with an emergency,in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant,under the circumstances,threaten s the destruction of evidence.ibid.quoting preston united states.the court explained that drawing a person blood is a highly effective means of determining the degree to which he is under the influence of alcohol and is a reasonable procedure because blood tests are commonplace and involv e virtually no risk,trauma,or pain.at.the court,therefore,held that dissipation of alcohol in the blood constitutes an exigency that allows a blood draw without a warrant.
the rapid destruction of evidence acknowledged by the parties,the majority,and schmerber exigency determination occurs in every situation where police have probable cause to arrest a drunk driver.in turn,that destruction of evidence implicates the doctrine.see cupp murphy.in cupp,officers questioning a murder suspect observed a spot on the suspect finger that they believed might be dried blood,at.after the suspect began making obvious efforts to remove the spots from his hands,the officers took samples without obtaining either his consent or a warrant,at.following a fourth amendment challenge to this search,the court held that the ready destructibility of the evidence and the suspect observed efforts to destroy it justified the police in subjecting him to the very limited search necessary to preserve the highly evanescent evidence they found under his fingernails.ibid.
in this case,a similar exigency is present.just as the suspect efforts to destroy highly evanescent evidence gave rise to the exigency in cupp,the natural metabolization of blood alcohol concentration bac creates an exigency once police have probable cause to believe the driver is drunk.it naturally follows that police may conduct a search in these circumstances.
a hypothetical involving classic exigent circumstances further illustrates the point.officers are watching a warehouse and observe a worker carrying bundles from the warehouse to a large bonfire and throwing them into the blaze.the officers have probable cause to believe the bundles contain marijuana.because there is only one person carrying the bundles,the officers believe it will take hours to completely destroy the drugs.during that time the officers likely could obtain a warrant.but it is clear that the officers need not sit idly by and watch the destruction of evidence while they wait for a warrant.the fact that it will take time for the evidence to be destroyed and that some evidence may remain by the time the officers secure a warrant are not relevant to the exigency.however,the quantity of drugs may have an impact on the severity of the crime and the length of the sentence.see,b d lower penalties for less than kilograms of marijuana united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual c drug quantity table tying base offense level to drug amounts.conducting a warrantless search of the warehouse in this situation would be entirely reasonable.
the same obtains in the context.just because it will take time for the evidence to be completely destroyed does not mean there is no exigency.congress has conditioned federal highway grants on states adoption of laws penalizing the operation of a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of percent or greater.a.see also cfr.all states have acceded to this condition.national highway traffic safety admin.nhtsa,alcohol and highway safety a review of the state of knowledge,nhtsa state review.ann.stat.west establishing missouri percent bac standard.moreover,as of,states and the district of columbia imposed additional penalties for bac levels of percent or higher.nhtsa state review.missouri is one such state.see.stat.ann,suspended sentence unavailable even for first offenders with bac above percent unless they complete drug treatment mandatory jail time if treatment is not completed.as a result,the level of intoxication directly bears on enforcement of these laws.nothing in the fourth amendment requires officers to allow evidence essential to enforcement of laws to be destroyed while they wait for a warrant to issue.
in today decision,the court elides the certainty of evidence destruction in cases and focuses primarily on the time necessary for destruction.in doing so,it turns the exigency inquiry into a question about the amount of evidentiary destruction police must permit before they may act without a warrant.that inquiry is inconsistent with the actual exigency at issue the uncontested destruction of evidence due to metabolization of alcohol.see part i,supra.moreover,the court analysis will be difficult to administer,a particularly important concern in the fourth amendment context.
the court judgment reflects nothing more than a vague notion that everything will come out right most of the time so long as the delay is not too lengthy.ante,at justifying delays in part because bac evidence is lost gradually and relatively predictably ante,at same,quoting brief for petitioner.but hard percentage lines have meaningful legal consequences in the context.the fact that police will be able to retrieve some evidence before it is all destroyed is simply not relevant to the exigency inquiry.
the majority believes that,absent special facts and circumstances,some destruction of evidence is acceptable.see ante,at sufficient for our purposes to note that significant delay in testing will negatively affect the probative value emphasis added.this belief must rest on the a
