following a trial,leoner martínez was found guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and possession with intent to distribute at least kilograms but less than kilograms of cocaine,in violation of a,b a,and.martínez was sentenced to months of imprisonment.martínez appeals,contending that the evidence was insufficient for his conspiracy conviction and there were errors at his trial.because the entire drug deal was captured on video and audio which show martínez inspecting the drugs with his own hands we find that there was sufficient evidence to convict martínez.we also find martínez claims that there were errors at his trial to be without merit.we therefore affirm.
background 
on july,a confidential informant told homeland security investigations hsi agents that a money laundering and drug trafficking organization was seeking assistance to transport cocaine from thomas to puerto rico.that same day,an hsi undercover agent the agent,acting as a facilitator,called the organization and coordinated a meeting to discuss the smuggling venture.
on july,the agent met with oscar de la cruz de la cruz and pedro in piñones,puerto rico,to discuss the venture and agreed that,in exchange for transporting the narcotics,they would pay the agent per kilogram of cocaine in transportation fees,plus in fuel and travel expenses.during a series of recorded calls and meetings,they ultimately agreed to have the agent transport kilograms of cocaine and provided him with a blackberry and the phone number of erasmo,who had the narcotics in thomas.the agent travelled to thomas and successfully arranged the delivery of the narcotics.
the agent called on july to arrange the location for the exchange.the exchange took place at the martínez nadal train station parking lot,in san juan,puerto rico,and was recorded on video accompanying audio was provided through a body wire that the agent was wearing.
the controlled delivery involved four cars.messaged the agent and informed him that would be driving a grey nissan,and that he would be with somebody who was later identified as carlos carmona.also informed the agent that a second vehicle,a white altima,would be involved in the transaction.it would later turn out that martínez would be driving this altima,with his friend ramón coplin in the passenger seat.another undercover agent would drive a small suv to the transaction with the agent in the passenger seat.the sham cocaine would be located in a separate red undercover vehicle the agents naturally did not bring the real cocaine to the transaction.the money would be put into the small suv,and martínez would drive away in the red undercover vehicle that contained the narcotics.
the transaction followed this plan except,of course,that the conspirators were arrested before they could drive away.the agent got out of the suv and approached vehicle,the grey nissan.told the agent that the bag containing the was in the rear seat of this grey nissan.after the agent inspected the bag of money and confirmed its contents,carmona placed it in the small suv.the agent then approached the white altima.martínez was in the driver seat,and coplin in the passenger seat.the agent asked martínez whether he was going to drive the red vehicle and martínez nodded his head.the agent asked martínez whether anyone was going to check that,referring to the sham narcotics in the vehicle.martínez replied o h,okay.both martínez and coplin approached the agent vehicle to inspect the bags and the agent opened the trunk.the agent opened the bag containing the bricks of sham cocaine to show them to martínez.martínez looked into the trunk,reached into the trunk,and touched the sham narcotics.after martínez had completed this inspection of the sham cocaine,the agent closed the trunk of the vehicle,which signaled federal agents to arrest the conspirators.
after the arrest,martínez waived his miranda rights at the police station and admitted that he was hired to move the vehicle containing the bags from point a to point b for,and that he knew that he was to move something illegal because of the amount of money that he was offered.
martínez was tried from may to may.he was found guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and possession with intent to distribute at least but less than kilograms of cocaine,in violation of a,b a,and.martínez was sentenced to months of imprisonment.martínez appeals,contending that the evidence was insufficient for his conviction and his trial was unfair.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
martínez principal argument on appeal is that the evidence was insufficient for his conviction.we review preserved challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.united states,cir.citation omitted,cert.denied.on sufficiency of evidence review,this court must view the evidence,both direct and circumstantial,in the light most favorable to the prosecution,and decide whether that evidence,including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom,would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.id.citation omitted.given this difficult standard,defendants raising this claim are rarely successful united states,cir.quoting united states moran,cir.for conspiracies such as the one martínez was convicted for,the government need only prove that the defendant had knowledge that he was dealing with a controlled substance,not that he had knowledge of the specific controlled substance.id.at quoting united states woods,cir.
martínez concedes that he knew that he was doing something illegal,and he concedes that he was paid for doing so.martínez,however,contends that he did not know that he was part of a criminal conspiracy,or that the conspiracy involved illegal drugs.the video recording belies martínez arguments.he was caught on tape arriving in the white altima,the car that had said he would arrive in,at the exact location and at the exact time that the drug deal was to take place.not only did he look into the trunk of the undercover vehicle with the unzipped bag of drugs inside it but he also touched the bricks of sham cocaine with his hands.only after martínez had completed this inspection did the agent close the trunk,which was the signal for the police to appear.we have no difficulty in finding that such evidence is sufficient to allow a rational to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that martínez knew not only that he was part of a conspiracy to do something illegal,but also that the conspiracy involved a narcotics deal.
b.other alleged trial irregularities 
martínez raises a number of additional issues,none of which are of any avail to him.
according to martínez,the transcript of the audio that accompanied the surveillance video was not properly authenticated.the transcript was authenticated by the agent testimony on the third day of the trial.because authentication rulings are necessarily,we review such rulings only for mistake of law or abuse of discretion.united states,cir.citation omitted.this court has discern ed no problem with the authentication of a transcript by an officer who was personally involved in recording the transmissions coming from an electronic transmitting device worn by an informant during a drug transaction and who compared the transcript to the tape recording and testified that the transcript fairly and accurately represented the conversation on the tape,even though the officer did not prepare the transcript.united states anderson,cir.indeed,the officer is in an even better position to authenticate the transcript because he himself had listened to the conversation while monitoring the controlled transaction.id.and if the appellant was so concerned about the authenticity of the government transcript,he could have submitted his own.id.martínez never submitted his own transcript.rather,on the first day of trial,he agreed with the government to use the transcript and to let the agent identify the speaker.
martínez also seeks to convince this court that the trial testimony of a firearms and ammunition expert was not relevant and caused a prejudicial
