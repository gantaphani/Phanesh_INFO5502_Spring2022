setting the stage 
randy ray rivera pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm.see g.his conditional plea reserved the right to appeal from the district judge order denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his home a seizure authorized by a warrant issued by the same judge.rivera had argued below that the affidavit dea special agent john barron submitted in support of the application failed to establish probable cause because it did not provide an adequate nexus between his drug dealing and his house rivera had also asked the judge for an evidentiary hearing dubbed a franks hearing,after franks delaware,so that he could challenge the truthfulness of barron affidavit statements.but the judge concluded that even if the affidavit failed to supply probable cause a question the judge saw no need to decide,rivera suppression bid failed because barron had obtained the warrant in good faith.see united states leon,discussing how evidence seized in good faith,in reliance on a warrant later invalidated,may still be admissible.and the judge also concluded that rivera had failed to make the substantial showing of probable falsity on barron part,thus making a franks hearing unnecessary.
an unhappy rivera appeals both aspects of the judge ruling.we affirm,though on the first issue we think law enforcement actually had probable cause for the search which removes any need to invoke the exception.
background 
we cite only those facts necessary to put the issue into workable perspective presenting them,of course,in the light most favorable to the suppression ruling.see,united states mcgregor,cir.united states owens,cir.
back in,a vermont state trooper stopped an suv for a traffic infraction.the driver,shawn kivela,consented to a vehicle search.and that search turned up about ounces of what turned out to be crack cocaine.
the trooper arrested and mirandized kivela and his passengers,randy and star gaboriault.after the trio waived their miranda rights,a series of police interviews ensued.among other juicy tidbits,law enforcement learned from kivela that he and the gaboriaults had driven to springfield,massachusetts to meet with a puerto rican male known as melvin or randy we use randy for simplicity at a apartment at beaumont street a very sparsely furnished apartment that randy used as a house,not apparently as a home.kivela said that the gaboriaults had bought about ounces of crack from randy too paying him,according to star gaboriault and searches of the gaboriaults uncovered that crack amount.kivela added that he had been buying crack from randy on a weekly basis since.the gaboriaults routinely accompanied him on these sprees kivela would score about or ounces of crack per visit,while the gaboriaults would score between and ounces.kivela and randy would communicate by text,kivela said.and he identified a photo of rivera as randy.
rivera,it turns out,was no stranger to the springfield police a check disclosed prior narcotics convictions plus a prior conviction.he lived at merwin street a street in springfield with his girlfriend yayaira guzman,a confidential source cs told the police records showed that guzman solely owned the property.the cs also identified some cars registered to guzman at the address including a white infiniti that rivera used.a team regularly saw rivera and guzman entering and leaving the property,and routinely saw the cars described by the cs at that address as well.
most helpfully for the police,the cs eventually agreed to participate in a controlled buy of crack from rivera.on the day of the buy,but before the buy went down,a dea agent spotted the infiniti at merwin street rivera home at and again at around,the cs phoned rivera to say that he would be at beaumont street rivera stash house shortly.the dea saw the infiniti drive away from rivera home around,roughly minutes after the cs call.at about,rivera texted the cs to stay away from beaumont street because a police officer was parked outside.agents spotted the infiniti parked at beaumont street a minute later.
following rivera instructions,the cs drove to a walgreens parking lot.rivera said he would package up the crack and meet the cs there.the surveillance team saw the infiniti drive away from beaumont street at.an officer later identified the driver as rivera.investigators watched as the infiniti pulled up behind the cs vehicle.rivera honked the infiniti horn and motioned to the cs to follow him to the back of the parking lot.the cs did as asked.then the cs got into the infiniti around,and after a short time,returned to his car with a package of what proved to be crack.investigators followed rivera to a body shop,saw him get out and walk around a bit,and then tailed him back to beaumont.
armed with this information,the dea barron applied for federal warrants to search rivera residence at merwin street and his stash house at beaumont street.in addition to recounting the events just described,barron accompanying affidavit stated that based on his years of training and experience,including his participation in over narcotics investigations dealers often sell drugs at places other than where they live,though they frequently hide evidence of their illicit trade in their homes weapons cash expensive items,like furniture,artwork,and jewelry records showing things like addresses,phone numbers,drug buys,and steps taken to launder drug money photos of themselves and their accomplices.the judge signed the warrants.and the search of rivera residence revealed in cash,receipts,and a loaded handgun,while the search of his stash house disclosed among other things sizeable amounts of crack and cocaine.
rivera indictment on a charge,rejected suppression motion a motion that only targeted items taken from his home,conditional guilty plea reserving the right to contest the judge suppression ruling,and appeal to us followed apace.now we must decide whether rivera is right that the judge suppression order amounts to reversible error an argument premised on the theory that the affidavit did not establish probable cause because it did not show a nexus between drug trafficking and his house.rivera is wrong,however,for reasons we will come to right after we highlight the legal principles that govern our analysis.
legal primer 
the fourth amendment requires that search warrants issue only on a showing of probable cause,see const.amend.iv a common sense,nontechnical conception that deals with the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men,not legal technicians,act,see united states vongkaysone,cir.quoting united states meade,cir.to satisfy this standard,a application must reveal probable cause to believe two things one,that a crime has occurred,the commission element and two,that specified evidence of the crime will be at the search location,the nexus element.see,united states joubert,cir.rivera focuses only on the nexus element.so we will too.
when it comes to nexus,common sense says that a connection with the search site can be deduced from the type of crime,the nature of the items sought,plus normal inferences as to where a criminal would hide evidence of his crime.see united states feliz,cir.quoting united states charest,cir.common sense also says that when a criminal peddles narcotics outside his home,one can infer that evidence of his drug dealing activity will be found in the home,at least when he is spotted leaving the home immediately prior to selling drugs.see united states barnes,cir.
keep in mind too that probable cause does not demand certainty,or proof beyond a reasonable doubt,or even proof by a preponderance of the evidence it demands only a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.illinois gates,accord feliz,at explaining that the government need not show that the agent belief that evidence of a crime will be found is necessarily correct or more likely true than false.fair probability is another way of saying reasonable likelihood,by the way.see united states clark,cir.and in asking whether probable cause existed,courts look to the totality of the circumstances,see gates,at a phrase that means that all material circumstances should be considered,see united states,cir.
last but not least,we stress that when evaluating a judge suppression ruling,we review legal conclusions de novo and factual findings for clear error.see,mcgregor,at.and because of the de novo component to our review,we can affirm on any ground appearing in the record including one that the judge did not rely on.see united states arnott,cir.see also united states,cir.noting that we review a denial with deference,upholding the denial if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it feliz,at similar.
rivera does not dispute that agents had probable cause to believe that he was a drug pusher.and he does not dispute that agents had probable cause to believe that he lived at merwin street.instead he principally argues that the affidavit established only that he confine d his drug business to his stash house running his drug operation from there as opposed to his home.and this means that the affidavit provided no nexus between his home and his alleged drug peddling and thus supplied no probable cause for the house search or so he says.though ably presented,his argument ultimately fails to persuade.
taking the facts in the light most agreeable to the suppression order,as we must,see mcgregor,at,we can infer that rivera used a phone at his house either a landline or a cell phone the record does say which it was to conduct his drug business,talking with the cs to help push the crack deal along.that is a commonsense insight,given the timeline of events 
agents saw the infiniti parked outside rivera home at 
the cs called rivera at to tell him he was minutes away from the stash house the rendezvous point.
after finishing his call,rivera drove off in the infiniti at,stopped at the stash house at,and gave the cs the crack in the walgreens parking lot at 
so while the affidavit does not explicitly say rivera was at home when he had a phone confab with the cs,we can consistent with common sense infer as much given the concatenation of circumstances.and that means that the affidavit contains evidence showing that rivera used his home as a communications point to further his drug crimes making it reasonably likely that a search there would reveal incriminating evidence,such as his drug contacts names and phone numbers.and remember,the affidavit noted that dealers often keep info of that sort in their homes a factor that a judge can weigh in the balance.united states hoffman,cir.accord united states floyd,cir.
but that is not all.the affidavit info also suggests a fair probability that a search of rivera home would reveal other incriminating evidence.for example,given the affidavit description of the stash house as sparsely furnished and not lived in that the account kivela gave agents,one can infer that rivera a,drug dealer would opt to keep cash from his sales and stuff he bought with his profits,furniture,artwork,jewelry at his home.after all,common sense indicates that a drug pusher would want to hide these things in a safe yet accessible place,like a house,see feliz,at a stash house would not cut it,experience tells us,because it is a dangerous venue,often filled with criminals looking to steal whatever they can from there.see generally united states kenney,cir.discussing a planned robbery.on top of all this,the affidavit also permits an inference that rivera would have a firearm at his home to protect his drug cash and spoils from any robbers a commonsense inference to be sure,deriving as it does from the everyday understanding of the drug trade violent nature.see generally united states rivera gonzález,cir.emphasizing that guns are common in the drug trade.
so looking at everything,taking in the totality of the circumstances we think the affidavit established a fair probability of finding incriminating items in rivera residence.and rivera gives us no convincing reason to hold otherwise.
take first rivera argument about the evidence show ing that he took pains to confine his business to the stash house.yes,the affidavit provides no specific info showing that rivera actually doled out drugs from his home.but again,a commonsense reading of that document shows that he participated in a call with the cs from his house.and that commonsense insight sinks his line of argument about only doing business from the stash house 
unwilling to give up so easily,rivera spends a lot of time trying to convince us not to follow barnes.there,we held that even though agents only saw the defendant sell drugs from his suv,the affidavit showed there was a fair probability that they would find evidence of drug dealing at his house and as support we noted in a passage we quoted earlier that it is reasonable to conclude that there is evidence of drug dealing activity in the home when the defendant is observed leaving the home immediately prior to selling drugs.at,concluding given both that the confidential informant stated that barnes lived at the target residence and that the police observed barnes exit the target residence,drive away,and sell drugs on the day of his arrest and the search that the totality of the circumstances strongly suggested that there was evidence of drug dealing at the target residence.hoping to avoid its reach,rivera calls barnes an anomaly.but barnes is still good law,having never been overruled or discredited.so follow it we must.see united states rodríguez,cir.noting the general rule that newly constituted panels in a circuit are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point.
rivera also accuses the government of asking us to lay down a per se rule that agents can search a drug dealer home whenever they spy a controlled buy.binding caselaw,he reminds us,rejects any rule that treats the agents viewing of a controlled buy as per se sufficient to establish probable cause to search the dealer residence.see united states khounsavanh,cir.but the government here asks for no such rule.instead,and consistent with khounsavanh,the government asks us to evaluate probable cause through a analysis in a commonsense manner,see id.circumstances that include the controlled buy but also rivera phone call in his house.and staying faithful to controlling precedent,we have done just that.consequently,rivera argument is a nonstarter.
so too is rivera suggestion that a judge can not rely on an agent affidavit statement that evidence cash,items,records,firearms,is often found in the dealer home.as rivera sees it,such reliance is tantamount to delegating the decision to the agent.but the federal reporter is teeming with opinions some of which we cited above saying that a law enforcement officer training and experience may yield insights that support a probable cause determination.see floyd,at collecting a bunch of cases.and those cases kibosh rivera argument.
let us be clear we might very well have reached a different result had a commonsense reading of the evidence not indicated that rivera participated in a phone call from his home.but with that inference,there is enough probable cause to believe evidence of his activities would be at his house.and for that reason,we need not assess the judge analysis either.
enough said about the issue.on to the last issue,then.
barron affidavit said emphasis ours that a before the controlled buy,agents conducted database checks that showed rivera uses a residence at merwin street in addition to the third floor apartment at beaumont street and that b a confidential informant told agents that rivera resides at merwin street with his girlfriend,and uses that residence as well as the third floor apartment at beaumont street.claiming that the word uses deliberately or recklessly suggested that he had used his home to sell drugs the affidavit,he said,failed to establish that drugs were there,rivera asked the judge for a franks hearing to test the accuracy of barron statement.the judge denied the motion,finding that uses was not misleading because it did not suggest that rivera used his home for his drug dealing,only that he lived there.rivera protests that ruling.but we notice no reversible error.
