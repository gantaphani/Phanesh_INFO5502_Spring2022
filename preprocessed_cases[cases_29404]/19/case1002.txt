appellant jos pled guilty to conspiring to distribute cocaine in a coamo,puerto rico,housing project.having three times moved unsuccessfully to withdraw his plea,he now challenges his conviction and sentence,contending that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because he relied on a contradictory and ambiguous plea agreement he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to identify and inform him of the plea agreement inconsistencies the district court erred in concluding that was on probation at the time of his crime and enhancing his sentence under section d of the sentencing guidelines and his sentence was unreasonable.
concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellant motions to withdraw his guilty plea,and finding no error in the court sentencing calculation,we affirm conviction and sentence.we also dismiss his ineffective assistance of counsel claim as procedurally flawed.
on november,and fifteen were indicted for conspiring to traffic narcotics in the las palmas public housing project from around to.was charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of controlled substances near a school or public housing project in violation of,and.
pled guilty on april,pursuant to a written plea agreement.the agreement stipulated a sentencing guidelines base offense level of and a reduction of three levels based on acceptance of responsibility,yielding a guidelines sentencing range of seventy to months the agreement specified that no further enhancements or deductions would apply,although it expressly stated that it made no stipulation as to the defendant criminal history category.
in exchange for plea,the government agreed to recommend the minimum sentence of seventy months or the lower end of the guidelines and to not seek any upward adjustments to his sentence.the agreement emphasized,however,that the district court judge did not have to accept this recommendation and could in fact sentence up to the statutory maximum of forty years.
the plea agreement also incorporated the government version of the statement of facts,which,by the terms of the agreement,acknowledged were accurate and could be used by the sentencing judge in applying the sentencing guidelines to his case.the statement specified that had participated in at least two drug distribution transactions in the las palmas housing project and noted that had possessed firearms in furtherance of the conspiracy.the statement also confirmed participation in the conspiracy from its beginning in or around 
the probation office relied on these details in the investigation report psr it prepared for the district court.the psr recommended a enhancement because the offense was committed in a protected location,a,and a enhancement for use of dangerous weapons in the conspiracy,b.the report also noted that was on probation during the conspiracy and thus assigned him a criminal history of ii the psr adjustments yielded a guidelines imprisonment range of to months,significantly higher than the range set forth in plea agreement.
both the government and objected to the proposed sentencing enhancements.in addition,filed three motions to withdraw his plea,the first two pro se and the third with the help of his current counsel.first argued that he was heavily sedated at the time of his hearing and that his trial attorney,benjamin ortiz,had coerced him into signing the plea agreement.in his second pro se motion,he contended that he did not understand the nature of the agreement because his attorney had not read it to him or explained its terms in spanish.in his third motion,claimed that the government deliberately drafted a contradictory and ambiguous plea agreement to induce him to plead guilty,and his attorney participation in negotiating the plea constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.
the district court overruled the parties objections to the sentencing report,determining that the statement of facts justified the enhancements.it also denied motions to withdraw his plea.the court found that statements at his hearing discredited his later allegations of ignorance,and it found no evidence that the government had acted deceitfully.although it agreed that the stipulated facts were patently irreconcilable with the sentence the defendant agreed to with the government,the court observed that it had no reason to suspect that ortiz did not warn of this fact.moreover,the court noted that the defendant had expressly acknowledged his awareness that it could impose a harsher sentence and that such would not be a valid basis for withdrawal of his plea.

ii.analysis 
raises four issues on appeal.we address each in turn 
denial of motion to withdraw guilty plea 
argues that the plea agreement contradictory and ambiguous language led him to plead guilty without understanding the consequences of his plea,and that he would not have pled guilty had he known that facts included with his plea agreement would operate to enhance his sentence.
we review the decision to deny a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion.united states pulido,cir.the trial court subsidiary findings of fact in connection with the motion are reviewed only for clear error.united states,cir.
although a defendant does not have an automatic right to withdraw a guilty plea,united states sousa,cir,the court should permit the defendant motion if the defendant establishes a fair and just reason for the withdrawal.d b.factors to be included in determining whether the defendant has met this burden are whether the plea was voluntary,intelligent,knowing,and in compliance with rule the plausibility of the proffered reason for withdrawing the plea the presence or absence of a claim of innocence the timing of the defendant motion and possible prejudice to the government if the defendant is allowed to withdraw his plea.id.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting request to withdraw his guilty plea.the plea agreement expressly stated that the district court was not bound by the agreement recommended sentencing range and could in fact sentence the defendant to the maximum term of forty years imprisonment.may not withdraw his plea merely because of the likelihood of a higher sentence.see united states,cir t he fact that a defendant finds himself faced with a stiffer sentence than he had anticipated is not a fair and just reason for abandoning a guilty plea.united states mercedes mercedes,cir observing that c ases holding to this effect are legion.
lodges two arguments that he should be able to withdraw his plea,neither of which alters our analysis.
first,he claims that he is innocent of the conduct that prompted the district court to enhance his sentence.he argues that he was not on probation when he joined the drug conspiracy,that he did not traffic drugs in a protected location,and that he did not use a weapon in connection with the offense.but the statement of facts that signed included this conduct,and at his change of plea hearing he explicitly confirmed that all of the facts were true.the district court did not err in presuming the validity of these assurances.see united states,cir holding that a court is entitled to give weight to the defendant assurances at his change of plea hearing absent a good reason for disregarding them blackledge allison,stating that a defendant declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity 
also argues that the plea agreement which he signed was internally inconsistent in that the statement of facts supported a stiffer sentence than the agreement contemplated.thus,he avers,his plea was not knowing and voluntary.we disagree.as we have already noted,the plea agreement put on plain notice of his sentence exposure.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
blames his first attorney,as well as the government,for allowing him to sign the plea agreement ortiz,asserts,should have known that the details provided in the agreement stipulated facts section would lead the cou
