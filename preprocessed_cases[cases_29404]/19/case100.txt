florida,petitioner joelis jardines 
on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of florida 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether using a dog on a homeowner porch to investigate the contents of the home is a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.
in,detective william pedraja of the police department received an unverified tip that marijuana was being grown in the home of respondent joelis jardines.one month later,the department and the drug enforcement administration sent a joint surveillance team to jardines home.detective pedraja was part of that team.he watched the home for fifteen minutes and saw no vehicles in the driveway or activity around the home,and could not see inside because the blinds were drawn.detective pedraja then approached jardines home accompanied by detective douglas bartelt,a trained canine handler who had just arrived at the scene with his dog.the dog was trained to detect the scent of marijuana,cocaine,heroin,and several other drugs,indicating the presence of any of these substances through particular behavioral changes recognizable by his handler.
detective bartelt had the dog on a leash,owing in part to the dog wild nature,app.to pet.for cert,and tendency to dart around erratically while searching.as the dog approached jardines front porch,he apparently sensed one of the odors he had been trained to detect,and began energetically exploring the area for the strongest point source of that odor.as detective bartelt explained,the dog began tracking that airborne odor by tracking back and forth,engaging in what is called bracketing,back and forth,back and forth.at a to.detective bartelt gave the dog the full six feet of the leash plus whatever safe distance he could give him to do this he testified that he needed to give the dog as much distance as i can.at.and detective pedraja stood back while this was occurring,so that he would not get knocked over when the dog was spinning around trying to find the source,at.
after sniffing the base of the front door,the dog sat,which is the trained behavior upon discovering the odor strongest point.detective bartelt then pulled the dog away from the door and returned to his vehicle.he left the scene after informing detective pedraja that there had been a positive alert for narcotics.
on the basis of what he had learned at the home,detective pedraja applied for and received a warrant to search the residence.when the warrant was executed later that day,jardines attempted to flee and was arrested the search revealed marijuana plants,and he was charged with trafficking in cannabis.
at trial,jardines moved to suppress the marijuana plants on the ground that the canine investigation was an unreasonable search.the trial court granted the motion,and the florida third district court of appeal reversed.on a petition for discretionary review,the florida supreme court quashed the decision of the third district court of appeal and approved the trial court decision to suppress,holding as relevant here that the use of the trained narcotics dog to investigate jardines home was a fourth amendment search unsupported by probable cause,rendering invalid the warrant based upon information gathered in that search.so.
we granted certiorari,limited to the question of whether the officers behavior was a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.
the fourth amendment provides in relevant part that the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated.the amendment establishes a simple baseline,one that for much of our history formed the exclusive basis for its protections when the government obtains information by physically intruding on persons,houses,papers,or effects,a search within the original meaning of the fourth amendment has undoubtedly occurred.united states jones,slip,at.by reason of our decision in katz united states,property rights are not the sole measure of fourth amendment violations,soldal cook county,but though katz may add to the baseline,it does not subtract anything from the amendment protections when the government does engage in a physical intrusion of a constitutionally protected area,united states knotts,brennan,concurring in the judgment.
that principle renders this case a straightforward one.the officers were gathering information in an area belonging to jardines and immediately surrounding his house in the curtilage of the house,which we have held enjoys protection as part of the home itself.and they gathered that information by physically entering and occupying the area to engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly permitted by the homeowner.
the fourth amendment indicates with some precision the places and things encompassed by its protections persons,houses,papers,and effects.oliver united states.the fourth amendment does not,therefore,prevent all investigations conducted on private property for example,an officer may subject to katz gather information in what we have called open fields even if those fields are privately owned because such fields are not enumerated in the amendment text.hester united states.
but when it comes to the fourth amendment,the home is first among equals.at the amendment very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.silverman united states.this right would be of little practical value if the state agents could stand in a home porch or side garden and trawl for evidence with impunity the right to retreat would be significantly diminished if the police could enter a man property to observe his repose from just outside the front window.
we therefore regard the area immediately surrounding and associated with the home what our cases call the curtilage as part of the home itself for fourth amendment purposes.oliver,supra,at.that principle has ancient and durable roots.just as the distinction between the home and the open fields is as old as the common law,hester,supra,at,so too is the identity of home and what blackstone called the curtilage or homestall,for the house protects and privileges all its branches and appurtenants.blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england.this area around the home is intimately linked to the home,both physically and psychologically,and is where privacy expectations are most heightened.california ciraolo.
while the boundaries of the curtilage are generally clearly marked,the conception defining the curtilage is at any rate familiar enough that it is easily understood from our daily experience.oliver,at.here there is no doubt that the officers entered it the front porch is the classic exemplar of an area adjacent to the home and to which the activity of home life extends.ibid.
since the officers investigation took place in a constitutionally protected area,we turn to the question of whether it was accomplished through an unlicensed physical intrusion while law enforcement officers need not shield their eyes when passing by the home on public thoroughfares,ciraolo,at,an officer leave to gather information is sharply circumscribed when he steps off those thoroughfares and enters the fourth amendment protected areas.in permitting,for example,visual observation of the home from public navigable airspace,we were careful to note that it was done in a physically nonintrusive manner.ibid.entick carrington,wils,eng,a case undoubtedly familiar to every american statesman at the time of the founding,boyd united states,states the general rule clearly o ur law holds the property of every man so sacred,that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour close without his leave.wils,at,eng,at.as it is undisputed that the detectives had all four of their feet and all four of their companion firmly planted on the constitutionally protected extension of jardines home,the only question is whether he had given his leave even implicitly for them to do so.he had not.
a license may be implied from the habits of the country,notwithstanding the strict rule of the english common law as to entry upon a close.mckee gratz,holmes.we have accordingly recognized that the knocker on the front door is treated as an invitation or license to attempt an entry,justifying ingress to the home by solicitors,hawkers and peddlers of all kinds.breard alexandria.this implicit license typically permits the visitor to approach the home by the front path,knock promptly,wait briefly to be received,and then absent invitation to linger longer leave.complying with the terms of that traditional invitation does not require legal knowledge it is generally managed without incident by the nation girl scouts and thus,a police officer not armed with a warrant may approach a home and knock,precisely because that is no more than any private citizen might do.kentucky king,slip,at.
but introducing a trained police dog to explore the area around the home in hopes of discovering incriminating evidence is something else.there is no customary invitation to do that.an invitation to engage in canine forensic investigation assuredly does not inhere in the very act of hanging a knocker to find a visitor knocking on the door is routine even if sometimes unwelcome to spot that same visitor exploring the front path with a metal detector,or marching his bloodhound into the garden before saying hello and asking permission,would inspire most of us to well,call the police.the scope of a license express or implied is limited not only to a particular area but also to a specific purpose.consent at a traffic stop to an officer checking out an anonymous tip that there is a body in the trunk does not permit the officer to rummage through the trunk for narcotics.here,the background social norms that invite a visitor to the front door do not invite him there to conduct a search 
the state points to our decisions holding that the subjective intent of the officer is irrelevant.see ashcroft,whren united states.but those cases merely hold that a stop or search that is objectively reasonable is not vitiated by the fact that the officer real reason for making the stop or search has nothing to do with the validating reason.thus,the defendant will not be heard to complain that although he was speeding the officer real reason for the stop was racial harassment.see,at.here,however,the question before the court is precisely whether the officer conduct was an objectively reasonable search.as we have described,that depends upon whether the officers had an implied license to enter the porch,which in turn depends upon the purpose for which they entered.here,their behavior objectively reveals a purpose to conduct a search,which is not what anyone would think he had license to do.
the state argues that investigation by a forensic narcotics dog by definition can not implicate any legitimate privacy interest.the state cites for authority our decisions in united states place,united states jacobsen,and illinois caballes,which held,respectively,that canine inspection of luggage in an airport,chemical testing of a substance that had fallen from a parcel in transit,and canine inspection of an automobile during a lawful traffic stop,do not violate the reasonable expectation of privacy described in katz.
just last term,we considered an argument much like this.jones held that tracking an automobile whereabouts using a gps receiver is a fourth amendment search.the government argued that the katz standard show ed that no search occurred,as the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his whereabouts on the public roads,jones,at slip,at a proposition with at least as much support in our case law as the one the state marshals here.see,united states knotts.but because the gps receiver had been physically mounted on the defendant automobile thus intruding on his effects we held that tracking the vehicle movements was a search a person fourth amendment rights do not rise or fall with the katz formulation.jones,supra,at slip,at.the katz test has been added to,not substituted for,the traditional understanding of the fourth amendment,and so is unnecessary to consider when the government gains evidence by physically intruding on constitutionally protected areas.jones,supra,at slip,at.
thus,we need not decide whether the officers investigation of jardines home violated his expectation of privacy under katz.one virtue of the fourth amendment baseline is that it keeps easy cases easy.that the officers learned what they learned only by physically intruding on jardines property to gather evidence is enough to establish that a search occurred.
for a related reason we find irrelevant the state argument echoed by the dissent that forensic dogs have been commonly used by police for centuries.this argument is apparently directed to our holding in kyllo united states,that surveillance of the home is a search where the government uses a device that is not in general public use to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion.at emphasis added.but the implication of that statement inclusio unius est exclusio alterius is that when the government uses a physical intrusion to explore details of the home including its curtilage,the antiquity of the tools that they bring along is irrelevant.
the government use of trained police dogs to investigate the home and its immediate surroundings is a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.the judgment of the supreme court of florida is therefore affirmed.
it is so ordered.

justice kagan,with whom justice ginsburg and justice sotomayor join,concurring.
for me,a simple analogy clinches this case and does so on privacy as well as property grounds.a stranger comes to the front door of your home carrying binoculars.see ante,at.he does knock or say hello.instead,he stands on the porch and uses the binoculars to peer through your windows,into your home furthest corners.it does take long the binoculars are really very fine in just a couple of minutes,his uncommon behavior allows him to learn details of your life you disclose to no one.has your visitor trespassed on your property,exceeding the license you have granted to members of the public to,say,drop off the mail or distribute campaign flyers yes,he has.and has he also invaded your reasonable expectation of privacy,by nosing into intimacies you sensibly thought protected from disclosure katz united states,harlan,concurring.yes,of course,he has done that too.
that case is this case in every way that matters.here,police officers came to joelis jardines door with a instrument,which they deployed to detect things inside that they could not perceive unassisted.the they used was animal,not mineral.but contra the dissent,see post,at opinion of alito,noting the ubiquity of dogs in american households,that is of no significance in determining whether a search occurred.detective bartelt dog was not your neighbor pet,come to your porch on a leisurely stroll.as this court discussed earlier this term,dogs are highly trained tools of law enforcement,geared to respond in distinctive ways to specific scents so as to convey clear and reliable information to their human partners.see florida harris,slip op.at.they are to the poodle down the street as binoculars are to a piece of plain glass.like the binoculars,a dog is a specialized device for discovering objects not in plain view or plain smell.and as in the hypothetical above,that device was aimed here at a home the most private and inviolate or so we expect of all the places and things the fourth amendment protects.was this activity a trespass yes,as the court holds.was it also an invasion of privacy yes,that as well.
the court today treats this case under a property rubric i write separately to note that i could just as happily have decided it by looking to jardines privacy interests.a decision along those lines would have looked well,much like this one.it would have talked about the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.ante,at quoting silverman united states.it would have insisted on maintaining the practical value of that right by preventing police officers from standing in an adjacent space and trawl ing for evidence with impunity.ante,at.it would have explained that privacy expectations are most heightened in the home and the surrounding area.ante,at quoting california ciraolo.and it would have determined that police officers invade those shared expectations when they use trained canine assistants to reveal within the confines of a home what they could not otherwise have found there.see ante,at,and nn.
it is not surprising that in a case involving a search of a home,property concepts and privacy concepts should so align.the law of property naturally enough influence s our shared social expectations of what places should be free from governmental incursions.georgia randolph,see rakas illinois.and so the sentiment my home is my own,while originating in property law,now also denotes a common understanding extending even beyond that law formal protections about an especially private sphere.jardines home was his property it was also his most intimate and familiar space.the analysis proceeding from each of those facts,as today decision reveals,runs mostly along the same path.
i can think of only one divergence if we had decided this case on privacy grounds,we would have realized that kyllo united states,already resolved it the kyllo court held that police officers conducted a search when they used a device to detect heat emanating from a private home,even though they committed no trespass.highlighting our intention to draw both a firm and a bright line at the entrance to the house,at,we announced the following rule 
where,as here,the government uses a device that is not in general public use,to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion,the surveillance is a search and is presumptively unreasonable without a warrant.ibid.
that firm and bright rule governs this case the police officers here conducted a search because they used a device not in general public use a trained dog to explore details of the home the presence of certain substances that they would not otherwise have discovered without entering the premises.
and again,the dissent argument that the device is just a dog can not change the equation.as kyllo made clear,the tool at issue may be crude or sophisticated,may be old or new dogs actually go back not years or centuries,post,at,but only a few decades,may be either smaller or bigger than a breadbox still,at least where as here the device is not in general public use,training it on a home violates our minimal expectation of privacy an expectation that exists,and that is acknowledged to be reasonable.at,that does not mean the device is,as the dissent implies,see post,at it just means police officers can not use it to examine a home without a warrant or exigent circumstance.see brigham city stuart,describing exigencies allowing the warrantless search of a home.
with these further thoughts,suggesting that a focus on jardines privacy interests would make an easy cas e easy twice over,ante,at,i join the court opinion in full.

justice alito,with whom the chief justice,jus tice kennedy,and justice breyer join,dissenting.
the court decision in this important fourth amendment case is based on a putative rule of trespass law that is nowhere to be found in the annals of jurisprudence.
the law of trespass generally gives members of the public a license to use a walkway to approach the front door of a house and to remain there for a brief time.this license is not limited to persons who intend to speak to an occupant or who actually do so.mail carriers and persons delivering packages and flyers are examples of individuals who may lawfully approach a front door without intending to converse.nor is the license restricted to categories of visitors whom an occupant of the dwelling is likely to welcome as the court acknowledges,this license applies even to solicitors,hawkers and peddlers of all kinds.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted.and the license even extends to police officers who wish to gather evidence against an occupant by asking potentially incriminating questions.
according to the court,however,the police officer in this case,detective bartelt,committed a trespass because he was accompanied during his otherwise lawful visit to the front door of respondent house by his dog,franky.where is the authority evidencing such a rule dogs have been domesticated for about years they were ubiquitous in both this country and britain at the time of the adoption of the fourth amendment and their acute sense of smell has been used in law enforcement for centuries yet the court has been unable to find a single case from the united states or any other nation that supports the rule on which its decision is based.thus,trespass law provides no support for the court holding today.
the court decision is also inconsistent with the test that the court adopted in katz united states.a reasonable person understands that odors emanating from a house may be detected from locations that are open to the public,and a reasonable person will not count on the strength of those odors remaining within the range that,while detectible by a dog,can not be smelled by a human.
for these reasons,i would hold that no search within the meaning of the fourth amendment took place in this case,and i would reverse the decision below.
the opinion of the court may leave a reader with the mistaken impression that detective bartelt and franky remained on respondent property for a prolonged period of time and conducted a exploration of the front yard.see ante,at trawl for evidence with impunity marching his bloodhound into the garden but that is not what happened.
detective bartelt and franky approached the front door via the driveway and a paved path the route that any visitor would customarily and franky was on the kind of leash that any dog owner might employ as franky approached the door,he started to track an airborne odor.he held his head high and began bracketing the area pacing back and forth in order to determine the strongest source of the smell.app.detective bartelt knew the minute he observed this behavior that franky had detected drugs,at.upon locating the odor strongest source,franky sat at the base of the front door,and at this point,detective bartelt and franky immediately returned to their patrol car,at.
a critical fact that the court omits is that,as respondent counsel explained at oral argument,this entire process walking down the driveway and front path to the front door,waiting for franky to find the strongest source of the odor,and walking back to the car took approximately a minute or two.tr.of oral arg.thus,the amount of time that franky and the detective remained at the front porch was even less.the court also fails to mention that,while detective bartelt apparently did not personally smell the odor of marijuana coming from the house,another officer who subsequently stood on the front porch,detective pedraja,did notice that smell and was able to identify it.app.
the court concludes that the conduct in this case was a search because detective bartelt exceeded the boundaries of the license to approach the house that is recognized by the law of trespass,but the court interpretation of the scope of that license is unfounded.
it is said that members of the public may lawfully proceed along a walkway leading to the front door of a house because custom grants them a license to do so.breard alexandria,lakin ames,bishop,commentaries on the law.this rule encompasses categories of visitors whom most homeowners almost certainly wish to allow to approach their front doors friends,relatives,mail carriers,persons making deliveries.but it also reaches categories of visitors who are less universally welcome solicitors,hawkers,peddlers,and the like.the law might attempt to draw fine lines between categories of welcome and unwelcome visitors,distinguishing,for example,between tolerable and intolerable peddlers girl scouts selling cookies versus adults selling aluminum siding or between police officers on agreeable and disagreeable missions gathering information about a bothersome neighbor versus asking potentially incriminating questions.but the law of trespass has not attempted such a difficult taxonomy.see desnick american broadcasting,c onsent to an entry is often given legal effect even though the entrant has intentions that if known to the owner of the property would cause him for perfectly understandable and generally ethical or at least lawful reasons to revoke his consent skinner ogallala public school,i n order to determine if a business invitation is implied,the inquiry is not a subjective assessment of why the visitor chose to visit the premises in a particular instance crown cork seal kane,noting that there are many cases in which an invitation has been implied from circumstances,such as custom,and that this test is objective in that it stresses custom and the appearance of things as opposed to the undisclosed intention of the visitor 
of course,this license has certain spatial and temporal limits.a visitor must stick to the path that is typically used to approach a front door,such as a paved walkway.a visitor can not traipse through the garden,meander into the backyard,or take other circuitous detours that veer from the pathway that a visitor would customarily use.see,robinson virginia.app,en banc united states wells,police exceeded scope of their implied invitation when they bypassed the front door and proceeded directly to the back yard state harris.crim.app.any substantial and unreasonable departure from an area where the public is impliedly invited exceeds the scope of the implied invitation internal quotation marks and brackets omitted lafave,search and seizure c,hereinafter lafave,f,at w hen the police come on to private property to conduct an investigation or for some other legitimate purpose and restrict their movements to places visitors could be expected to go,walkways,driveways,porches,observations made from such vantage points are not covered by the fourth amendment footnotes omitted.
nor,as a general matter,may a visitor come to the front door in the middle of the night without an express invitation.see state cada,idaho,app.furtive intrusion late at night or in the predawn hours is not conduct that is expected from ordinary visitors.indeed,if observed by a resident of the premises,it could be a cause for great alarm 
similarly,a visitor may not linger at the front door for an extended period.see so.app.case below cope,concurring in part and dissenting in part t here is no such thing as squatter rights on a front porch.a stranger may not plop down uninvited to spend the afternoon in the front porch rocking chair,or throw down a sleeping bag to spend the night,or lurk on the front porch,looking in the windows the license is limited to the amount of time it would customarily take to approach the door,pause long enough to see if someone is home,and if not expressly invited to stay longer,leave.
as i understand the law of trespass and the scope of the implied license,a visitor who adheres to these limitations is not necessarily required to ring the doorbell,knock on the door,or attempt to speak with an occupant.for example,mail carriers,persons making deliveries,and individuals distributing flyers may leave the items they are carrying and depart without making any attempt to converse.a pedestrian or motorist looking for a particular address may walk up to a front door in order to check a house number that is hard to see from the sidewalk or road.a neighbor who knows that the residents are away may approach the door to retrieve an accumulation of newspapers that might signal to a potential burglar that the house is unoccupied.
as the majority acknowledges,this implied license to approach the front door extends to the police.see ante,at.as we recognized in kentucky king,police officers do not engage in a search when they approach the front door of a residence and seek to engage in what is termed a knock and talk,knocking on the door and seeking to speak to an occupant for the purpose of gathering evidence.see,at slip,at when law enforcement officers who are not armed with a warrant knock on a door,they do no more than any private citizen might do see also lafave e,at it is not objectionable for an officer to come upon that part of the property which has been opened to public common use internal quotation marks omitted.even when the objective of a knock and talk is to obtain evidence that will lead to the homeowner arrest and prosecution,the license to approach still applies.in other words,gathering evidence even damning evidence is a lawful activity that falls within the scope of the license to approach.and when officers walk up to the front door of a house,they are permitted to see,hear,and smell whatever can be detected from a lawful vantage point.california ciraolo,the fourth amendment protection of the home has never been extended to require law enforcement officers to shield their eyes when passing by a home on public thoroughfares cada,supra,at,at p olice officers restricting their activity to areas to which the public is impliedly invited are permitted the same intrusion and the same level of observation as would be expected from a reasonably respectful citizen internal quotation marks omitted lafave a,c,at.
detective bartelt did not exceed the scope of the license to approach respondent front door.he adhered to the customary path he did not approach in the middle of the night and he remained at the front door for only a very sho
