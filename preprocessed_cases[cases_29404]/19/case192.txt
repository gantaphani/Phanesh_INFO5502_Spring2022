from jury selection to jury instructions in a michigan court,respondent lett first trial for,inter alia,murder took less than nine hours.during approximately four hours of deliberations,the jury sent the trial court seven notes,including one asking what would happen if the jury could not agree.the judge called the jury and the attorneys into the courtroom and questioned the foreperson,who said that the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict.the judge then declared a mistrial,dismissed the jury,and scheduled a new trial.at lett second trial,after deliberating for only hours and minutes,a new jury found him guilty of murder.on appeal,lett argued that because the judge in his first trial had announced a mistrial without any manifest necessity to do so,the double jeopardy clause barred the state from trying him a second time.agreeing,the michigan court of appeals reversed the conviction.the michigan supreme court reversed.it concluded that,under united states perez,wheat,a defendant may be retried following the discharge of a deadlocked jury so long as the trial court exercised its sound discretion in concluding that the jury was deadlocked and thus that there was a manifest necessity for a mistrial and that,under arizona washington,an appellate court must generally defer to a trial judge determination that a deadlock has been reached.it then found that the judge at lett first trial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mistrial,observing that the jury had deliberated a sufficient amount of time following a short,noncomplex trial that the jury had sent several notes,including one appearing to indicate heated discussions and that the foreperson had stated that the jury could not reach a verdict.in lett federal habeas petition,he contended that the michigan supreme court rejection of his double jeopardy claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,and thus that he was not barred by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa from obtaining federal habeas relief.the district court granted the writ,and the sixth circuit affirmed.
held because the michigan supreme court decision in this case was not unreasonable under aedpa,the sixth circuit erred in granting lett habeas relief.
a the question under aedpa is whether the michigan supreme court determination was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,d,not whether it was an incorrect application of that law,see williams taylor.aedpa imposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,lindh murphy,and demands that they be given the benefit of the doubt,woodford visciotti,per curiam.
b here,the clearly established federal law is largely undisputed.when a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury can not reach a verdict,the double jeopardy clause does not bar a new trial for the defendant before a new jury,perez,at.trial judges may declare a mistrial when,in their opinion,taking all the circumstances into consideration,there is a manifest necessity for doing so,at,a high degree of necessity,washington,supra,at.the decision whether to grant a mistrial is reserved to the broad discretion of the trial judge,illinois somerville,and the discretion to declare a mistrial for a deadlocked jury is accorded great deference by a reviewing court,washington,supra,at,although this deference is not absolute.this court has expressly declined to require the mechanical application of any rigid formula,wade hunter,when a trial judge decides to declare a mistrial due to jury deadlock,and it has explicitly held that the judge is not required to make explicit findings of manifest necessity or articulate on the record all the factors informing his discretion,washington,supra,at.the court has never required a judge in these circumstances to force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of time,to question the jurors individually,to consult with counsel,to issue a supplemental jury instruction,or to consider any other means of breaking the impasse.moreover,the legal standard applied by the michigan supreme court is a general one whether there was an abuse of the broad discretion reserved to the trial judge,somerville,supra,at.because aedpa authorizes a federal court to grant relief only when a state court application of federal law was unreasonable,it follows that t he more general the rule at issue and thus the greater the potential for reasoned disagreement among judges the more leeway state courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.yarborough alvarado.
c the michigan supreme court adjudication involved a straightforward application of this court longstanding precedents to the facts of lett case.the state court cited this court double jeopardy cases from perez to washington applying those precedents to the particular facts before it and finding no abuse of discretion in light of the length of deliberations following a short,uncomplicated trial,the jury notes to the judge,and the fact that the foreperson stated that the jury could not reach a verdict.it was thus reasonable for the court to determine that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.the sixth circuit concluded otherwise because it disagreed with the inferences that the michigan supreme court had drawn from the facts.the circuit court interpretation is not implausible,but other reasonable interpretations of the record are also possible.it was not objectively unreasonable for the michigan supreme court to conclude that the trial judge exercise of discretion was sound,both in light of what happened at trial and the fact that the relevant legal standard is a general one,to which there is no plainly correct or incorrect answer in this case.yarborough,supra,at.the sixth circuit failed to grant the michigan courts the dual layers of deference required by aedpa and this court double jeopardy precedents.
d the sixth circuit also erred in relying on its own fulton moore decision for the proposition that arizona washington sets forth three specific factors that determine whether a judge has exercised sound discretion.because fulton does not constitute clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,d,failure to apply it does not independently authorize habeas relief under aedpa.nor can fulton be understood merely to illuminate this court decision in washington,as washington did not set forth any such test to determine whether a trial judge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.
e the court does not deny that the trial judge in this case could have been more thorough before declaring a mistrial.nonetheless,the steps that the sixth circuit thought she should have taken were not required either under this court double jeopardy precedents or,by extension,under aedpa.

chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
this case requires us to review the grant of a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d.the district court in this case issued the writ to respondent reginald lett on the ground that his michigan murder conviction violated the double jeopardy clause of the constitution,and the court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed.in doing so,however,these courts misapplied aedpa deferential standard of review.because we conclude that the michigan supreme court application of federal law was not unreasonable,we reverse.
on august,an argument broke out in a detroit liquor store.the antagonists included adesoji latona,a taxi driver charles jones,a passenger who claimed he had been wrongfully ejected from latona cab and reginald lett,a friend of jones.after the argument began,lett left the liquor store,retrieved a handgun from another friend outside in the parking lot,and returned to the store.he shot latona twice,once in the head and once in the chest.latona died from his wounds shortly thereafter.see people lett.
michigan prosecutors charged lett with murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.his trial took place in june.from jury selection to jury instructions the trial took less than nine hours,spread over six different days,at,at.
the jury deliberations began on june,at,and ran that day until,at,at.after resuming its work the next morning,the jury sent the trial court a note one of seven it sent out in its two days of deliberations stating that the jurors had a concern about our voice levels disturbing any other proceedings that might be going on.at,at.later,the jury sent out another note,asking what if we ca agree m istrial r etrial w hat at,at.
the trial transcript does not reveal whether the judge discussed the jury query with counsel,off the record,upon receiving this last communication,at,at.what is clear is that at the judge called the jury back into the courtroom,along with the prosecutor and defense counsel.once the jury was seated,the following exchange took place 
the court i received your note asking me what if you ca agree and i have to conclude from that that that is your situation at this time.so,i like to ask the foreperson to identify themselves,please the foreperson identified herself.the court okay,thank you.all right.i need to ask you if the jury is deadlocked in other words,is there a disagreement as to the verdict the foreperson yes,there is.the court all right.do you believe that it is hopelessly deadlocked the foreperson the majority of us do believe that the court interposing do say what you going to say,okay the foreperson oh,i sorry.the court i do want to know what your verdict might be,or how the split is,or any of that.thank you.okay are you going to reach a unanimous verdict,or not the foreperson no response the court yes or no the foreperson no,judge.tr.in recorder court,detroit.
the judge then declared a mistrial,dismissed the jury,and scheduled a new trial for later that year.neither the prosecutor nor lett attorney made any objection.
lett second trial was held before a different judge and jury in november.this time,the jury was able to reach a unanimous verdict that lett was guilty of murder after deliberating for only hours and minutes.lett,supra,at,and,at,and.
lett appealed his conviction to the michigan court of appeals.he argued that the judge in his first trial had announced a mistrial without any manifest necessity for doing so.because the mistrial was an error,lett maintained,the state was barred by the double jeopardy clause of the constitution from trying him a second time.the michigan court of appeals agreed with lett and reversed his conviction.
the state appealed to the michigan supreme court,which reversed the court of appeals.the court explained that under our decision in united states perez,wheat,a defendant may be retried following the discharge of a deadlocked jury,even if the discharge occurs without the defendant consent.lett,at,at.there is no double jeopardy clause violation in such circumstances,it noted,so long as the trial court exercised its sound discretion in concluding that the jury was deadlocked and thus that there was a manifest necessity for a mistrial.ibid.quoting perez,supra,at emphasis deleted.the court further observed that,under our decision in arizona washington,an appellate court must generally defer to a trial judge determination that a deadlock has been reached,at,at.
after setting forth the applicable law,the michigan supreme court determined that the judge at lett first trial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mistrial,at,at.the court cited the facts that the jury had deliberated for at least four hours following a relatively short,and far from complex,trial,that the jury had sent out several notes,including one that appears to indicate that its discussions may have been particularly heated,and m ost important that the jury foreperson expressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a verdict.ibid.
lett petitioned for a federal writ of habeas corpus.again he argued that the trial court declaration of a mistrial constituted an abuse of discretion because there was no manifest necessity to cut short the jury deliberations.he further contended that the michigan supreme court rejection of his double jeopardy claim amounted to an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,and thus that he was not barred by aedpa,d,from obtaining federal habeas relief.the district court agreed and granted the writ.supp.ed.on appeal,a divided panel of the court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed.fed.appx.the state petitioned for review in our court,and we granted certiorari.
it is important at the outset to define the question before us.that question is not whether the trial judge should have declared a mistrial.it is not even whether it was an abuse of discretion for her to have done so the applicable standard on direct review.the question under aedpa is instead whether the determination of the michigan supreme court that there was no abuse of discretion was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.d.
we have explained that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.williams taylor.indeed,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.at.rather,that application must be objectively unreasonable.at.this distinction creates a substantially higher threshold for obtaining relief than de novo review.schriro landrigan.aedpa thus imposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,lindh murphy,and demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,woodford visciotti,per curiam 
the clearly established federal law in this area is largely undisputed.in perez,we held that when a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury can not reach a verdict,the double jeopardy clause does not bar a new trial for the defendant before a new jury,at.we explained that trial judges may declare a mistrial whenever,in their opinion,taking all the circumstances into consideration,there is a manifest necessity for doing so,at.the decision to declare a mistrial is left to the sound discretion of the judge,but the power ought to be used with the greatest caution,under urgent circumstances,and for very plain and obvious causes.ibid.
since perez,we have clarified that the manifest necessity standard can not be interpreted literally,and that a mistrial is appropriate when there is a high degree of necessity.washington,supra,at.the decision whether to grant a mistrial is reserved to the broad discretion of the trial judge,a point that has been consistently reiterated in decisions of this court.illinois somerville.see also gori united states.
in particular,t he trial judge decision to declare a mistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is accorded great deference by a reviewing court.washington,at.a mistrial premised upon the trial judge belief that the jury is unable to reach a verdict has been long considered the classic basis for a proper mistrial.at see also downum united states,deadlocked jury is the classic example of when the state may try the same defendant twice.
the reasons for allowing the trial judge to exercise broad discretion are especially compelling in cases involving a potentially deadlocked jury.washington,at.there,the justification for deference is that the trial court is in the best position to assess all the factors which must be considered in making a necessarily discretionary determination whether the jury will be able to reach a just verdict if it continues to deliberate.at.in the absence of such deference,trial judges might otherwise employ coercive means to break the apparent deadlock,thereby creating a significant risk that a verdict may result from pressures inherent in the situation rather than the considered judgment of all the jurors.at.
this is not to say that we grant absolute deference to trial judges in this context.perez itself noted that the judge exercise of discretion must be sound,at,and we have made clear that i f the record reveals that the trial judge has failed to exercise the sound discretion entrusted to him,the reason for such deference by an appellate court disappears.washington,at.thus if the trial judge acts for reasons completely unrelated to the trial problem which purports to be the basis for the mistrial ruling,close appellate scrutiny is appropriate.ibid.similarly,if a trial judge acts irrationally or irresponsibly,his action can not be condoned.at citing united states jorn,and somerville,supra,at.
we have expressly declined to require the mechanical application of any rigid formula when trial judges decide whether jury deadlock warrants a mistrial.wade hunter.we have also explicitly held that a trial judge declaring a mistrial is not required to make explicit findings of manifest necessity nor to articulate on the record all the factors which informed the deliberate exercise of his discretion.washington,supra,at.and we have never required a trial judge,before declaring a mistrial based on jury deadlock,to force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of time,to question the jurors individually,to consult with or obtain the consent of either the prosecutor or defense counsel,to issue a supplemental jury instruction,or to consider any other means of breaking the impasse.in,rehnquist noted that this court had never overturned a trial court declaration of a mistrial after a jury was unable to reach a verdict on the ground that the manifest necessity standard had not been met.winston moore,opinion dissenting from denial of certiorari.the same remains true today,nearly years later.
the legal standard applied by the michigan supreme court in this case was whether there was an abuse of the broad discretion reserved to the trial judge.somerville,supra,at washington,supra,at.this type of general standard triggers another consideration under aedpa.when assessing whether a state court application of federal law is unreasonable,the range of reasonable judgment can depend in part on the nature of the relevant rule that the state court must apply.yarborough alvarado.because aedpa authorizes federal courts to grant relief only when state courts act unreasonably,it follows that t he more general the rule at issue and thus the greater the potential for reasoned disagreement among judges the more leeway state courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.see also knowles mirzayance,slip,at.
in light of all the foregoing,the michigan supreme court decision in this case was not unreasonable under aedpa,and the decision of the court of appeals to grant lett a writ of habeas corpus must be reversed.
the michigan supreme court adjudication involved a straightforward application of our longstanding precedents to the facts of lett case.the court cited our own double jeopardy cases from perez to washington elaborating upon the manifest necessity standard for granting a mistrial and noting the broad deference that appellate courts must give trial judges in deciding whether that standard has been met in any given case.lett,at,at.it then applied those precedents to the particular facts before it and found no abuse of discretion,especially in light of the length of deliberations after a short and uncomplicated trial,the jury notes suggesting heated discussions and asking what would happen if we ca agree,and m ost important the fact that the jury foreperson expressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a verdict.at,at.in these circumstances,it was reasonable for the michigan supreme court to determine that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.
the court of appeals for the sixth circuit concluded otherwise.it did not contest the michigan supreme court description of the objective facts,but disagreed with the inferences to be drawn from them.for example,it speculated that the trial judge may have misinterpreted the jury notes as signs of discord and deadlock when,read literally,they expressly stated no such thing.fed,at.it further determined that the judge brief colloquy with the foreperson may have wrongly implied a false equivalence between mere disagreement and genuine deadlock,and may have given rise to inappropriate pressure on her to say that the jury would be unable to reach a verdict,at.the trial judge mistakes were so egregious,in the court of appeals view,that the michigan supreme court opinion finding no abuse of discretion was not only wrong but objectively unreasonable,at.
the court of appeals interpretation of the trial record is not implausible.nor,for that matter,is the more inventive surely not crude speculation of the dissent.post,at.after all,the jury only deliberated for four hours,its notes were arguably ambiguous,the trial judge initial question to the foreperson was imprecise,and the judge neither asked for elaboration of the foreperson answers nor took any other measures to confirm the foreperson prediction that a unanimous verdict would not be reached 
but other reasonable interpretations of the record are also possible.lett trial was not complex,and there is no reason that the jury would necessarily have needed more than a few hours to deliberate over his guilt.the notes the jury sent to the judge certainly could be read as reflecting substantial disagreement,even if they did not say so outright.most important,the foreperson expressly told the judge in response to her unambiguous question are you going to reach a unanimous verdict,or not that the jury would be unable to agree.lett,supra,at,at.
given the foregoing facts,the michigan supreme court decision upholding the trial judge exercise of discretion while not necessarily correct was not objectively unreasonable not only are there a number of plausible ways to interpret the record of lett trial,but the standard applied by the michigan supreme court whether the judge exercised sound discretion is a general one,to which there is no plainly correct or incorrect answer in this case.yarborough,at see also knowles,supra,at slip,at.the court of appeals ruling in lett favor failed to grant the michigan courts the dual layers of deference required by aedpa and our double jeopardy precedents.
the court of appeals also erred in a second respect.it relied upon its own decision in fulton moore,for the proposition that arizona washington sets forth three factors that determine whether a judge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial whether the judge heard the opinions of the parties counsel about the propriety of the mistrial considered the alternatives to a mistrial and acted deliberately,instead of abruptly.fed,at.it then cited fulton interpretation of washington to buttress its conclusion that the michigan supreme court erred in concluding that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion.fed,at.
the fulton decision,however,does not constitute clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,d,so any failure to apply that decision can not independently authorize habeas relief under aedpa.nor,as the dissent suggests,can fulton be understood merely to illuminat e washington.post,at.washington nowhere established these three factors as a constitutional test that determine s whether a trial judge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.fed,at.
in concluding that lett is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus,we do not deny that the trial judge could have been more thorough before declaring a mistrial.as the court of appeals pointed out,at,she could have asked the foreperson additional followup questions,granted additional time for further deliberations,or consulted with the prosecutor and defense counsel before acting.any of these steps would have been appropriate under the circumstances.none,however,was required either under our double jeopardy precedents or,by extension,under aedpa.
aedpa prevents defendants and federal courts from using federal habeas corpus review as a vehicle to the reasonable decisions of state courts.whether or not the michigan supreme court opinion reinstating lett conviction in this case was correct,it was clearly not unreasonable.the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice stevens,with whom justice sotomayor joins,and with whom justice breyer joins as to parts i and ii,dissenting.
at common law,courts went to great lengths to ensure the jury reached a verdict.english judges reportedly loaded hung juries into oxcarts and carried them from town to town until a judgment bounced out.less enterprising colleagues kept jurors as de facto prisoners until they achieved unanimity the notion of a mistrial based on jury deadlock did not appear in blackstone commentaries it is no surprise,then,that colonial juries virtually always returned a verdict well into the and even the century,some american judges continued to coax unresolved juries toward consensus by threatening to deprive them of heat sleep or or to lock them in a room for a prolonged period of time 
mercifully,our legal system has evolved,and such harsh measures are no longer tolerated.yet what this history demonstrates and what has not changed is the respect owed a defendant valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.wade hunter.our longstanding doctrine applying the double jeopardy clause attests to the durability and fundamentality of this interest.
the reasons why this valued right merits constitutional protection are worthy of repetition.arizona washington.
even if the first trial is not completed,a second prosecution may be grossly unfair.it increases the financial and emotional burden on the accused,prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing,and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted.the danger of such unfairness to the defendant exists whenever a trial is aborted before it is completed.consequently,as a general rule,the prosecutor is entitled to one,and only one,opportunity to require an accused to stand trial.at footnotes omitted.
the underlying idea is that the state with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense,thereby subjecting him to embarrassment,expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity,as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.green united states,
we have come over the years to recognize that jury coercion poses a serious threat to jurors and defendants alike,and that the accused interest in a single proceeding must sometimes yield to the public interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments,wade,at and we have therefore carved out exceptions to the rule.but the exceptions are narrow.for a mistrial to be granted at the prosecutor request,the prosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar.his burden is a heavy one.washington,at.a judge who acts sua sponte in declaring a mistrial must similarly make sure,and must enable a reviewing court to confirm,that there is a manifest necessity to deprive the defendant of his valued right.ibid.
in this case,the trial judge did not meet that burden.the record suggests that she discharged the jury without considering any less extreme courses of action,and the record makes quite clear that she did not fully appreciate the scope or significance of the ancient right at stake.the michigan supreme court decision rejecting reginald lett double jeopardy claim was just as clearly in error.
no one disputes that a genuinely deadlocked jury is the classic basis for declaring a mistrial or that such declaration,under our doctrine,does not preclude reprosecution,at what is disputed in this case is whether the trial judge took adequate care to ensure the jury was genuinely deadlocked.a long line of precedents from this court establishes the governing legal principle s,williams taylor,for resolving this question.although the court acknowledges these precedents,ante,at,it minimizes the heavy burden we have placed on trial courts.
the fountainhead decision is united states perez,wheat.illinois somerville,writing for a unanimous court,justice story articulated a manifest necessity standard that continues to govern the double jeopardy analysis for mistrial orders 
we think,that in all cases of this nature,the law has invested courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict,whenever,in their opinion,taking all the circumstances into consideration,there is a manifest necessity for the act,or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.they are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject and it is impossible to define all the circumstances,which would render it proper to interfere.to be sure,the power ought to be used with the greatest caution,under urgent circumstances,and for very plain and obvious causes and,in capital cases especially,courts should be extremely careful how they interfere with any of the chances of life,in favour of the prisoner.but,after all,they have the right to order the discharge and the security which the public have for the faithful,sound,and conscientious exercise of this discretion,rests,in this,as in other cases,upon the responsibility of the judges,under their oaths of office.united states perez,wheat.
this passage,too,is worthy of repetition,because in it the perez court struck a careful balance.the court established the authority of trial judges to discharge the jury prior to verdict,but in recognition of the novelty and potential injustice of the practice,the court subjected that authority to several constraints the judge may not declare a mistrial unless there is a manifest necessity for the act or the ends of public justice so require and in determining whether such conditions exist,the judge must exercise sound discretion,conscientious ness,and the greatest caution,reserving the discharge power for urgent circumstances and very plain and obvious causes.ibid.what exact circumstances and causes would meet that bar,the court declined to specify.recognizing that trial proceedings may raise innumerable complications,so that it is impossible to define in advance all of the possible grounds for interfere nce,the court set forth general standards for judicial conduct rather than categorical rules for specific classes of situations.ibid.
the seeds of our entire jurisprudence on the permissibility of retrial following an initial mistrial are packed into this one passage.later courts have fleshed out perez,without making significant innovations or additions.justice story formulation has been quoted over and over again to provide guidance in the decision of a wide variety of cases,washington,at,and it has been consistently adhered to by this court in subsequent decisions,somerville,at.
thus,we have repeatedly reaffirmed that the power to discharge the jury prior to verdict should be reserved for extraordinary and striking circumstances,downum united states,internal quotation marks omitted that the trial judge may not take this weighty step,somerville,at,unless and until he has scrupulous ly assessed the situation and take n care to assure himself that it warrants action on his part foreclosing the defendant from a potentially favorable judgment by the tribunal,united states jorn,plurality opinion that,to exercise sound discretion,the judge may not act irrationally,irresponsibly,or precipitately but must instead act deliberately and careful ly,washington,at,and that,in view of the elusive nature of the problem,mechanical rules are no substitute in the double jeopardy mistrial context for the sensitive application of general standards,jorn,at plurality opinion the governing legal principles in this area are just that principles and their application to any particular set of facts entails an element of judgment.
as the court emphasizes,we have also repeatedly reaffirmed that trial judges have considerable leeway in determining whether the jury is deadlocked,that they are not bound to use specific procedures or to make specific findings,and that reviewing courts must accord broad deference to their decisions.ante,at.but the reviewing court still has an important role to play the application of deference does not,of course,end the inquiry.washington,at.in order to ensure that the defendant constitutional interest is adequately protected,reviewing courts have an obligation to satisfy themselves that,in the words of justice story,the trial judge exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.ibid.if the record reveals that the trial judge has failed to exercise the sound discretion entrusted to him,the reason for deference by an appellate court disappears.at.and while trial judges need not follow any precise regimen to facilitate appellate review,they must at least take care to ensure that t he basis for a mistrial order is adequately disclosed by the record.at.
our precedents contain examples of judicial action on both sides of the line.we have,for instance,allowed a second trial when the jurors in the first trial,after hours of deliberation,announced in open court that they were unable to agree,and no specific and traversable fact s called their deadlock into question.logan united states.we have likewise permitted reprosecution when the initial judge heard extended argument from both parties on the mistrial motion,acted with evident concern for the possible double jeopardy consequences of an erroneous ruling,and accorded careful consideration to the defendant interest in having the trial concluded in a single proceeding.washington,at.
on the other hand,we have barred retrial when the first judge acted abruptly,cutting off the prosecutor in midstream and discharging the jury without giving the parties an opportunity to object.jorn,at plurality opinion see also somerville,at characterizing jorn judge actions as erratic and we have opined that,while trial judges have considerable leeway in deciding whether to discharge the jury,w e resolve any doubt in favor of the liberty of the citizen,rather than exercise what would be an unlimited,uncertain,and arbitrary judicial discretion.downum,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the court accurately describes the events leading up to this trial judge declaration of mistrial,ante,at,but it glides too quickly over a number of details that,taken together,show her decisionmaking was neither careful nor well considered.if the manifest necessity and sound discretion standards are to have any force,we must demand more from our trial courts.
it is probably fair to say that this trial was not especially complex,ante,at,but neither was it a trivial affair.lett was charged with the most serious of crimes,murder,as well as possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.he faced a potential sentence of life imprisonment if convicted.seventeen witnesses provided testimony over the course of calendar days.see supp,ed see also,at discussing piecemeal fashion in which evidence was presented to the jury.
the jury first period of deliberation on thursday afternoon lasted less than minutes.the jury likely spent that brief session doing little more than electing a foreperson.people lett,cavanagh,dissenting.the jury deliberated a few more hours on friday morning prior to discharge.during that time,it sent the trial court seven notes.most were inconsequential,routine queries.the first note on friday morning raised a concern about the jurors voice levels,letter from mccowan to clerk of court,but nothing in the record relates this concern to the substance or tenor of their discussion.at,the jury sent the fateful missive,asking what if we ca agree m istrial r etrial w hat ibid.seconds later,still at,the jury sent another note what about lunch ibid.
at,the trial judge initiated a colloquy with the foreperson that concluded in the mistrial declaration.see ante,at reproducing transcript of colloquy.even accounting for the imprecision of oral communication,the judge made an inordinate number of logical and legal missteps during this short exchange.somerville,at critiquing erratic mistrial inquiry.it does not take much exegetical skill to spot them.
the judge began by stating i received your note asking me what if you ca agree and i have to conclude from that that that is your situation at this time.ante,at.this conclu sion was a non sequitur.the note asked what would happen if the jury could not agree it gave no indication that the jury had already reached an irrevocable impasse.the judge ignored the request for information that the note actually contained.instead,she announced that deadlock was the jury situation at this time,thereby prejudging the question she had ostensibly summoned the foreperson to probe namely,whether the jury was in fact deadlocked.
the judge continued i need to ask you if the jury is deadlocked in other words,is there a disagreement as to the verdict ante,at.as the federal court of appeals observed,this question improperly conflated deadlock with mere disagreement.fed.appx.deadlock is a condition or situation in which it is impossible to proceed or act a complete standstill.oxford english dictionary ed.disagreement among jurors is perfectly normal and does not come close to approaching the imperious necessity we have required for their discharge.downum,at.
the trial judge then modulated her inquiry do you believe the jury is hopelessly deadlocked ante,at.the foreperson was in the midst of replying,the majority of us do believe that,when the judge appears to have cut her off.ibid.one can not fault the trial judge for wanting to preserve the secrecy of jury deliberations,supp,at,but two aspects of the foreperson truncated reply are notable.first,it tends to show that the foreperson did not feel prepared to declare definitively that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked.ibid.if she had been so prepared,then it is hard to see why she would begin her response with a descriptive account of the majority viewpoint.
second,the foreperson reply suggests the jury may have been leaning toward acquittal.admittedly,this is crude speculation,but it is entirely possible that the foreperson was in the process of saying,the majority of us do believe that he guilty.or the majority of us do believe that there is sufficient evidence to prove one of the counts.on retrial,lett was convicted on both counts.these possibilities are,i submit,linguistically more probable than something like the following the majority of us do believe that lett is guilty,whereas a minority of us believe that he is and we are hopelessly deadlocked on the matter.and they are logically far more probable than something along the lines of,the majority of us do believe that we will ever be able to reach a verdict,as the foreperson had been given no opportunity to poll her colleagues on this point.yet only such implausible endings could have supported a conclusion that it was manifestly necessary to discharge the jury 
the judge then steered the conversation back to the issue of deadlock,asking are you going to reach a unanimous verdict,or not ante,at.after the foreperson hesitated,the judge persisted yes or no ibid.the foreperson replied no,judge.ibid.two aspects of this interchange are also notable.first,the judge question,though very direct,was actually rather ambiguous,because it gave the foreperson no temporal or legal context within which to understand what was being asked.supp,at.the foreperson could have easily thought the judge meant,are you going to reach a unanimous verdict in the next hour or before the lunch recess or by the end of the day ibid.emphasis deleted.even if the foreperson assumed no time constraint,she could have easily thought the judge meant,are you,in your estimation,more likely than not to reach a unanimous verdict an affirmative answer to that question would likewise fall far short of manifest necessity.
second,the foreperson hesitation suggests a lack of confidence in her position.that alone ought to have called into question the propriety of a mistrial order.but the judge bore down and demanded an unqualified answer,yes or no.most of the time when we worry about judicial coercion of juries,we worry about judges pressuring them,in the manner,to keep deliberating until they return a verdict they may not otherwise have chosen.this judge exerted pressure so as to prevent the jury from reaching any verdict at all.in so doing,she cut off deliberations well before the point when it was clear they would no longer be fruitful.recall that prior to summoning the foreperson for their colloquy,the trial judge gave her no opportunity to consult with the other jurors on the matter that would be discussed.so,the foreperson had no solid basis for estimating the likelihood of deadlock.recall,as well,that almost immediately after sending the judge a note asking what would happen if they disagreed,the jury sent a note asking about lunch.plainly,this was a group that was prepared to go on with its work.
the judge then declared a mistrial on the spot.her entire exchange with the foreperson took three minutes,from to app.to pet.for cert.the entire jury deliberations took roughly four hours.the judge gave the parties no opportunity to comment on the foreperson remarks,much less on the question of mistrial.washington,at trial judge gave both defense counsel and the prosecutor full opportunity to explain their positions on the propriety of a mistrial fed.rule crim.proc.before ordering a mistrial,the court must give each defendant and the government an opportunity to comment on the propriety of the order,to state whether that party consents or objects,and to suggest alternatives just as soon as the judge declared a mistrial,she set a new pretrial date,discharged the jury,and concluded proceedings.by,everyone was free to take off for the weekend.app.to pet.for cert.
in addition to the remarkable hast e,washington,at,and inexplicabl e abrupt ness,fed,at,with which she acted,it is remarkable what the trial judge did not do.never did the trial judge consider alternatives or otherwise provide evidence that she exercised sound discretion.for example,the judge did not poll the jurors,give an instruction ordering further deliberations,query defense counsel about his thoughts on continued deliberations,or indicate on the record why a mistrial declaration was necessary.lett,at,at cavanagh,dissenting.nor did the judge invite any argument or input from the prosecutor,make any findings of fact or provide any statements illuminating her thought process,follow up on the foreperson final response,or give any evident consideration to the ends of public justice or the balance between the defendant rights and the state interests.the manner in which this discharge decision was made contravened standard guidelines the judge may not have had a constitutional obligation to take any one of the aforementioned measures,but she did have an obligation to exercise sound discretion and thus to assure h er self that the situation warrant ed action on h er part foreclosing the defendant from a potentially favorable judgment by the tribunal.jorn,at plurality opinion.
add all these factors up,and i fail to see how the trial judge exercised anything resembling sound discretion in declaring a mistrial,as we have defined that term.indeed,i fail to see how a record could disclose much less evidence of sound decisionmaking.within the realm of realistic,nonpretextual possibilities,this mistrial declaration was about as precipitate as one is liable to find.despite the multitude of cases involving mistrials that have arisen over the years,neither petitioner nor the court has been able to identify any in which such abrupt judicial action has been upheld.see tr.of oral arg.even the prosecutor felt compelled to acknowledge that the trial court decision to discharge the jury clearly was error.fed,at quoting postconviction hearing transcript.
the michigan supreme court contrary conclusion was unreasonable.the court suggested that an abuse of discretion should only be found when the result is so palpably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evidences not the exercise of will but perversity of will,not the exercise of judgment but defiance thereof.lett,at,at,quoting,waterbury headers.finding that the record in this case provides sufficient justification for the mistrial declaration,lett,at,at,the court concluded that the declaration constituted a permissible exercise of judicial discretion,at,at.the court listed,without explaining,several reasons for this conclusion.the jury had deliberated for at least four hours following a relatively short,and far from complex,trial it had sent out several notes over the course of its deliberations,including one that appears to indicate that its discussions may have been particularly heated the parties did not object to the mistrial order and,m ost important,the jury foreperson expressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a verdict.see ante,at reprising this list 
these reasons do not suffice to justify the mistrial order.four hours is not a long time for jury deliberations,particularly in a murder case.indeed,it would have been remarkable if the jurors could review the testimony of all the witnesses in the time they were given,let alone conclude that they were deadlocked.supp,at.the jury note pertaining to its volume level does not necessarily indicate anything about the heated ness,lett,at,at,of its discussion.t here is no other suggestion in the record that such was the case,and the trial judge did not draw that conclusion.supp,at.although it would have been preferable if lett had tried to lodge an objection,defense counsel was given no meaningful opportunity to do so the judge discharged the jury simultaneously with her mistrial order,counsel received no advance notice of either action,and he may not even have been informed of the content of the jury notes.see ante,at fed,at at no point before the actual declaration of the mistrial was it even mentioned on the record as a potential course of action by the court.the summary nature of the trial court actions rendered an objection both unlikely and meaningless internal quotation marks omitted.counsel failure to object is therefore legally irrelevant and,as detailed above,the foreperson remarks were far more equivocal and ambiguous,in context,than the michigan supreme court allowed.
the michigan supreme court defense of the trial court actions is thus weak on its own terms.it collapses entirely under the weight of the many defects in the trial court process,virtually all of which the court either overlooked or discounted.
the unreasonableness of the michigan supreme court decision is highlighted by the decisions of the three other courts that have addressed lett double jeopardy claim,each of which ruled in his favor,as well as the dissent filed by two michigan supreme court justices and the opinion of the state own prosecutor.this court decision unfortunately compounds the deleterious consequences of the michigan supreme court ruling.although the trial judge decision is entitled to great deference,it is not the place of a reviewing court to extract factoids from the record in an attempt to salvage a bad decision.supp,at.
