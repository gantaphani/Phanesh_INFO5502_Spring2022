federal habeas courts generally refuse to hear claims defaulted in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule.coleman thompson.state rules count as adequate if they are firmly established and regularly followed.walker martin,internal quotation marks omitted.like all states,california requires criminal defendants to raise available claims on direct appeal.under the dixon bar,a defendant procedurally defaults a claim raised for the first time on state collateral review if he could have raised it earlier on direct appeal.see in re dixon,cal.yet,in this case,the ninth circuit held that the dixon bar is inadequate to bar federal habeas review.because california procedural bar is longstanding,and shared by habeas courts across the nation,this court now summarily reverses the ninth circuit judgment.
respondent donna kay lee and her boyfriend paul carasi stabbed to death carasi mother and his.a california jury convicted the pair of two counts each of murder.carasi received a death sentence,and lee received a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.in june,lee unsuccessfully raised four claims on direct appeal.after the california appellate courts affirmed,lee skipped state postconviction review and filed the federal habeas petition at issue.see a.the petition raised mostly new claims that lee failed to raise on direct appeal.because lee had not exhausted available remedies,however,the district court temporarily stayed federal proceedings to allow lee to pursue her new claims in a state habeas petition.the california supreme court denied lee petition in a summary order citing dixon.
having exhausted state remedies,lee returned to federal court to litigate her federal habeas petition.the district court dismissed her new claims as procedurally defaulted.then,for the first time on appeal,lee challenged the dixon bar adequacy.in her brief,lee presented a small sample of the california supreme court state habeas denials on a single day about six months after her default.lee claimed that out of the summary denials on december,the court failed to cite dixon in cases where it should have been applied.the court instead denied the nine petitions without any citation at all.in lee view,these missing citations proved that the california courts inconsistently applied the dixon bar.without evaluating this evidence,the ninth circuit reversed and remanded to permit the warden to submit evidence to the contrary,and for consideration by the district court in the first instance.lee jacquez,fed.appx.
on remand,the warden submitted a study analyzing more than summary habeas denials during a nearly period around the time of lee procedural default.from august to june,the study showed,the california supreme court cited dixon in approximately of all denials more than times.in light of this evidence,the district court held that the dixon bar is adequate.
the ninth circuit again reversed.lee jacquez.lee sample proved the dixon bar inadequacy,the court held,because the failure to cite dixon where dixon applies reflects its irregular application.at.the general citation rate proved nothing,the court reasoned,because the warden d id not purport to show to how many cases the dixon bar should have been applied.at.in the ninth circuit view,without this baseline number the warden study was entirely insufficient to prove dixon adequacy,at.
the ninth circuit decision profoundly misapprehends what makes a state procedural bar adequate.that question is a matter of federal law.lee kemna.to qualify as an adequate procedural ground,capable of barring federal habeas review,a state rule must be firmly established and regularly followed.martin,supra,at quoting beard kindler.
california dixon bar satisfies both adequacy criteria.it is firmly established because,decades before lee june procedural default,the california supreme court warned defendants in plain terms that,absent special circumstances,habeas will not lie where the claimed errors could have been,but were not,raised upon a timely appeal from a judgment of conviction.dixon,supra,at,at.and the california supreme court eliminated any arguable ambiguity surrounding this bar by reaffirming dixon in two cases decided before lee default.see in re harris,cal,in re robbins,cal,and,and.
the california supreme court repeated dixon citations also prove that the bar is regularly followed.martin recently held that another california procedural bar a rule requiring prisoners to file state habeas petitions promptly met that requirement because e ach year,the california supreme court summarily denies hundreds of habeas petitions by citing the timeliness rule,at.the same goes for dixon.nine purportedly missing dixon citations from lee sample of summary orders hardly support an inference of inconsistency.see dugger adams,holding that the florida supreme court applied its similar procedural bar consistently and regularly despite address ing the merits in several cases raising new claims on postconviction review indeed,all nine orders in that sample were denials.none ignored the dixon bar to grant relief,so there is no sign of inconsistency.
nor is california rule unique.federal and state habeas courts across the country follow the same rule as dixon.the general rule in federal habeas cases is that a defendant who fails to raise a claim on direct appeal is barred from raising the claim on collateral review.oregon.likewise,state postconviction remedies generally may not be used to litigate claims which were or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal.wilkes,state postconviction remedies and relief handbook,ed.it appears that every state shares this procedural bar in some form.see brief for state of alabama et as amici curiae,collecting citations.for such and ubiquitous rules,it takes more than a few outliers to show inadequacy.federal habeas courts must not lightly disregard state procedural rules that are substantially similar to those to which we give full force in our own courts.kindler,at.and it would be e ven stranger to do so with respect to rules in place in nearly every state.ibid.nothing suggests,moreover,that california courts apply the dixon bar in a way that disfavors federal claims.the court therefore holds that it qualifies as adequate to bar federal habeas review.
the ninth circuit contrary reasoning is unpersuasive and inconsistent with this court precedents.applying the dixon bar may be a straightforward or mechanica l task for state courts,at.but simplicity does not imply that missing citations reflect inconsistency.to begin with,since the dixon bar has several exceptions,see robbins,supra,at,and,at,and,the california supreme court can hardly be faulted for failing to cite dixon whenever a petitioner raises a claim that he could have raised on direct appeal.
more importantly,california courts need not address procedural default before reaching the merits,so the purportedly missing citations show nothing.bell cone,per curiam declining to address the warden argument lambrix singletary,explaining that j udicial economy might counsel bypassing a question if the merits were easily resolvable against the habeas petitioner ordinarily,procedural default is not a jurisdictional matter.trest cain.as a result,the appropriate order of analysis for each case remains within the state courts discretion.such discretion will often lead to seeming inconsistencies.martin,at,and.but that superficial tension does not make a procedural bar inadequate.a state procedural bar may count as an adequate and independent ground for denying a federal habeas petition even if the state court had discretion to reach the merits despite the default.at see kindler,supra,at.
the ninth circuit attempt to get around martin and kindler fails.the court of appeals distinguished those cases on the ground that california dixon bar is mandatory rather than discretionary because it involves a general rule,notwithstanding exceptions that might involve discretion,at.the court assumes,without deciding,that this description is accurate and the dixon bar exceptions leave some room for discretion.even so,there is little d
