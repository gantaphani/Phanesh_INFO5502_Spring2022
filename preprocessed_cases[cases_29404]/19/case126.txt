respondent frye was charged with driving with a revoked license.because he had been convicted of the same offense three times before,he was charged,under missouri law,with a felony carrying a maximum prison term.the prosecutor sent frye counsel a letter,offering two possible plea bargains,including an offer to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and to recommend,with a guilty plea,a sentence.counsel did not convey the offers to frye,and they expired.less than a week before frye preliminary hearing,he was again arrested for driving with a revoked license.he subsequently pleaded guilty with no underlying plea agreement and was sentenced to three years in prison.seeking postconviction relief in state court,he alleged his counsel failure to inform him of the earlier plea offers denied him the effective assistance of counsel,and he testified that he would have pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor had he known of the offer.the court denied his motion,but the missouri appellate court reversed,holding that frye met both of the requirements for showing a sixth amendment violation under strickland washington.specifically,the court found that defense counsel had been ineffective in not communicating the plea offers to frye and concluded that frye had shown that counsel deficient performance caused him prejudice because he pleaded guilty to a felony instead of a misdemeanor.
the sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel extends to the consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected.that right applies to all critical stages of the criminal proceedings.montejo louisiana.hill lockhart,established that strickland test governs claims in the plea bargain context.there,the defendant had alleged that his counsel had given him inadequate advice about his plea,but he failed to show that he would have proceeded to trial had he received the proper advice,at.in padilla kentucky,where a plea offer was set aside because counsel had misinformed the defendant of its immigration consequences,this court made clear that the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical stage for purposes,at,and rejected the argument made by the state in this case that a knowing and voluntary plea supersedes defense counsel errors.the state attempts to distinguish hill and padilla from the instant case.it notes that hill and padilla concerned whether there was ineffective assistance leading to acceptance of a plea offer,a process involving a formal court appearance with the defendant and all counsel present,while no formal court proceedings are involved when a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected and it insists that there is no right to receive a plea offer in any event.thus,the state contends,it is unfair to subject it to the consequences of defense counsel inadequacies when the opportunities for a full and fair trial,or for a later guilty plea albeit on less favorable terms,are preserved.while these contentions are neither illogical nor without some persuasive force,they do not suffice to overcome the simple reality that percent of federal convictions and percent of state convictions are the result of guilty pleas.plea bargains have become so central to today criminal justice system that defense counsel must meet responsibilities in the plea bargain process to render the adequate assistance of counsel that the sixth amendment requires at critical stages of the criminal process.
as a general rule,defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal prosecution offers to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused.any exceptions to this rule need not be addressed here,for the offer was a formal one with a fixed expiration date.standards for prompt communication and consultation recommended by the american bar association and adopted by numerous state and federal courts,though not determinative,serve as important guides.the prosecution and trial courts may adopt measures to help ensure against late,frivolous,or fabricated claims.first,a formal offer terms and processing can be documented.second,states may require that all offers be in writing.third,formal offers can be made part of the record at any subsequent plea proceeding or before trial to ensure that a defendant has been fully advised before the later proceedings commence.here,as the result of counsel deficient performance,the offers lapsed.under strickland,the question then becomes what,if any,prejudice resulted from the breach of duty.
to show prejudice where a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected because of counsel deficient performance,defendants must demonstrate a reasonable probability both that they would have accepted the more favorable plea offer had they been afforded effective assistance of counsel and that the plea would have been entered without the prosecution canceling it or the trial court refusing to accept it,if they had the authority to exercise that discretion under state law.this application of strickland to uncommunicated,lapsed pleas does not alter hill standard,which requires a defendant complaining that ineffective assistance led him to accept a plea offer instead of going to trial to show a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.at.hill correctly applies in the context in which it arose,but it does not provide the sole means for demonstrating prejudice arising from counsel deficient performance during plea negotiations.because frye argues that with effective assistance he would have accepted an earlier plea offer as opposed to entering an open plea,strickland inquiry into whether the result of the proceeding would have been different,at,requires looking not at whether the defendant would have proceeded to trial but at whether he would have accepted the earlier plea offer.he must also show that,if the prosecution had the discretion to cancel the plea agreement or the trial court had the discretion to refuse to accept it,there is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution nor the trial court would have prevented the offer from being accepted or implemented.this further showing is particularly important because a defendant has no right to be offered a plea,see weatherford bursey,nor a federal right that the judge accept it,santobello new york.missouri,among other states,appears to give the prosecution some discretion to cancel a plea agreement and the federal rules of criminal procedure,some state rules,including missouri,and this court precedents give trial courts some leeway to accept or reject plea agreements.
applying these standards here,the missouri court correctly concluded that counsel failure to inform frye of the written plea offer before it expired fell below an objective reasonableness standard,but it failed to require frye to show that the plea offer would have been adhered to by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court.these matters should be addressed by the missouri appellate court in the first instance.given that frye new offense for driving without a license occurred a week before his preliminary hearing,there is reason to doubt that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement or that the trial court would have accepted it unless they were required by state law to do so.

on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of missouri,western district 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
the sixth amendment,applicable to the states by the terms of the fourteenth amendment,provides that the accused shall have the assistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions.the right to counsel is the right to effective assistance of counsel.see strickland washington.this case arises in the context of claimed ineffective assistance that led to the lapse of a prosecution offer of a plea bargain,a proposal that offered terms more lenient than the terms of the guilty plea entered later.the initial question is whether the constitutional right to counsel extends to the negotiation and consideration of plea offers that lapse or are rejected.if there is a right to effective assistance with respect to those offers,a further question is what a defendant must demonstrate in order to show that prejudice resulted from counsel deficient performance.other questions relating to ineffective assistance with respect to plea offers,including the question of proper remedies,are considered in a second case decided today.see lafler cooper,post,at.
in august,respondent galin frye was charged with driving with a revoked license.frye had been convicted for that offense on three other occasions,so the state of missouri charged him with a class d felony,which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of four years.see.stat.
on november,the prosecutor sent a letter to frye counsel offering a choice of two plea bargains.app.the prosecutor first offered to recommend a sentence if there was a guilty plea to the felony charge,without a recommendation regarding probation but with a recommendation that frye serve days in jail as shock time.the second offer was to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor and,if frye pleaded guilty to it,to recommend a sentence.the misdemeanor charge of driving with a revoked license carries a maximum term of imprisonment of one year.app.the letter stated both offers would expire on december.frye attorney did not advise frye that the offers had been made.the offers expired,at.
frye preliminary hearing was scheduled for january.on december,less than a week before the hearing,frye was again arrested for driving with a revoked license.app,at.at the january hearing,frye waived his right to a preliminary hearing on the charge arising from the august arrest.he pleaded not guilty at a subsequent arraignment but then changed his plea to guilty.there was no underlying plea agreement.app.the state trial court accepted frye guilty plea,at.the prosecutor recommended a sentence,made no recommendation regarding probation,and requested days shock time in jail,at.the trial judge sentenced frye to three years in prison,at.
frye filed for postconviction relief in state court,at.he alleged his counsel failure to inform him of the prosecution plea offer denied him the effective assistance of counsel.at an evidentiary hearing,frye testified he would have entered a guilty plea to the misdemeanor had he known about the offer,at.
a state court denied the postconviction motion,at,but the missouri court of appeals reversed.it determined that frye met both of the requirements for showing a sixth amendment violation under strickland.first,the court determined frye counsel performance was deficient because the record is void of any evidence of any effort by trial counsel to communicate the offer to frye during the offer window.at,emphasis deleted.the court next concluded frye had shown his counsel deficient performance caused him prejudice because frye pled guilty to a felony instead of a misdemeanor and was subject to a maximum sentence of four years instead of one year.at.
to implement a remedy for the violation,the court deemed frye guilty plea withdrawn and remanded to allow frye either to insist on a trial or to plead guilty to any offense the prosecutor deemed it appropriate to charge.this court granted certiorari.
it is well settled that the right to the effective assistance of counsel applies to certain steps before trial.the sixth amendment guarantees a defendant the right to have counsel present at all critical stages of the criminal proceedings.montejo louisiana,quoting united states wade.critical stages include arraignments,postindictment interrogations,postindictment lineups,and the entry of a guilty plea.see hamilton alabama,arraignment massiah united states,postindictment interrogation wade,supra postindictment lineup argersinger hamlin,guilty plea.
with respect to the right to effective counsel in plea negotiations,a proper beginning point is to discuss two cases from this court considering the role of counsel in advising a client about a plea offer and an ensuing guilty plea hill lockhart,and padilla kentucky.
hill established that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in the plea bargain context are governed by the test set forth in strickland.see hill,supra,at.as noted above,in frye case,the missouri court of appeals,applying the two part test of strickland,determined first that defense counsel had been ineffective and second that there was resulting prejudice.
in hill,the decision turned on the second part of the strickland test.there,a defendant who had entered a guilty plea claimed his counsel had misinformed him of the amount of time he would have to serve before he became eligible for parole.but the defendant had not alleged that,even if adequate advice and assistance had been given,he would have elected to plead not guilty and proceed to trial.thus,the court found that no prejudice from the inadequate advice had been shown or alleged.hill,supra,at.
in padilla,the court again discussed the duties of counsel in advising a client with respect to a plea offer that leads to a guilty plea.padilla held that a guilty plea,based on a plea offer,should be set aside because counsel misinformed the defendant of the immigration consequences of the conviction.the court made clear that the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes of the sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.at slip,at.it also rejected the argument made by petitioner in this case that a knowing and voluntary plea supersedes errors by defense counsel.brief for respondent in padilla kentucky,arguing sixth amendment assurance of effective assistance does not extend to collateral aspects of the prosecution because knowledge of the consequences that are collateral to the guilty plea is not a prerequisite to the entry of a knowing and intelligent plea 
in the case now before the court the state,as petitioner,points out that the legal question presented is different from that in hill and padilla.in those cases the claim was that the prisoner plea of guilty was invalid because counsel had provided incorrect advice pertinent to the plea.in the instant case,by contrast,the guilty plea that was accepted,and the plea proceedings concerning it in court,were all based on accurate advice and information from counsel.the challenge is not to the advice pertaining to the plea that was accepted but rather to the course of legal representation that preceded it with respect to other potential pleas and plea offers.
to give further support to its contention that the instant case is in a category different from what the court considered in hill and padilla,the state urges that there is no right to a plea offer or a plea bargain in any event.see weatherford bursey.it claims frye therefore was not deprived of any legal benefit to which he was entitled.under this view,any wrongful or mistaken action of counsel with respect to earlier plea offers is beside the point.
the state is correct to point out that hill and padilla concerned whether there was ineffective assistance leading to acceptance of a plea offer,a process involving a formal court appearance with the defendant and all counsel present.before a guilty plea is entered the defendant understanding of the plea and its consequences can be established on the record.this affords the state substantial protection against later claims that the plea was the result of inadequate advice.at the plea entry proceedings the trial court and all counsel have the opportunity to establish on the record that the defendant understands the process that led to any offer,the advantages and disadvantages of accepting it,and the sentencing consequences or possibilities that will ensue once a conviction is entered based upon the plea.see,fed.rule crim.proc.sup.rule.hill and padilla both illustrate that,nevertheless,there may be instances when claims of ineffective assistance can arise after the conviction is entered.still,the state,and the trial court itself,have had a substantial opportunity to guard against this contingency by establishing at the plea entry proceeding that the defendant has been given proper advice or,if the advice received appears to have been inadequate,to remedy that deficiency before the plea is accepted and the conviction entered.
when a plea offer has lapsed or been rejected,however,no formal court proceedings are involved.this underscores that the process is often in flux,with no clear standards or timelines and with no judicial supervision of the discussions between prosecution and defense.indeed,discussions between client and defense counsel are privileged.so the prosecution has little or no notice if something may be amiss and perhaps no capacity to intervene in any event.and,as noted,the state insists there is no right to receive a plea offer.for all these reasons,the state contends,it is unfair to subject it to the consequences of defense counsel inadequacies,especially when the opportunities for a full and fair trial,or,as here,for a later guilty plea albeit on less favorable terms,are preserved.
the state contentions are neither illogical nor without some persuasive force,yet they do not suffice to overcome a simple reality.percent of federal convictions and percent of state convictions are the result of guilty pleas.see of justice,bureau of justice statistics,sourcebook of criminal justice statistics online,table,all internet materials as visited,and available in clerk of court case file of justice,bureau of justice statistics,rosenmerkel,durose,farole,felony sentences in state courts,tables,padilla,supra,at slip,at recognizing pleas account for nearly of all criminal convictions.the reality is that plea bargains have become so central to the administration of the criminal justice system that defense counsel have responsibilities in the plea bargain process,responsibilities that must be met to render the adequate assistance of counsel that the sixth amendment requires in the criminal process at critical stages.because ours is for the most part a system of pleas,not a system of trials,lafler,post,at,it is insufficient simply to point to the guarantee of a fair trial as a backstop that inoculates any errors in the pretrial process.to a large extent horse trading between prosecutor and defense counsel determines who goes to jail and for how long.that is what plea bargaining is.it is not some adjunct to the criminal justice system it is the criminal justice system.scott stuntz,plea bargaining as contract,yale.see also barkow,separation of powers and the criminal law,stan,defendants who do take their case to trial and lose receive longer sentences than even congress or the prosecutor might think appropriate,because the longer sentences exist on the books largely for bargaining purposes.this often results in individuals who accept a plea bargain receiving shorter sentences than other individuals who are less morally culpable but take a chance and go to trial footnote omitted.in today criminal justice system,therefore,the negotiation of a plea bargain,rather than the unfolding of a trial,is almost always the critical point for a defendant.
to note the prevalence of plea bargaining is not to criticize it.the potential to conserve valuable prosecutorial resources and for defendants to admit their crimes and receive more favorable terms at sentencing means that a plea agreement can benefit both parties.in order that these benefits can be realized,however,criminal defendants require effective counsel during plea negotiations.anything less might deny a defendant effective representation by counsel at the only stage when legal aid and advice would help him.massiah,at quoting spano new york,douglas,concurring.
the inquiry then becomes how to define the duty and responsibilities of defense counsel in the plea bargain process.this is a difficult question.the art of negotiation is at least as nuanced as the art of trial advocacy and it presents questions farther removed from immediate judicial supervision.premo moore,slip,at.bargaining is,by its nature,defined to a substantial degree by personal style.the alternative courses and tactics in negotiation are so individual that it may be neither prudent nor practicable to try to elaborate or define detailed standards for the proper discharge of defense counsel participation in the process.ibid.
this case presents neither the necessity nor the occasion to define the duties of defense counsel in those respects,however.here the question is whether defense counsel has the duty to communicate the terms of a formal offer to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may result in a lesser sentence,a conviction on lesser charges,or both.
this court now holds that,as a general rule,defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused.any exceptions to that rule need not be explored here,for the offer was a formal one with a fixed expiration date.when defense counsel allowed the offer to expire without advising the defendant or allowing him to consider it,defense counsel did not render the effective assistance the constitution requires.
though the standard for counsel performance is not determined solely by reference to codified standards of professional practice,these standards can be important guides.the american bar association recommends defense counsel promptly communicate and explain to the defendant all plea offers made by the prosecuting attorney,aba standards for criminal justice,pleas of guilty a ed,and this standard has been adopted by numerous state and federal courts over the last years.see,davie state,cottle state,so,becton hun,harris state,lloyd state,united states rodriguez rodriguez,per curiam pham united states,united states ex rel.caruso zelinsky,griffin united states,johnson duckworth,united states blaylock,diaz united states.the standard for prompt communication and consultation is also set out in state bar professional standards for attorneys.see.rule regulating bar.rule conduct.rule conduct.sup.rule,rule conduct.rule conduct.rule conduct.
the prosecution and the trial courts may adopt some measures to help ensure against late,frivolous,or fabricated claims after a later,less advantageous plea offer has been accepted or after a trial leading to conviction with resulting harsh consequences.first,the fact of a formal offer means that its terms and its processing can be documented so that what took place in the negotiation process becomes more clear if some later inquiry turns on the conduct of earlier pretrial negotiations.second,states may elect to follow rules that all offers must be in writing,again to ensure against later misunderstandings or fabricated charges.see.rule b any plea offer to be made by the prosecutor shall be in writing and forwarded to the defendant attorney third,formal offers can be made part of the record at any subsequent plea proceeding or before a trial on the merits,all to ensure that a defendant has been fully advised before those further proceedings commence.at least one state often follows a similar procedure before trial.see brief for national association of criminal defense lawyers et as amici curiae discussing hearings in arizona conducted pursuant to state donald,app.see also.rules b,c requiring the prosecutor and defense counsel to discuss the case prior to the conference including any plea offers and to report on these discussions in open court with the defendant present in re alvernaz,cal,encouraging parties to memorialize in some fashion prior to trial the fact that a plea bargain offer was made,and that the defendant was advised of the offer and its precise terms,and the defendant response to the plea bargain offer brief for center on the administration of criminal law,new york university scho
