after being charged with the felony offense of distributing marijuana,petitioner tony henderson was required as a condition of his bail to turn over firearms that he lawfully owned.henderson ultimately pleaded guilty,and,as a felon,was prohibited under g from possessing his or any other firearms.henderson therefore asked the federal bureau of investigation,which had custody of his firearms,to transfer them to his friend.but the agency refused to do so.henderson then filed a motion in federal district court seeking to transfer his firearms,but the court denied the motion on the ground that henderson requested transfer would give him constructive possession of the firearms in violation of g.the eleventh circuit affirmed.
held a transfer of a felon lawfully owned firearms from government custody to a third party is not barred by g if the court is satisfied that the recipient will not give the felon control over the firearms,so that he could either use them or direct their use.federal courts have equitable authority to order law enforcement to return property obtained during the course of a criminal proceeding to its rightful owner.section g,however,bars a court from ordering guns returned to a like henderson,because that would place the owner in violation of the law.and because g bans constructive as well as actual possession,it also prevents a court from ordering the transfer of a felon guns to someone willing to give the felon access to them or to accede to the felon instructions about their future use.
the government goes further,arguing that g prevents all transfers to a third party,no matter how independent of the felon influence,unless that recipient is a licensed firearms dealer or other third party who will sell the guns on the open market.but that view conflates possession,which g prohibits,with an owner right merely to alienate his property,which it does not.after all,the government reading of g would prohibit a felon from disposing of his firearms even when he would lack any control over and thus not possess them before,during,or after the disposition.that reading would also extend g scope far beyond its purpose preventing a felon like henderson from disposing of his firearms,even in ways that guarantee he never uses them again,does nothing to advance the statute goal of keeping firearms away from felons.finally,the government insistence that a felon can not select a recipient over whom he exercises no influence fits poorly with its concession that a felon may select a firearms dealer or third party to sell his guns.the government reading of g is thus overbroad.
accordingly,a court may approve the transfer of a felon guns consistently with g if,but only if,the recipient will not grant the felon control over those weapons.one way to ensure that result is to order that the guns be turned over to a firearms dealer,himself independent of the felon control,for subsequent sale on the open market.but that is not the only option a court,with proper assurances from the recipient,may also grant a felon request to transfer his guns to a person who expects to maintain custody of them.either way,once a court is satisfied that the transferee will not allow the felon to exert any influence over the firearms,the court has equitable power to accommodate the felon transfer request.

tony henderson,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
government agencies sometimes come into possession of firearms lawfully owned by individuals facing serious criminal charges.if convicted,such a person can not recover his guns because a federal statute,g,prohibits any felon from possessing firearms.in this case,we consider what g allows a court to do when a felon instead seeks the transfer of his guns to either a firearms dealer for future sale on the open market or some other third party.we hold that g does not bar such a transfer unless it would allow the felon to later control the guns,so that he could either use them or direct their use.
the federal government charged petitioner tony henderson,then a border patrol agent,with the felony offense of distributing marijuana.see a,b d.a magistrate judge required that henderson surrender all his firearms as a condition of his release on bail.henderson complied,and the federal bureau of investigation fbi took custody of the guns.soon afterward,henderson pleaded guilty to the distribution charge as a result of that conviction,g prevents him from legally repossessing his firearms.
following his release from prison,henderson asked the fbi to transfer the guns to robert rosier,a friend who had agreed to purchase them for an unspecified price.the fbi denied the request.in a letter to henderson,it explained that the release of the firearms to rosier would place you in violation of g,as it would amount to constructive possession of the guns.app.
henderson then returned to the court that had handled his criminal case to seek release of his firearms.invoking the court equitable powers,henderson asked for an order directing the fbi to transfer the guns either to his wife or to rosier.the district court denied the motion,concluding as the fbi had that henderson could not transfer the firearms or receive money from their sale without constructive ly possessi ng them in violation of g.md,app.to pet.for cert.the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit affirmed on the same ground,reasoning that granting henderson motion would amount to giving a felon constructive possession of his firearms.fed.appx,per curiam 
we granted certiorari,to resolve a circuit split over whether,as the courts below held,g categorically prohibits a court from approving a convicted felon request to transfer his firearms to another person we now vacate the decision below.
a federal court has equitable authority,even after a criminal proceeding has ended,to order a law enforcement agency to turn over property it has obtained during the case to the rightful owner or his designee.see,united states martinez,citing numerous appellate decisions to that effect tr.of oral arg.solicitor general agreeing.congress,however,may cabin that power in various ways.as relevant here,g makes it unlawful for any person convicted of a felony to possess in or affecting commerce any firearm or ammunition.that provision prevents a court from instructing an agency to return guns in its custody to a like henderson,because that would place him in violation of the law.the question here is how g affects a court authority to instead direct the transfer of such firearms to a third party.
section g proscribes possession alone,but covers possession in every form.by its terms,g does not prohibit a felon from owning firearms.rather,it interferes with a single incident of ownership one of the proverbial sticks in the bundle of property rights by preventing the felon from knowingly possessing his or another person guns.but that stick is a thick one,encompassing what the criminal law recognizes as actual and constructive possession alike,grenig,lee,federal jury practice and instructions,criminal,ed.hereinafter see national safe deposit stead,noting that in legal terminology the word possession is interchangeably used to describe both the actual and the constructive kinds.actual possession exists when a person has direct physical control over a thing.see black law dictionary ed.hereinafter black,at.constructive possession is established when a person,though lacking such physical custody,still has the power and intent to exercise control over the object.see black,at.section g thus prevents a felon not only from holding his firearm
