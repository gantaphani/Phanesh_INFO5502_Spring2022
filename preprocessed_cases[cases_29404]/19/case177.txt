founded in,enron corporation grew from its headquarters in houston,texas,into the seventh company in america.petitioner jeffrey skilling,a longtime enron officer,was enron chief executive officer from february until august,when he resigned.less than four months later,enron crashed into bankruptcy,and its stock plummeted in value.after an investigation uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up enron stock prices by overstating the company financial,the government prosecuted dozens of enron employees who participated in the scheme.in time,the government worked its way up the chain of command,indicting skilling and two other top enron executives.these three defendants,the indictment charged,engaged in a scheme to deceive investors about enron true financial performance by manipulating its publicly reported financial results and making false and misleading statements.count of the indictment charged skilling with,inter alia,conspiracy to commit wire fraud,by depriving enron and its shareholders of the intangible right of his honest services.skilling was also charged with over substantive counts of securities fraud,wire fraud,making false representations to enron auditors,and insider trading.
in november,skilling moved for a change of venue,contending that hostility toward him in houston,coupled with extensive pretrial publicity,had poisoned potential jurors.he submitted hundreds of news reports detailing enron downfall,as well as affidavits from experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in houston in comparison to other potential venues.the district court denied the motion,concluding that pretrial publicity did not warrant a presumption that skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in houston.despite incidents of intemperate commentary,the court observed,media coverage,on the whole,had been objective and unemotional,and the facts of the case were neither heinous nor sensational.moreover,the court asserted,effective voir dire would detect juror bias.
in the months before the trial,the court asked the parties for questions it might use to screen prospective jurors.rejecting the government sparer inquiries in favor of skilling more probing and specific questions,the court converted skilling submission,with slight modifications,into a,document.the questionnaire asked prospective jurors about their sources of news and exposure to publicity,beliefs concerning enron and what caused its collapse,opinions regarding the defendants and their possible guilt or innocence,and relationships to the company and to anyone affected by its demise.the court then mailed the questionnaire to prospective jurors and received responses from nearly all of them.it granted hardship exemptions to about individuals,and the parties,with the court approval,further winnowed the pool by excusing another for cause,hardship,or physical disability.the parties agreed to exclude,in particular,every prospective juror who said that a preexisting opinion about enron or the defendants would prevent her from being impartial.
in december,three weeks before the trial date,one of skilling,richard causey,pleaded guilty.skilling renewed his motion,arguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of causey guilty plea further tainted the jury pool.the court again declined to move the trial,ruling that the questionnaires and voir dire provided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury.the court also denied skilling request for voir dire on the ground that potential jurors were more forthcoming with judges than with lawyers.but the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask questions,agreed that venire members should be examined individually about pretrial publicity,and allotted the defendants jointly two extra peremptory challenges.
voir dire began in january.after questioning the venire as a group,the court examined prospective jurors individually,asking each about her exposure to news,the content of any stories that stood out in her mind,and any questionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible bias.the court then permitted each side to pose questions and ruled on the parties challenges for cause.ultimately,the court qualified prospective jurors,a number sufficient,allowing for peremptory challenges,to empanel jurors and alternates.after a trial,the jury found skilling guilty of counts,including the conspiracy charge,and not guilty of counts.
on appeal,skilling raised two arguments relevant here.first,he contended that pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevented him from obtaining a fair trial.second,he alleged that the jury improperly convicted him of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.as to the former,the fifth circuit initially determined that the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by enron collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice.stating,however,that the presumption is rebuttable,the court examined the voir dire,found it proper and thorough,and held that the district court had empaneled an impartial jury.the court of appeals also rejected skilling claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit fraud.it did not address skilling argument that the statute,if not interpreted to exclude his actions,should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague.
pretrial publicity and community prejudice did not prevent skilling from obtaining a fair trial.he did not establish that a presumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that tried him.
a the district court did not err in denying skilling requests for a venue transfer.
although the sixth amendment and art.iii,cl,provide for criminal trials in the state and district where the crime was committed,these prescriptions do not impede transfer of a proceeding to a different district if extraordinary local prejudice will prevent a fair trial.
the foundation precedent for the presumption of prejudice from which the fifth circuit analysis proceeded is rideau louisiana.wilbert rideau robbed a bank,kidnaped three bank employees,and killed one of them.police interrogated rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his confession,which,without his knowledge,was filmed and televised three times to large local audiences shortly before trial.after the louisiana trial court denied rideau motion,he was convicted,and the conviction was upheld on direct appeal.this court reversed.t o the tens of thousands of people who saw and heard it,the court explained,the interrogation in a very real sense was rideau trial at which he pleaded guilty.at.w ithout pausing to examine the voir dire,the court held that the kangaroo court proceedings trailing the televised confession violated due process,at.the court followed rideau in two other cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted criminal prosecutions.however,it later explained that those decisions can not be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to news accounts of the crime alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process.murphy florida.thus,prominence does not necessarily produce prejudice,and juror impartiality does not require ignorance.see,irvin dowd.a presumption of prejudice attends only the extreme case.
important differences separate skilling prosecution from those in which the court has presumed juror prejudice.first,the court has emphasized the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred.in contrast to the setting in rideau,for example,the record shows that houston is the nation fourth most populous city.given the large,diverse pool of residents eligible for jury duty,any suggestion that impartial individuals could not be empaneled in houston is hard to sustain.second,although news stories about skilling were not kind,they contained no blatantly prejudicial information such as rideau dramatically staged admission of guilt.third,unlike rideau and other cases in which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime,over four years elapsed between enron bankruptcy and skilling trial.although reporters covered news throughout this period,the decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years following enron collapse.finally,and of prime significance,skilling jury acquitted him of nine counts.similarly,earlier instituted prosecutions yielded no overwhelming victory for the government.it would be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors actions run counter to that presumption.
the fifth circuit presumed juror prejudice based primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of the media attention directed at enron.but pretrial publicity even pervasive,adverse publicity does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.nebraska press stuart.here,news stories about enron did not present the kind of vivid,unforgettable information the court has recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice,and houston size and diversity diluted the media impact.nor did enron sheer number of victims trigger a presumption.although the widespread community impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors connections to enron,the extensive screening questionnaire and voir dire yielded jurors whose links to enron were either nonexistent or attenuated.finally,while causey well publicized decision to plead guilty shortly before trial created a danger of juror prejudice,the district court took appropriate steps to mitigate that risk.
b no actual prejudice contaminated skilling jury.the court rejects skilling assertions that voir dire did not adequately detect and defuse juror prejudice and that several seated jurors were biased.
no formula dictates the necessary depth or breadth of voir dire.jury selection is particularly within the province of the trial judge.ristaino ross.when pretrial publicity is at issue,moreover,primary reliance on the judgment of the trial court makes especially good sense because the judge sits in the locale where the publicity is said to have had its effect and may base her evaluation on her own perception of the depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.virginia.the court considers the adequacy of jury selection in skilling case attentive to the respect due to determinations of juror impartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that impartiality.
skilling failed to show that his voir dire fell short of constitutional requirements.the process was insufficient,skilling maintains,because voir dire lasted only five hours,most of the district court questions were conclusory and failed adequately to probe jurors true feelings,and the court consistently took prospective jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair,no matter any other indications of bias.this court review of the record,however,yields a different appraisal.the district court initially screened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large part by skilling.that survey helped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served as a springboard for further questions voir dire thus was the culmination of a lengthy process.moreover,inspection of the questionnaires and voir dire of the seated jurors reveals that,notwithstanding the flaws skilling lists,the selection process secured jurors largely uninterested in publicity about enron and untouched by the corporation collapse.whatever community prejudice existed in houston generally,skilling jurors were not under its sway.relying on irvin dowd,at,skilling asserts the district court should not have accepted jurors promises of fairness.but a number of factors show that the district court had far less reason than the trial court in irvin to discredit jurors assurances of impartiality news stories about enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information rife in reports about leslie irvin rampage of robberies and murders houston shares little in common with the rural community in which irvin trial proceeded circulation figures for houston media sources were far lower than the saturation level recorded in irvin and skilling seated jurors exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown in irvin.in any event,the district court did not simply take venire members at their word.it questioned each juror individually to uncover concealed bias.this opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility,coupled with information from the questionnaires regarding jurors backgrounds,opinions,and news sources,gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service.
skilling allegation that several jurors were openly biased also fails.in reviewing such claims,the deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle a trial court findings of juror impartiality may be overturned only for manifest error.at.skilling,moreover,unsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for cause,strong evidence that he was convinced the other jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to his guilt.beck washington.a review of the record reveals no manifest error regarding the empaneling of jurors,and,each of whom indicated,inter alia,that he or she would be fair to skilling and would require the government to prove its case.four other jurors skilling claims he would have excluded with extra peremptory strikes,jurors,and,exhibited no signs of prejudice this court can discern.
section,which proscribes fraudulent deprivations of the intangible right of honest services,is properly confined to cover only bribery and kickback schemes.because skilling alleged misconduct entailed no bribe or kickback,it does not fall within the court confinement of proscription.
a to place skilling claim that is unconstitutionally vague in context,the court reviews the origin and subsequent application of the doctrine.
in a series of decisions beginning in the,the courts of appeals,one after another,interpreted the statute prohibition of any scheme or artifice to defraud to include deprivations not only of money or property,but also of intangible rights.see,shushan united states,which stimulated the development of the doctrine.unlike traditional fraud,in which the victim loss of money or property supplied the defendant gain,with one the mirror image of the other,the doctrine targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry.while the offender profited,the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of money or property instead,a third party,who had not been deceived,provided the enrichment.even if the scheme occasioned a money or property gain for the betrayed party,courts reasoned,actionable harm lay in the denial of that party right to the offender honest services.most often these cases involved bribery of public officials,but over time,the courts increasingly recognized that the doctrine applied to a private employee who breached his allegiance to his employer,often by accepting bribes or kickbacks.by,all courts of appeals had embraced the theory of fraud.
in,this court halted the development of the doctrine in mcnally united states,which held that the statute was limited in scope to the protection of property rights.if congress desires to go further,the court stated,it must speak more clearly.ibid.
congress responded the next year by enacting,which provides for the purposes of th e chapter of the code that prohibits,inter alia,mail fraud,and wire fraud,the term scheme or artifice to defraud includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.pp.
b section,properly confined to core cases,is not unconstitutionally vague.
to satisfy due process,a penal statute must define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.kolender lawson.the doctrine embraces these requirements.skilling contends that meets neither of the two essentials.but this court must,if possible,construe,not condemn,congress enactments.see,civil service comm letter carriers.alert to potential breadth,the courts of appeals have divided on how best to interpret the statute.uniformly,however,they have declined to throw out the statute as irremediably vague.this court agrees that should be construed rather than invalidated.
the court looks to the doctrine developed in cases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase the intangible right of honest services.there is no doubt that congress intended to refer to and incorporate the doctrine recognized in courts of appeals decisions before mcnally derailed the theory of fraud.congress,it bears emphasis,enacted on the heels of mcnally and drafted the statute using that decision terminology.see,at.
to preserve what congress certainly intended to cover,the court pares the body of precedent down to its core in the main,the cases involved fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who had not been deceived.in parsing the various decisions,the court acknowledges that skilling vagueness challenge has force,for decisions were not models of clarity or consistency.it has long been the court practice,however,before striking a federal statute as impermissibly vague,to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a limiting construction.see,hooper california.arguing against any limiting construction,skilling contends that it is impossible to identify a salvageable core because the cases are inconsistent and hopelessly unclear.this court rejected an argument of the same tenor in letter carriers,at.although some applications of the doctrine occasioned disagreement among the courts of appeals,these decisions do not cloud the fact that the vast majority of cases involved offenders who,in violation of a fiduciary duty,participated in bribery or kickback schemes.indeed,mcnally itself presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern,at.in view of this history,there is no doubt that congress intended to reach at least bribes and kickbacks.because reading the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct would raise vagueness concerns,the court holds that criminalizes only the core of the case law.
the government urges the court to go further by reading to proscribe another category of conduct undisclosed by a public official or private employee.neither of the government arguments in support of this position withstands close inspection.contrary to the first,mcnally itself did not center on nondisclosure of a conflicting financial interest,but rather involved a classic kickback scheme.see,at.reading to proscribe bribes and kickbacks and nothing more satisfies congress undoubted aim to reverse mcnally on its facts.nor is the court persuaded by the government argument that the cases constitute core applications of the doctrine.although the courts of appeals upheld convictions for some schemes,they reached no consensus on which schemes qualified.given the relative infrequency of those prosecutions and the intercircuit inconsistencies they produced,the court concludes that a reasonable limiting construction of must exclude this amorphous category of cases.further dispelling doubt on this point is the principle that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.cleveland united states.the court therefore resists the government less constrained construction of absent congress clear instruction otherwise.if congress desires to go further,the court reiterates,it must speak more clearly than it has.mcnally,at.
interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback schemes,is not unconstitutionally vague.a prohibition on fraudulently depriving another of one honest services by accepting bribes or kickbacks presents neither a nor an problem.see kolender,at.as to fair notice,it has always been clear that bribes and kickbacks constitute fraud,williams united states,and the statute mens rea requirement further blunts any notice concern,see,screws united states.as to arbitrary prosecutions,the court perceives no significant risk that the statute,as here interpreted,will be stretched out of shape.its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the case law,but also from federal statutes proscribing and defining similar crimes.
c skilling did not violate,as the court interprets the statute.the government charged skilling with conspiring to defraud enron shareholders by misrepresenting the company fiscal health to his own profit,but the government never alleged that he solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for making these misrepresentations.because the indictment alleged three objects of the conspiracy wire fraud,wire fraud,and securities fraud skilling conviction is flawed.see yates united states.this determination,however,does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy conviction,for errors of the yates variety are subject to analysis.the court leaves the parties dispute about whether the error here was harmless for resolution on remand,along with the question whether reversal on the conspiracy count would touch any of skilling other convictions.

jeffrey skilling,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
in,enron corporation,then the seventh company in america,crashed into bankruptcy.we consider in this opinion two questions arising from the prosecution of jeffrey skilling,a longtime enron executive,for crimes committed before the corporation collapse.first,did pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevent skilling from obtaining a fair trial second,did the jury improperly convict skilling of conspiracy to commit wire fraud,
answering no to both questions,the fifth circuit affirmed skilling convictions.we conclude,in common with the court of appeals,that skilling argument fails skilling,we hold,did not establish that a presumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that tried him.but we disagree with the fifth circuit ruling.in proscribing fraudulent deprivations of the intangible right of honest services,congress intended at least to reach schemes to defraud involving bribes and kickbacks.construing the statute to extend beyond that core meaning,we conclude,would encounter a vagueness shoal.we therefore hold that covers only bribery and kickback schemes.because skilling alleged misconduct entailed no bribe or kickback,it does not fall within proscription.we therefore affirm in part and vacate in part.
founded in,enron corporation grew from its headquarters in houston,texas,into one of the world leading energy companies.skilling launched his career there in when kenneth lay,the company founder,hired him to head an enron subsidiary.skilling steadily rose through the corporation ranks,serving as president and chief operating officer,and then,beginning in february,as chief executive officer.six months later,on august,skilling resigned from enron.
less than four months after skilling departure,enron spiraled into bankruptcy.the company stock,which had traded at per share in august,plummeted to pennies per share in late.attempting to comprehend what caused the corporation collapse,the department of justice formed an enron task force,comprising prosecutors and fbi agents from around the nation.the government investigation uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up enron stock prices by overstating the company financial.in the years following enron bankruptcy,the government prosecuted dozens of enron employees who participated in the scheme.in time,the government worked its way up the corporation chain of command on july,a grand jury indicted skilling,lay,and richard causey,enron former chief accounting officer.
these three defendants,the indictment alleged,
engaged in a scheme to deceive the investing public,including enron shareholders,about the true performance of enron businesses by a manipulating enron publicly reported financial results and b making public statements and representations about enron financial performance and results that were false and misleading.app.
skilling and his,the indictment continued,enriched themselves as a result of the scheme through salary,bonuses,grants of stock and stock options,other profits,and prestige.at.
count of the indictment charged skilling with conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud in particular,it alleged that skilling had sought to depriv e enron and its shareholders of the intangible right of his honest services.at the indictment further charged skilling with more than substantive counts of securities fraud,wire fraud,making false representations to enron auditors,and insider trading.
in november,skilling moved to transfer the trial to another venue he contended that hostility toward him in houston,coupled with extensive pretrial publicity,had poisoned potential jurors.to support this assertion,skilling,aided by media experts,submitted hundreds of news reports detailing enron downfall he also presented affidavits from the experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in houston in comparison to other potential venues.
the district court for the southern district of texas,in accord with rulings in two earlier instituted prosecutions denied the motion.despite isolated incidents of intemperate commentary,the court observed,media coverage ha d mostly been objective and unemotional,and the facts of the case were neither heinous nor sensational.app.to brief for united states moreover,courts ha d commonly favored effective voir dire to ferret out any juror bias.at.pretrial publicity about the case,the court concluded,did not warrant a presumption that skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in houston,at.
in the months leading up to the trial,the district court solicited from the parties questions the court might use to screen prospective jurors.unable to agree on a questionnaire format and content,skilling and the government submitted dueling documents.on venire members sources of news,for example,the government proposed that they tick boxes from a checklist of generic labels such as t elevision,n ewspaper,and r adio,record skilling proposed more probing questions asking venire members to list the specific names of their media sources and to report on what st ood out in their mind s of all the things they ha d seen,heard or read about enron,at.
the district court rejected the government sparer inquiries in favor of skilling submission.skilling questions we re more helpful,the court said,because they we re generally and w ould allow the potential jurors to give us more meaningful information.at.the court converted skilling submission,with slight modifications,into a,document that asked prospective jurors about,inter alia,their sources of news and exposure to publicity,beliefs concerning enron and what caused its collapse,opinions regarding the defendants and their possible guilt or innocence,and relationships to the company and to anyone affected by its demise 
in november,the district court mailed the questionnaire to prospective jurors and received responses from nearly all the addressees.the court granted hardship exemptions to approximately individuals,at,and the parties,with the court approval,further winnowed the pool by excusing another for cause,hardship,or physical disability,at.the parties agreed to exclude,in particular,each and every prospective juror who said that a preexisting opinion about enron or the defendants would prevent her from impartially considering the evidence at trial,at.
on december,three weeks before the date scheduled for the commencement of trial,causey pleaded guilty.skilling attorneys immediately requested a continuance,and the district court agreed to delay the proceedings until the end of january,at.in the interim,skilling renewed his motion,arguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of causey guilty plea further tainted the jury pool.if houston remained the trial venue,skilling urged that jurors need to be questioned individually by both the court and counsel concerning their opinions of enron and publicity issues.at.
the district court again declined to move the trial.skilling,the court concluded,still had not establish ed that pretrial publicity community prejudice raise d a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.at.the questionnaires and voir dire,the court observed,provided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury,at.
denying skilling request for voir dire,the court said that in years on the bench 
i found i get more forthcoming responses from potential jurors than the lawyers on either side.i do know whether people are suspicious of lawyers but i think if i ask a person a question,i will get a candid response much easier than if a lawyer asks the question.at.
but the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask questions,and it agreed that venire members should be examined individually about pretrial publicity,at.the court also allotted the defendants jointly peremptory challenges,more than the standard number prescribed by federal rule of criminal procedure b and c b,at.
voir dire began on january.the district court first emphasized to the venire the importance of impartiality and explained the presumption of innocence and the government burden of proof.the trial,the court next instructed,was not a forum to seek vengeance against enron former officers,or to provide remedies for its victims.app.the bottom line,the court stressed,is that we want jurors who will faithfully,conscientiously and impartially serve if selected.at.in response to the court query whether any prospective juror questioned her ability to adhere to these instructions,two individuals indicated that they could not be fair they were therefore excused for cause,at.
after questioning the venire as a group the district court brought prospective jurors one by one to the bench for individual examination.although the questions varied,the process generally tracked the following format the court asked about exposure to news and the content of any stories that stood out in the prospective juror mind.next,the court homed in on questionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible bias.the court then permitted each side to pose questions.finally,after the venire member stepped away,the court entertained and ruled on challenges for cause.in all,the court granted one of the government forcause challenges and denied four it granted three of the defendants challenges and denied six.the parties agreed to excuse three additional jurors for cause and one for hardship.
by the end of the day,the court had qualified prospective jurors,a number sufficient,allowing for peremptory challenges,to empanel jurors and alternates before the jury was sworn in,skilling objected to the seating of six jurors.he did not contend that they were in fact biased instead,he urged that he would have used peremptories to exclude them had he not exhausted his supply by striking several venire members after the court refused to excuse them for cause.supp.app.sealed the court overruled this objection.
after the jurors took their oath,the district court told them they could not discuss the case with anyone or follow media accounts of the proceedings.e ach of you,the court explained,needs to be absolutely sure that your decisions concerning the facts will be based only on the evidence that you hear and read in this courtroom.app.
following a trial and nearly five days of deliberation,the jury found skilling guilty of counts,including the conspiracy charge,and not guilty of counts.the district court sentenced skilling to months imprisonment,years supervised release,and million in restitution.
on appeal,skilling raised a host of challenges to his convictions,including the and arguments he presses here.regarding the former,the fifth circuit initially determined that the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by enron collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice,the court also noted potential prejudice stemming from causey guilty plea and from the large number of victims in houston from the t housands of enron employees who lost their jobs,and saw their k accounts wiped out,to houstonians who suffered spillover economic effects,at.
the court of appeals stated,however,that the presumption of prejudice is rebuttable,and it therefore examined the voir dire to determine whether the district court empanelled an impartial jury.at internal quotation marks,italics,and some capitalization omitted.the voir dire was,in the fifth circuit view,proper and thorough.at.moreover,the court noted,skilling had challenged only one seated juror juror for cause.although juror made some troubling comments about corporate greed,the district court observed his demeanor,listened to his answers,and believed he would make the government prove its case.at.in sum,the fifth circuit found that the government had overcome the presumption of prejudice and that skilling had not show n that any juror who actually sat was prejudiced against him.ibid.
the court of appeals also rejected skilling claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit fraud.t he jury was entitled to convict skilling,the court stated,on these elements a material breach of a fiduciary duty that results in a detriment to the employer,including one occasioned by an employee decision to withhold material information,information that he had reason to believe would lead a reasonable employer to change its conduct.at.the fifth circuit did not address skilling argument that the statute,if not interpreted to exclude his actions,should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague.brief of jeffrey skilling in.
arguing that the fifth circuit erred in its consideration of these claims,skilling sought relief from this court.we granted certiorari,and now affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings we consider first skilling allegation of juror prejudice,and next,his argument.
pointing to the community passion aroused by enron collapse and the vitriolic media treatment aimed at him,skilling argues that his trial never should have proceeded in houston.brief for petitioner.and even if it had been possible to select impartial jurors in houston,t he truncated voir dire did almost nothing to weed out prejudices,he contends,so f ar from rebutting the presumption of prejudice,the record below affirmatively confirmed it.at.skilling claim thus raises two distinct questions.first,did the district court err by failing to move the trial to a different venue based on a presumption of prejudice second,did actual prejudice contaminate skilling jury

the theory of our trial system is that the conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence and argument in open court,and not by any outside influence,whether of private talk or public print.patterson colorado ex rel.attorney general of,opinion for the court by holmes.when does the publicity attending conduct charged as criminal dim prospects that the trier can judge a case,as due process requires,impartially,unswayed by outside influence because most cases of consequence garner at least some pretrial publicity,courts have considered this question in diverse settings.we begin our discussion by addressing the presumption of prejudice from which the fifth circuit analysis in skilling case proceeded.the foundation precedent is rideau louisiana.
wilbert rideau robbed a bank in a small louisiana town,kidnaped three bank employees,and killed one of them.police interrogated rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his confession.without informing rideau,no less seeking his consent,the police filmed the interrogation.on three separate occasions shortly before the trial,a local television station broadcast the film to audiences ranging from to individuals.rideau moved for a change of venue,arguing that he could not receive a fair trial in the parish where the crime occurred,which had a population of approximately people.the trial court denied the motion,and a jury eventually convicted rideau.the supreme court of louisiana upheld the conviction.
we reversed.what the people in the community saw on their television sets,we observed,was rideau,in jail,flanked by the sheriff and two state troopers,admitting in detail the commission of the robbery,kidnapping,and murder.at.t o the tens of thousands of people who saw and heard it,we explained,the interrogation in a very real sense was rideau trial at which he pleaded guilty.at.we therefore d id not hesitate to hold,without pausing to examine a particularized transcript of the voir dire,that t he kangaroo court proceedings trailing the televised confession violated due process,at.
we followed rideau lead in two later cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted a criminal prosecution.in estes texas,extensive publicity before trial swelled into excessive exposure during preliminary court proceedings as reporters and television crews overran the courtroom and bombard ed the community with the sights and sounds of the pretrial hearing.the media overzealous reporting efforts,we observed,led to considerable disruption and denied the judicial serenity and calm to which billie sol estes was entitled.at.
similarly,in sheppard maxwell,news reporters extensively covered the story of sam sheppard,who was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death.b edlam reigned at the courthouse during the trial and newsmen took over practically the entire courtroom,thrusting jurors into the role of celebrities.at.pretrial media coverage,which we characterized as months of virulent publicity about sheppard and the murder,did not alone deny due process,we noted,at.but sheppard case involved more than heated reporting pretrial we upset the murder conviction because a carnival atmosphere pervaded the trial,at.
in each of these cases,we overturned a conviction obtained in a trial atmosphere that was utterly corrupted by press coverage our decisions,however,can not be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to news accounts of the crime alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process.murphy florida,see also,patton yount,prominence does not necessarily produce prejudice,and juror impartiality,we have reiterated,does not require ignorance.irvin dowd,jurors are not required to be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will not have formed some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case.reynolds united states,e very case of public interest is almost,as a matter of necessity,brought to the attention of all the intelligent people in the vicinity,and scarcely any one can be found among those best fitted for jurors who has not read or heard of it,and who has not some impression or some opinion in respect to its merits.a presumption of prejudice,our decisions indicate,attends only the extreme case.
relying on rideau,estes,and sheppard,skilling asserts that we need not pause to examine the screening questionnaires or the voir dire before declaring his jury verdict void.we are not persuaded.important differences separate skilling prosecution from those in which we have presumed juror prejudice 
first,we have emphasized in prior decisions the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred.in rideau,for example,we noted that the murder was committed in a parish of only residents.houston,in contrast,is the fourth most populous city in the nation at the time of skilling trial,more than million individuals eligible for jury duty resided in the houston area.app.given this large,diverse pool of potential jurors,the suggestion that impartial individuals could not be empaneled is hard to sustain.see virginia,potential for prejudice mitigated by the size of the metropolitan washington statistical area,which has a population of over million,and in which,unfortunately,hundreds of murders are committed each year gentile state bar of,plurality opinion reduced likelihood of prejudice where venire was drawn from a pool of over individuals 
second,although news stories about skilling were not kind,they contained no confession or other blatantly prejudicial information of the type readers or viewers could not reasonably be expected to shut from sight.rideau dramatically staged admission of guilt,for instance,was likely imprinted indelibly in the mind of anyone who watched it.parker randolph,plurality opinion t he defendant own confession is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him.internal quotation marks omitted.pretrial publicity about skilling was less memorable and prejudicial.no evidence of the variety invited prejudgment of his culpability.see united states chagra,a jury may have difficulty in disbelieving or forgetting a defendant opinion of his own guilt but have no difficulty in rejecting the opinions of others because they may not be.
third,unlike cases in which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime,rideau,at,over four years elapsed between enron bankruptcy and skilling trial.although reporters covered news throughout this period,the decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years following enron collapse.see app,at yount,at.
finally,and of prime significance,skilling jury acquitted him of nine counts.similarly,earlier instituted prosecutions yielded no overwhelming victory for the government in rideau,estes,and sheppard,in marked contrast,the jury verdict did not undermine in any way the supposition of juror bias.it would be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors actions run counter to that presumption.see,united states,the jury ability to discern a failure of proof of guilt of some of the alleged crimes indicates a fair minded consideration of the issues and reinforces our belief and conclusion that the media coverage did not lead to the deprivation of the right to an impartial trial.
skilling trial,in short,shares little in common with those in which we approved a presumption of juror prejudice.the fifth circuit reached the opposite conclusion based primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of media attention directed at enron.but pretrial publicity even pervasive,adverse publicity does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.nebraska press stuart.in this case,as just noted,news stories about enron did not present the kind of vivid,unforgettable information we have recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice,and houston size and diversity diluted the media impact 
nor did enron sheer number of victims,at,trigger a presumption of prejudice.although the widespread community impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors connections to enron,the extensive screening questionnaire and voir dire were well suited to that task.and hindsight shows the efficacy of these devices as we discuss infra,at,jurors links to enron were either nonexistent or attenuated.
finally,although causey decision to plead guilty shortly before trial created a danger of juror prejudice,at,the district court took appropriate steps to reduce that risk.the court delayed the proceedings by two weeks,lessening the immediacy of that development.and during voir dire,the court asked about prospective jurors exposure to recent publicity,including news regarding causey.only two venire members recalled the plea neither mentioned causey by name,and neither ultimately served on skilling jury.app.although publicity about a codefendant guilty plea calls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice,it does not ordinarily and,we are satisfied,it did not here warrant an automatic presumption of prejudice.
persuaded that no presumption arose we conclude that the district court,in declining to order a venue change,did not exceed constitutional limitations 
we next consider whether actual prejudice infected skilling jury.voir dire,skilling asserts,did not adequately detect and defuse juror bias.t he record affirmatively confirm s prejudice,he maintains,because several seated jurors prejudged his guilt.brief for petitioner.we disagree with skilling characterization of the voir dire and the jurors selected through it.
no formula dictates the necessary depth or breadth of voir dire.see united states wood,impartiality is not a technical conception.it is a state of mind.for the ascertainment of this mental attitude of appropriate indifference,the constitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is not chained to any ancient and artificial formula.jury selection,we have repeatedly emphasized,is particularly within the province of the trial judge.ristaino ross,internal quotation marks omitted see,at yount,at united states,plurality opinion connors united states.
when pretrial publicity is at issue,primary reliance on the judgment of the trial court makes especially good sense because the judge sits in the locale where the publicity is said to have had its effect and may base her evaluation on her own perception of the depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.at.appellate courts making assessments of the media impact on jurors should be mindful that their judgments lack the comprehension of the situation possessed by trial judges.
reviewing courts are properly resistant to the trial judge estimation of a juror impartiality,for that judge appraisal is ordinarily influenced by a host of factors impossible to capture fully in the record among them,the prospective juror inflection,sincerity,demeanor,candor,body language,and apprehension of duty.see reynolds,at.in contrast to the cold transcript received by the appellate court,the voir dire affords the trial court a more intimate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member fitness for jury service.we consider the adequacy of jury selection in skilling case,therefore,attentive to the respect due to determinations of juror impartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that impartiality 
skilling deems the voir dire insufficient because,he argues,jury selection lasted just five hours,m ost of the court questions were conclusory,and failed adequately to probe jurors true feelings,and the court consistently took prospective jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair,no matter what other indications of bias were present.brief for petitioner emphasis deleted.our review of the record,however,yields a different appraisal 
as noted,supra,at,and,the district court initially screened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large part by skilling.that survey helped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served as a springboard for further questions put to remaining members of the array.voir dire thus was,in the court words,the culmination of a lengthy process.app.see,at,we consider the questionnaire in assessing the quality of voir dire as a whole.in other prosecutions,we note,district courts,after inspecting venire members responses to questionnaires,completed the process within one day.see supra,at,
the district court conducted voir dire,moreover,aware of the need,due to pretrial publicity,to ensure against jury bias.at skilling urging,the court examined each prospective juror individually,thus preventing the spread of any prejudicial information to other venire members.see,at.to encourage candor,the court repeatedly admonished that there were no right and wrong answers to th e questions.app.the court denied skilling request for voir dire because,in its experience,potential jurors were more forthcoming when the court,rather than counsel,asked the question.record.the parties,however,were accorded an opportunity to ask questions of every prospective juror brought to the bench for colloquy.skilling counsel declined to ask anything of more than half of the venire members questioned individually,including eight eventually selected for the jury,because,he explained,the court and other counsel have covered everything he wanted to know.app.
inspection of the questionnaires and voir dire of the individuals who actually served as jurors satisfies us that,notwithstanding the flaws skilling lists,the selection process successfully secured jurors who were largely untouched by enron collapse eleven of the seated jurors and alternates reported no connection at all to enron,while all other jurors reported at most an insubstantial link.see,supp.app.juror i once met a guy who worked for enron.i can not remember his name.as for pretrial publicity,jurors and alternates specifically stated that they had paid scant attention to news.see,app.juror would b asically start out knowing nothing about the case because i just did follow it a whole lot at juror enron was anything that i was interested in reading about in detail.i do really know much about it.the remaining two jurors indicated that nothing in the news influenced their opinions about skilling 
the questionnaires confirmed that,whatever community prejudice existed in houston generally,skilling jurors were not under its sway although many expressed sympathy for victims of enron bankruptcy and speculated that greed contributed to the corporation collapse,these sentiments did not translate into animus toward skilling.when asked whether they ha d an opinion about jeffrey skilling,none of the seated jurors and alternates checked the yes box and in response to the question whether any opinion they may have formed regarding enron or skilling would prevent their impartial consideration of the evidence at trial,every juror despite options to mark yes or unsure instead checked no.
the district court,skilling asserts,should not have accept ed at face value jurors promises of fairness.brief for petitioner.in irvin dowd,at,skilling points out,we found actual prejudice despite jurors assurances that they could be impartial.brief for petitioner.justice sotomayor,in turn,repeatedly relies on irvin,which she regards as closely analogous to this case.see post,at opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part hereinafter dissent.see also,post,at.we disagree with that characterization of irvin.
the facts of irvin are worlds apart from those presented here.leslie irvin stood accused of a brutal murder and robbery spree in a small rural community,at.in the months before irvin trial,a barrage of publicity was unleashed against him,including reports of his confessions to the slayings and robberies,at.this court description of the media coverage in irvin reveals why the dissent best case is not an apt comparison 
s tories revealed the details of irvin background,including a reference to crimes committed when a juvenile,his convictions for arson almost years previously,for burglary and by a on awol charges during the war.he was accused of being a parole violator.the headlines announced his police identification,that he faced a lie detector test,had been placed at the scene of the crime and that the six murders were solved but he refused to confess.finally,they announced irvin confession to the six murders and the fact of his indictment for four of them in indiana.they reported irvin offer to plead guilty if promised a sentence,but also the determination,on the other hand,of the prosecutor to secure the death penalty,and that irvin had confessed to burglaries the modus operandi of these robberies was compared to that of the murders and the similarity noted.one story dramatically relayed the promise of a sheriff to devote his life to securing irvin execution.another characterized irvin as remorseless and without conscience but also as having been found sane by a panel of doctors.in many of the stories irvin was described as the confessed slayer of six,a parole violator and artist.irvin counsel was quoted as having received much criticism over being irvin counsel and it was pointed out,by way of excusing the attorney,that he would be subject to disbarment should he refuse to represent irvin.on the day before the trial the newspapers carried the story that irvin had orally admitted to the murder of one victim as well as the of a second individual the murder of a third individual,and the slaughter of three members of a different family.at.
n ewspapers in which the se stories appeared were delivered regularly to of the dwellings in the county where the trial occurred,which had a population of only radio and tv stations,which likewise blanketed that county,also carried extensive newscasts covering the same incidents.at.
reviewing irvin claim,this court noted that the pattern of deep and bitter prejudice in the community was clearly reflected in the sum total of the voir dire prospective jurors or almost of those examined on the point entertained some opinion as to guilt,and out of the jurors thought irvin was guilty.at internal quotation marks omitted.although these jurors declared they could be impartial,we held that,w ith his life at stake,it is not requiring too much that irvin be tried in an atmosphere undisturbed by so huge a wave of public passion and by a jury other than one in which of the members admit,before hearing any testimony,to possessing a belief in his guilt.at.
in this case,as noted,supra,at,news stories about enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information rife in reports about irvin rampage of robberies and murders.of key importance,houston shares little in common with the rural community in which irvin trial proceeded,and circulation figures for houston media sources were far lower than the saturation level recorded in irvin,see app.to brief for united states the houston chronicle reaches less than of occupied households in houston.internal quotation marks omitted.skilling seated jurors,moreover,exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown in irvin.see supra,at noting,inter alia,that none of skilling jurors answered yes when asked if they ha d an opinion about skilling see also post,at dissent distinguishing from irvin on similar bases the offense occurred in a large metropolitan area,media coverage was not as pervasive as in irvin and did not contain the same sort of damaging information,and the seated jurors uniformly disclaimed having ever formed an opinion about the case internal quotation marks omitted.in light of these large differences,the district court had far less reason than did the trial court in irvin to discredit jurors promises of fairness.
the district court,moreover,did not simply take venire members who proclaimed their impartiality at their word as noted,all of skilling jurors had already affirmed on their questionnaires that they would have no trouble basing a verdict only on the evidence at trial.nevertheless,the court followed up with each individually to uncover concealed bias.this opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility,coupled with information from the questionnaires regarding jurors backgrounds,opinions,and sources of news,gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service.see,at the district court made thorough credibility determinations that requir ed more than just the venire members statements that they could be fair.the jury verdict on nine counts after nearly five days of deliberation,meanwhile,suggests the court assessments were accurate.see united states haldeman,cadc skilling,we conclude,failed to show that his voir dire fell short of constitutional requirements 
skilling also singles out several jurors in particular and contends they were openly biased.see united states,t he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause require s reversal.in reviewing claims of this type,the deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle a trial court findings of juror impartiality may be overturned only for manifest error.at internal quotation marks omitted.skilling,moreover,unsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for cause,strong evidence that he was convinced the other jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to his guilt.beck washington.with these considerations in mind,we turn to skilling specific allegations of juror partiality.
skilling contends that juror the only seated juror he challenged for cause expressed the most obvious bias.brief for petitioner.see also post,at dissent.juror stated that greed on enron part triggered the company bankruptcy and that corporate executives,driven by avarice,walk a line that stretches sometimes the legality of something.app.but,as the fifth circuit accurately summarized,juror 
had no idea whether skilling had crossed that line,and he did say that every ceo is probably a crook.he also asserted that he could be fair and require the government to prove its case,that he did not believe everything he read in the paper,that he did not get into the details of the enron coverage,that he did not watch television,and that enron was old news.at.
despite his criticism of greed,juror remarked that skilling earned his salar y,app,and said he would have no problem telling his,who had lost k funds due to enron collapse,that the jury voted to acquit,if that scenario came to pass,at.the district court,noting that it had looked juror in the eye and heard all his answers,found his assertions of impartiality credible,at supra,at.we agree with the court of appeals that t he express finding that juror was fair is not reversible error.at 
skilling also objected at trial to the seating of six specific jurors whom,he said,he would have excluded had he not already exhausted his peremptory challenges.see supra,at.juror,he observes,said she was angry about enron collapse and that she,too,had been forced to forfeit her own k funds to survive layoffs.reply brief.but juror made clear during voir dire that she did not personally blame skilling for the loss of her retirement account.app.having not pa id much attention to news,she quite honestly did not have enough information to know whether skilling was probably guilty,at,and she th ought she could be fair and impartial,at.in light of these answers,the district court did not commit manifest error in finding juror fit for jury service.
the same is true of juror,who,skilling points out,wrote on her questionnaire that skilling probably knew he w as breaking the law.reply brief.during voir dire,however,juror insisted that she did not really have an opinion about skilling guilt either way,app.she did not know what she was thinking when she completed the questionnaire,but she absolutely presumed skilling innocent and confirmed her understanding that the government would have to prove his guilt,at.in response to questions from skilling counsel,she again stated she would not presume that skilling violated any laws and could a bsolutely give her word that she could be fair,at.jurors,we have recognized,can not be expected invariably to express themselves carefully or even consistently.yount,at.see also,at it is here that the federal appellate court deference must operate,for while the cold record arouses some concern,only the trial judge could tell which of these answers was said with the greatest comprehension and certainty.from where we sit,we can not conclude that juror was biased.
the four remaining jurors skilling said he would have excluded with extra peremptory strikes exhibited no sign of prejudice we can discern.see app.juror remembered no media coverage about enron and said nothing in her experience would prevent her from being fair and impartial supp.app,juror had no connection to enron and no anger about its collapse app.juror did not know much about enron supp.app,app.juror had not heard or read anything about enron and said she did not know enough to answer the question whether she was angry about the company demise.skilling counsel declined to ask questions of any of these jurors and,indeed,told juror he had nothing to ask because she gave all the right answers.at.whatever skilling reasons for wanting to strike these four individuals from his jury,he can not credibly assert they displayed a disqualifying bias 
in sum,skilling failed to establish that a presumption of prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that tried him.jurors,the trial court correctly comprehended,need not enter the box with empty heads in order to determine the facts impartially.it is sufficient if the juror s can lay aside their impression s or opinion s and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.irvin,at.taking account of the full record,rather than incomplete exchanges selectively culled from it,we find no cause to upset the lower courts judgment that skilling jury met that measure.we therefore affirm the fifth circuit ruling that skilling received a fair trial 
we next consider whether skilling conspiracy conviction was premised on an improper theory of wire fraud.the statute,skilling maintains,is unconstitutionally vague.alternatively,he contends that his conduct does not fall within the statute compass.
to place skilling constitutional challenge in context,we first review the origin and subsequent application of the doctrine.
enacted in,the original provision,the predecessor of the mail and laws,proscribed,without further elaboration,use of the mails to advance any scheme or artifice to defraud.see mcnally united states.in,congress amended the statute to prohibit,as it does today,any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.emphasis added see,at.emphasizing congress disjunctive phrasing,the courts of appeals,one after the other,interpreted the term scheme or artifice to defraud to include deprivations not only of money or property,but also of intangible rights.
in an opinion credited with first presenting the theory,shushan united states,the fifth circuit reviewed the prosecution of a public official who allegedly accepted bribes from entrepreneurs in exchange for urging city action beneficial to the bribe payers.it is not true that because the city was to make and did make a saving by the operations there could not have been an intent to defraud,the court of appeals maintained,at.a scheme to get a public contract on more favorable terms than would likely be got otherwise by bribing a public official,the court observed,would not only be a plan to commit the crime of bribery,but would also be a scheme to defraud the public.at.
the fifth circuit opinion in shushan stimulated the development of an doctrine.unlike fraud in which the victim loss of money or property supplied the defendant gain,with one the mirror image of the other,see,united states starr,the theory targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry.while the offender profited,the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of money or property instead,a third party,who had not been deceived,provided the enrichment.for example,if a city mayor the offender accepted a bribe from a third party in exchange for awarding that party a city contract,yet the contract terms were the same as any that could have been negotiated at arm length,the city the betrayed party would suffer no tangible loss.mcnally,at.even if the scheme occasioned a money or property gain for the betrayed party,courts reasoned,actionable harm lay in the denial of that party right to the offender honest services.see,united states dixon.
most often these cases involved bribery of public officials,united states bohonus,but courts also recognized fraud.in perhaps the earliest application of the theory to private actors,a district court,reviewing a bribery scheme,explained 
when one tampers with the relationship for the purpose of causing the employee to breach his duty to his employer,he in effect is defrauding the employer of a lawful right.the actual deception that is practised is in the continued representation of the employee to the employer that he is honest and loyal to the employer interests.united states procter gamble,supp.
over time,a n increasing number of courts recognized that a recreant employee public or private c ould be prosecuted under the statute if he breache d his allegiance to his employer by accepting bribes or kickbacks in the course of his employment,united states mcneive,by,all courts of appeals had embraced the theory of fraud,hurson,limiting the federal mail fraud statute a legislative approach,am.crim,
in,this court,in mcnally united states,stopped the development of the doctrine in its tracks.mcnally involved a state officer who,in selecting kentucky insurance agent,arranged to procure a share of the agent commissions via kickbacks paid to companies the official partially controlled,at.the prosecutor did not charge that,in the absence of the alleged scheme,the commonwealth would have paid a lower premium or secured better insurance.ibid.instead,the prosecutor maintained that the kickback scheme defraud ed the citizens and government of kentucky of their right to have the commonwealth affairs conducted honestly.at.
we held that the scheme did not qualify as mail fraud.rather than constru ing the statute in a manner that leaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the federal government in setting standards of disclosure and good government for local and state officials,we read the statute as limited in scope to the protection of property rights.at.if congress desires to go further,we stated,it must speak more clearly.ibid.
congress responded swiftly.the following year,it enacted a new statute specifically to cover one of the intangible rights that lower courts had protected prior to mcnally the intangible right of honest services.cleveland united states.in full,the statute stated 
for the purposes of th e chapter of the united states code that prohibits,inter alia,mail fraud,and wire fraud,the term scheme or artifice to defraud includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.
congress,skilling charges,reacted quickly but not clearly he asserts that is unconstitutionally vague.to satisfy due process,a penal statute must define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.kolender lawson.the doctrine embraces these requirements.
according to skilling,meets neither of the two due process essentials.first,the phrase the intangible right of honest services,he contends,does not adequately define what behavior it bars.brief for petitioner.second,he alleges,standardless sweep allows policemen,prosecutors,and juries to pursue their personal predilections,thereby facilitat ing opportunistic and arbitrary prosecutions.at quoting kolender,at.
in urging invalidation of,skilling swims against our case law current,which requires us,if we can,to construe,not condemn,congress enactments.see,civil service comm letter carriers.see also united states national dairy products,stressing,in response to a vagueness challenge,t he strong presumptive validity that attaches to an act of congress alert to potential breadth,the courts of appeals have divided on how best to interpret the statute uniformly,however,they have declined to throw out the statute as irremediably vague 
we agree that should be construed rather than invalidated.first,we look to the doctrine developed in cases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase the intangible right of honest services.second,to preserve what congress certainly intended the statute to cover,we pare that body of precedent down to its core in the main,the cases involved fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who had not been deceived.confined to these paramount applications,presents no vagueness problem.
there is no doubt that congress intended to refer to and incorporate the doctrine recognized in court of appeals decisions before mcnally derailed the theory of fraud.see brief for petitioner brief for united states post,at,scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment.congress enacted on the heels of mcnally and drafted the statute using that decision terminology.see,at intangible righ t at stevens,dissenting right to honest services as the second circuit observed in its leading analysis of 
the definite article the suggests that intangible right of honest services had a specific meaning to congress when it enacted the statute congress was recriminalizing mail and schemes to deprive others of that intangible right of honest services,which had been protected before mcnally,not all intangible rights of honest services whatever they might be thought to be.united states rybicki,en banc 
satisfied that congress,by enacting,meant to reinstate the body of law,post,at opinion of scalia,we have surveyed that case law.see infra,at.in parsing the courts of appeals decisions,we acknowledge that skilling vagueness challenge has force,for decisions preceding mcnally were not models of clarity or consistency.see brief for petitioner describing divisions of opinions.see also post,at opinion of scalia.while the cases preceding mcnally dominantly and consistently applied the fraud statute to bribery and kickback schemes schemes that were the basis of most prosecutions there was considerable disarray over the statute application to conduct outside that core category.in light of this disarray,skilling urges us,as he urged the fifth circuit,to invalidate the statute in toto.brief for petitioner section is intolerably and unconstitutionally vague.brief of jeffrey skilling in,s ection should be invalidated as unlawfully vague on its face.
it has long been our practice,however,before striking a federal statute as impermissibly vague,to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a limiting construction.see,hooper california,the elementary rule is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to,in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.emphasis added.see also boos barry,schneider smith,we have accordingly instructed the federal courts to avoid constitutional difficulties by adopting a limiting interpretation if such a construction is fairly possible.boos,at see united states harriss,i f the general class of offenses to which the statute is directed is plainly within its terms,the statute will not be struck down as vague.and if this general class of offenses can be made constitutionally definite by a reasonable construction of the statute,this court is under a duty to give the statute that construction.
arguing against any limiting construction,skilling contends that it is impossible to identify a salvageable core the caselaw,he asserts,is a hodgepodge of holdings that are hopelessly unclear.brief for petitioner some capitalization and italics omitted.we have rejected an argument of the same tenor before.in civil service comm letter carriers,federal employees challenged a provision of the hatch act that incorporated earlier decisions of the united states civil service commission enforcing a similar law.t he several thousand adjudications of the civil service commission,the employees maintained,were an impenetrable jungle undiscoverable,inconsistent,and incapable of yielding any meaningful rules to govern present or future conduct.at.mindful that our task wa s not to destroy the act if we c ould,but to construe it,we held that the rules that had evolved over the years from repeated adjudications were subject to sufficiently clear and summary statement.at.
a similar observation may be made here.although some applications of the doctrine occasioned disagreement among the courts of appeals,these cases do not cloud the doctrine solid core the vast majority of the cases involved offenders who,in violation of a fiduciary duty,participated in bribery or kickback schemes.united states runnels,see brief for united states,and citing dozens of examples indeed,the mcnally case itself,which spurred congress to enact,presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern,at.congress reversal of mcnally and reinstatement of the doctrine,we conclude,can and should be salvaged by confining its scope to the core applications.
as already noted,supra,at,the doctrine had its genesis in prosecutions involving bribery allegations.see shushan,at public sector procter gamble,at private sector.see also united states orsburn.both before mcnally and after enactment,courts of appeals described schemes involving bribes or kickbacks as core honest services fraud precedents,united states czubinski,paradigm case s,united states devegter,t he most obvious form of honest services fraud,united states carbo,core misconduct covered by the statute,united states urciuoli,most of the honest services cases,united states sorich,typical,united states brown,united states mandel,and uniformly cover ed,united states paradies.see also tr.of oral arg.counsel for the government t he bulk of honest services cases entailed bribes or kickbacks brief for petitioner bribes and kickbacks were the paradigm cases,constituting t he overwhelming majority of prosecutions for honest services fraud.
in view of this history,there is no doubt that congress intended to reach at least bribes and kickbacks.reading the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct,we acknowledge,would raise the due process concerns underlying the vagueness doctrine to preserve the statute without transgressing constitutional limitations,we now hold that criminalizes only the core of the case law 
the government urges us to go further by locating within compass another category of proscribed conduct undisclosed by a public official or private employee,the taking of official action by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owes a fiduciary duty.at.t he theory of liability in mcnally itself was nondisclosure of a conflicting financial interest,the government observes,and congress clearly intended to revive th at nondisclosure theory.at.moreover,a lthough not as numerous as the bribery and kickback cases,the government asserts,the cases involving undisclosed were abundant.ibid.
neither of these contentions withstands close inspection.mcnally,as we have already observed,supra,at,involved a classic kickback scheme a public official,in exchange for routing kentucky insurance business through a middleman company,arranged for that company to share its commissions with entities in which the official held an interest,at.this was no mere failure to disclose a conflict of interest rather,the official conspired with a third party so that both would profit from wealth generated by public contracts.see,at.reading to proscribe bribes and kickbacks and nothing more satisfies congress undoubted aim to reverse mcnally on its facts.
nor are we persuaded that the cases constitute core applications of the doctrine.although the courts of appeals upheld convictions for some schemes of and concealment of material information,mandel,at,they reached no consensus on which schemes qualified.in light of the relative infrequency of prosecutions in comparison to bribery and kickback charges,and the intercircuit inconsistencies they produced,we conclude that a reasonable limiting construction of must exclude this amorphous category of cases.
further dispelling doubt on this point is the familiar principle that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.cleveland,at quoting rewis united states.this interpretive guide is especially appropriate in construing because mail and wire fraud are predicate offense s under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,supp.iv,and the money laundering statute,c a.cleveland,at.holding that fraud does not encompass conduct more than the paradigmatic cases of bribes and kickbacks,we resist the government less constrained construction absent congress clear instruction otherwise,united states universal credit.
in sum,our construction of establish es a uniform national standard,define s honest services with clarity,reach es only seriously culpable conduct,and accomplish es congress goal of overruling mcnally.brief for albert alschuler as amicus curiae in weyhrauch united states.if congress desires to go further,we reiterate,it must speak more clearly than it has.mcnally,at 
interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback schemes,is not unconstitutionally vague.recall that the doctrine addresses concerns about fair notice and arbitrary and discriminatory prosecutions.see kolender,at.a prohibition on fraudulently depriving another of one honest services by accepting bribes or kickbacks does not present a problem on either score.
as to fair notice,whatever the school of thought concerning the scope and meaning of it has always been as plain as a pikestaff that bribes and kickbacks constitute fraud,williams united states,and the statute mens rea requirement further blunts any notice concern,see,screws united states,plurality opinion.see also broadrick oklahoma,e ven if the outermost boundaries of a statute are imprecise,any such uncertainty has little relevance where appellants conduct falls squarely within the hard core of the statute proscriptions.today decision clarifies that no other misconduct falls within province.see united states lanier,c larity at the requisite level may be supplied by judicial gloss on an otherwise uncertain statute.
as to arbitrary prosecutions,we perceive no significant risk that the statute,as we interpret it today,will be stretched out of shape.its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the case law,but also from federal statutes proscribing and defining similar crimes.see,b,a the term kickback means any money,fee,commission,credit,gift,gratuity,thing of value,or compensation of any kind which is provided,directly or indirectly,to enumerated persons for the purpose of improperly obtaining or rewarding favorable treatment in connection with enumerated circumstances.see also,united states ganim,sotomayor,reviewing conviction involving bribery in light of elements of bribery under other federal statutes united states whitfield,united states kemp.a criminal defendant who participated in a bribery or kickback scheme,in short,can not tenably complain about prosecution under on vagueness grounds.
it remains to determine whether skilling conduct violated.skilling prosecution,the government concedes,was not prototypical.brief for united states.the government charged skilling with conspiring to defraud enron shareholders by misrepresenting the company fiscal health,thereby artificially inflating its stock price.it was the government theory at trial that skilling profited from the fraudulent scheme through the receipt of salary and bonuses,and through the sale of approximately million in enron stock,which netted him million.at.
the government did not,at any time,allege that skilling solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for making these misrepresentations.see record may,letter from the government to the district court t he indictment does not allege,and the government evidence did not show,that skilling engaged in bribery.it is therefore clear that,as we read,skilling did not commit fraud.
because the indictment alleged three objects of the conspiracy wire fraud,wire fraud,and securities fraud skilling conviction is flawed.see yates united states,constitutional error occurs when a jury is instructed on alternative theories of guilt and returns a general verdict that may rest on a legally invalid theory.this determination,however,does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy conviction we recently confirmed,in hedgpeth pulido,per curiam,that errors of the yates variety are subject to analysis.the parties vigorously dispute whether the error was harmless.compare brief for united states a ny juror who voted for conviction based on the theory also would have found skilling guilty of conspiring to commit securities fraud.with reply brief the government can not show that the conspiracy conviction rested only on the theory,rather than the distinct,theory.we leave this dispute for resolution on remand 
whether potential reversal on the conspiracy count touches any of skilling other convictions is also an open question.all of his convictions,skilling contends,hinged on the conspiracy count and,like dominoes,must fall if it falls.the district court,deciding skilling motion for bail pending appeal,found this argument dubious,app,but the fifth circuit had no occasion to rule on it.that court may do so on remand.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the fifth circuit ruling on skilling argument,vacate its ruling on his conspiracy conviction,and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
jeffrey skilling,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice scalia,with whom justice thomas joins,and with whom justice kennedy joins except as to part iii,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
i agree with the court that petitioner jeffrey skilling challenge to the impartiality of his jury and to the district court conduct of the voir dire fails.i therefore join parts i and ii of the court opinion.i also agree that the decision upholding skilling conviction for fraud must be reversed,but for a different reason.in my view,the specification in,supp.ii that scheme or artifice to defraud in the and statutes,and ed,includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,is vague,and therefore violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment.the court strikes a pose of judicial humility in proclaiming that our task is not to destroy the act but to construe it,ante,at internal quotation marks omitted.but in transforming the prohibition of fraud into a prohibition of bribery and it is wielding a power we long ago abjured the power to define new federal crimes.see united states hudson,cranch.
a criminal statute must clearly define the conduct it proscribes,see grayned city of rockford.a statute that is unconstitutionally vague can not be saved by a more precise indictment,see lanzetta new jersey,nor by judicial construction that writes in specific criteria that its text does not contain,see united states reese.our cases have described vague statutes as failing to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited,or as being so standardless that they authoriz e or encourag e seriously discriminatory enforcement.united states williams.here,skilling argues that fails to provide fair notice and encourages arbitrary enforcement because it provides no definition of the right of honest services whose deprivation it prohibits.brief for petitioner.in my view skilling is correct.
the court maintains that the intangible right of honest services means the right not to have one fiduciaries accept bribes or kickbacks.its first step in reaching that conclusion is the assertion that the phrase refers to the doctrine developed in cases decided by lower federal courts prior to our decision in mcnally united states.ante,at.i do not contest that.i agree that congress used the novel phrase to adopt the case law that had been disapproved by mcnally what the court calls the doctrine,ante,at.the problem is that that doctrine provides no ascertainable standard of guilt,united states cohen grocery,and certainly is not limited to bribes or kickbacks.
investigation into the meaning of the doctrine might logically begin with mcnally itself,which rejected it.that case repudiated the many court of appeals holdings that had expanded the meaning of fraud in the and statutes beyond deceptive schemes to obtain property,at.if the repudiated cases stood for a prohibition of bribery and kickbacks,one would have expected those words to appear in the opinion description of the cases.in fact,they do not.not at all.nor did mcnally even provide a consistent definition of the theory of fraud it rejected.it referred variously to a right of citizens to have the state affairs conducted honestly,at,to honest and impartial government,at,to good government,at,and to have public officials perform their duties honestly,at.it described prior case law as holding that a public official owes a fiduciary duty to the public,and misuse of his office for private gain is a fraud,at.
but the court of appeals opinions were not limited to fraud by public officials.some courts had held that those fiduciaries subject to the honest services obligation included private individuals who merely participated in public decisions,see,united states gray,citing united states margiotta,and even private employees who had no role in public decisions,see,united states lemire,cadc united states von barta.moreover,to say that a man is a fiduciary only begins the analysis it gives direction to further inquiry.what obligations does he owe as a fiduciary sec chenery.none of the honest services cases,neither those pertaining to public officials nor those pertaining to private employees,defined the nature and content of the fiduciary duty central to the fraud offense.
there was not even universal agreement concerning the source of the fiduciary obligation whether it must be positive state or federal law,see,united states rabbitt,or merely general principles,such as the obligations of loyalty and fidelity that inhere in the employment relationship,lemire,supra,at.the decision mcnally reversed had grounded the duty in general not trust law,see gray,supra,at,a corpus juris festooned with various duties.see,restatement second of trusts.another case referred to the general law of agency,united states ballard,modified on other grounds by,which imposes duties quite different from those of a trustee see restatement second of agency.
this indeterminacy does not disappear if one assumes that the cases developed a federal,fiduciary duty the duty remained hopelessly undefined.some courts described it in astoundingly broad language.blachly united states,loftily declared that l aw puts its imprimatur on the accepted moral standards and condemns conduct which fails to match the reflection of moral uprightness,of fundamental honesty,fair play and right dealing in the general and business life of members of society.at quoting gregory united states.other courts unhelpfully added that any scheme contrary to public policy was also condemned by the statute,united states bohonus.see also united states mandel,any scheme that is contrary to public policy and conflicts with accepted standards of moral uprightness,fundamental honesty,fair play and right dealing even opinions that did not indulge in such grandiloquence did not specify the duty at issue beyond loyalty or honesty,see,von barta,supra,at.moreover,the demands of the duty were said to be greater for public officials than for private employees,see,lemire,supra,at,ballard,supra,at,but in what respects or by how much was never made clear.
the indefiniteness of the fiduciary duty is not all.many courts held that some beyond a mere breach of fiduciary duty was needed to establish fraud.see,von barta,supra,at collecting cases united states george.there was,unsurprisingly,some dispute about that,at least in the context of acts by persons owing duties to the public.see united states price.and even among those courts that did require something additional where a public official was involved,there was disagreement as to what the addition should be.for example,in united states bush,the seventh circuit held that material misrepresentations and active concealment were enough,at.but in rabbitt,the eighth circuit held that actual harm to the state was needed,at.
similar disagreements occurred with respect to private employees.courts disputed whether the defendant must use his fiduciary position for his own gain.compare lemire,supra,at yes,with united states bronston,no.one opinion upheld a conviction on the ground that the defendant failure to disclose his receipt of kickbacks and consulting fees from his employer suppliers resulted in a breach of his fiduciary duties depriving his employer of his loyal and honest services.united states bryza.another opinion,however,demanded more than an intentional failure to disclose there must be a failure to disclose something which in the knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an independent business risk to the employer.lemire,at.other courts required that the victim suffer some loss,see,ballard,supra,at a proposition that,of course,other courts rejected,see,united states newman,united states.the court statement today that there was a deprivation of honest services even if the scheme occasioned a money or property gain for the betrayed party,ante,at,is therefore true,except to the extent it is not.
in short,the first step in the court analysis holding that the intangible right of honest services refers to the doctrine recognized in court of appeals decisions before mcnally,ante,at is a step out of the frying pan into the fire.the cases provide no clear indication of what constitutes a denial of the right of honest services.the possibilities range from any action that is contrary to public policy or otherwise immoral,to only the disloyalty of a public official or employee to his principal,to only the secret use of a perpetrator position of trust in order to harm whomever he is beholden to.the duty probably did not have to be rooted in state law,but maybe it did.it might have been more demanding in the case of public officials,but perhaps not.at the time was enacted there was no settled criterion for choosing among these options,for conclusively settling what was in and what was out 
the court is aware of all this.it knows that adopting by reference the doctrine,ante,at,is adopting by reference nothing more precise than the referring term itself the intangible right of honest services hence the deus ex machina w e pare that body of precedent down to its core,ante,at.since the doctrine had its genesis in bribery prosecutions,and since several cases and counsel for skilling referred to bribery and kickback schemes as core or paradigm or typical examples,or t he most obvious form,of fraud,ante,at internal quotation marks omitted,and since two cases and counsel for the government say that they formed the vast majority,or most or at least t he bulk of cases,ante,at internal quotation marks omitted,therefore it must be the case that they are all congress meant by its reference to the doctrine.
even if that conclusion followed from its premises,it would not suffice to eliminate the vagueness of the statute.it would solve perhaps the indeterminacy of what acts constitute a breach of the honest services obligation under the law.but it would not solve the most fundamental indeterminacy the character of the fiduciary capacity to which the bribery and kickback restriction applies.does it apply only to public officials or in addition to private individuals who contract with the public or to everyone,including the corporate officer here the case law does not provide an answer.thus,even with the bribery and kickback limitation the statute does not answer the question what is the criterion of guilt 
but that is perhaps beside the point,because it is obvious that mere prohibition of bribery and kickbacks was not the intent of the statute.to say that bribery and kickbacks represented the core of the doctrine,or that most cases applying the doctrine involved those offenses,is not to say that they are the doctrine.all it proves is that the multifarious versions of the doctrine overlap with regard to those offenses.but the doctrine itself is much more.among all the of varieties of fraud,not one is limited to bribery and kickbacks.that is a dish the court has cooked up all on its own.
thus,the court claim to respec t the legislature,ante,at,emphasis deleted,is false.it is entirely clear as the court and i agree that congress meant to reinstate the body of law and entirely clear that that prohibited much more though precisely what more is uncertain than bribery and kickbacks.perhaps it is true that congress intended to reach at least bribes and kickbacks,ante,at.that simply does not mean,as the court now holds,that criminalizes only bribery and kickbacks,ante,at.
arriving at that conclusion requires not interpretation but invention.the court replaces a vague criminal standard that congress adopted with a more narrow one included within the vague one that can pass constitutional muster.i know of no precedent for such paring down,and it seems to me clearly beyond judicial power.this is not,as the court claims,ante,at,simply a matter of adopting a limiting construction in the face of potential unconstitutionality.to do that,our cases have been careful to note,the narrowing construction must be fairly possible,boos barry,reasonable,hooper california,or not plainly contrary to the intent of congress,edward debartolo florida gulf coast building constr.trades council.as we have seen and the court does not contest,no court before mcnally concluded that the deprivation of honest services meant only the acceptance of bribes or kickbacks.if it were a fairly possible or reasonable construction,not contrary to the intent of congress,one would think that some court would have adopted it.the court does not even point to a case that reads to cover only bribery and kickbacks,and i am aware of none.
the canon of constitutional avoidance,on which the court so heavily relies,see ante,at,states that when the constitutionality of a statute is assailed,if the statute be reasonably susceptible of two interpretations,by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid,it is our plain duty to adopt that construction which will save the statute from constitutional infirmity.united states ex rel.attorney general delaware hudson,see also united states rumely,describing the canon as decisive in the choice of fair alternatives here there is no choice to be made between two fair alternatives.until today,no one has thought and there is no basis for thinking that the statute prohibited only bribery and kickbacks.
i certainly agree with the court that we must,if we can,uphold,rather than condemn,congress enactments,ante,at.but i do not believe we have the power,in order to uphold an enactment,to rewrite it.congress enacted the entirety of the law,the content of which is to put it mildly unclear.in prior vagueness cases,we have resisted the temptation to make all things right with the stroke of our pen.see,smith goguen.i would show the same restraint today,and reverse skilling conviction on the basis that provides no ascertainable standard for the conduct it condemns,cohen,at.instead,the court today adds to our functions the prescription of criminal law.
a brief word about the appropriate remedy.as i noted supra,at,skilling has argued that can not be constitutionally applied to him because it affords no definition of the right whose deprivation it prohibits.though this reasoning is categorical,it does not make skilling challenge a facial one,in the sense that it seeks invalidation of the statute in all its applications,as opposed to preventing its enforcement against him.i continue to doubt whether striking down a statute is ever an appropriate exercise of our article iii power.see chicago morales,scalia,dissenting.in the present case,the universality of the infirmity skilling identifies in may mean that if he wins,anyone else prosecuted under the statute will win as well,see smith,supra,at.but skilling only asks that his conviction be reversed,brief for petitioner,so the remedy he seeks is not facial invalidation.
i would therefore reverse skilling conviction under on the ground that it fails to define the conduct it prohibits.the fate of the statute in future prosecutions obvious from my reasoning in the case would be a matter for stare decisis.
it is hard to imagine a case that more clearly fits the description of what chief justice waite said could not be done,in a colorful passage in our vagueness opinions,united states reese,at 
the question,then,to be determined,is,whether we can introduce words of limitation into a penal statute so as to make it specific,when,as expressed,it is general only.it would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders,and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained,and who should be set at large.this would,to some extent,substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government.to limit this statute in the manner now asked for would be to make a new law,not to enforce an old one.this is no part of our duty.
jeffrey skilling,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice alito,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
i join the judgment of the court and all but part ii of the court opinion.i write separately to address petitioner argument.
the sixth amendment guarantees criminal defendants a trial before an impartial jury.in my view,this requirement is satisfied so long as no biased juror is actually seated at trial.of course,evidence of pretrial media attention and widespread community hostility may play a role in the bias inquiry.such evidence may be important in assessing the adequacy of voir dire,see,virginia,or in reviewing the denial of requests to dismiss particular jurors for cause,see,patton yount.there are occasions in which such evidence weighs heavily in favor of a change of venue.in the end,however,if no biased jury is actually seated,there is no violation of the defendant right to an impartial jury.see,at,murphy florida,see also rivera illinois,slip,at united states,smith phillips.
petitioner advances a very different understanding of the right.where there is extraordinary pretrial publicity and community hostility,he contends,a court must presume juror prejudice and thus grant a change of venue.brief for petitioner.i disagree.careful voir dire can often ensure the selection of impartial jurors even where pretrial media coverage has generated much hostile community sentiment.moreover,once a jury has been selected,there are measures that a trial judge may take to insulate jurors from media coverage during the course of the trial.what the sixth amendment requires is an impartial jury.if the jury that sits and returns a verdict is impartial,a defendant has received what the sixth amendment requires.
the rule that petitioner advances departs from the text of the sixth amendment and is difficult to apply.it requires a trial judge to determine whether the adverse pretrial media coverage and community hostility in a particular case has reached a certain level of severity,but there is no clear way of demarcating that level or of determining whether it has been met.
petitioner relies chiefly on three cases from the sheppard maxwell,estes texas,and rideau louisiana.i do not read those cases as demanding petitioner suggested approach.as the court notes,sheppard and estes primarily involved media interference with courtroom proceedings during trial.ante,at,see also post,at sotomayor,concurring in part and dissenting in part.rideau involved unique events in a small community.
i share some of justice sotomayor concerns about the adequacy of the voir dire in this case and the trial judge findings that certain jurors could be impartial.see post,at.but those highly issues are not within the question presented.pet.for cert.i also do not understand the opinion of the court as reaching any question regarding a change of venue under federal rule of criminal procedure.
because petitioner,in my view,is not entitled to a reversal of the decision below on the question that is before us,i join the judgment of the court in full.
jeffrey skilling,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice sotomayor,with whom justice stevens and justice breyer join,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
i concur in the court resolution of the fraud question and join part iii of its opinion.i respectfully dissent,however,from the court conclusion that jeffrey skilling received a fair trial before an impartial jury.under our relevant precedents,the more intense the public antipathy toward a defendant,the more careful a court must be to prevent that sentiment from tainting the jury.in this case,passions ran extremely high.the sudden collapse of enron directly affected thousands of people in the houston area and shocked the entire community.the accompanying barrage of local media coverage was massive in volume and often caustic in tone.as enron ceo,skilling was at the center of the storm.even if these extraordinary circumstances did not constitutionally compel a change of venue,they required the district court to conduct a thorough voir dire in which prospective jurors attitudes about the case were closely scrutinized.the district court inquiry lacked the necessary thoroughness and left serious doubts about whether the jury empaneled to decide skilling case was capable of rendering an impartial decision based solely on the evidence presented in the courtroom.accordingly,i would grant skilling relief on his claim.
the majority understates the breadth and depth of community hostility toward skilling and overlooks significant deficiencies in the district court jury selection process.the failure of enron wounded houston deeply.virtually overnight,what had been the city largest,most visible,and most prosperous company,its foremost social and charitable force,and a source of civic pride was reduced to a shattered shell.app.thousands of the company employees lost their jobs and saw their retirement savings vanish.as the effects rippled through the local economy,thousands of additional jobs disappeared,businesses shuttered,and community groups that once benefited from enron largesse felt the loss of millions of dollars in contributions.see,supp.record,see also,accounting firms that serviced enron books had less work,hotels had more open rooms,restaurants sold fewer meals,and so on enron community ties were so extensive that the entire local attorney office was forced to recuse itself from the government investigation into the company fall.see supp.record official press release.
with enron demise affecting the lives of so many houstonians,local media coverage of the story saturated the community.according to a defense media expert,the houston chronicle the area leading newspaper assigned as many as reporters to work on the enron story full time.app.the paper mentioned enron in more than articles during the period following the company december bankruptcy filing.hundreds of these articles discussed skilling by name.see supp.record.skilling expert,a professional journalist and academic with years experience,could not recall another instance where a local paper dedicated as many resources to a single topic over such an extended period of time as the houston chronicle dedicated to enron.app.local television news coverage was similarly pervasive and,in terms of editorial theme,largely followed the chronicle lead.at see also,at.between may and october,local stations aired an estimated news segments involving enron,more than of which mentioned skilling.supp.record.
while many of the stories were straightforward news items,many others conveyed and amplified the community outrage at the top executives perceived to be responsible for the company bankruptcy.a chronicle report on skilling testimony before congress is typical of the coverage.it began,across houston,enron employees watched former chief executive jeffrey skilling congressional testimony on television,turning incredulous,angry and then sarcastic by turns,as a man they knew as savvy and pleaded memory failure and ignorance about critical financial transactions at the energy giant.app.he is lying he knew everything,said an employee,who said she had seen skilling frequently over her years with the firm,where skilling was known for his intimate grasp of the inner doings at the company.i am getting sicker by the minute.at.a companion piece quoted a local attorney who called skilling an idiot who was in denial he added,i glad skilling not my client.at.
articles deriding enron senior executives were juxtaposed with pieces expressing sympathy toward and solidarity with the company many victims.skilling media expert counted nearly a hundred stories in the chronicle,including a layout entitled the faces of enron,which poignantly described the experiences of former employees who lost vast sums of money,faced eviction from their homes,could not afford christmas gifts for their children,and felt scared,hurt,humiliat ed,helpless,and betrayed.at.the conventional wisdom that blame for enron devastating implosion and the ensuing human tragedy ultimately rested with skilling and former enron chairman kenneth lay became so deeply ingrained in the popular imagination that references to their involvement even turned up on the sports pages if you believe the story about coach bill parcells not having anything to do with the end of emmitt smith cowboys career,then you probably believe in other concepts.like jeff skilling having nothing to do with enron collapse.supp.record.
when a federal grand jury indicted skilling,lay,and richard causey enron former chief accounting officer in on charges of conspiracy to defraud,securities fraud,and other crimes,the media placed them directly in its crosshairs.in the words of one article,there was one thing those whose lives were touched by the company all seemed to agree upon the indictment of former enron ceo jeff skilling was overdue.app.scoffing at skilling attempts to paint himself as a victim of his subordinates,at,the chronicle derided the doofus defense that lay and skilling were expected to offer,at the chronicle referred to the coming trial as the main event and the big one,which would finally bring the true measure of justice in the enron saga.record app,on the day the superseding indictment charging lay was issued,the chronicle dedicated of its front page,other full pages,and substantial portions of other pages,all in the front or business sections,to th e story.at.
citing the widely felt sense of victimhood among houstonians and the voluminous adverse publicity,skilling moved in november for a change of venue the district court denied the motion,characterizing the media coverage as largely objective and unemotional.app.to brief for united states.voir dire,it concluded,would provide an effective means to ferret out any bias in the jury pool,at see ante,at.
to that end,the district court began the jury selection process by mailing screening questionnaires to prospective jurors in november.the completed questionnaires of the respondents not excused for hardship dramatically illustrated the widespread impact of enron collapse on the houston community and confirmed the intense animosity of houstonians toward skilling and his codefendants.more than of the prospective jurors approximately of,by my count indicated that they or persons they knew had lost money or jobs as a result of the enron bankruptcy.of the jurors about of expressed views about enron or the defendants that suggested a potential predisposition to convict.in many instances,they did not mince words,describing skilling as smug,arrogant,brash,conceited,greedy,deceitful,totally unethical and criminal,a crook,the biggest liar on the face of the earth,and guilty as sin capitalization omitted only about percent of the prospective jurors of did not read the houston chronicle,had not otherwise heard or read about any of the enron cases,record,were not connected to enron victims,and gave no answers suggesting possible antipathy toward the defendants the parties jointly stipulated to the dismissal of members of the jury pool for cause,hardship,or disability,but numerous individuals who had made harsh comments about skilling remained 
on december,shortly after the questionnaires had been returned,causey pleaded guilty.the plea was covered in lead newspaper and television stories.a headline in the chronicle proclaimed that causey plea wreaks havoc for lay,skilling.record,see also ibid.quoting a former attorney who described the plea as a serious blow to the defense a chronicle editorial opined that causey admission of securities fraud.makes less plausible lay claim that most of the guilty pleas were the result of prosecutorial pressure rather than actual wrongdoing.at.
with the trial date quickly approaching,skilling renewed his motion,arguing that both the questionnaire responses and the causey guilty plea confirmed that he could not receive a fair trial in houston.in the alternative,skilling asserted that defendants are entitled to a more thorough jury selection process than currently envisioned by the c ourt.at.the court had announced its intention to question individual jurors at the bench with one attorney for each side present,and to complete the voir dire in a single day.see,at.skilling proposed,inter alia,that defense counsel be afforded a greater role in questioning,at that jurors be questioned privately in camera or in a closed courtroom where it would be easier for counsel to consult with their colleagues,clients,and jury consultants,at and that the court avoid leading questions,which tend to e licit affirmative responses from prospective jurors that may not reflect their actual views,at.at a minimum,skilling asserted,the court should grant a continuance of at least days and send a revised questionnaire to a new group of prospective jurors,at.
the district court denied skilling motion without a hearing,stating in a brief order that it was not persuaded that the evidence or arguments urged by defendants establish that pretrial publicity community prejudice raise a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.at.according to the court,the jury questionnaires sent to the remaining members of the jury panel and the court voir dire examination of the jury panel provide adequate safeguards to defendants and will result in the selection of a fair and impartial jury in this case.at.the court did agree to delay the trial by two weeks,until january.
the coming trial featured prominently in local news outlets.a,story in the chronicle described the hurt and anger and resentment that had been churn ing inside houstonians since enron collapse,at.again criticizing lay and skilling for offering a doofus defense a plea of not guilty by reason of the paper stated that lay and skilling took hundreds of millions in compensation yet now fail to accept the responsibility that went with it.ibid.the article allowed that the defendants guilt,though perhaps widely assumed,remains even now an assertion.a jury now takes up the task of deciding whether that assertion is valid.at.the next paragraph,however,assured readers that it normal for your skin to crawl when lay or skilling claim with innocence that they were unaware that something was amiss at enron.the company utter failure belies the claim.ibid.one paragraph break omitted see also,at declaring that lay and skilling would have to offer a convincing explanation for how executives once touted as corporate geniuses could be so much in the dark about the illegal activities and deceptive finances of their own company 
it is against this backdrop of widespread community impact and pervasive pretrial publicity that jury selection in skilling case unfolded.approximately prospective jurors appeared for voir dire at a federal courthouse located about six blocks from enron former headquarters.at.addressing them as a group,the district court began by briefly describing the case and providing a standard admonition about the need to be fair and impartial and to decide the case based solely on the trial evidence and jury instructions.the court then asked whether anyone had any reservations about your ability to conscientiously and fairly follow these very important rules.app.two individuals raised their hands and were called forward to the bench.one told the court that he thought lay and skilling knew exactly what they were doing and would have to prove their innocence,at.the second juror,who had stated on his written questionnaire that he held no opinion that would preclude him from being impartial,declared that he would dearly love to sit on this jury.i would love to claim responsibility,at least of the responsibility,for putting these sons of bitches away for the rest of their lives.at.the court excused both jurors for cause.
the court proceeded to question individual jurors from the bench.as the majority recounts,ante,at,the court asked them a few general questions about their exposure to news,often variations of,do you recall any particular articles that stand out that you read about the case app.the court also asked about questionnaire answers that suggested bias,focusing mainly on whether,notwithstanding seemingly partial comments,the prospective jurors believed they could be fair and put the government to its proof.at.counsel were permitted to follow up on issues raised by the court.the court made clear,however,that its patience would be limited,see,at,and questioning tended to be brief generally less than five minutes per person.even so,it exposed disqualifying biases among several prospective jurors who had earlier expressed no concerns about their ability to be fair 
once it identified qualified prospective jurors,the court allowed the defense and government to exercise their allotted peremptory challenges.this left jurors and alternates,who were sworn in and instructed,for the first time,not to read anything dealing with the case or listen to any discussion of the case on radio or television or access any internet sites that may deal with the case and to inform your friends and family members that they should not discuss with you anything they may have read or heard about this case.at.start to finish,the selection process took about five hours.
skilling trial commenced the next day and lasted four months.after several days of deliberations,the jury found skilling guilty of conspiracy,counts of securities fraud,counts of making false representations to auditors,and count of insider trading it acquitted on insider trading counts.the jury found lay guilty on all counts.
on appeal,skilling asserted that he had been denied his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.addressing this claim,the court of appeals began by disavowing the district court findings concerning community hostility.there was,the court concluded,sufficient inflammatory pretrial material to require a finding of presumed prejudice,especially in light of the immense volume of coverage.at.p rejudice was also inherent in an alleged decision to plead guilty on the eve of trial.ibid.the court of appeals,moreover,faulted the district court for failing to consider the wider context.at.i t was not enough for the court merely to assess the tone of the news reporting.the evaluation of the volume and nature of reporting is merely a proxy for the real inquiry whether there could be a fair trial by an impartial jury that was not influenced by outside,irrelevant sources.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.according to the court of appeals,t he district court seemed to overlook that the prejudice came from more than just pretrial media publicity,but also from the sheer number of victims.ibid.
having determined that skilling was entitled to a presumption of prejudice,the court of appeals proceeded to explain that the presumption is rebuttable,and the government may demonstrate from the voir dire that an impartial jury was actually impanelled.at internal quotation marks omitted.describing the voir dire as exemplary,searching,and proper and thorough,at,the court concluded that t he government had met its burden of showing that the actual jury that convicted skilling was impartial,at.on this basis,the court of appeals rejected skilling claim and affirmed his convictions.
the sixth amendment right to an impartial jury and the due process right to a fundamentally fair trial guarantee to criminal defendants a trial in which jurors set aside preconceptions,disregard extrajudicial influences,and decide guilt or innocence based on the evidence presented in court.irvin dowd,see also sheppard maxwell.community passions,often inflamed by adverse pretrial publicity,can call the integrity of a trial into doubt.in some instances,this court has observed,the hostility of the community becomes so severe as to give rise to a presumption of juror prejudice.patton yount.
the court of appeals incorporated the concept of presumptive prejudice into a framework once the defendant musters sufficient evidence of community hostility,the onus shifts to the government to prove the impartiality of the jury.the majority similarly envisions a fixed point at which public passions become so intense that prejudice to a defendant rights must be presumed.the majority declines,however,to decide whether the presumption is rebuttable,as the court of appeals held.
this court has never treated the notion of presumptive prejudice so formalistically.our decisions instead merely convey the commonsense understanding that as the tide of public enmity rises,so too does the danger that the prejudices of the community will infiltrate the jury.the underlying question has always been this do we have confidence that the jury verdict was induced only by evidence and argument in open court,and not by any outside influence,whether of private talk or public print patterson colorado ex rel.attorney general of.
the inquiry is necessarily case specific.in selecting a jury,a trial court must take measures adapted to the intensity,pervasiveness,and character of the pretrial publicity and community animus.reviewing courts,meanwhile,must assess whether the trial court procedures sufficed under the circumstances to keep the jury free from disqualifying bias.murphy florida,scrutinizing the record for any indications in the totality of circumstances that petitioner trial was not fundamentally fair this court precedents illustrate the sort of steps required in different situations to safeguard a defendant constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.
at one end of the spectrum,this court has,on rare occasion,confronted such inherently prejudicial circumstances that it has reversed a defendant conviction without pausing to examine the voir dire examination of the members of the jury.rideau louisiana.in rideau,repeated television broadcasts of the defendant confession to murder,robbery,and kidnaping so thoroughly poisoned local sentiment as to raise doubts that even the most careful voir dire could have secured an impartial jury.a change of venue,the court determined,was thus the only way to assure a fair trial.see also lafave,israel,king,kerr,criminal procedure a,ed.hereinafter lafave the best reading of rideau is that the court there recognized that prejudicial publicity may be so inflammatory and so pervasive that the voir dire simply can not be trusted to fully reveal the likely prejudice among prospective jurors 
as the majority describes,ante,at,this court reached similar conclusions in estes texas,and sheppard.these cases involved not only massive pretrial publicity but also media disruption of the trial process itself.rejecting the argument that the defendants were not entitled to relief from their convictions because they ha d established no isolatable prejudice,the court described the untoward circumstances as inherently suspect.estes,at.it would have been difficult for the jurors not to have been swayed,at least subconsciously,by the bedlam that surrounded them.sheppard,at.criticizing the trial courts failures to protect the jury from outside influence,at,the court stressed that,where there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial,the judge should continue the case until the threat abates,or transfer it to another venue not so permeated with publicity.at.estes and sheppard thus applied rideau insight that in particularly extreme circumstances even the most rigorous voir dire can not suffice to dispel the reasonable likelihood of jury bias.
apart from these exceptional cases,this court has declined to discount voir dire entirely and has instead examined the particulars of the jury selection process to determine whether it sufficed to produce a jury untainted by pretrial publicity and community animus.the court has recognized that when antipathy toward a defendant pervades the community there is a high risk that biased jurors will find their way onto the panel.the danger is not merely that some prospective jurors will deliberately hide their prejudices,but also that,as part of a community deeply hostile to the accused,they may unwittingly be influenced by the fervor that surrounds them.murphy,at.to assure an impartial jury in such adverse circumstances,a trial court must carefully consider the knowledge and attitudes of prospective jurors and then closely scrutinize the reliability of their assurances of fairness.morgan illinois,p art of the guarantee of a defendant right to an impartial jury is an adequate voir dire to identify unqualified jurors 
irvin offers an example of a case in which the trial court voir dire did not suffice to counter the wave of public passion that had swept the community prior to the defendant trial,at.the local news media had extensively covered the crimes a murder spree,arous ing great excitement and indignation.at internal quotation marks omitted.following irvin arrest,the press blanketed the community with a barrage of newspaper headlines,articles,cartoons and pictures communicating numerous unfavorable details about irvin,including that he had purportedly confessed,at.nearly percent of the prospective jurors examined during the trial court voir dire entertained some opinion as to guilt ranging in intensity from mere suspicion to absolute certainty.at.of the jurors seated,thought petitioner was guilty,although each indicated that notwithstanding his opinion he could render an impartial verdict.at.
despite the seated jurors assurances of impartiality,this court invalidated irvin conviction for want of due process.it is not required,this court declared,that the jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.it is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.at.the court emphasized,however,that a juror word on this matter is not decisive,particularly when the of prejudice in the community is clear and convincing.at.many of irvin jurors,the court noted,had been influenced by the pattern of deep and bitter prejudice shown to be present throughout the community.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court did not doubt that each juror was sincere when he said that he would be fair and impartial to irvin,but w here so many,so many times,admitted prejudice,such a statement of impartiality can be given little weight.at.
the media coverage and community animosity in irvin was particularly intense.in three subsequent cases,this court recognized that cases may generate substantial publicity without stirring similar public passions.the jury selection process in such cases,the court clarified,generally need not be as exhaustive as in a case such as irvin.so long as the trial court conducts a reasonable inquiry into extrajudicial influences and the ability of prospective jurors to presume innocence and render a verdict based solely on the trial evidence,we would generally have no reason to doubt the jury impartiality 
the first of these cases,murphy,involved a defendant put on trial for a widely publicized miami beach robbery.the state trial court denied his motion for a change of venue and during voir dire excused of the prospective jurors for cause.distinguishing irvin,this court saw no indication in the voir dire of such hostility to murphy by the jurors who served in his trial as to suggest a partiality that could not be laid aside.at.although some jurors had a vague recollection of the robbery with which murphy was charged and each had some knowledge of his past crimes,none betrayed any belief in the relevance of murphy past to the present case.see also,contrasting a juror mere familiarity with a defendant or his past with an actual predisposition against him t hese indicia of impartiality,the court suggested,might be disregarded in a case where the general atmosphere in the community or courtroom is sufficiently inflammatory,but the circumstances surrounding murphy trial were not at all of that variety.at.
in a second case,yount,the defendant was granted a new trial four years after being convicted of murder.he requested a change of venue,citing pretrial publicity and the widespread local knowledge that he had previously been convicted and had made confessions that would be inadmissible in court.the state trial court denied yount motion and seated a jury following a voir dire of prospective jurors.nearly all of the prospective jurors had heard of the case,and percent admitted they would carry an opinion into the jury box.at.declining to grant relief on federal habeas review,this court stressed the significant interval between yount first trial when adverse publicity and the community sense of outrage were at their height and his second trial,which did not occur until four years later,at a time when prejudicial publicity was greatly diminished and community sentiment had softened.at.while of the seated jurors and alternates had at some time formed an opinion as to yount guilt,the particularly extensive voir dire confirmed that time had weakened or eliminated any bias they once may have harbored,at.accordingly,this court concluded,the trial court did not commit manifest error in finding that the jury as a whole was impartial.at.
this court most recently wrestled with the issue of pretrial publicity in virginia.stood accused of murdering a woman while out of prison on a work detail.citing newspaper articles about the crime,moved for a change of venue.the state trial court deferred its ruling and attempted to seat a jury.during group questioning,of the prospective jurors indicated that they had heard about the case from media or other sources.dividing these prospective jurors into panels of four,the court asked further general questions about their ability to be fair given what they had heard or read.one juror answered equivocally and was dismissed for cause.the court refused request to ask more specific questions relating to the content of news items that potential jurors might have read or seen.at.of the persons who served on the jury,had at one time or another read or heard something about the case.none had indicated that he had formed an opinion about the case or would be biased in any way.at.
rejecting attempt to analogize his case to irvin,this court observed that the cases differ both in the kind of community in which the coverage took place and in extent of media coverage.at.offense occurred in the metropolitan washington,area,which has a population of over million,and in which,unfortunately,hundreds of murders are committed each year.ibid.while the crime garnered substantial pretrial publicity,the coverage was not as pervasive as in irvin and did not contain the same sort of damaging information.at.moreover,in contrast to irvin,the seated jurors uniformly disclaimed having ever formed an opinion about the case.given these circumstances,this court rebuffed assertion that the trial court committed constitutional error by declining to make precise inquiries about the contents of any news reports that potential jurors have read.at.the court stressed,however,that its ruling was had the trial court in this case been confronted with the wave of public passion engendered by pretrial publicity that occurred in connection with irvin trial,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment might well have required more extensive examination of potential jurors than it undertook here.at.
it is necessary to determine how this case compares to our existing precedents.were the circumstances so inherently prejudicial that,as in rideau,even the most scrupulous voir dire would have been but a hollow formality incapable of reliably producing an impartial jury,at.if the circumstances were not of this character,did the district court conduct a jury selection process sufficiently adapted to the level of pretrial publicity and community animus to ensure the seating of jurors capable of presuming innocence and shutting out extrajudicial influences 
though the question is close,i agree with the court that the prospect of seating an unbiased jury in houston was not so remote as to compel the conclusion that the district court acted unconstitutionally in denying skilling motion to change venue.three considerations lead me to this conclusion.first,as the court observes,ante,at,the size and diversity of the houston community make it probable that the jury pool contained a nontrivial number of persons who were unaffected by enron collapse,neutral in their outlook,and unlikely to be swept up in the public furor.second,media coverage of the case,while ubiquitous and often inflammatory,did not,as the court points out,ante,at,contain a confession by skilling or similar evidence of specific criminal acts.for many prospective jurors,the guilty plea of codefendant and alleged causey,along with the pleas and convictions of other enron executives,no doubt suggested guilt by association.but reasonable minds exposed to such information would not necessarily have formed an indelible impression that skilling himself was guilty as charged.rideau,at a majority of the county residents were exposed repeatedly and in depth to the spectacle of rideau personally confessing in detail to the crimes with which he was later to be charged third,there is no suggestion that the courtroom in this case became,as in estes and sheppard,a carnival in which the calmness and solemnity of the proceedings was compromised.sheppard,at,internal quotation marks omitted.it is thus appropriate to examine the voir dire and determine whether it instills confidence in the impartiality of the jury actually selected 
in concluding that the voir dire adequately detect ed and defuse d juror bias,ante,at,the court downplays the extent of the community antipathy toward skilling and exaggerates the rigor of the jury selection process.the devastating impact of enron collapse and the relentless media coverage demanded exceptional care on the part of the district court to ensure the seating of an impartial jury.while the procedures employed by the district court might have been adequate in the typical case,they did not suffice in the extraordinary circumstances of this case to safeguard skilling constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.
in conducting this analysis,i am mindful of the wide discretion owed to trial courts when it comes to issues,at ante,at.trial courts are uniquely positioned to assess public sentiment and the credibility of prospective jurors.proximity to events,however,is not always a virtue.persons in the midst of a tumult often lack a panoramic view.a ppellate tribunals thus have the duty to make an independent evaluation of the circumstances.sheppard,at.in particular,reviewing courts are well qualified to inquire into whether a trial court implemented procedures adequate to keep community prejudices from infecting the jury.if the jury selection process does not befit the circumstances of the case,the trial court rulings on impartiality are necessarily called into doubt.see morgan,at without an adequate voir dire the trial judge responsibility to remove prospective jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the court instructions and evaluate the evidence can not be fulfilled quoting united states,plurality opinion see also,at kennedy,dissenting our willingness to accord substantial deference to a trial court finding of juror impartiality rests on our expectation that the trial court will conduct a sufficient voir dire to determine the credibility of a juror professing to be impartial 
as the court of appeals apprehended,the district court gave short shrift to the mountainous evidence of public hostility.for houstonians,enron collapse was an event of proportions.not only was the volume of media coverage immense and frequently intemperate,but the sheer number of victims created a climate in which animosity toward skilling ran deep and the desire for conviction was widely shared,at.
the level of public animus toward skilling dwarfed that present in cases such as murphy and.the pretrial publicity in those cases consisted of dozens of news reports,most of which were largely factual in nature.murphy,at.there was no indication that the relevant communities had been captivated by the cases or had adopted fixed views about the defendants.in contrast,the number of media reports in this case reached the tens of thousands,and denunciations of skilling were common.the much closer analogy is thus to irvin,which similarly featured a barrage of media coverage and a huge wave of public passion,at,although even that case did not,as here,involve direct harm to entire segments of the community 
attempting to distinguish irvin,the majority suggests that skilling economic offenses were less incendiary than irvin violent crime spree and that news stories about enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information rife in reports about irvin rampage of robberies and murders.ante,at.along similar lines,the district court described the facts of this case as neither heinous nor sensational.app.to brief for united states.the majority also points to the four years that passed between enron declaration of bankruptcy and the start of skilling trial,asserting that the decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat over this time.ante,at.neither of these arguments is persuasive.
first,while violent crimes may well provoke widespread community outrage more readily than crimes involving monetary loss,economic crimes are certainly capable of rousing public passions,particularly when thousands of unsuspecting people are robbed of their livelihoods and retirement savings.indeed,the record in this case is replete with examples of visceral outrage toward skilling and other enron executives.see,record,story describing the hurt and anger and resentment churn ing inside the people of houston.houstonians compared skilling to,among other things,a rapist,an axe murderer,and an al qaeda terrorist as one commentator observed,i t a sign of how shocked houstonians are about enron ignominious demise that can be invoked and is frequently to explain the shock of the company collapse.supp.record.the bad blood was so strong that skilling and other top executives hired private security to protect themselves from persons inclined to take the law into their own hands.see,app.after taking the temperature of enron victims,a local lawyer says the enron executives are wise to take security precautions 
second,the passage of time did little to soften community sentiment.contrary to the court suggestion,ante,at,this case in no way resembles yount,where,by the time of the defendant retrial,prejudicial publicity had greatly diminished and community animus had significantly waned,at see also ibid.in the months preceding the defendant retrial,newspaper reports about the case averaged less than one article per month,and public interest was minimal the enron story was a continuing saga,and publicity remained intense throughout.at.not only did enron downfall generate news coverage,but so too did a succession of subsequent events of particular note is the highly publicized guilty plea of codefendant causey just weeks before skilling trial.if anything,the time that elapsed between the bankruptcy and the trial made the task of seating an unbiased jury more difficult,not less.for many members of the jury pool,each highly publicized guilty plea or conviction likely served to increase their certainty that skilling too had engaged in if not masterminded criminal acts,particularly given that the media coverage reinforced this view.see supra,at.the trial of skilling and lay was the culmination of all that had come before.see record noting that prosecutors followed the classic pattern of working their way up through the ranks as the chronicle put it in july,shortly after the trial of several enron broadband services executives ended without convictions,the real trial,the true measure of justice in the enron saga,begins in january.let the small fry swim free if need be.we got bigger fish in need of frying.app.paragraph breaks omitted see also ibid.from the beginning,the enron prosecution has had one true measure of success lay and skilling in a cold steel cage 
any doubt that the prevailing mindset in the houston community remained overwhelmingly negative was dispelled by prospective jurors responses to the written questionnaires.as previously indicated,supra,at,more than of the prospective jurors either knew victims of enron collapse or were victims themselves,and gave responses suggesting an antidefendant bias.in many instances their contempt for skilling was palpable.see nn,supra.only a small fraction of the prospective jurors raised no red flags in their responses.and this was before causey guilty plea and the flurry of news reports that accompanied the approach of trial.one of skilling experts,a political scientist who had studied pretrial publicity for over years and consulted in more than cases in which he had recommended against venue changes more often than not,c a me to the conclusion that the extent and depth of bias shown in these questionnaires is the highest or at least one of the very highest i have ever encountered.app,emphasis deleted.
given the extent of the antipathy evident both in the community at large and in the responses to the written questionnaire,it was critical for the district court to take strong measures to ensure the selection of an impartial jury free from outside influences.sheppard,at.as this court has recognized,i n a community where most veniremen will admit to a disqualifying prejudice,the reliability of the others protestations may be drawn into question.murphy,at see also groppi wisconsin,a ny judge who has sat with juries knows that in spite of forms they are extremely likely to be impregnated by the environing atmosphere quoting frank mangum,holmes,dissenting.perhaps because it had underestimated the public antipathy toward skilling,the district court voir dire was manifestly insufficient to identify and remove biased jurors 
as an initial matter,important lines of inquiry were not pursued at all.the majority accepts,for instance,that publicity about a codefendant guilty plea calls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice.ante,at.implying that the district court undertook this inquiry,the majority states that o nly two venire members recalled causey plea.ibid.in fact,the court asked very few prospective jurors any questions directed to their knowledge of or feelings about that event considering how much news the plea generated,many more than two venire members were likely aware of it.the lack of questioning,however,makes the prejudicial impact of the plea on those jurors impossible to assess.
the court also rarely asked prospective jurors to describe personal interactions they may have had about the case,or to consider whether they might have difficulty avoiding discussion of the case with family,friends,or colleagues during the course of the lengthy trial.the tidbits of information that trickled out on these subjects provided cause for concern.in response to general questions,several prospective jurors volunteered that they had spoken with others about the case.juror,for example,indicated that her husband was the news person,that they had talked about it,that she had also heard things from work,and that what she heard was all negative,of course.app.the court,however,did not seek elaboration about the substance of these interactions.surely many prospective jurors had similar conversations,particularly once they learned upon receiving the written questionnaire that they might end up on skilling jury.
prospective jurors personal interactions,moreover,may well have left them with the sense that the community was counting on a conviction.yet this too was a subject the district court did not adequately explore.on the few occasions when prospective jurors were asked whether they would feel pressure from the public to convict,they acknowledged that it might be difficult to return home after delivering a verdict.juror,for instance,told the court,i think a lot of people feel that they guilty.and maybe they expecting something to come out of this trial.at.it would be tough,she recognized,to vote not guilty and go back into the community.at see also,at juror admitting some hesitancy about telling people the government did prove its case 
with respect to potential nonmedia sources of bias,the district court exchange with juror is particularly troubling although juror responded in the negative when asked whether she had read anything in the newspaper that stood out in her mind,she volunteered that she just heard that,between the two of them,skilling and lay had million to contribute for their case and that there was an insurance policy that they could collect on,also.at.this information,she explained,was just something i overheard today other jurors talking.ibid.it seemed suspicious,she intimated,to have an insurance policy ahead of time.at.the court advised her that most corporations provide insurance for their officers and directors.ibid.the court,however,did not investigate the matter further,even though it had earlier instructed prospective jurors not to talk to each other about the case,at.it is thus not apparent whether other prospective jurors also overheard the information and whether they too believed that it reflected unfavorably on the defendants nor is it apparent what other outside information may have been shared among the venire members.at the very least,juror statements indicate that the court questions were failing to bring to light the extent of jurors exposure to potentially prejudicial facts and that some prospective jurors were having difficulty following the court directives.
the topics that the district court did cover were addressed in cursory fashion.most prospective jurors were asked just a few questions about their general exposure to media coverage and a handful of additional questions concerning any responses to the written questionnaire that suggested bias.in many instances,their answers were unenlightening yet the court rarely sought to draw them out with questions about their impressions of enron or skilling and showed limited patience for counsel followup efforts.see,at,when prospective jurors were more forthcoming,their responses tended to highlight the ubiquity and negative tone of the local news coverage,thus underscoring the need to press the more guarded members of the venire for further information juror,for example,mentioned hearing a radio program that very morning in which a former enron employee compared persons who did not think skilling was guilty to holocaust deniers.see,at h e said he thought that he would find them guilty automatically if he was on the jury because he said that it would be worse than a german trying to say that they did kill the jews other jurors may well have encountered,and been influenced by,similarly incendiary rhetoric.
these deficiencies in the form and content of the voir dire questions contributed to a deeper problem the district court failed to make a sufficiently critical assessment of prospective jurors assurances of impartiality.although the court insists otherwise,ante,at,the voir dire transcript indicates that the district court essentially took jurors at their word when they promised to be fair.indeed,the court declined to dismiss for cause any prospective juror who ultimately gave a clear assurance of impartiality,no matter how much equivocation preceded it.juror,for instance,wrote on her questionnaire that skilling was not an honest man.app.during questioning,she acknowledged having previously thought the defendants were guilty,and she disclosed that she lost in her k as a result of enron collapse,at.but she ultimately agreed that she would be able to presume innocence,at.noting that she blame d enron for the loss of her money and appeared to have unshakeable bias,skilling counsel challenged her for cause,at.the court,however,declined to remove her,stating that she answered candidly she going to have an open mind now and agree ing with the government assertion that we have to take her at her word.at as this court has made plain,jurors assurances of impartiality simply are not entitled to this sort of talismanic significance.see,murphy,at t he juror assurances that he is equal to th e task can not be dispositive of the accused rights irvin,at where so many,so many times,admi t prejudice,a statement of impartiality can be given little weight 
worse still,the district court on a number of occasions accepted declarations of impartiality that were equivocal on their face.prospective jurors who hope d they could presume innocence and did not necessarily think skilling was guilty were permitted to remain in the pool.app.juror,for instance,wrote of lay on her questionnaire,shame on him.at.asked by the court about this,she stated that,innocent or guilty,he was at the helm and should have known what was going on at the company.see also,at skilling is probably in the same boat as lay.the court then asked,can you presume,as you start this trial,that lay is innocent at.she responded,i hope so,but you know.i do know.i ca honestly answer that one way or the other.see also,at i bring in my past history.i bring in my biases.i would like to think i could rise above those,but i never been in this situation before.so i do know how i could honestly answer that question one way or the other.i do have some concerns eventually,however,juror answered yes when the court asked if she would be able to acquit if she had a reasonable doubt that the defendants are guilty.at.challenging her for cause,defense counsel insisted that they had not received a clear and unequivocal answer about her ability to be fair.ibid.the court denied the challenge,stating,you know,she tried.ibid.
the majority takes solace in the fact that most of the persons actually seated as jurors and alternates specifically stated that they had paid scant attention to news.ante,at,and in context,however,these general declarations reveal little about the seated jurors actual knowledge or views or the possible pressure they might have felt to convict,and thus can not instill confidence that the jurors were not under the sway of the prevailing community sentiment.ante,at.jurors who did not get into details of enron complicated accounting schemes,app,nevertheless knew the outline of the story,including that skilling and lay had been cast as the leading villains.juror,for instance,told the court that she may have heard a little bit about litigation but had not really pa id attention.at.yet she was clearly aware of some specifics.on her questionnaire,despite stating that she had not followed news,she wrote about whistleblowers and arthur andersen lying about enron accounting,and she expressed the view that skilling and lay probably knew they were breaking the law.supp.app.during questioning,which lasted barely four minutes,the district court obtained no meaningful information about the actual extent of juror familiarity with the case or the basis for her belief in skilling guilt.yet it nevertheless accepted her assurance that she could absolutely presume innocence.app.
indeed,the district court anemic questioning did little to dispel similar doubts about the impartiality of numerous other seated jurors and alternates.in my estimation,more than half of those seated made written and oral comments suggesting active antipathy toward the defendants.the majority thus misses the mark when it asserts that skilling seated jurors exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown in irvin.ante,at.juror,for instance,reported on his written questionnaire that he knew several who owned enron stock that he personally may have owned enron stock through a mutual fund that he heard and read about the enron cases from the houston chronicle,all three houston news channels,fox news,talking with friends and,and texas lawyer magazine that he believed enron collapse was due to greed and mismanagement that i f lay did not know what was going on in his company,he was really a poor and that the defendants were suspect.supp.app.during questioning,he said he th ought he could presume innocence and believe d he could put the government to its proof,but he also acknowledged that he might have some hesitancy in telling people the government did prove its case.app.
juror wrote that he work ed with someone who worked at enron that he got news from the houston chronicle,channel news,channel news,factor,and talking with friends and that he regularly visited the chronicle web site that greed on enron part caused the company collapse and that a lot of people were hurt financially.supp.app.during questioning,he stated that he would have no problem requiring the government to prove its case,but he also told the court that he believed lay was greedy and that corporate executives are often stretching the legal limits.i not going to say that they all crooks,but,you know.app.asked whether he would star t the case with sort of an inkling that because lay is greedy he must have done something illegal,he offered an indeterminate not necessarily.at 
while several seated jurors and alternates did not make specific comments suggesting prejudice,their written and oral responses were so abbreviated as to make it virtually impossible for the district court reliably to assess whether they harbored any latent biases.juror,for instance,wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard about the enron cases from the n ews.supp.app.the court questioned him for two minutes,during which time he confirmed that he had heard what on the news,basically,including that the trial had moved from the to the.he added that the story was all over the news on every detail of enron.app.no meaningful information about his knowledge or attitudes was obtained.similarly,juror wrote that she had not followed news but was aware that m any people lost their jobs.supp.app.the court questioned her for less than seconds.during that time,she acknowledged that she had caught glimpses of the coverage and kn e w generally,you know,that the company went bankrupt and that there were some employees that went off and did their own businesses.app.little more was learned 
in assessing the likelihood that bias lurked in the minds of at least some of these seated jurors,i find telling the way in which voir dire played out.when the district court asked the prospective jurors as a group whether they had any reservations about their ability to presume innocence and put the government to its proof,only two answered in the affirmative,and both were excused for cause,at.the district court individual questioning,though truncated,exposed disqualifying prejudices among numerous additional prospective jurors who had earlier expressed no concerns about their impartiality.see,supra.it thus strikes me as highly likely that at least some of the seated jurors,despite stating that they could be fair,harbored similar biases that a more probing inquiry would likely have exposed.yount,at,holding that the trial court particularly extensive voir dire assured the jury impartiality 
the majority suggests,ante,at,that the jury decision to acquit skilling on nine relatively minor insider trading charges confirms its impartiality.this argument,however,mistakes partiality with bad faith or blind vindictiveness.jurors who act in good faith and sincerely believe in their own fairness may nevertheless harbor disqualifying prejudices.such jurors may well acquit where evidence is wholly lacking,while subconsciously resolving closer calls against the defendant rather than giving him the benefit of the doubt.united states mcveigh,supp,wd prejudice may go unrecognized in those who are affected by it.the prejudice that may deny a fair trial is not limited to a bias or discriminatory attitude.it includes an impairment of the deliberative process of deductive reasoning from evidentiary facts resulting from an attribution to something not included in the evidence.that something has its most powerful effect if it generates strong emotional responses in this regard,it is significant that the government placed relatively little emphasis on the nine insider trading counts during its closing argument,declining to explain its theory on all but one of the counts in any detail whatsoever.record.the acquittals on those counts thus provide scant basis for inferring a lack of prejudice.
in sum,i can not accept the majority conclusion that voir dire gave the district court a sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service.ante,at.taken together,the district court failure to cover certain vital subjects,its superficial coverage of other topics,and its uncritical acceptance of assurances of impartiality leave me doubtful that skilling jury was indeed free from the animosity that pervaded the community at large.r egardless of the heinousness of the crime charged,the apparent guilt of the offender,or the station in life which he occupies,our system of justice demands trials that are fair in both appearance and fact.irvin,at.because i do not believe skilling trial met this standard,i would grant him relief.

we also granted certiorari and heard arguments this term in two other cases raising questions concerning the statute scope.see black united states,weyhrauch united states.today we vacate and remand those decisions in light of this opinion.black,post,weyhrauch,post.
assuming,as the fifth circuit found,that a presumption of prejudice arose in houston,the question presented in skilling petition for certiorari casts his argument as an inquiry into when,if ever,that presumption may be rebutted.see pet.for cert.although we find a presumption of prejudice unwarranted in this case,we consider the issue to be fairly subsumed within the question we agreed to decide.see this court rule a.
venue transfer in federal court is governed by federal rule of criminal procedure,which instructs that a court must transfer the proceeding to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a prejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that the defendant can not obtain a fair and impartial trial there.as the language of the rule suggests,calls on the necessity of transfer are granted a healthy measure of respect.see platt minnesota mining.federal courts have invoked the rule to move certain highly charged cases,for example,the prosecution arising from the bombing of the alfred murrah federal office building in oklahoma city.see united states mcveigh,supp,wd.they have also exercised discretion to deny requests in cases involving substantial pretrial publicity and community impact,for example,the prosecutions resulting from the world trade center bombing,see united states salameh,no.cr.ktd sdny,united states yousef,no.cr.ktd sdny,july,aff,and the prosecution of john walker lindh,referred to in the press as the american taliban,see united states lindh,supp,ed.skilling does not argue,distinct from his due process challenge,that the district court abused its discretion under rule by declining to move his trial.we therefore review the district court decision only for compliance with the constitution.
murphy involved the robbery prosecution of the notorious jack murphy,a convicted murderer who helped mastermind the heist of the star of india sapphire from new york american museum of natural history.pointing to extensive press coverage about him,murphy moved to transfer venue,at.the trial court denied the motion and a jury convicted murphy.we affirmed.murphy trial,we explained,was markedly different from the proceedings at issue in rideau louisiana,estes texas,and sheppard maxwell,which entirely lack ed the solemnity and sobriety to which a defendant is entitled in a system that subscribes to any notion of fairness and rejects the verdict of a mob.at.voir dire revealed no great hostility toward murphy s ome of the jurors had a vague recollection of the robbery with which he was charged and each had some knowledge of his past crimes,but none betrayed any belief in the relevance of his past to the present case.at footnote omitted.
in yount,the media reported on jon yount confession to a brutal murder and his prior conviction for the crime,which had been reversed due to a violation of miranda arizona.during voir dire,of prospective jurors acknowledged they would carry an opinion into the jury box,and of the seated jurors and alternates admitted they had formed an opinion as to yount guilt,at.nevertheless,we rejected yount claim.the adverse publicity and community outrage,we noted,were at their height prior to yount first trial,four years before the second prosecution time had helped sooth e and eras e community prejudice,at.
skilling reliance on estes and sheppard is particularly misplaced those cases involved media interference with courtroom proceedings during trial.see supra,at.skilling does not assert that news coverage reached and influenced his jury after it was empaneled.
according to a survey commissioned by skilling in conjunction with his first motion for a venue change,only of houstonians named him when asked to list enron executives they believed guilty of crimes.app.in response to the question w hat words come to mind when you hear the name jeff skilling of respondents failed to say a single negative word,at either had never heard of skilling or stated that nothing came to mind when they heard his name,and another knew skilling name was associated with enron but reported no opinion about him,record see app.
as the united states summarizes,i n hirko,the jury deliberated for several days and did not convict any enron defendant in bayly,which was routinely described as the first enron criminal trial,the jury convicted five defendants,but acquitted a former enron executive.at the sentencing phase of bayly,the jury found a loss amount of slightly over million,even though the government had argued that the true loss was million.brief for united states citation omitted.
the fifth circuit,moreover,did not separate media attention aimed at skilling from that devoted to enron downfall more generally.data submitted by skilling in support of his first motion for a venue transfer suggested that a slim percentage of stories specifically named him.app.w hen publicity is about the event,rather than directed at individual defendants,this may lessen any prejudicial impact.united states hueftle.
the parties disagree about whether a presumption of prejudice can be rebutted,and,if it can,what standard of proof governs that issue.compare brief for petitioner with brief for united states.because we hold that no presumption arose,we need not,and do not,reach these questions.
the dissent acknowledges that the prospect of seating an unbiased jury in houston was not so remote as to compel the conclusion that the district court acted unconstitutionally in denying skilling motion to change venue.post,at.the dissent conclusion that skilling did not receive a fair trial accordingly turns on its perception of the adequacy of the process.
the dissent recognizes the wide discretion owed to trial courts when it comes to issues,post,at quoting virginia,but its analysis of the district court voir dire sometimes fails to demonstrate that awareness.for example,the dissent faults the district court for not questioning prospective jurors regarding their knowledge of or feelings about causey guilty plea.post,at.but the court could reasonably decline to ask direct questions involving causey plea to avoid tipping off uninformed venire members that the plea had occurred.app.counsel for skilling urged district court to find a way to question venire members about causey without mentioning anything nothing inhibited defense counsel from inquiring about venire members knowledge of the plea indeed,counsel posed such a question,at post,at,acknowledging that counsel squeeze d in an inquiry whether a venire member had read about any guilty pleas in this case over the last month or two internal quotation marks omitted.from this court lofty and panoramic vantage point,post,at,lines of voir dire inquiry that might be helpful in assessing whether a juror is impartial are not hard to conceive,at.to be constitutionally compelled,however,it is not enough that such questions might be helpful.rather,the trial court failure to ask these questions must render the defendant trial fundamentally unfair.at.according appropriate deference to the district court,we can not characterize in this case as fundamentally unfair.supra,at,same selection process was used in other prosecutions.
in addition to focusing on the adequacy of voir dire,our decisions have also take n into account other measures that were used to mitigate the adverse effects of publicity.nebraska press stuart.we have noted,for example,the prophylactic effect of emphatic and clear instructions on the sworn duty of each juror to decide the issues only on evidence presented in open court.at.here,the district court instructions were unequivocal the jurors,the court emphasized,were duty bound to reach a fair and impartial verdict in this case based solely on the evidence they hear d and read in th e courtroom.app.peremptory challenges,too,provid e protection against prejudice,united states ex rel.darcy handy,the district court,as earlier noted,exercised its discretion to grant the defendants two extra peremptories,app.see supra,at.
the dissent analysis undervalues the questionnaire,a part of the selection process difficult to portray as cursory,post,at,or anemic,post,at.notably,the questions about prospective jurors impressions of enron or skilling that the dissent contends should have been asked,post,at,were asked on the questionnaire,see supra,at.moreover,the district court gave skilling counsel relatively free rein to ask venire members about their responses on the questionnaire.see,app,at.the questionnaire plus opportunity to interrogate potential jurors surely gave skilling counsel clear avenue s for permissible inquiry.but see post,at.see also app.counsel for skilling judge,for the record,if i do ask any questions,it because the court and other counsel have covered it.
one of the earlier prosecutions targeted the big five public accounting firm arthur andersen.see supra,at.among media readers and auditors,the name and reputation of arthur andersen likely sparked no less attention than the name and reputation of jeffrey skilling.supra,at.
in considering whether skilling was tried before an impartial jury,the dissent relies extensively on venire members not selected for that jury.see,post,at,quoting the questionnaires of ten venire members all were excused for cause before voir dire commenced,see record post,at,quoting the questionnaires of venire members none sat on skilling jury post,at,quoting voir dire testimony of six venire members none sat on skilling jury post,at reporting at length voir dire testimony of venire members,and none sat on skilling jury.statements by nonjurors do not themselves call into question the adequacy of the process elimination of these venire members is indeed one indicator that the process fulfilled its function.critically,as discussed infra,at,the seated jurors showed little knowledge of or interest in,and were personally unaffected by,enron downfall.

as the circuit observed,reviewing the impact on jurors of media coverage of the watergate scandal,t his may come as a surprise to lawyers and judges,but it is simply a fact of life that matters which interest them may be less fascinating to the public generally.united states haldeman.see also in re charlotte observer,r emarkably in the eyes of many,c ases such as those involving the watergate defendants,the abscam defendants,and john delorean,all characterized by massive pretrial media reportage and commentary,nevertheless proceeded to trial with juries which were satisfactorily disclosed to have been unaffected indeed,in some instances blissfully unaware of or untouched by that publicity.brief for abc,et as amici curiae describing other examples.
one juror did not check any box,explaining that she lived in another state when enron went bankrupt and therefore was not fully aware of all the facts regarding enron fall and the media coverage.supp.app.juror.two other jurors,juror and juror,indicated in answer to a different question that they had an opinion about skilling guilt,but voir dire established they could be impartial.see infra,at,and.
the court viewed with skepticism,for example,venire member promises that she could abide by law,follow the court instructions,and find skilling not guilty if the government did not prove its case,app.i have to gauge demeanor,all the answers she gave me,the court stated,and s he persuaded me that she could not be fair and impartial,so she excused,at.
the dissent asserts that the government placed relatively little emphasis on these insider trading counts during its closing argument.post,at.as the record shows,however,counsel described in detail the evidence supporting count,one of the counts on which the jury returned a verdict.see record.skilling,government counsel asserted,sold half of his stock based on material inside information and then lied in testimony before the securities and exchange commission sec by claiming the only reason he sold enron stock was because of the september terrorist attacks.at internal quotation marks omitted.as counsel summarized skilling used our nation tragedy to cover his tracks.i suggest the reason he was lying is because he did want the sec to know that he had done it before.t hat count.that proof beyond a reasonable doubt.at.regarding the remaining counts,counsel reminded jurors they had heard similar evidence of skilling other sales,and urged them to conclude,based on the evidence,that skilling had information that he used to sell his stock at the key periods in time.ibid.
skilling emphasizes that voir dire did not weed out every juror who suffered from enron collapse because the district court failed to grant his challenge to venire member,whose retirement fund lost due to ripple effects from the decline in the value of enron stock.app.critically,however,venire member did not sit on skilling jury instead,skilling struck her using a peremptory challenge.i f a defendant elects to cure a trial judge erroneous ruling by exercising a peremptory challenge,and is subsequently convicted by a jury on which no biased juror sat,we have held,he has not been deprived of any constitutional right.united states.indeed,the use of a peremptory challenge to effect an instantaneous cure of the error exemplifies a principal reason for peremptories to help secure the constitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury.at.
skilling trial counsel and jury consultants apparently did not regard juror as so obvious ly bias ed,brief for petitioner,as to warrant exercise of a peremptory challenge.
although skilling raised no objection to juror and juror at trial,his briefs in this court impugn their impartiality.brief for petitioner reply brief.even if we allowed these tardy pleas,the voir dire testimony of the two jurors gives sufficient assurance that they were unbiased.see,app.juror did not prejudge skilling guilt,indicated he could follow the court instructions and make the government prove its case,stated he could be fair to skilling,and said he would judge on the facts at juror had not formed an opinion on whether skilling was guilty and affirmed she could adhere to the presumption of innocence.
our decisions have rightly set a high bar for allegations of juror prejudice due to pretrial publicity.see,patton yount,murphy florida.news coverage of civil and criminal trials of public interest conveys to society at large how our justice system operates.and it is a premise of that system that jurors will set aside their preconceptions when they enter the courtroom and decide cases based on the evidence presented.trial judges generally take care so to instruct jurors,and the district court did just that in this case.app.
in addition to upholding prosecutions,courts also increasingly approved use of the statute to attack corruption that deprived victims of other kinds of intangible rights,including election fraud and privacy violations.see,cleveland united states,mcnally united states,and nn.stevens,dissenting.

justice scalia emphasizes divisions in the courts of appeals regarding the source and scope of fiduciary duties.post,at.but these debates were rare in bribe and kickback cases.the existence of a fiduciary relationship,under any definition of that term,was usually beyond dispute examples include public,see,united states mandel,see,united states bohonus,and union members,see,united states price.see generally chiarella united states,noting the established doctrine that a fiduciary duty arises from a specific relationship between two parties

justice scalia charges that our construction of is not interpretation but invention.post,at.stating that he know s of no precedent for paring down the case law to its core,he contends that the court today wield s a power we long ago abjured the power to define new federal crimes,post,at.see also,post,at.as noted supra,at,and,cases paring down federal statutes to avoid constitutional shoals are legion.these cases recognize that the court does not legislate,but instead respects the legislature,by preserving a statute through a limiting interpretation.see united states lanier,this court does not create a common law crime by adopting a narrow ing constru ction.internal quotation marks omitted supra,at.given that the courts of appeals uniformly recognized bribery and kickback schemes as fraud before mcnally,and that these schemes composed the lion share of cases,limiting to these heartland applications is surely fairly possible.boos barry,clark martinez,opinion of the court by scalia,when adopting a limiting construction,t he lowest common denominator,as it were,must govern so construed,the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.see infra,at post,at.only by taking a wrecking ball to a statute that can be salvaged through a reasonable narrowing interpretation would we act out of step with precedent.
if congress were to take up the enterprise of criminalizing undisclosed by a public official or private employee,brief for united states,it would have to employ standards of sufficient definiteness and specificity to overcome due process concerns.the government proposes a standard that prohibits the taking of official action by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owes a fiduciary duty,so long as the employee acts with a specific intent to deceive and the undisclosed conduct could influence the victim to change its behavior,at.see also,at.that formulation,however,leaves many questions unanswered.how direct or significant does the conflicting financial interest have to be to what extent does the official action have to further that interest in order to amount to fraud to whom should the disclosure be made and what information should it convey these questions and others call for particular care in attempting to formulate an adequate criminal prohibition in this context.
overlap with other federal statutes does not render superfluous.the principal federal bribery statute,for example,generally applies only to federal public officials,so application to state and local corruption and to fraud reaches misconduct that might otherwise go unpunished.
the fifth circuit appeared to prejudge this issue,noting that,if any of the three objects of skilling conspiracy offers a legally insufficient theory,it must set aside his conviction.at.that reasoning relied on the mistaken premise that hedgpeth pulido,per curiam,governs only cases on collateral review.see,at.analysis,we clarify,applies equally to cases on direct appeal.accordingly,the fifth circuit,on remand,should take a fresh look at the parties arguments.
the court is untroubled by these divisions because these debates were rare in bribe and kickback cases,in which t he existence of a fiduciary relationship,under any definition of that term,was usually beyond dispute,ante,at.this misses the point.the courts of appeals may have consistently found unlawful the acceptance of a bribe or kickback by one or another sort of fiduciary,but they have not consistently described as the statute does not any test for who is a fiduciary.
courts since enactment have fared no better,reproducing some of the same disputes that predated mcnally.see,sorich united states,scalia,dissenting from denial of certiorari slip,at collecting cases.we have previously found important to our vagueness analysis the conflicting results which have arisen from the painstaking attempts of enlightened judges in seeking to carry out a statute in cases brought before them.united states cohen grocery.i am at a loss to explain why the court barely mentions those conflicts today.
the only alleged precedent the court dares to describe is civil service comm letter carriers.that case involved a provision of the hatch act incorporating prior adjudications of the civil service commission.we upheld the provision against a vagueness challenge not,however,by paring down the adjudications to a more narrow rule that we invented,but by concluding that what they held was not vague.see,at.the string of cases the court lists,see ante,at,almost none of which addressed claims of vagueness,have nothing to do with paring down.the one that comes closest,united states photographs,specified a time limit within which proceedings authorized by statute for the forfeiture of obscene imported materials had to be commenced and completed.that is not much different from reading in a requirement for obligations undertaken in contracts,and can hardly be described as a rewriting or paring down of the statute.the court relied on legislative history anticipating that the proceedings would be prompt,at,and noted that unlike here it was not decid ing issues of policy,at.

of course,even if the jury selection process is adequate,a trial court violates a defendant right to an impartial jury if it erroneously denies a challenge to a biased venire member who ultimately sits on the jury.see,united states,t he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause would require reversal 
whether the district court abused its discretion in declining to change venue pursuant to the federal rules of criminal procedure is a different question.see fed.rule crim.proc.a upon the defendant motion,the court must transfer the proceeding against that defendant to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a prejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that the defendant can not obtain a fair and impartial trial there as this court has indicated,its supervisory powers confer more latitude to set standards for the conduct of trials in federal courts than in state courts.virginia.while the circumstances may not constitutionally compel a change of venue without pausing to examine the voir dire,rideau louisiana,the widely felt sense of victimhood among houstonians and the community animus toward skilling certainly meant that the task of reliably identifying untainted jurors posed a major challenge,with no guarantee of success.it likely would have been far easier to empanel an impartial jury in a venue where the enron story had less salience.i thus agree with the court of appeals that i t would not have been imprudent for the district c ourt to have granted skilling transfer motion.skilling,however,likely forfeited any rule or supervisory powers claim by failing to present it either in his opening brief before the fifth circuit,see,at,or in his petition for certiorari,ante,at.

among the highlights in,skilling testified before congress,and other enron executives invoked their fifth amendment rights enron auditor arthur andersen was indicted,tried,convicted,and sentenced on charges of obstruction of justice the enron task force charged enron cfo and andrew fastow with fraud,money laundering,and other crimes and at least two enron employees pleaded guilty on fraud and tax charges.in,the enron task force indicted numerous enron employees,including ben glisan,the company treasurer,lea fastow wife of andrew and an assistant treasurer,and more than half a dozen executives of enron broadband services several enron employees entered guilty pleas and received prison sentences and enron filed its bankruptcy reorganization plan.in,andrew and lea fastow both pleaded guilty skilling and causey were indicted in february a superseding indictment adding lay was filed in july a number of additional enron employees entered guilty pleas and former enron employees and merrill lynch bankers were defendants in a trial in houston concerning an enron deal involving the sale of nigerian barges.in,a trial was held in houston for five executives of enron broadband services various pretrial proceedings occurred in the run up to the trial of skilling,lay,and causey and,three weeks before the scheduled trial date,causey pleaded guilty to securities fraud.
the majority points out that the jury selection processes in the three previous enron trials that had been held in houston were similarly brief.see ante,at.the circumstances of those cases,however,were very different.in particular,the defendants had not been personally subjected to anything approaching the withering public criticism that had been directed at skilling and lay.as earlier noted,see,supra,at,it was the trial of skilling and lay that was widely seen as the climactic event of the enron saga.accordingly,my conclusion that the jury selection process in this unusual case did not suffice to select an impartial jury does not cast doubt on the adequacy of the processes used in the earlier enron prosecutions.
moreover,in referencing the length of the voir dire in this case,i do not mean to suggest that length should be a principal measure of the adequacy of a jury selection process.trial courts,including this one,should be commended for striving to be efficient,but they must always take care to ensure that their expeditiousness does not compromise a defendant right.i also express no view with respect to versus voir dire.federal rule of criminal procedure a gives district courts discretion to choose between these options,and i have no doubt that either is capable of producing an impartial jury even in high profile cases so long as the trial court assures that the scope of the voir dire is tailored to the circumstances.

the majority criticism of skilling counsel for failing to ask questions of many of the prospective jurors,ante,at,is thus misplaced.given the district court express warning early in the voir dire that it would not allow counsel to ask individual questions if they abuse d that right,app,counsel can hardly be blamed for declining to test the court boundaries at every turn.moreover,the court perfunctory exchanges with prospective jurors often gave counsel no clear avenue for further permissible inquiry.
although the district court underestimated the extent of the community hostility,it was certainly aware of the ubiquity of the pretrial publicity,acknowledging that all of us have been exposed to substantial media attention about this case.at.the court even made an offhand remark about one of the prior enron prosecutions,the nigerian barge case,apparently expecting that the prospective jurors would understand the reference,at.
taking a more line than most prospective jurors,juror stated that he thought the guy on the radio was pretty narrow minded,that everyone should be considered innocent totally until they get a chance to come to court,and that the government might have been overzealous in some of its prosecutions,at.he added,however,that he believe d there was probably some accounting fraud at enron.at.the district court denied the government request to remove juror for cause,but he did not ultimately sit on the jury.
the majority attempts to downplay the significance of juror by noting that she did not end up on the jury because skilling used a peremptory challenge to remove her.see ante,at.the majority makes a similar point with respect to other venire members who were not ultimately seated.see ante,at.the comments of these venire members,however,are relevant in assessing the impartiality of the seated jurors,who were similarly part of a community deeply hostile to the accused and who may have been unwittingly influenced by it.murphy florida,see also irvin dowd.moreover,the fact that the district court failed to remove persons as dubiously qualified as juror goes directly to the adequacy of its voir dire.if juror made it through to the end of the selection process,it is difficult to have confidence in the impartiality of the jurors who sat,especially given how little is known about many of them.lafave f,at the responses of those not seated casts light on the credibility of the seated jurors who were familiar with the same publicity 
the majority also notes that about of the seated jurors and alternates of had no personal enron connection.ante,at,and.this means,of course,that five of the seated jurors and alternates did have connections to friends or colleagues who had lost jobs or money as a result of enron collapse a fact that does not strike me as particularly reassuring.
as one of skilling jury experts observed,there is a tendency in voir dire of jury pool members in cases to minimize their exposure to media,their knowledge of prejudicial information,and any biases they may have.app.see also,at those who perceive themselves or wish to be perceived as good citizens are reluctant to admit they can not be fair for this reason,the fact that none of the seated jurors and alternates checked the yes box on the written questionnaire when asked whether they ha d an opinion about skilling,ante,at,is of minimal significance,particularly given that the causey plea and the impending trial received significant media coverage after the questionnaires were submitted.
many other seated jurors and alternates expressed similarly troubling sentiments.see,supp.app.juror obtained news from the chronicle and local news stations blamed enron collapse on n ot enough corporate controls or effective audit procedures to prevent mismanagement of corporate assets and was angry that so many people lost their jobs and their retirement savings at juror followed news from various sources,including the chronicle was angry about what happened and fe lt bad for those that worked hard and invested in the corp oration only to have it all taken away at juror had several friends who worked at enron and lost money heard about the enron cases on the news described the collapse as sad because people lost jobs and money lots of money and believed the government did the right thing in its investigation,at juror received news from the chronicle,channel news,the factor,internet news sources,and friends,family,and attributed enron collapse to p oor management and bad judgment greed lamented t he sad state of the loyal employees who are left with nothing in their retirement accounts and admire d the bravery of enron sherron watkins for bringing the situation to the attention of the public,which stopped things from getting worse at juror heard news from his wife,and television wrote that i t not right for someone to take away the money that the small average worker saves for retirement all his life and described the government enron investigation as a good thing at juror obtained information about enron from a who was in the jury pool for fastow trial worked for an employer who lost money as a result of enron collapse found it sad that the collapse had affected such a huge number of people and thought someone had to be doing something illegal at juror knew a colleague who lost money in enron collapse obtained news from the houston chronicle,time magazine,local tv news and radio,friends,family,and,and internet news sources and noted that what stood out was t he employees and retirees that lost their savings 
several other jurors fell into this category.juror wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard about enron from the chronicle and internet news sources.at.he was questioned for seconds,during which time he indicated that he had read an article on the internet the preceding night about the jury selection taking place today,stuff like that.app.juror wrote that she had not heard or read about the enron cases and did not know anything about enron.supp.app.the district court questioned her for barely one minute.she stated that she had n ot really learned more about the case,but added that she had heard this and that from her parents.app.the court did not press further.
the majority suggests that the fact that skilling challenged only one of the seated jurors for cause indicates that he did not believe the other jurors were biased.ante,at.our decisions,however,distinguish claims involving the partiality of an individual juror from antecedent claims directed at the partiality of the trial jury as a whole.patton yount,see also frazier united states,t he two sorts of challenge s are distinct and are therefore to be dealt with separately if the jury selection process does not,as here,give a defendant a fair opportunity to identify biased jurors,t
