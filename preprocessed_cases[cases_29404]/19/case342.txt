the police found a machinegun under the passenger seat of a truck belonging to migdoel berríos bonilla berríos.after fleeing the scene of the crime,berríos contacted one of the individuals who had been in the car with him and told her to lie about knowing him.berríos eventually turned himself in and a jury convicted berríos for two weapons possession counts under,subsections g and o,as well as witness tampering in violation of b.appealing from the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,berríos challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions and alleges several procedural errors.unconvinced by berríos arguments,we affirm.
background 
on the night of august,berríos lent his ford pickup truck to rolando torres fernández torres.torres picked up five other men and met up with maría rivera mulero rivera and verónica álamo gómez álamo at a bridge.accompanied by the five unidentified males,torres drove berríos truck to a bar to meet berríos,while rivera and álamo followed in rivera car.
berríos,torres,rivera,álamo,and two of the unidentified men left and drove in berríos truck to a second bar.at the second bar,berríos and álamo danced and álamo felt something hard around the back of berríos waist although she could not tell what it was.the group then left the bar to go to a restaurant.after eating,the two unidentified men who had been sitting in the front driver and passenger seats were dropped off.
torres drove the remaining members of the group to a motel rivera was in the front passenger seat,berríos sat behind the driver seat,and álamo sat behind the passenger seat.once they arrived at the motel,torres exited and began talking to a motel employee while berríos,álamo,and rivera waited in the car.berríos left the truck when he noticed torres and the motel employee arguing.berríos asked torres what he was doing and said they should leave.the group drove away from the motel sitting in the same seats of the car as before,but the motel employee called the police to report the and gave a description of berríos truck.
three puerto rico police department officers responded to the call.the officers spotted a truck matching the dispatcher description and followed it until it stopped in front of a restaurant.álamo had spilled food on herself and exited the truck from the rear door to clean up.one of the officers,ángel hernández nieves officer hernández,exited the police car and began approaching the truck.as officer hernández neared,he saw berríos stick his head out of the open rear door and look around.officer hernández then announced himself and told everyone to exit the vehicle.berríos fled,exiting from the rear door.officer hernández pursued berríos but was unable to catch him.
álamo,rivera,and torres remained at the scene.a second officer asked torres to exit the vehicle and stand at the back of the truck on the passenger side.at that point,the officer noticed through the open rear door a firearm sticking out from underneath the passenger seat.upon further examination,the police concluded it was a glock pistol modified to shoot automatically.the police subsequently searched berríos truck and found two magazines under the same seat as the pistol,berríos driver license inside a pocket on the rear door,and a cellphone inside a pocket on the rear door.they arrested álamo,rivera,and torres.
álamo was released and subsequently spoke with berríos twice over the phone.in one conversation,berríos told álamo t hat if she was asked about him she should say she did know who he was and that everything is torres,is from him.berríos eventually turned himself in to the police on august.
berríos was charged with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and possession of a machinegun as well as witness tampering.a jury found berríos guilty on all counts.this timely appeal followed.
ii.sufficiency claims 
berríos first argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to convict him on all three counts.this court review s the sufficiency of the evidence for a conviction de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution.united states rosado pérez,cir.we conclude berríos has failed to meet this rigorous standard.
weapons charges 
berríos stipulated to all but the knowledge element of his weapons possession charges he argues,as he did at trial,that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly possessed the machinegun found in his vehicle.
knowing possession of a firearm may be proved through either actual or constructive possession.united states williams,cir.an individual constructively possesses something when he or she knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object,either directly or through others.united states ocampo guarin,cir quoting united states lamare,cir.a jury may infer knowledge from circumstantial evidence.united states ridolfi,cir.for constructive possession of a firearm in particular,the requisite knowledge and intention can be inferred from circumstances such as a defendant control over the area where the contraband is found id.quoting united states mclean,cir.in such a case,the record must contain evidence of some action,some word,or some conduct that links the individual to the firearm and indicates that he had some stake in it,some power over it.id.alteration in original quoting mclean,at.
contrary to berríos arguments,the government did not rely on his mere proximity to the weapon to prove possession.rather,it presented strong circumstantial evidence connecting berríos to the machinegun and ruling out the other potential sources of the weapon.drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution,the timeline of events unfolded as follows the police pulled up behind berríos vehicle álamo exited the car from the rear door berríos stuck his head out the rear door to look around berríos saw officer hernández and berríos ran out the rear door.this sequence of events places berríos as the last person to occupy the rear passenger seat,close to where the police found the machinegun.moreover,the government presented additional evidence connecting berríos to the rear passenger seat,including that his driver license was in a pocket inside the rear passenger side door.a reasonable jury could accept this testimony and conclude that berríos saw the police,became worried about them finding the machinegun on his person,and placed it in the most convenient hiding place inside the car before he fled.
this conclusion is further strengthened by two observations made by álamo that she felt an unidentified hard object around the back of berríos waist earlier that night and that she had not seen the machinegun until her arrest.álamo sat in the rear passenger seat two times before the gun was discovered on the drive from the second bar to the restaurant and from the restaurant to the truck ultimate stopping place.the police testified and the trial exhibits photographs of the truck interior show that the machinegun was not fully under the passenger seat,but sticking out part of the way.the fact álamo did not notice the machinegun earlier strongly suggests it was not under the passenger seat until she exited the vehicle and berríos sat there.this,in turn,helps rule out any of the unidentified men or torres and rivera who were sitting in the front seats as the machinegun owner.
we also note that the government presented evidence of berríos consciousness of guilt.berríos argues that he fled because he was on probation and did not want to be associated with torres actions at the motel.we reject berríos contention that an innocent explanation was equally as likely as a guilty one in light of the evidence.see bourjaily united states,d i ndividual pieces of evidence,insufficient in themselves to prove a point,may in cumulation prove it.we also note that berríos subsequent attempt to have álamo deny knowing him further strengthens the inference that berríos was conscious of his guilt.
finally,we reject berríos argument that the numerousness of the truck occupants created a reasonable doubt as to who placed the machinegun under the passenger seat.the government presented evidence that the machinegun did not belong to torres because another firearm was found under the driver seat.as we previously stated,the timeline of events creates a reasonable inference that the machinegun was not under the passenger seat before the police arrived and was likely placed there by berríos.we also find it dubious that those men would have left the machinegun there after they were dropped off.f actfinders may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence based on shared perceptions and understandings of the habits,practices,and inclinations of human beings,united states ortiz,cir,and people are generally not inclined to forget or store machineguns in cars that do not belong to them.despite the truck numerous occupants,a reasonable jury could have concluded that berríos placed the machinegun under the passenger seat and convicted him of both weapons possession offenses.
witness tampering 
we turn now to berríos witness tampering conviction.to convict berríos of witness tampering,the jury needed to find that berríos corruptly persuade d another person,or attempt ed to do so,with intent to influence,delay,or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding or cause or induce any person to withhold testimony.b.
berríos does not contend that calling álamo and asking her to tell the police that she did not know him would not qualify as witness tampering.he argues only that the jury should not have believed álamo testimony based on her failure to mention him asking her to lie in an earlier interview with a federal agent and that it was implausible that he told álamo to lie but not rivera the latter of whom did not testify.these arguments go to álamo credibility as a witness and it is not the appellate court function to weigh the evidence or make credibility judgments.ortiz,at.viewing álamo testimony in the light most favorable to the prosecution,a reasonable jury could have concluded that berríos spoke to her and attempted to influence her testimony.rosado pérez,at.thus,we affirm on this charge as well.
iii.motion to play tape 
in addition to his sufficiency challenge,berríos also claims that the trial court impaired his right to.specifically,berríos argues that the district court should have allowed him to introduce an audio recording of a september,interview between álamo and a federal agent as impeachment evidence.during this interview,álamo did not mention that berríos had told her to lie about knowing him.berríos sought to use this omission to impeach álamo credibility and moved to admit excerpts of an audio recording of the interview which was in spanish and a translated transcript during his.after listening to the tape,the district court determined that berríos could show álamo the interview transcript whenever she made contradictory statements and ask her if the transcript showed she told the federal agent something different.nonetheless,the district court ruled against playing the tape.
the sixth amendment protects a defendant right to effective of key adverse witnesses.united states martínez vives,cir.we engage in a review in evaluating challenges to a trial court limitation of a id.first,we review de novo to determine whether the defendant was afforded a reasonable opportunity to impeach adverse witnesses consistent with the confrontation clause.id.quoting united states callipari,cir,vacated and remanded on other grounds,d.if that threshold is met,we review the specific limitation imposed by the trial court on the defendant for an abuse of discretion.id.trial courts may restrict to prevent undue prejudice,confusion of the issues,witness badgering,redundancy,or questioning that appears to be of marginal relevance.united states vega molina,cir.
under step one of this analysis,berríos was afforded a reasonable opportunity to impeach álamo on.berríos asked álamo if she mentioned berríos request for her to lie to the federal agent who interviewed her on september.after being shown the interview transcript,álamo stated she had not.there is no doubt that berríos was able to impeach álamo and berríos does not argue otherwise.rather,he argues only that his ability to do so was limited because he was not able to play the tape.this claim we review only for abuse of discretion.
we do not believe the district court abused its discretion in light of the specific request berríos made.berríos did not ask the district court to play the entire tape or to play the tape in a manner similar to how the transcript was used,playing short snippets and asking álamo if her testimony was different from what she said on the tape.rather,he asked the district court to play the portion of the interview relating to the obstruction charge.berríos argues that the district court should have allowed him to play the tape of the interview because it was important for the jury to hear álamo tone to judge her credibility specifically,to hear that álamo was not afraid and withholding information out of fear.even assuming that hearing álamo tone could have been helpful for the jury,we think the district court properly balanced this interest against the government valid hearsay objections and its own concerns about completeness.the government motion stated that it opposed the district court playing only the parts of the tape that contain ed hearsay namely berríos proclaiming his innocence to álamo.berríos fails to cite an evidentiary rule under which these statements would have been admissible.moreover,we note that berríos requested that the district court not play the entire tape because álamo also made statements that suggested she was afraid of berríos during the interview.the district court also expressed concern that playing only berríos requested portion of the tape would prejudice the government.given these concerns,the district court properly weighed the potential for jury confusion and prejudicial impact in denying berríos motion to play the tape.
berríos argues this holding would contradict our decision in united states meises,cir.it is true that in meises we expressed concerns about the jury ability to assess witness credibility based on a district court decision to not play an audio tape.id.at.meises,however,involved a dispute between the defendant and the government about why incriminatory statements allegedly made by the defendant as testified to by a confidential informant could not be heard on the taped conversation the government argued the statements were inaudible due to malfunctioning recording equipment while the defendant argued he never said them.id.we viewed the quality of the audio recording as potentially important to the defendant ability to respond to the government argument.id.in other words,meises involved a dispute about the recording itself.berríos case does not involve such a dispute.thus,the helpfulness of the tape itself was less,and in light of the concerns noted by the district court,the potential for jury confusion and prejudice was higher.we find no abuse of discretion 
iv.jury instructions 
finally,berríos contends that the district court jury instructions contained two errors.the parties disagree over how to view berríos claims and the corresponding standard of review.berríos frames the district court decisions as refusals to give a requested instruction,which we review de novo.see united states baird,cir.the government,however,argues that the district court gave berríos requested instruction and his arguments concern the district court phrasing,which we review for abuse of discretion.see id.at.because berríos challenge fails even if we apply the standard of review most favorable to him,we assume without deciding that the district court refused his requested instruction and our review is de novo.see united states rivera gonzález,cir.
in determining whether a district court refusal to give a jury instruction is reversible error,we look to see whether the requested instruction was correct as a ma
