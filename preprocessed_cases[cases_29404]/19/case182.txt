reversed and remanded.
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court,except as to part,concluding that because magwood habeas application challenges a new judgment for the first time,it is not second or successive under b.
a this case turns on when a claim should be deemed to arise in a second or successive habeas corpus application.b.the state contends that b,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,should be read to bar claims that a prisoner had a prior opportunity to present.under this one opportunity rule,magwood claim was second and successive because he had an opportunity to raise it in his first application but did not.magwood counters that b should not apply to a first application challenging a new judgment intervening between habeas applications.this court agrees.the phrase second or successive is not defined by aedpa and it is a term of art.slack mcdaniel.to determine its meaning,the court looks first to the statutory context.section b limitations apply only to a habeas corpus application under,an application on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,b.both b text and the relief it provides indicate that second or successive must be interpreted with respect to the judgment challenged.a petitioner seeks invalidation of the judgment authorizing his confinement,wilkinson dotson.if a conditional writ is granted,the state may seek a new judgment through a new trial or a new sentencing proceeding.ibid.the state errs in contending that,if is relevant at all,custody and not judgment,is the proper reference because unlawful custody is the substance requirement for habeas relief.this argument is unpersuasive.section articulates the kind of custody that may be challenged under.because applies only to custody pursuant to a judgment,that judgment is inextricable and essential to relief.it is a requirement that distinguishes from other statutes permitting constitutional relief.see.the state custody based rule is also difficult to justify because applying second or successive to any subsequent application filed before a prisoner release would require a prisoner who remains in continuous custody for an unrelated conviction to satisfy b strict rules to challenge the unrelated conviction for the first time.nothing in the statutory text or context supports such an anomalous result.
b this court is also not convinced by the state argument that a one opportunity rule would be consistent with the statute and should be adopted because it better reflects aedpa purpose of preventing piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship.aedpa uses second or successive to modify application,not claim as the state contends,and this court has refused to adopt an interpretation of b that would elid e the difference between an application and a claim,artuz bennett.the state reading also reflects a more fundamental error.it would undermine or render superfluous much of b.in some circumstances,it would increase the restrictions on review by applying rules where b imposes no restrictions.in others,it would decrease the restrictions on review by applying more lenient rules where b mandates stricter requirements.
c this court interpretation of b is consistent with its precedents.because none of the cases that the state invokes,wong doo united states,applies second or successive to an application challenging a new judgment,these cases shed no light on the question presented here.nor do cases contradict the approach adopted here.only burton stewart,comes close to addressing the threshold question whether an application is second or successive if it challenges a new judgment,and that decision confirms that the existence of a new judgment is dispositive.in holding that both of the petitioner habeas petitions had challenged the same judgment,this court in burton expressly recognized that had there been a new judgment intervening between the habeas petitions,the result might have been different.here,there is such an intervening judgment.this is magwood first application challenging that intervening judgment.magwood challenges not the trial court error in his first sentencing,but the court new error when it conducted a full resentencing and reviewed the aggravating evidence afresh.
d because magwood has not attempted to challenge his underlying conviction,the court has no occasion to address the state objection that this reading of b allows a petitioner who obtains a conditional writ as to his sentence to file a subsequent application challenging not only his resulting,new sentence,but also his original,undisturbed conviction.nor does the court address whether magwood claim is procedurally defaulted or whether the eleventh circuit erred in rejecting his claim.

billy joe magwood,petitioner tony patterson,warden,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court,except as to part.
petitioner billy joe magwood was sentenced to death for murdering a sheriff.after the alabama courts denied relief on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings,magwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,challenging both his conviction and his sentence.the district court conditionally granted the writ as to the sentence,mandating that magwood either be released or resentenced.the state trial court conducted a new sentencing hearing and again sentenced magwood to death.magwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court challenging this new sentence.the district court once again conditionally granted the writ,finding constitutional defects in the new sentence.the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reversed,holding in relevant part that magwood challenge to his new death sentence was an unreviewable second or successive challenge under b because he could have mounted the same challenge to his original death sentence.we granted certiorari,and now reverse.because magwood habeas challenges a new judgment for the first time,it is not second or successive under b.
after a conviction for a drug offense,magwood served several years in the coffee county jail in elba,alabama,under the watch of sheriff neil grantham.during his incarceration,magwood,who had a long history of mental illness,became convinced that grantham had imprisoned him without cause,and vowed to get even upon his release.magwood followed through on his threat.on the morning of march,shortly after his release,he parked outside the jail and awaited the sheriff arrival.when grantham exited his car,magwood shot him and fled the scene.
magwood was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of an sheriff,a capital offense under alabama code a he was tried in.the prosecution asked the jury to find magwood guilty of aggravated murder as charged in the indictment,and sought the death penalty.magwood pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity however,the jury found him guilty of capital murder under a,and imposed the sentence of death based on the aggravation charged in the indictment.in accordance with alabama law,the trial court reviewed the basis for the jury decision.see.although the court did not find the existence of any statutory aggravating circumstance under,the court relied on ex parte kyzer,so,to find that murder of a sheriff while on duty or because of some official or acts,a,is a capital felony that,by definition,involves aggravation sufficient for a death sentence the trial court found that magwood young age at the time of the offense and lack of significant criminal history qualified as mitigating factors,but found no mitigation related to magwood mental state.weighing the aggravation against the two mitigating factors,the court approved the sentence of death.the alabama courts affirmed.see magwood state,so.crim.app.ex parte magwood,so.we denied certiorari.magwood alabama.after the alabama supreme court set an execution date of july,magwood filed a coram nobis petition and an application for a stay of execution.the trial court held a hearing on the petition and denied relief on july,
eight days before his scheduled execution,magwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus under,and the district court granted a stay of execution.after briefing by the parties,the district court upheld magwood conviction but vacated his sentence and conditionally granted the writ based on the trial court failure to find statutory mitigating circumstances relating to magwood mental state see magwood smith,supp,md.the court of appeals affirmed.see magwood smith.
in response to the conditional writ,the state trial court held a new sentencing proceeding in september.this time,the judge found that magwood mental state,as well as his age and lack of criminal history,qualified as statutory mitigating circumstances.as before,the court found that magwood capital felony under a included sufficient aggravation to render him death eligible.in his proposed findings,magwood attorney agreed that magwood offense rendered him death eligible,but argued that a death sentence would be inappropriate in light of the mitigating factors.the trial court imposed a penalty of death,stating on the record that the new judgment and sentence were the result of a complete and new assessment of all of the evidence,arguments of counsel,and law.sentencing,tab.the alabama courts affirmed,see magwood state,so.crim.app.ex parte magwood,so,and this court denied certiorari,see magwood alabama.
magwood filed a petition for relief under alabama former temporary rule of criminal procedure now.rule crim.proc.rule petition claiming,inter alia,that his death sentence exceeded the maximum sentence authorized by statute that his death sentence violated the fifth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments because it rested upon an unforeseeable interpretation of the capital sentencing statute and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during resentencing.the trial court denied relief.it held that the statutory basis for magwood death sentence had been affirmed on direct appeal and could not be relitigated.the trial court also held that magwood attorney played no substantive role in the resentencing and had no obligation to dispute the aggravation,given that the district court had required only that the trial court consider additional mitigating factors.
magwood appealed the denial of his rule petition,arguing,inter alia,that his sentence was unconstitutional because he did not have fair warning that his offense could be punished by death,and that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel at resentencing.see record in appeal.crim.app,tab.
the alabama court of criminal appeals affirmed,citing its decision on direct appeal as to the propriety of the death sentence.see magwood state,so,citing kyzer,so,and jackson state,so.crim.app.the alabama supreme court denied certiorari,see so,at,as did this court,see magwood alabama.
in april,magwood sought leave to file a second or successive application for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his judgment of conviction.see b a requiring authorization from the court of appeals to file a second or successive application.the court of appeals denied his request.see in re magwood.he simultaneously filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his new death sentence,which the district court conditionally granted.see magwood culliver,supp,md.in that petition,magwood again argued that his sentence was unconstitutional because he did not have fair warning at the time of his offense that his conduct would be sufficient to warrant a death sentence under alabama law,and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance during the resentencing proceeding.
before addressing the merits of magwood claim,the district court sua sponte considered whether the application was barred as a successive petition under,and concluded that it was not,at h abeas petitions challenging the constitutionality of a resentencing proceeding are not successive to petitions that challenge the underlying conviction and original sentence citing hertz liebman,federal habeas corpus practice procedure b i,ed.when a petitioner files a second or subsequent petition to challenge a criminal judgment other than the one attacked in an earlier petition,it can not be said that the two petitions are successive emphasis in original.the district court rejected the state argument that magwood had procedurally defaulted the claim by failing to present it adequately to the state courts,noting that magwood had presented the claim both in his rule petition and on appeal from the denial of that petition.see supp,at supra,at.addressing the merits,the district court ruled that magwood death sentence was unconstitutional because at the time of the offense conduct,magwood did not have fair notice that he could be sentenced to death absent at least one aggravating circumstance enumerated in former.code.supp,at.the district court also found the state court grounds for rejecting magwood claim unreasonable in light of clearly established federal law,noting that magwood attorney in fact had engaged substantively in the complete and new resentencing,and although the attorney could not be expected to object on grounds foreclosed by precedent,he was clearly ineffective for failing to raise the federal claim,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the court of appeals reversed in relevant part.see.it concluded that the first step in determining whether b applies is to separate the new claims challenging the resentencing from the old claims that were or should have been presented in the prior application.at internal quotation marks omitted.under the court of appeals approach,any claim that challenge s the new,amended component of the sentence should be regarded as part of a first petition,and any claim that challenge s any component of the original sentence that was not amended should be regarded as part of a second petition.ibid.applying this test,the court held that because magwood claim challenged the trial court reliance on the same allegedly improper aggravating factor that the trial court had relied upon for magwood original sentence,his claim was governed by b restrictions on second or successive habeas applications,at.the court of appeals then dismissed the claim because magwood did not argue that it was reviewable under one of the exceptions to b general rule requiring dismissal of claims first presented in a successive application see,at.
we granted certiorari to determine whether magwood application challenging his death sentence,imposed as part of resentencing in response to a conditional writ from the district court,is subject to the constraints that b imposes on the review of second or successive habeas applications.
as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,b provides in relevant part 
a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless a the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable or b i the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence and ii the facts underlying the claim,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
this case turns on the meaning of the phrase second or successive in b.more specifically,it turns on when a claim should be deemed to arise in a second or successive habeas corpus application.b.if an application is second or successive,the petitioner must obtain leave from the court of appeals before filing it with the district court.see b a.the district court must dismiss any claim presented in an authorized second or successive application unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies certain statutory requirements.see b.thus,if magwood application was second or successive,the district court should have dismissed it in its entirety because he failed to obtain the requisite authorization from the court of appeals.if,however,magwood application was not second or successive,it was not subject to b at all,and his claim was reviewable absent procedural default.
the state contends that although b,as amended by aedpa,applies the phrase second or successive to application s,it is a statute,brief for respondents,and c laims,not applications,are barred by b,at citing artuz bennett.according to the state,the phrase should be read to reflect a principle that a prisoner is entitled to one,but only one,full and fair opportunity to wage a collateral attack.see brief for respondents citing beyer litscher,internal quotation marks omitted.the state asserts that under this one opportunity rule,magwood claim was successive because he had an opportunity to raise it in his first application,but did not do so.see brief for respondents.
magwood,in contrast,reads b to apply only to a second or successive application challenging the same judgment.according to magwood,his resentencing led to a new judgment,and his first application challenging that new judgment can not be second or successive such that b would apply.we agree.
we begin with the text.although congress did not define the phrase second or successive,as used to modify habeas corpus application under section,b,it is well settled that the phrase does not simply refe r to all applications filed second or successively in time,panetti quarterman,see,at creating an exceptio n to b for a second application raising a claim that would have been unripe had the petitioner presented it in his first application stewart,treating a second application as part of a first application where it was premised on a newly ripened claim that had been dismissed from the first application as premature slack mcdaniel,declining to apply b to a second application where the district court dismissed the first application for lack of exhaustion 
we have described the phrase second or successive as a term of art.at.to determine its meaning,we look first to the statutory context.the limitations imposed by b apply only to a habeas corpus application under,that is,an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,b emphasis added.the reference to a judgment in b is significant because the term application can not be defined in a vacuum.a petitioner is applying for something his petition seeks invalidation in whole or in part of the judgment authorizing the prisoner confinement,wilkinson dotson,emphasis added.if his petition results in a district court granting of the writ,the state may seek a new judgment through a new trial or a new sentencing proceeding.ibid.emphasis in original.thus,both b text and the relief it provides indicate that the phrase second or successive must be interpreted with respect to the judgment challenged.
the state disagrees,contending that if the to is relevant,we should focus not on the statute reference to a judgment but on its reference to custody,brief for respondents compare a,b establishing rules for review of an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court emphasis added with a specifying that an application may be entertained only on the ground that the petitioner is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states emphasis added.the state explains that unlawful custody is the key substance requirement of,whereas being held pursuant to a judgment is merely a status requirement.brief for respondents quoting liebman hertz,federal habeas corpus practice and procedure.
we find this argument unpersuasive.section articulates the kind of confinement that may be challenged on the ground that the petitioner is being held in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.a.the requirement of custody pursuant to a judgment distinguishes from other statutory provisions authorizing relief from constitutional violations such as,which allows challenges to the judgments of federal courts,or,which allows suits against state and local officials.custody is crucial for purposes,but it is inextricable from the judgment that authorizes it.
the state custody based rule is difficult to justify for another reason.under the state approach,applying the phrase second or successive to any subsequent application filed before a prisoner release would mean that a prisoner who remains in continuous custody for a completely unrelated conviction would have to satisfy the strict rules for review under b to challenge his unrelated conviction for the first time.nothing in the statutory text or context supports,much less requires,such an anomalous result.see,beyer,at a prisoner is entitled to one collateral attack per judgment,rather than one attack per stretch of imprisonment dotson,supra,at scalia,concurring w hen a habeas petitioner challenges only one of several consecutive sentences,the court may invalidate the challenged sentence even though the prisoner remains in custody to serve the others 
appearing to recognize that magwood has the stronger textual argument,the state argues that we should rule based on the statutory purpose.according to the state,a one opportunity rule is consistent with the statutory text,and better reflects aedpa purpose of preventing piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship.
we are not persuaded.aedpa uses the phrase second or successive to modify application.see b.the state reads the phrase to modify claims.see,brief for respondents congress intent for aedpa was to eradicate successive claims we can not replace the actual text with speculation as to congress intent.we have previously found congress use of the word application significant,and have refused to adopt an interpretation of b that would elid e the difference between an application and a claim,artuz,at see also gonzalez crosby,f or purposes of b,an application for habeas relief is a filing that contains one or more claims therefore,although we agree with the state that many of the rules under b focus on claims,that does not entitle us to rewrite the statute to make the phrase second or successive modify claims as well 
the state reading leads to a second,more fundamental error.under the state one opportunity rule,the phrase second or successive would apply to any claim that the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise in a prior application.and the phrase second or successive would not apply to a claim that the petitioner did not have a full and fair opportunity to raise previously.
this reading of b would considerably undermine if not render superfluous the exceptions to dismissal set forth in b.that section describes circumstances when a claim not presented earlier may be considered intervening and retroactive case law,or newly discovered facts suggesting that no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.b b ii.in either circumstance,a petitioner can not be said to have had a prior opportunity to raise the claim,so under the state rule the claim would not be successive and b would not apply to it at all.this would be true even if the claim were raised in a second application challenging the same judgment 
in addition to duplicating the exceptions under b in some circumstances,the state rule would dilute them in others.whereas the exception to dismissal of claims not presented in a prior application applies only if the facts provide clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense,b b ii,under the state rule,all that matters is that the facts could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence,b b i.we decline to adopt a reading that would thus truncate b requirements.
we are not persuaded by the state or the dissent that the approach we take here contradicts our precedents.the state invokes several cases denying review of claims in second or successive applications where the petitioners did not avail themselves of prior opportunities to present the claims.see wong doo united states,antone dugger,per curiam woodard hutchins,per curiam delo stokes,per curiam mccleskey zant.these cases,the state contends,show that magwood claim should be dismissed as second or successive because he could have raised but did not raise the claim in his first application.
but none of these decisions applies the phrase second or successive to an application challenging a new judgment.therefore,the decisions cast no light on the question before the court today whether rules,as modified by aedpa under b,apply at all to an application challenging a new judgment.the state misplaced reliance on those cases stems from its failure to distinguish between b threshold inquiry into whether an application is second or successive,and its subsequent inquiry into whether claims in a successive application must be dismissed.
the dissent similarly errs by interpreting the phrase second or successive by reference to our longstanding doctrine governing abuse of the writ.aedpa modifies those principles and creates new statutory rules under b.these rules apply only to second or successive applications.the dissent contends that this reading renders aedpa inapplicable to a broad range of abusive claims that would have been barred under prior rules.yet,the dissent fails to cite any case in which this court has dismissed a claim as successive or abusive if the petitioner raised it in an application challenging a new judgment.
the dissent conclusion that our reading of unmoor s the phrase second or successive from its textual and historical underpinnings,post,at,is unwarranted.usage of the phrase second or successive is consistent with our reading.a review of our habeas precedents shows that cases can not affirmatively define the phrase second or successive as it appears in aedpa.congress did not even apply the phrase second or successive to applications filed by state prisoners until it enacted aedpa.the phrase originally arose in the federal context,see,supp.ii,and applied only to applications raising previously adjudicated claims,see sanders united states.after this court interpreted the law to permit dismissal of abusive claims as distinguished from successive claims,see ibid.congress codified restrictions on both types of claims in b,but still without using the phrase second or successive.see b,supp.iv providing rules governing applications filed by state as well as federal prisoners.it was not until that aedpa incorporated the phrase second or successive into b.in light of this complex history of the phrase second or successive,we must rely upon the current text to determine when the phrase applies,rather than precedents or superseded statutory formulations 
nor do our cases contradict our approach.only one,burton stewart,per curiam,comes close to addressing the threshold question whether an application is second or successive if it challenges a new judgment.and that case confirms that the existence of a new judgment is dispositive.in burton,the petitioner had been convicted and sentenced in state court in.see,at.he successfully moved for resentencing based on vacatur of an unrelated prior conviction,at.the state appellate court affirmed the conviction but remanded for a second resentencing.ibid.in march,the trial court entered an amended judgment and new sentence,at.in december,with state review of his new sentence still pending,the petitioner filed a application challenging his conviction.the district court denied it on the merits,the court of appeals affirmed,and we denied certiorari.ibid.
in,after exhausting his state sentencing appeal,the petitioner filed a petition challenging only his sentence.the district court denied relief on the merits and the court of appeals affirmed.we reversed,holding that the petition challenging the sentence should have been dismissed as an unauthorized second or successive application,at see b a.we rejected the petitioner argument that his and petitions challenged different judgments.at see,at.although petitioner had styled his first petition as a challenge to the conviction and his second petition as a challenge to the sentence,we concluded that both attacked the same judgment because the sentence was already in place when the petitioner filed his first application for federal habeas relief.see,at.in other words,the judgment he challenged in his application was the same one challenged in the subsequent petition it was the judgment pursuant to which the petitioner was being detained.ibid.emphasis added.we expressly recognized that the case might have been different had there been a new judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions.ibid.there was no such judgment in burton,but there is such an intervening judgment here.this is magwood first application challenging that intervening judgment.the errors he alleges are new.it is obvious to us and the state does not dispute that his claim of ineffective assistance at resentencing turns upon new errors.but,according to the state,his claim does not,because the state court made the same mistake before.we disagree.an error made a second time is still a new error.that is especially clear here,where the state court conducted a full resentencing and reviewed the aggravating evidence afresh.see sentencing,tab,at the court in f or mulating the present judgment has considered the original record of the trial and sentence.the present judgment and sentence has been the result of a complete and new assessment of all of the evidence,arguments of counsel,and law emphasis added 
the dissent concern that our rule will allow petitioners to bring abusive claims so long as they have won any victory pursuant to a prior federal habeas petition,post,at,is greatly exaggerated.a petitioner may not raise in federal court an error that he failed to raise properly in state court in a challenge to the judgment reflecting the error.if a petitioner does not satisfy the procedural requirements for bringing an error to the state court attention whether in trial,appellate,or habeas proceedings,as state law may require procedural default will bar federal review.see coleman thompson,boerckel,stating that the petitioner failure to present three of his federal habeas claims to the state court in a timely fashion has resulted in a procedural default of those claims in this case,the state argued that magwood procedurally defaulted his claim by failing to raise it properly in his collateral challenge to the judgment,and sought dismissal on that ground.only after ruling that magwood did not procedurally default the claim did the district court sua sponte consider whether b barred review we leave that ruling to the court of appeals to review in the first instance.here,we underscore only that rules continue to constrain review of claims in all applications,whether the applications are second or successive or not 
ironically,in an effort to effectuate what they believe is congress intent not to give any unfair benefit to habeas petitioners,the state and the dissent propose an alternative rule that would close our doors to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review without any clear indication that such was congress intent.castro united states.many examples can be given,but one suffices to illustrate this point.suppose that a petitioner files an application raising meritorious claims challenging his conviction.the district court grants a conditional writ based on one of them,without reaching the remaining nine.upon retrial,the state court commits the same legal mistakes.these are new errors,but no more new than the sentencing error in magwood case.is an application presenting those same claims now based on the errors in the new judgment second or successive under the rule advanced by the state and the dissent,the answer must be yes.all claims would have to be dismissed.see b requiring dismissal of any claim presented in a prior application.the state attempts to avoid this procedural anomal y,castro,supra,at,by suggesting that we treat the nine unadjudicated claims as part of a first application,because they were never adjudicated on the merits.slack,at,at.as for the adjudicated claim,r espondents assume that state judges will follow instructions imposed by federal courts,and if not,that federal courts will consider a petitioner claim that the state court violated due process by failing to honor the federal court mandate.brief for respondents.we see no need to engage in such novel and complex rationalizations.aedpa text commands a more straightforward rule where,unlike in burton,there is a new judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions,at,an application challenging the resulting new judgment is not second or successive at all.
the state objects that our reading of b would allow a petitioner who obtains a conditional writ as to his sentence to file a subsequent application challenging not only his resulting,new sentence,but also his original,undisturbed conviction.the state believes this result follows because a sentence and conviction form a single judgment for purposes of habeas review.this case gives us no occasion to address that question,because magwood has not attempted to challenge his underlying conviction we base our conclusion on the text,and that text is not altered by consequences the state speculates will follow in another case 
for these reasons,we conclude that magwood first application challenging his new sentence under the judgment is not second or successive under b.the court of appeals erred by reading b to bar review of the claim magwood presented in that application.we do not address whether the claim is procedurally defaulted.nor do we address magwood contention that the court of appeals erred in rejecting his claim by not addressing whether his attorney should have objected under federal law.
the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice breyer,with whom justice stevens and justice sotomayor join,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
i join the court opinion with the exception of part.the court neither purports to alter nor does alter our holding in panetti quarterman.see ante,at.in panetti,we declined to interpret second or successive as referring to all applications filed second or successively in time,even when the later filings address a judgment already challenged in a prior application.at emphasis added.in this case,by contrast,we determine how b applies to a habeas petition that is the first petition to address a new judgment that has not already been challenged in a prior application.and,for the reasons provided by the court,such a first petition is not second or successive.of course,as the dissent correctly states,if magwood were challenging an undisturbed judgment for the second time,principles would apply,including panetti holding that an application containing a claim that the petitioner had no fair opportunity to raise in his first habeas petition is not a second or successive application.post,at opinion of kennedy.contrary to the dissent assertion,post,at,the court decision today and our decision in panetti fit comfortably together.
billy joe magwood,petitioner tony patterson,warden,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice kennedy,with whom the chief justice,justice ginsburg,and justice alito join,dissenting.
the court today decides that a state prisoner who succeeds in his first federal habeas petition on a discrete sentencing claim may later file a second petition raising numerous previously unraised claims,even if that petition is an abuse of the writ of habeas corpus.the court,in my respectful submission,reaches this conclusion by misreading precedents on the meaning of the phrase second or successive in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.the court then rewrites aedpa text but refuses to grapple with the logical consequences of its own editorial judgment.a straightforward application of the principles articulated in panetti quarterman,consistent with the conclusions of all of the courts of appeals that have considered this issue,dictates the opposite result.the design and purpose of aedpa is to avoid abuses of the writ of habeas corpus,in recognition of the potential for the writ intrusive effect on state criminal justice systems.but today opinion,with considerable irony,is not only a step back from aedpa protection for states but also a step back even from principles that were in place before aedpa.so this respectful dissent becomes necessary.
absent two exceptions that are inapplicable here,the relevant statutory provision in aedpa provides 
a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.b.
the question before the court is whether petitioner billy joe magwood filed a second or successive application by raising a claim in his second habeas petition that he had available and yet failed to raise in his first petition.
the term second or successive is a habeas term of art.slack mcdaniel.it incorporates the doctrine.panetti,at.before today,that legal principle was established by the decisions of this court.see,slack,at.under that rule,to determine whether an application is second or successive,a court must look to the substance of the claim the application raises and decide whether the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise the claim in the prior application.panetti,at.applying this analytical framework puts applications into one of three categories.
first,if the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise the claim in the prior application,a application that seeks to raise the same claim is barred as second or successive.this is consistent with cases applying the doctrine and the bar on second or successive applications.see,wong doo united states,second application barred where petitioner had a full opportunity to offer proof of the same claim in his first habeas application woodard hutchins,powell,concurring,writing for a majority of the court second application barred for claims that could and should have been raised in the first petition delo stokes,per curiam subsequent application barred for a claim that could have been raised in his first petition for federal habeas corpus as mccleskey zant,explained,a petitioner can abuse the writ by raising a claim in a subsequent petition that he could have raised in his first,regardless of whether the failure to raise it earlier stemmed from a deliberate choice.see also habeas corpus rule c instructing habeas petitioners to specify all the grounds for relief available to them and to state the facts supporting each ground schlup delo,describing adoption in habeas,through legislation and judicial decision,of modified res judicata claim preclusion doctrine wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure,ed.claim preclusion aspect of res judicata doctrine bars matters that were not,but ought to have been raised in prior litigation.
second,if the petitioner had no fair opportunity to raise the claim in the prior application,a subsequent application raising that claim is not second or successive,and b bar does not apply.this can occur where the claim was not yet ripe at the time of the first petition,see,panetti,supra,at,or where the alleged violation occurred only after the denial of the first petition,such as the state failure to grant the prisoner parole as required by state law,see,hill alaska,crouch norris,in re cain.and to respond to the court concern,see ante,at,if the applicant in his second petition raises a claim that he raised in his first petition but the district court left unaddressed at its own discretion,the second application would not be second or successive.reraising a previously unaddressed claim is not abusive by any definition.if the court believes there are m any examples where principles unfairly close the door to state prisoners seeking federal habeas review,one would think the court would be able to come up with an example.it does not do so.
third,a mixed petition raising both abusive and nonabusive claims would be second or successive.in that circumstance the petitioner would have to obtain authorization from the court of appeals to proceed with the nonabusive claims.see b see also moore et,federal practice b ed.after the court of appeals makes its determination,a district court may consider nonabusive claims that the petitioner had no fair opportunity to present in his first petition and dismiss the abusive claims.see b.
the operation of the above rule is exemplified by the court decision in panetti.panetti claim that he was mentally incompetent to be executed under ford wainwright,did not become ripe until after the denial of his first habeas petition.when the ford claim became ripe,panetti filed a second habeas petition,raising his ford claim for the first time.in concluding that this second habeas petition was not a second or successive application,this court explained that second or successive did not refe r to all applications filed second or successively in time,but was rather a that takes its full meaning from our case law,including decisions predating the enactment of aedpa.at.the court relied on aedpa purpose of further ing the principles of comity,finality,and federalism,at quoting cockrell,an aversion to the empty formality requiring prisoners to file unripe claims,at,and this court cases regarding the doctrine,at.panetti thus looked to the nature of the claim raised in the habeas petition to determine that the application was not second or successive.ibid.
the above principles apply to a situation,like the present one,where the petitioner in his first habeas proceeding succeeds in obtaining a conditional grant of relief,which allows the state court to correct an error that occurred at the original sentencing.assume,as alleged here,that in correcting the error in a new sentencing proceeding,the state court duplicates a different mistake that also occurred at the first sentencing.the second application is second or successive with respect to that claim because the alleged error could and should have been raised in the first petition.woodard,at opinion of powell.put another way,under principles,a petitioner loses his right to challenge the error by not raising a claim at the first opportunity after his claim becomes ripe.on the other hand,if the petitioner raises a claim in his second habeas petition that could not have been raised in the earlier petition perhaps because the error occurred for the first time during resentencing then the application raising the claim is not second or successive and b bar does not apply.
although the authorities are adequate to show that the application in this case is second or successive,it must be noted that no previous case from this court has dealt with the precise sequence of events here a petitioner attempts to bring a previously unraised claim after a second resentencing proceeding that followed a grant of federal habeas relief.the conclusion that such an application is barred as second or successive unless the claim was previously unavailable is consistent with the approach of every court of appeals that has considered the issue,although some of those cases highlight subtleties that are not relevant under principles.see,pratt united states,galtieri united states,united states,lang united states.while most of these cases arose in the context of federal prisoners challenges to their convictions or sentences under,the second or successive bar under b applies to motions.see h,supp.ii.
in the present case the court should conclude that magwood has filed a second or successive habeas corpus application.in,he filed a first federal habeas petition raising nine claims,including that the trial court improperly failed to consider two mitigating factors when it imposed magwood death sentence.the district court granted magwood petition and ordered relief only on the mitigating factor claim.the state trial court then held a new sentencing proceeding,in which it considered all of the mitigating factors and reimposed the death penalty.in,magwood brought a second habeas petition,this time raising an argument that could have been,but was not,raised in his first petition.the argument was that he was not eligible for the death penalty because he did not have fair notice that his crime rendered him death eligible.there is no reason that magwood could not have raised the identical argument in his first habeas petition.because magwood had a full and fair opportunity to adjudicate his claim in his first petition in,his petition raising this claim is barred as second or successive.
the court reaches the opposite result by creating an exception to the second or successive application bar.the court,in my respectful view,makes two critical errors.first,it errs in rejecting panetti approach to determining whether an application is second or successive.second,it imposes an atextual exception to b bar against second or successive applications,requiring that the application be brought against the same judgment.this second error is underscored by the fact that the court refuses to deal with the logical implications of its newly created rule.
the court concludes that because aedpa refers to second or successive applications rather than second or successive claims,the nature of the claims raised in the second application is irrelevant.see ante,at a lthough we agree with the state that many of the rules under b focus on claims,that does not entitle us to rewrite the statute to make the phrase second or successive modify claims as well this is incorrect.as explained above,panetti establishes that deciding whether an application itself is second or successive requires looking to the nature of the claim that the application raises to determine whether the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise that claim in his earlier petition.indeed,the only way panetti could have concluded that the application there was not second or successive was to look at the underlying claim the application raised,at.
while the court asserts it is not calling panetti into doubt,see ante,at,it does not even attempt to explain how its analysis is consistent with that opinion,panetti,at thomas,dissenting before aedpa enactment,the phrase second or successive meant the same thing it does today any subsequent federal habeas application challenging a judgment the best that can be said is the court is limiting its new doctrine so it has no applicability to previously unexhausted ford claims,confining the holding of panetti to the facts of that case,at thomas,dissenting today decision thus stands only for the proposition that ford claims somehow deserve a special and unjustified exemption from the statute plain import 
failing to consider the nature of the claim when deciding whether an application is barred as second or successive raises other difficulties.consider a habeas petition challenging an alleged violation that occurred entirely after the denial of the first petition for example,a failure to grant a prisoner parole at the time promised him by state law or the unlawful withdrawal of credits.see supra,at.under the court rule,it would appear that a habeas application challenging those alleged violations would be barred as second or successive because it would be a application challenging custody pursuant to the same judgment.that result would be inconsistent with principles and might work a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.
having unmoored the phrase second or successive from its textual and historical underpinnings,the court creates a new puzzle for itself if the nature of the claim is not what makes an application second or successive,then to what should a court look finding no reference point in b text,the court searches in aedpa for a different peg.
the court believes that it finds its peg in a different provision 
a district court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.a.
but this provision does not purport to create any prerequisites to b bar against second or successive applications.the accepted reading of the quoted language is that this is a mere status requirement.see hertz liebman,federal habeas corpus practice and procedure,ed.the provision stands for the simple proposition that a petitioner must be held pursuant to the judgment of a state court to be able to file any b petition in the first place.that reading also explains why federal habeas petitions can attack not only the judgment pursuant to which the petitioner is being held but also the duration of sentence and the conditions under which that sentence is being served,including rules such as the basis of parole and good time credits,at.
the court reading of the phrase pursuant to the judgment of a state court as a limitation on b second or successive application bar is artificial.the court would amend b to read a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was not presented in a prior application against the same judgment shall be dismissed.this is not what b says.
the court wholly glosses over another significant problem with its atextual analysis.the court relies upon the notion that a n error made a second time is still a new error.ante,at.but in making this statement,the court can mean one of two very different things 
first,it could mean that any error logically encompassed in a reentered judgment is a new error.a criminal judgment generally includes both the conviction and the sentence.see,fed.rule crim.proc.k a criminal judgment must set forth the plea,the jury verdict or the court findings,the adjudication,and the sentence teague lane,as we have often stated,a criminal judgment necessarily includes the sentence imposed upon the defendant this principle applies in the federal habeas context,where petitioner is in custody pursuant to the judgment.b.a person can not be held in custody pursuant to a sentence,but only pursuant to the one judgment,which includes both the conviction and sentence.see burton stewart,per curiam explaining that aedpa statute of limitations did not run until the judgment both his conviction and sentence became final internal quotation marks omitted.
under this principle,the court holding today would allow a challenger in magwood position to raise any challenge to the guilt phase of the criminal judgment against him in his second application,since a new judgment consisting of both the conviction and sentence has now been reentered and all of the errors have apparently occurred anew.as an illustration,the state trial court here reentered the following judgment after resentencing it is,therefore,ordered and adjudged by the court that billy joe magwood is guilty of the offense of aggravated murder and that billy joe magwood is sentenced to death.app.to pet.for cert.this would mean that magwood attorney could dig through anything that occurred from voir dire to the of witnesses to the jury guilty verdict,and raise any alleged errors for the first time in his second habeas application,all because the trial court did not properly consider two mitigating factors during magwood first sentencing proceeding.
second,and alternatively,the court could retreat even further from the statutory text and conclude that only some parts of the reentered judgment are open to challenge by way of a second habeas application.magwood,for example,argues that he can only challenge previously unraised errors made during sentencing.brief for petitioner.indeed,magwood goes further and suggests that even the sentencing would not be reopened in a case where a court order leads the trial court to revise only the defendant term of supervised release,at.if the court is adopting this exception to the second or successive application bar,it is unclear why the error that magwood now raises is a new error at all.after all,magwood did not challenge his death eligibility in his first habeas petition but only disputed that he should not get the death penalty,as a matter of discretion,if the trial court properly weighed all of the aggravating and mitigating factors.the state trial court conducted this reweighing and had no reason to reconsider the uncontested finding that magwood is death eligible.it is hard to see how the trial court failure to reconsider sua sponte its previous finding is a new error,any more than its failure to reconsider the various errors that may have taken place at the guilt phase would have been new errors.
the court contends the approach dictated by panetti considerably undermine s if not render s superfluous,ante,at,the exceptions in b,which allow a petitioner to bring a claim in a second or successive application based on certain factual discoveries or based on a new supreme court precedent that has been applied retroactively.the court seems to be saying that applying panetti rule would make the exceptions superfluous,because any claim that would satisfy the exceptions would necessarily satisfy the more general rule derived from the doctrine.but the court misconceives the scope of the rule that an application is only second or successive if it raises for the first time a claim that could have been raised before.a second petition raising a claim that could have been raised in a prior petition,even though strengthened by a new decision from this court or based upon newly discovered evidence,is still second or successive.thus this subsequent application would only be permitted if it qualified under the pertinent subsection b exception.in fact,it is the court approach that limits the relevance of the subsection b exceptions.under the court theory,the second or successive bar does not apply at all to applications filed by petitioners in magwood situation,and thus the subsection b exceptions would have no operation in that context.
the court approach disregards aedpa principles of comity,finality,and federalism.panetti,at quoting,at.under the court newly created exception to the second or successive application bar,a defendant who succeeds on even the most minor and discrete issue relating to his sentencing would be able to raise or new sentencing claims in his second habeas petition,all based on arguments he failed to raise in his first petition.i f reexamination of a convictio n in the first round of habeas offends federalism and comity,the offense increases when a state must defend its conviction in a second or subsequent habeas proceeding on grounds not even raised in the first petition.mccleskey,at.
the court novel exception would also allow the petitioner to reraise every argument ag
