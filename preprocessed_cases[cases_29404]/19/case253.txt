after a bench trial,janice troisi was convicted in both of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud,see,and of healthcare fraud,see id,for her role from january forward in an extensive scheme between and to defraud medicare by billing the program for services provided to patients falsely presented as eligible to receive them.troisi does not dispute the role that she played in the fraudulent scheme,which involved billing the government for million in false claims,million of which were paid.she appeals,arguing that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she acted with the required culpable state of mind.we affirm her convictions.
we summarize the basic contours of the healthcare fraud scheme and proceedings below,reserving a fuller exposition of the relevant facts for our analysis of the particular issues presented by this appeal.see united states,cir.citing united states flores rivera,cir,cert.denied.
on september,troisi and michael galatis were indicted by a grand jury in the district of massachusetts on one count of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud,see,and eleven counts of substantive healthcare fraud see id.galatis was also separately charged with seven counts of money laundering.see id.the indictment alleged that galatis,the owner of at home vna ahvna,a home agency,and troisi,ahvna director of clinical services since january,had used ahvna as a vehicle for defrauding medicare by providing nursing services to ineligible patients and then billing medicare for those services based on falsified documents.
medicare determines whether a beneficiary qualifies for coverage of home health services and,in turn,whether and to what extent to reimburse the beneficiary healthcare provider for the cost of such services based primarily on information contained in two forms submitted by the healthcare provider.the first form,called the oasis form,documents the healthcare provider assessment of the beneficiary medical condition and needs.in filling out this form,a healthcare provider must,inter alia,rate on a numerical scale the beneficiary ability to perform certain activities such as eating,dressing,and bathing without assistance.the second form,called the form home health certification and plan of care form,requires a physician to certify that the beneficiary is confined to the home homebound,the beneficiary is in need of skilled services,such services will be or were furnished while the beneficiary is or was under the care of a physician,and a plan for furnishing the services has been established and will be or was periodically reviewed by a physician.additionally,for services started after april,a physician must certify that a encounter between the beneficiary and a physician,related to the beneficiary need for the services,occurred no more than days prior to or days after the start of the services id.
the prosecution charged that the ahvna scheme proceeded as follows.ahvna aggressively recruited individuals for nursing services,for which they could not legally receive medicare coverage,either because they were not homebound or because they were not in need of such services.troisi instructed ahvna nurses to fill out those patients oasis forms to represent,inaccurately,that the patients were incapable of caring for themselves.troisi then personally prepared a form for each patient,populating it with whatever false information was required to obtain medicare coverage for nursing services.and ahvna medical director,spencer wilking,signed the forms without reviewing their contents or even,in many cases,meeting with the patients 
ahvna nurses made home visits to patients,but most of those visits did not actually involve the nurses providing skilled services.yet at troisi direction,the nurses falsified their notes to indicate that they had provided such services.using fraudulent records,ahvna billed medicare for tens of millions of dollars worth of skilled nursing services,which had not been provided or had been provided unnecessarily,between and,inclusive.
only the portion of the scheme beginning on january,when troisi became ahvna clinical director is relevant to this appeal.the government theory was that galatis agreed to promote troisi from employee to clinical director at that time because she could and did take the scheme to another level.accordingly,she had a direct stake in the fraud even though she did not personally receive the reimbursement checks from medicare.
troisi and galatis proceeded jointly to a jury trial on october,the district court declared a mistrial as to troisi on november,after she became too ill to proceed.troisi waived her right to a jury on retrial.a bench trial before the same district judge who had presided over the earlier trial started on july.
the parties stipulated that transcripts of the testimony of government witnesses who testified at the earlier,joint trial,along with the exhibits admitted during the joint trial,would be admissible evidence at troisi bench trial the government supplemented this evidence with live testimony from four additional witnesses.in total,the government introduced documentary exhibits,including the transcripts.its witnesses included patients linked to the substantive fraud counts,nurses who had provided care to those patients,most of those patients primary care providers,and wilking.
at the conclusion of the government case,troisi moved for a judgment of acquittal,which was denied.in her defense,troisi called no witnesses and introduced five exhibits.the thrust of her defense was that the government had not proved that she possessed the requisite mens rea to commit the relevant crimes.
on august,the day after the trial ended,the district court delivered its verdict from the bench,finding troisi guilty on all of the conspiracy and fraud counts.the court concluded that troisi had participated in a sophisticated scheme among the senior managers of ahvna to provide inaccurate information to the government so as to secure payments,which the g overnment was not obligated to make.while h er knowing and willful participation in this scheme with the intent to defraud was largely demonstrated circumstantially,the court found sufficient evidence that troisi had manipulat ed the staff and the paperwork with the purpose of extracting monies that ahvna was not entitled to through fraud,that is,the misrepresentation of material facts.the court sentenced troisi to months of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release.this appeal followed.
in assessing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we examine the evidence,together with all inferences that may be reasonably drawn from it,in the light most favorable to the verdict,at quoting united states and√∫jar,cir.where the factfinder drew inferences from circumstantial evidence,we will not its ensuing conclusions as long as the inferences derive support from a plausible rendition of the record,and the conclusions flow rationally from those inferences.united states spinney,cir.ultimately,we ask whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states,cir.quoting united states grace,cir.

troisi does not dispute that officials at ahvna successfully executed a conspiratorial scheme intended to defraud medicare.nor does she dispute that she took actions that directly and crucially furthered that scheme.she attacks her convictions solely on the ground that the government allegedly failed to present sufficient evidence that she took those actions with the required culpable state of mind id.at.
we disagree.troisi culpable state of mind can be readily gleaned from several strands of circumstantial evidence presented at trial.vega,at.
