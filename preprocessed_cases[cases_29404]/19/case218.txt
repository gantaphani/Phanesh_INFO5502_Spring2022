defendants alvin houston,and shawna calhoun pleaded guilty to charges of transporting minor a from maine to massachusetts and back to maine over an period with the intent that minor a engage in prostitution.see.the district court sentenced each defendant to months imprisonment.in these consolidated appeals,houston asserts the district court erroneously applied sentencing enhancements for undue influence and computer use,b b b b,and the government breached the terms of a proffer agreement in its sentencing memorandum.calhoun argues the district court failed to adequately weigh the a factors when fashioning her sentence.exercising jurisdiction under and concluding that all these claims lack merit,we affirm.
when,as here,a sentencing appeal follows a guilty plea,we obtain the facts from the colloquy,the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report,and the record of the disposition hearing.united states,cir.we rehearse only those facts that are needed to put the claims of error into context.id.
on december,minor a contacted calhoun via facebook.in response to a question about her age,minor a,who was years old,wrote that she was.calhoun replied,w hat i do you need to be of age.they later discussed meeting up to travel from maine to either massachusetts or new york.
calhoun asked her acquaintance houston to rent a car to drive calhoun and minor a from maine to boston,massachusetts.in exchange,the group would pay his expenses and he could visit his child in boston.on december,houston drove calhoun,minor a,and another individual from maine to boston.while in boston,calhoun used her smartphone to prepare online advertisements on to market her own and minor a sexual services.calhoun coached minor a on how to post to and also purchased condoms for minor a to use.houston,meanwhile,drove minor a to various locations in the boston area to engage in prostitution,and minor a provided the money from these encounters to calhoun.both houston and calhoun learned minor a true age either at the outset of the trip or while in boston.
on december,calhoun,houston,and minor a learned the fbi was looking for minor a in massachusetts.houston then drove the group to bangor,maine.while en route,they stopped briefly in the area,near minor a hometown.minor a hid in the backseat of the car because the group knew the authorities and her mother were looking for her.advertisements for minor a sexual services in the bangor area were posted to,and minor a again performed sexual services for money.
early in the morning on december,calhoun and houston drove minor a to a hotel in the bangor area so that she could meet with a client.the purported client was a law enforcement detective who identified himself after minor a entered the hotel room.police then arrested calhoun and houston,who were in the parking lot in the rental car.
that same day,houston waived his miranda rights and agreed to speak with the police.he said he knew that minor a and calhoun had both been engaging in prostitution at different hotels,that he had driven them to boston and back to maine,and that they paid for his expenses during the trip.
in january,houston and calhoun were charged in a complaint with transporting an individual in interstate commerce with the intent that she engage in prostitution,and aiding and abetting the same,in violation of and.
the following month,houston agreed to provide information relating to the human trafficking of minor a via a proffer agreement.the government agreed not to offer houston statements from the proffer session in evidence in its or in connection with a sentencing proceeding,except in a prosecution for false statements or perjury.but the terms of the agreement also provided that,in the event of a prosecution,the government would provide houston statements to the district court.the parties acknowledged that the government could not bind the district court from using the statements to the extent permitted by law.
in march,calhoun and houston were charged in a indictment with the trafficking charges from the january complaint.calhoun and houston each pleaded guilty without a plea agreement.their separate revised presentence investigation reports psrs calculated the same offense level under the guidelines.starting with a base offense level of under,the psrs computed enhancements for unduly influencing minor a under subsection b b enhancements for use of a computer under subsection b enhancements as the offense involved the commission of a sex act under subsection b a and reductions for accepting responsibility,resulting in total offense levels of.as calhoun and houston prior convictions placed them both in criminal history category iii,their guidelines ranges were months imprisonment.
in december,the district court held separate sentencing hearings for calhoun and houston.overruling houston objections to the and enhancements,the district court accepted all of the suggested enhancements and reductions and sentenced each defendant to months imprisonment.calhoun and houston now appeal their sentences for the reasons described below.
houston argues the district court erred in applying b b,which provides for a enhancement when a participant unduly influenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.to the extent houston objected to the enhancement below,we review under a multifaceted abuse of discretion standard,in which we review the district court interpretation of the guidelines de novo,its findings of fact for clear error,and its judgment calls for abuse of discretion.united states leahy,cir.but we review the specific claims of error houston failed to preserve for plain error.under that standard,houston must establish that an error occurred the error was clear or obvious the error affected his substantial rights and the error seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states,cir.
houston does not dispute that calhoun warranted the enhancement for her conduct,but he faults the district court for accepting the government simplistic argument that calhoun conduct as a participant could be attributed to him as relevant conduct.to qualify as a defendant relevant conduct,acts and omissions of others that occurred during,in preparation for,or while attempting to avoid detection of an offense must be i within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,ii in furtherance of that criminal activity,and iii reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.a b.houston argues the district court held him vicariously liable for calhoun manipulation and undue influence over minor a without making an individualized finding that calhoun conduct was within the scope of the criminal activity to which he agreed to jointly undertake.because houston did not make this specific argument before the district court,but instead argued that he himself did not unduly influence minor a,we review this argument for plain error 
contrary to houston assertion,the district court did not uncritically hold houston vicariously liable for all of calhoun conduct,nor did it find that the scope of houston involvement was identical to calhoun.the district court did not,for example,hold houston responsible for conduct that predated his involvement,such as calhoun facebook communications with minor instead,the district court focused on events that took place after houston joined the criminal activity.the court found that houston participated actively with calhoun and facilitated her manipulation of minor a by driving calhoun and minor a,renting motel rooms,and sleeping in the same room or same car with calhoun and minor although the district court could have more specifically delineated the scope of the criminal activity houston agreed to undertake,the court nonetheless indicated that calhoun conduct was within that scope because houston actively participated in the offense and facilitated calhoun conduct.see cmt.b sentencing comm directing a court to determine the scope of criminal activity the defendant agreed to jointly undertake,and allowing the court to consider any explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others 
the district court did not plainly err by inferring that calhoun undue influence over minor a that took place after houston began participating in the offense was within the scope of the criminal activity he implicitly agreed to undertake.houston pleaded guilty to transporting minor a with the intent that she engage in prostitution.houston relied on calhoun and minor a success in prostitution activities to pay for his lodging,food,and alcohol.he admitted to overhearing at least some of calhoun manipulative conduct over minor a,including negotiations with customers,yet he continued to drive them between massachusetts and maine to meet with customers and avoid authorities who were looking for minor 
further,even when a defendant does not agree to the precise conduct of another participant,the participant conduct may still be within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.for example,the guidelines commentary explains that a defendant who agrees to commit a robbery is accountable for the other defendant assault and injury of a victim during the robbery,even if the defendant had not agreed to the assault and had cautioned the other defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone.see cmt.d.in that case,the assaultive conduct was within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity the robbery,was in furtherance of that criminal activity the robbery,and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity given the nature of the offense.id.
the district court likewise did not abuse its discretion in determining that houston own conduct qualified for the enhancement.first,the district court applied a rebuttable presumption that houston unduly influenced minor a because of their age difference he was and she was.see cmt.b providing for a rebuttable presumption of undue influence when a participant is at least ten years older than the minor.houston asserts in a footnote that it would be impossible to rebut this presumption when the district court applied it on a theory of vicarious liability,but the district court did not focus solely on calhoun conduct rather,the court found houston unique role in the offense compromised the voluntariness of minor a behavior,including driving minor a across state borders away from her family and familiar surroundings.additionally,houston drove minor a to various locations to meet with adult men for sexual encounters,thus giving her few options other than engaging in prohibited sexual conduct.contrary to houston arguments,the district court faithfully discharged its duty to closely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor behavior.cmt.b.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that houston failed to rebut the presumption that he unduly influenced minor between calhoun conduct and houston own role in the offense,we affirm the district court application of the enhancement to houston.
houston also argues the district court erred in applying the enhancement under b.specifically,he contends the enhancement does not apply to him because the application note limits the enhancement scope.we review this legal argument de novo.see leahy,at.
under b,a defendant is subject to a enhancement i f the offense involved the use of a computer to a persuade,induce,entice,coerce,or facilitate the travel of,the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct or b entice,encourage,offer,or solicit a person to engage in prohibited sexual conduct with the minor.application note to this section states 
subsection b is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an interactive computer service to communicate directly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody,care,or supervisory control of the minor.accordingly,the enhancement in subsection b would not apply to the use of a computer or an interactive computer service to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an airline internet site.
cmt.there is obvious tension between the plain text of the guideline in subpart b b,which involves using a computer to solicit a person to engage in prohibited sexual conduct with the minor,and application note,which only mentions using a computer to communicate with a minor or a minor caretaker.c ommentary in the guidelines manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.stinson united states.
today,we join the circuit courts that have concluded application note is inconsistent with the plain language of b b.see united states gibson,cir.united states hill,cir.united states cramer,cir.united states mcmillian,cir.united states pringler,cir.united states winbush,app x,cir.unpublished.as these courts have recognized,b has two distinct subsections,one relating to inducement of a minor and the other relating to solicitation of a third party.cramer,at.if the drafters of the guidelines intended application note to apply to subsection b b,it would render subsection b inoperable in all but a narrow subset of cases under only one of the criminal statutes the guideline covers.pringler,at noting that although the guideline covers six statutory provisions,only a specific scenario under one of the statutes b could satisfy both the plain text of the guideline and the application note.but there is no indication that the drafters of the guidelines intended to limit th e plain language of subsection b b through application note.cramer,at.instead,as the fifth circuit observed,the guideline drafting history shows that the application note was originally meant to apply only to subsection a,not to subsection b.pringler,at.the amendment that changed the application note to encompass both subsections was a mere drafting error.id.applying stinson,we conclude application note is not authoritative as to subsection b b.this reading of application note does not,as houston argues,nullify the note altogether,as it still applies to explain and clarify subsection b a.
the district court did not err when it disregarded application note and instead applied the plain text of the enhancement in b b.the district court applied the enhancement to houston because he jointly undertook criminal activity that involved using smartphones to solicit men to engage in prohibited sexual conduct with minor a.we affirm the enhancement.
houston final argument is that the government breached the proffer agreement by referencing statements he made during the proffer session in its sentencing memorandum.because houston did not object below,we review for plain error.see,at providing the four prongs of plain error review.
informal immunity agreements,such as proffer agreements,are shaped by the language of the contract conferring immunity.united states melvin,cir.quoting united states hogan,cir.houston brief relies on and heavily quotes from the proffer agreement.as such,we directly quote portions of the proffer agreement terms 
in any prosecution brought against houston,the government will not offer in evidence in its,or in connection with any sentencing proceeding for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence,any statements made by houston at the meeting,except in a prosecution for false statements,obstruction of justice or perjury with respect to any acts committed or statements made during or after the meeting or testimony given after the meeting.the parties understand,however,that in the event of a prosecution of houston,the government will provide to the court the information which houston provides pursuant to this agreement.the parties understand that,while the government will not introduce houston statements in evidence except as permitted in this agreement,the government can not bind the court as to its appropriate use of such information and that the court will use such information to the extent permitted by law.
notwithstanding item above the government may also use statements made by houston at the meeting to rebut any evidence or a
