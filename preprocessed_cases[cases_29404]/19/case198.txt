the speedy trial act of act requires a criminal defendant trial to commence within days of his indictment or initial appearance,c,and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if that deadline is not met,a.as relevant here,the act automatically excludes from the period delay resulting from proceedings concerning the defendant,h hereinafter subsection h,and separately permits a district court to exclude delay resulting from a continuance it grants,provided the court makes findings required by h hereinafter subsection h.petitioner indictment on federal firearm and drug possession charges started the clock on august.after petitioner arraignment,the magistrate judge ordered the parties to file pretrial motions by september.on september,the court granted petitioner motion to extend that deadline,but on the new due date,september,petitioner waived his right to file pretrial motions.on october,the magistrate judge found the waiver voluntary and intelligent.over the next three months,petitioner trial was delayed several times,often at petitioner instigation.on february,days after he was indicted he moved to dismiss the indictment,claiming that the act limit had elapsed.in denying the motion,the district court excluded the time from september through october as pretrial motion preparation time.at trial,petitioner was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to concurrent prison terms.the eighth circuit affirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss,holding that the period from september through october was automatically excludable from the limit under subsection h.
held the time granted to prepare pretrial motions is not automatically excludable from the limit under subsection h.such time may be excluded only when a district court grants a continuance based on appropriate findings under subsection h.
a the delay at issue is governed by subsection h d hereinafter subparagraph d,the enumerated category that renders automatically excludable delay resulting from any pretrial motion,from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on,or other prompt disposition of,such motion.this provision communicates congress judgment that pretrial delay is automatically excludable only from the time a pretrial motion is filed through a specified hearing or disposition point,and that other pretrial delay is excludable only if it results in a continuance under subsection h.this limitation is significant because congress knew how to define the boundaries of subsection h enumerated exclusions broadly when it so desired.although the period of delay the government seeks to exclude in this case results from a proceeding governed by subparagraph d,that period precedes the first day upon which congress specified that such delay may be excluded automatically and thus is not automatically excludable.
b this analysis resolves the automatic excludability inquiry because a specific provision here,subparagraph d controls one s of more general application here,subsections h and h.united states.a contrary result would depart from the statute in a manner that underscores the propriety of this court approach.subsection h phrase including but not limited to does not show that subsection h permits automatic exclusion of delay related to an enumerated category of proceedings,but outside the boundaries set forth in the subparagraph expressly addressed to that category.that would confuse the illustrative nature of the subsection list of categories with the contents of the categories themselves.reading the including but not limited to clause to modify the contents of each subparagraph in the list as well as the list itself would violate settled statutory construction principles by ignoring subsection h structure and grammar and in so doing rendering even the clearest of the subparagraphs indeterminate and virtually superfluous.see generally,at.subsection h context supports this court conclusion.subsection h provides that delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge may be excluded,but only if the judge finds that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,and records those findings.in setting forth the statutory factors justifying a subsection h continuance,congress twice recognized the importance of adequate pretrial preparation time.see h b ii,h b iv.the court determination that the delay at issue is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection h,and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only where a district court makes findings justifying the exclusion.the court precedents also support this reading of subsection h.see zedner united states.
c the act does not force a district court to choose between rejecting a defendant request for time to prepare pretrial motions and risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the trial.a court may still exclude preparation time under subsection h by granting a continuance for that purpose based on recorded findings.subsection h provides m uch of the act flexibility,zedner,at,giving district courts discretion to accommodate limited delays for needs,at.the government suggests that a district court may fail to make the necessary subsection h findings,leading to a windfall gain for a defendant who induces delay beyond the limit.but dismissal need not represent a windfall.if the court dismisses the charges without prejudice,the government may refile charges or reindict.in ruling on a motion to dismiss under the act,the district court should consider,inter alia,the party responsible for the delay.
d this court does not consider whether any of the act other exclusions would apply to all or part of the september through october period that is not automatically excludable under subsection h.

the speedy trial act of speedy trial act or act,et,requires that a criminal defendant trial commence within days after he is charged or makes an initial appearance,whichever is later,see c,and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if that deadline is not met,a.the act,however,excludes from the period delays due to certain enumerated events.h.as relevant here,delay resulting from proceedings concerning the defendant is automatically excludable from a speedy trial act calculation h supp.hereinafter subsection h.in addition,delay resulting from a continuance granted by the district court may be excluded if the district court makes the findings required by h hereinafter subsection h.
this case requires us to decide the narrow question whether time granted to a party to prepare pretrial motions is automatically excludable from the act limit under subsection h,or whether such time may be excluded only if a court makes findings under subsection h.the court of appeals for the eighth circuit held that pretrial motion preparation time is automatically excludable under subsection h.we granted certiorari,and now reverse.
on august,police officers surveilling an apartment building for drug activity saw petitioner and his girlfriend enter a car parked in front of the building and drive away.after observing petitioner commit several traffic violations,the officers stopped the vehicle.they approached the car and noticed two small bags of cocaine on petitioner lap.after the officers read petitioner his miranda warnings,petitioner made inculpatory statements.see miranda arizona.petitioner denied any association with the apartment building where the car had been parked,but his girlfriend admitted that she lived there and consented to a search of her residence.the officers who conducted the search uncovered several items that belonged to petitioner,including an identification card,cocaine,three firearms,ammunition,and a bulletproof vest.the police arrested petitioner the next day.
on august,a grand jury indicted petitioner for being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g,and for knowing and intentional possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine,in violation of a.the august indictment started the speedy trial act clock.see c.after petitioner arraignment on september,a magistrate judge entered a scheduling order requiring,inter alia,that the parties file pretrial motions by september.
on september,petitioner filed a motion to extend the deadline to file pretrial motions from september to september.the magistrate judge granted the motion and extended the deadline by an extra four days beyond petitioner request,to september.on september,however,petitioner filed a waiver of pretrial motions advising the court that he did not wish to file any pretrial motions.
on october,the magistrate judge held a hearing to consider petitioner waiver,at which petitioner confirmed that he wished to waive his right to file pretrial motions.after a colloquy,the magistrate judge found that petitioner waiver was voluntary and intelligent.
over the next three months,petitioner trial was delayed for several reasons.though these delays are not directly relevant to the question presented here,we recount them to explain the full context in which that question arises.on november,petitioner moved to continue the trial date,stating that his counsel needed additional time to prepare for trial.the district court granted the motion and reset the trial for december.
the parties then met informally and prepared a plea agreement,which they provided to the court.the district court scheduled a change of plea hearing for december.at the hearing,however,petitioner declined to implement the agreement and requested a new attorney.the district court rescheduled the trial for february,granted petitioner attorney subsequent motion to withdraw,and appointed new counsel.
on february,days after petitioner was indicted petitioner moved to dismiss the indictment,claiming that the act limit had elapsed.the district court denied the motion.in calculating how many of the days counted toward the limit,the district judge excluded the period from september through october as within the extension of time granted to file pretrial motions.order in ed,doc.
in late february,a matter arose in an unrelated case on the district court docket,which required the court to reschedule petitioner trial.after obtaining the consent of the parties and finding that a continuance would serve the public interest,the district court continued petitioner trial from february to march.petitioner trial began on that date.the jury found petitioner guilty on both counts and the district court later sentenced him to concurrent terms of imprisonment.
petitioner appealed his convictions and sentence to the eighth circuit,which affirmed the denial of his motion to dismiss for a speedy trial act violation.as relevant,the court of appeals agreed with the district court that the time from september the original deadline for filing pretrial motions through october when the trial court held a hearing on petitioner decision to waive the right to file pretrial motions was excludable from the act limit.although the district court did not identify which provision of the act supported this exclusion,the court of appeals held that pretrial motion preparation time is automatically excludable under subsection h which covers delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant as long as the district court specifically grants time for that purpose.at in reaching this conclusion,the eighth circuit joined seven other courts of appeals that interpret subsection h the same way two courts of appeals,the fourth and sixth circuits,interpret subsection h differently,holding that time for preparing pretrial motions is outside subsection h scope we granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.
as noted,the speedy trial act requires that a criminal defendant trial commence within days of a defendant initial appearance or indictment,but excludes from the period days lost to certain types of delay.section h specifies the types of delays that are excludable from the calculation.some of these delays are excludable only if the district court makes certain findings enumerated in the statute.see h.other delays are automatically excludable,they may be excluded without district court findings.as relevant here,subsection h requires the automatic exclusion of a ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant,including but not limited to periods of delay resulting from eight enumerated subcategories of proceedings the government contends that the time the district court granted petitioner to prepare his pretrial motions is automatically excludable under subsection h.we disagree,and conclude that such time may be excluded only when a district court enters appropriate findings under subsection h.
the eight subparagraphs in subsection h address the automatic excludability of delay generated for certain enumerated purposes.thus,we first consider whether the delay at issue in this case is governed by one of these subparagraphs.it is.
the delay at issue was granted to allow petitioner sufficient time to file pretrial motions subsection h d hereinafter subparagraph d renders automatically excludable delay resulting from any pretrial motion,from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on,or other prompt disposition of,such motion.read,as it must be,in the context of subsection h,this text governs the automatic excludability of delays resulting from a specific category of proceedings concerning the defendant,namely,proceedings involving pretrial motions because the delay at issue here results from a decision granting time to prepare pretrial motions,if not from a pretrial motion itself the defendant request for additional time,it is governed by subparagraph d.but that does not make the delay at issue here automatically excludable.
subparagraph d does not subject all pretrial delay to automatic exclusion.instead,it renders automatically excludable only the delay that occurs from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on,or other prompt disposition of the motion.emphasis added.in so doing,the provision communicates congress judgment that delay resulting from pretrial motions is automatically excludable,excludable without district court findings,only from the time a motion is filed through the hearing or disposition point specified in the subparagraph,and that other periods of pretrial delay are excludable only when accompanied by district court findings 
this limitation is significant because congress knew how to define the boundaries of an enumerated exclusion broadly when it so desired.subsection h a hereinafter subparagraph a,for example,provides for the automatic exclusion of delay resulting from any proceeding,including any examinations,to determine the mental competency or physical capacity of the defendant.emphasis added.with the word including,congress indicated that other proceedings besides examinations might fall within subparagraph a automatic exclusion.in subparagraph d,by contrast,congress declined to use an expansive or illustrative term such as including,and provided instead that only pretrial delay from the filing of a motion to the hearing or disposition point specified in the provision is automatically excludable from the act limit.
thus,although the period of delay the government seeks to exclude in this case results from a proceeding governed by subparagraph d,that period precedes the first day upon which congress specified that such delay may be automatically excluded.the result is that the pretrial motion preparation time at issue in this case is not automatically excludable 
the foregoing analysis resolves our inquiry into automatic excludability because a specific provision here,subparagraph d controls one s of more general application here,subsections h and h.united states.in arguing that this principle applies,but requires a result different from the one we reach,the dissent like the government and several courts of appeals departs from the statute in a manner that underscores the propriety of our approach.
there is no question that subparagraph d is more specific than the general language in subsection h,post,at,or that g eneral language of a statutory provision,although broad enough to include it,will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment,ginsberg sons,popkin.we part company with the dissent because we conclude that subparagraph d governs the period of delay at issue in this case.the dissent does not object to this conclusion on the ground that it is foreclosed by the statute.see post,at asserting that the delay at issue in this case is not necessarily covered by subparagraph d.instead,it joins the government in asserting that the act is amenable to another interpretation that would avoid the strange result that petitioner may be entitled to dismissal of the charges against him because his attorney persuaded a magistrate judge to give the defense additional time to prepare pretrial motions and thus delayed the commencement of his trial.post,at.this argument takes aim at an exaggerated target.because we conclude that the type of delay at issue here is excludable under subsection h,courts can in future cases easily avoid the result the dissent decries,a result that is not certain even in this case.see infra,at.and even if dismissal is ultimately required on remand,a desire to avoid this result does not justify reading subsection h and specifically its reference to other proceedings concerning the defendant to permit automatic exclusion of delay resulting from virtually any decision to continue a deadline.
the dissent first argues that the delay in this case is automatically excludable under subsection h because the provision use of the phrase including but not limited to shows that subsection h permits automatic exclusion of delays beyond those covered by its enumerated subparagraphs.see post,at see also united states oberoi.this argument confuses the illustrative nature of subsection h list of categories of excludable delay each of which is represented by a subparagraph with the contents of the categories themselves.that the list of categories is illustrative rather than exhaustive in no way undermines our conclusion that a delay that falls within the category of delay addressed by subparagraph d is governed by the limits in that subparagraph.the including but not limited to clause would affect our conclusion only if one read it to modify the contents of subparagraph d as well as the list itself.as noted,such a reading would violate settled principles of statutory construction because it would ignore the structure and grammar of subsection h,and in so doing render even the clearest of the subparagraphs indeterminate and virtually superfluous.see,supra,at duncan walker,a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant internal quotation marks omitted.our reading avoids these problems by treating the list as illustrative,but construing each of the eight subparagraphs in h to govern,conclusively unless the subparagraph itself indicates otherwise,see,h a supra,at,the automatic excludability of the delay resulting from the category of proceedings it addresses.
the dissent responds that,even if subparagraph d limits are conclusive rather than merely illustrative,we should automatically exclude the delay at issue here under subsection h opening clause,see post,at,because it is not clear that the delay is governed by the more specific and restrictive language in subparagraph d.post,at.we decline this invitation to use the alleged uncertainty in subparagraph d scope as a justification for disregarding its limits and instead expanding,through liberal interpretation of subsection h generic opening clause what the dissent itself describes as the automatic exclusion exceptio n to the act period and the act general rule requiring findings for continuances.post,at.
on the dissent reading of subsection h,a court could extend by weeks or months,without any finding that the incursion on the act timeliness guarantee is justified,the entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the act sets a default limit of days.the problem with this reading is clear it relies on an interpretation of subsection h that admits of no principled,limit on the definition of a proceeding concerning the defendant,and thus threatens the act manifest purpose of ensuring speedy trials by construing the act automatic exclusion exceptions in a manner that could swallow the rule.this approach is not justified,much less compelled,by the textual ambiguities and legislative history upon which the dissent relies.nor is it justified by the prospect,however appealing,of reaching a different result in this case.hence our conclusion that the text and structure of subsection h do not permit automatic exclusion of the delay at issue in this case.
our conclusion is further supported by subsection h context,particularly neighboring subsection h.subsection h provides that delays resulting from a continuance granted by any judge may be excluded,but only if the judge finds that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial and records those findings.in setting forth the statutory factors that justify a continuance under subsection h,congress twice recognized the importance of adequate pretrial preparation time.see h b ii requiring a district court to consider whether the unusual or complex nature of a case makes it unreasonable to expect adequate preparation for pretrial proceedings or for the trial itself within the time limits emphasis added h b iv requiring a district court to consider in other cases w hether the failure to grant such a continuance would deny counsel for the defendant or the attorney for the government the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation,taking into account the exercise of due diligence emphasis added.our determination that the delay at issue here is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection h,and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only where district court makes findings justifying the exclusion post,at construing subsection h in a manner that could encompass,and govern,delays expressly within subsection h purview.
finally,our speedy trial act precedents support our reading of subsection h.we recently explained that the act serves not only to protect defendants,but also to vindicate the public interest in the swift administration of justice.we thus held that a defendant may not opt out of the act even if he believes it would be in his interest a llowing prospective waivers would seriously undermine the act because there are many cases in which the prosecution,the defense,and the court would all be happy to opt out of the act,to the detriment of the public interest.zedner united states,
courts of appeals that have read subsection h to exclude automatically pretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that their interpretation is necessary to provide defendants adequate time to build their defense.see,united states mobile materials,per curiam,opinion supplemented on other grounds on rehearing,per curiam.yet these same courts have recognized that reading subsection h to exclude all time for preparing pretrial motions would undermine the guarantee of a speedy trial,and thus harm the public interest we have recognized in preserving that guarantee even where one or both parties to a proceeding would be willing to waive it.see zedner,supra,at.to avoid a result so inconsistent with the statute purpose,to avoid creating a big loophole in the statute,united states tibboel,these courts have found it necessary to craft limitations on the automatic exclusion for pretrial motion preparation time that their interpretation of subsection h otherwise would allow.see,ibid.stating that pretrial motion preparation time may be automatically excluded under subsection h only when the judge has expressly granted a party time for that purpose emphasis added oberoi,at this qualification prevents abuse.without it,either party could delay trial indefinitely merely by working on pretrial motions right up to the eve of trial 
the fact that courts reading subsection h to exclude preparation time have imposed extratextual limitations on excludability to avoid creating a big loophole in the statute,tibboel,supra,at,underscores the extent to which their interpretation and the dissent strays from the act text and purpose.as noted,subsection h expressly accounts for the possibility that a district court would need to delay a trial to give the parties adequate preparation time.an exclusion under subsection h is not automatic,however,and requires specific findings.allowing district courts to exclude automatically such delays would redesign this statutory framework.
we also note that some of the courts of appeals that have interpreted subsection h to exclude automatically pretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that a contrary reading of that provision would lay a trap for trial judges by forcing them to risk a speedy trial act violation if they wish to grant a defendant request for additional time to prepare a pretrial motion,united states wilson,cadc see also oberoi,supra,at.
we acknowledge that it would be unpalatable to interpret the speedy trial act to trap district courts for accommodating a defendant request for additional time to prepare pretrial motions,particularly in a case like this.petitioner instigated all of the pretrial delays except for the final continuance from february to march.and the record clearly shows that the magistrate judge and the district court diligently endeavored to accommodate petitioner requests granting his motion for an extension of time to decide whether to file pretrial motions,his motion for a continuance,and his motion for a new attorney and for time to allow this new attorney to become familiar with the case.fortunately,we can abide by the limitations congress imposed on the statutory rights at issue here without interpreting the act in a manner that would trap trial courts.
for the reasons we explained above,neither subparagraph d nor subsection h automatically excludes time granted to prepare pretrial motions.this conclusion does not lay a trap for trial judges because it limits in a way the statute requires only automatic exclusions.in considering any request for delay,whether the exclusion of time will be automatic or not,trial judges always have to devote time to assessing whether the reasons for the delay are justified,given both the statutory and constitutional requirement of speedy trials.placing these reasons in the record does not add an appreciable burden on these judges.neither are district courts forced to choose between rejecting a defendant request for time to prepare pretrial motions and risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the trial.instead,a district court may exclude preparation time under subsection h if it grants a continuance for that purpose based on recorded findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.subsection h provides m uch of the act flexibility,zedner,at,and gives district courts discretion within limits and subject to specific procedures to accommodate limited delays for needs,at.the statutory scheme thus ensures that district courts may grant necessary pretrial motion preparation time without risking dismissal.
still,the government suggests that,in some cases,a district court may fail to make the findings necessary for an exclusion under subsection h,leading to a windfall gain for a defendant who induces delay beyond the act limit.dismissal,however,need not represent a windfall.a district court may dismiss the charges without prejudice,thus allowing the government to refile charges or reindict the defendant.a.in ruling upon a motion to dismiss under the act,a district court should consider,among other factors,the party responsible for the delay.see ibid.in determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice,the district court shall consider,among others,each of the following factors the seriousness of the offense the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice emphasis added see also united states taylor,seemingly ignored were the brevity of the delay and the consequential lack of prejudice to respondent,as well as respondent own illicit contribution to the delay 
based on this analysis,we hold that the period from september through october,which includes the additional time granted by the district court for pretrial motion preparation,is not automatically excludable under subsection h.the court of appeals did not address whether any portion of that time might have been otherwise excludable.nor did the government assert in its merits brief that another provision of the act could support exclusion,presenting the argument that september through october could be excluded separately only in its brief in opposition to certiorari and during oral argument.we therefore do not consider whether any other exclusion would apply to all or part of the period.instead,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals for the eighth circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice ginsburg,concurring.
in its brief in opposition to bloate petition for certiorari,the government argued that the indictment against bloate need not be dismissed even if,as the court today holds,the additional time bloate gained to prepare pretrial motions does not qualify for automatic exclusion from the speedy trial act limit.i join the court opinion on the understanding that nothing in the opinion bars the eighth circuit from considering,on remand,the government argument that the indictment,and convictions under it,remain effective.
bloate moved,on september,to extend the deadline for filing pretrial motions.the magistrate judge granted bloate request that same day,extending the deadline from september to september.having gained more time,bloate decided that pretrial motions were unnecessary after all.accordingly,on september,he filed a proposed waiver of his right to file such motions.on october,the magistrate judge accepted the waiver following a hearing at which the judge found the waiver knowing and voluntary.as urged by the government,even if the clock continued to run from september,
it stopped on september,when bloate filed a pleading advising the court that he had decided not to raise any issues by pretrial motion.although not labeled a pretrial motion,that pleading required a hearing and served essentially as a motion for leave to waive the right to file pretrial motions.the speedy trial act clock thus stopped under h d until the matter was heard by the court on october.brief in opposition.
by the government measure,excluding the time from september through october would reduce the number of days that count for speedy trial act purposes to,days short of the act threshold.see,at.
the government reiterated this contention at oral argument.e ven if the time starting on september i s not excluded,counsel said,bloate september filing trigger ed its own exclusion of time until the hearing held by the magistrate judge on october.tr.of oral arg.see also,at.this argument,the government suggested,should be taken into account on any remand.at.see also,at i f the court thinks that an incorrect amount of time was excluded,the appropriate thing to do in that circumstance would be for the court to leave that open on remand,assuming that it preserved.
the question presented and the parties merits briefs address only whether time granted to prepare pretrial motions is automatically excludable under h supp.as a court of ultimate review,we are not positioned to determine,in the first instance,and without full briefing and argument,whether the time from september to october should be excluded from the speedy trial act calculation.but the eighth circuit is not similarly restricted.it may therefore consider,after full airing,the government argument that bloate indictment should not be dismissed despite his success in this court.
taylor james bloate,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice alito,with whom justice breyer joins,dissenting.
the court interpretation of the speedy trial act of speedy trial act or act is not supported by the text or the legislative history of the act.under the court interpretation,petitioner may be entitled to dismissal of the charges against him because his attorney persuaded a magistrate judge to give the defense additional time to prepare pretrial motions and thus delayed the commencement of his trial.the speedy trial act does not require this strange result.
the speedy trial act generally requires a federal criminal trial to begin within days after the defendant is charged or appears in court,but certain pretrial periods are excluded from the calculation.see ed.and supp.the provision at issue here,h supp,automatically excludes a ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant,including but not limited to eight specific types of delay that are set out in subparagraphs a h.eight courts of appeals have and i agree that a delay resulting from the granting of a defense request for additional time to complete pretrial motions is a delay resulting from a proceedin g concerning the defendant and is thus automatically excluded under h.
in considering the question presented here,i begin with the general language of h,which,as noted,automatically excludes any delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant.for convenience,i will refer to this portion of the statute as subsection h.the delay resulting from the granting of a defense request for an extension of time to complete pretrial motions falls comfortably within the terms of subsection h.
first,the granting of such a defense request qualifies as a proceeding.a court proceeding is defined as a n act or step that is part of a larger action and an act done by the authority or direction of the court.black law dictionary ed.internal quotation marks omitted hereinafter black law.the granting of a defense request for an extension of time to prepare pretrial motions constitutes both a n act or step that is part of the larger criminal case and an act done by the authority or direction of the court.second,delay caused by the granting of such an extension is obviously delay resulting from the successful extension request.
the court does not contend that the granting of a defense request for time to prepare pretrial motions falls outside the plain meaning of subsection h,but the court holds that h d hereinafter subparagraph d narrows the meaning of subsection h.subparagraph d sets out one of the eight categories of delay that are specifically identified as delay resulting from a proceedin g concerning the defendant,but as noted,this list is preceded by the phrase including but not limited to.when include is utilized,it is generally improper to conclude that entities not specifically enumerated are excluded.singer singer,sutherland on statutes and statutory construction,ed.see campbell music,herb welding,gray,federal land bank of paul bismarck lumber,black law the participle including typically indicates a partial list and the inclusion in subsection h of the additional phrase not limited to reinforces this point.see united states tibboel.
because subparagraph d follows the phrase including but not limited to,the court has a steep hurdle to clear to show that this subparagraph narrows the meaning of the general rule set out in subsection h.the court argument is that subparagraph d governs not just delay resulting from any pretrial motion,h d,but also delay resulting from proceedings involving pretrial motions,ante,at,and emphasis added,and all pretrial delay,ante,at emphasis added.in the court view,congress has expressed a judgment that if a period of pretrial delay does not fall within the express terms of subparagraph d,then it is excludable only when accompanied by district court findings.ante,at.thus,since subparagraph d does not provide for the exclusion of delay resulting from the granting of a defense request for more time to prepare pretrial motions,the court holds that such delay is not excluded from the calculation.the court analysis,however,is not supported by either the text of subparagraph d or the circumstances that gave rise to its enactment.
the court argument would have some force if it were clear that the delay involved in the present case is delay resulting from a pretrial motion.h d.it could then be argued that subparagraph d reflects a legislative decision to provide for the automatic exclusion of delay resulting from a pretrial motion only if that delay occurs during the period from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on,or other prompt disposition of,such motion.ibid 
it is at least doubtful,however,that the delay at issue in the present case is delay resulting from a pretrial motion.ibid the phrase resulting from means proceed ing,spring ing,or aris ing as a consequence,effect,or conclusion.webster third new international dictionary.thus,delay resulting from a pretrial motion is delay that occurs as a consequence of such a motion.the type of delay involved in the present case,however,does not occur as a consequence of a pretrial motion rather,it occurs as a consequence of the court granting of a defense request for an extension of time.the particular facts of this case sharply illustrate this point because petitioner never filed pretrial motions 
it is telling that the court elides the statutory phrase resulting from and substitutes a broader phrase of its own invention.the court writes that pretrial delay that is not captured by subparagraph d text is excludable only when accompanied by district court findings.ante,at.see also ante,at subparagraph d does not subject all pretrial delay to automatic exclusion ante,at o nly pretrial delay from the filing of a motion to the hearing or disposition point specified in the provision is automatically excludable ante,at,pretrial delay ibid.pretrial proceedings but pretrial delay is not necessarily delay resulting from a pretrial motion.
even if it is possible to read the statutory phrase resulting from to mean related to,see ante,at,there are at least two good reasons for rejecting that reading.first,because subparagraphs a h are meant to be illustrative,those provisions should not be interpreted as limiting unless the limitation is very clear.second,the court interpretation of subparagraph d leads to an anomalous result that congress is unlikely to have intended.because subparagraph d automatically excludes delay resulting from any pretrial motion,from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on,or other prompt disposition of,such motion,it is clear that subparagraph d automatically excludes delay resulting from the granting of a prosecution request for additional time to respond to a defendant pretrial motions.the court has not identified any reason why congress might have wanted to provide an automatic exclusion for delay resulting from the granting of a prosecution request for additional time to respond to a defendant pretrial motions but not for delay resulting from the granting of the defendant request for additional time to prepare those very motions.since there is nothing to suggest that congress intended such a strange,asymmetrical result,the court strained interpretation of subparagraph d should be rejected.subparagraph d should be read to apply only to delay resulting from a pretrial motion,and because the delay involved here does not result from a pretrial motion,there is no basis for inferring that subparagraph d was meant to take that delay outside the scope of the general language of subsection h.
the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the current version of subparagraph d in point to the same conclusion.that language was adopted to expand the reach of the exclusion.as originally enacted,the relevant provision of the act excluded only delay resulting from hearings on pretrial motions,stat,and courts had interpreted this language literally to exclude only time actually devoted to hearings.see,united states lewis,supp,united states conroy,cr.cht,dist.lexis,sdny,accord,united states simms,supp,wd.the house judiciary committee stated that the language on which the court now relies was added to avoid an unduly restrictive interpretation of the exclusion as extending only to the actual time consumed in a pretrial hearing.similarly,the senate judiciary committee expressed frustration with what it described as the courts unnecessarily inflexible interpretation of the act,hereinafter.see also,at.congress expansion of the exclusion set out in subparagraph d so that it covers,not just the time taken up by hearings on pretrial motions,but all delay resulting from pretrial motions does not support the inference that congress wanted the type of delay at issue in this case to count against the speedy trial act period.
contending that congress could have been more explicit if it wished courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation time automatically,the court cites as an example a legislative proposal by the department of justice to provide for an express exclusion of preparation time for pretrial motions.ante,at.the court is correct that congress did not choose this option,but the court argument misses the point.
first,it bears emphasizing that the justice department proposal did not simply exclude delay caused by a successful defense request for additional time to prepare pretrial motions.that is the delay in dispute here.instead,the justice department proposal excluded all delay resulting from the preparation and service of pretrial motions and responses from hearings thereon.as introduced.
second,the reasons given in the senate judiciary committee report for rejecting the justice department proposal do not apply when the delay results from the granting of a defense request such as the one at issue here.the senate committee report noted that,when excluding time for the preparation of pretrial motions,it will be quite difficult to determine a point at which preparation actually begins.at.but when a district court grants a defendant motion for time to prepare pretrial motions,that concern is not present.see united states oberoi,noting the importance of the district court expressly stopping the speedy trial clock to create a point from which to measure preparation time in addition,the committee expressed the view that in routine cases,preparation time should not be excluded.at.however,cases in which a district court accedes to a defense request for more than the usual amount of time for the completion of pretrial motions are by definition not routine.
third,there is no reason why congress should have supposed that the language that congress and the president enacted did not reach delay resulting from the granting of the defendant request for additional time to prepare pretrial motions.as explained above,supra,at,such delay results from a proceeding concerning the defendant and is not delay resulting from a pretrial motion.
in sum,delay resulting from the granting of a defense motion for an extension of time to file pretrial motions falls within the general rule,set out in subsection h,that automatically excludes delay resulting from a proceedin g concerning the defendant the subparagraphs that follow,which are preceded by the phrase including but not limited to,are illustrative,not exhaustive and neither the text of subparagraph d nor the circumstances surrounding its adoption clearly reflect an intent to narrow the scope of the general rule set out in subsection h.for these reasons,i would hold that the delay in question here is automatically excluded.
the court advances several additional arguments in support of its analysis,but none is persuasive.
two of these arguments hinge on the court unjustifiably broad interpretation of subparagraph d,that it covers all pretrial delay.first,the court reasons that under a contrary interpretation,a court could extend by weeks or months,without any finding that the incursion on the act timeliness guarantee is justified,the entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the act sets a default limit of days.ante,at.but the same is true of the court interpretation.even under an interpretation that automatically excludes delay only from the time a motion is filed through the hearing or disposition point,ante,at,there appears to be no reason why a district court may not,in its discretion,extend the automatically excludable period of time under subparagraph d through any number of means,including extending the time to file an opposition brief,see tr.of oral arg.extending the time to file a reply brief,see united states latham,dist.lexis,nd,allowing supplemental briefing,see united states faison,app.lexis,deferring the hearing on a pretrial motion,see united states riley,conducting multiple hearings on the motion or motions,united states boone,crim,wl,d nj,or allowing the filing of post hearing submissions,see henderson united states.indeed,in henderson we held that days of delay resulting from the filing of a pretrial motion were automatically excludable,and we noted that congress was aware of the breadth of the exclusion it was enacting.at the court suggestion that its interpretation is necessary to protect the act timeliness guarantee,ante,at,is illusory.
for a similar reason,the court interpretation is not supported by the rule of construction that a specific provision controls one s of more general application.ante,at.this rule applies only when specific and general statutory provisions conflict.national cable telecommunications,gulf power.here,there is no conflict because,even if subparagraph d governs delay resulting from any pretrial motion,there is no basis for concluding that subparagraph d governs all pretrial delay.
contrary to the court claim,its decision is not supported by h a,which excludes delay resulting from a continuance provided that the trial court sets forth,in the record of the case,its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.one might argue that a trial judge grants a continuance whenever the judge postpones a trial date,even when the postponement is the direct result of a proceeding that falls squarely within the language of subsection h or one of the specific illustrative subparagraphs that follow.see h a a ny period of delay resulting from a continuance but such a reading would render subsection h and subparagraphs a h meaningless if it were true that all continuances required findings.the plain terms of subsection h refute this interpretation and show that congress intended for some periods of delay that postpone the trial date to be automatically excludable.
viewed in their proper context,subsection h and its subparagraphs carve out exceptions to the general rule of h a requiring findings for continuances.see,united states,noting that when pretrial motion delay is automatically excluded,the district court does not have to make findings or consider any factors a period of delay resulting from a continuance requires findings only when it does not also fall within the subset of automatically excludable delay defined by subsection h.when a period of delay resulting from a continuance does qualify for automatic exclusion,a court ordinarily should give effect to the more specific provisions of subsection h.see united states,a specific provision controls over one of more general application ante,at.
for the reasons discussed,see supra,at,the granting of a defense request for an extension of time to complete pretrial motions is a proceedin g concerning the defendant within the meaning of s
