defendants luis eligio and aquiles were found guilty of violating a,which makes it a crime for the master,operator,or person in charge of a vessel of the united states,or a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states,to knowingly fail to obey an order by an authorized federal law enforcement officer to heave to that vessel.they now appeal their convictions,asserting multiple trial errors and claiming that the evidence was,in any event,insufficient to support the jury verdict.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
the factual background of this appeal,which we recite in the light most favorable to the verdict,is uncomplicated.in the hours of march,the coast guard cutter matinicus was patrolling the mona passage between puerto rico and the dominican republic when a member of the crew sighted a small vessel leaving mona island,puerto rico and heading toward the dominican republic the crew member reported the sighting to chief warrant officer michael levecque,who ordered that the matinicus be brought about to intercept the vessel.as it later turned out,was operating the small vessel and was also in the vessel.
at around,the crew of the matinicus activated its blue law enforcement light on the ship mast shined a spotlight on the defendants vessel blew the ship whistle and began directing the defendants to stop in both english and spanish using the ship loud hailer.the defendants did not stop at that time.a boarding team launched from the matinicus in a small vessel at and arrived alongside the defendants vessel one minute later.the boarding team activated a blue light on its vessel and began commanding the defendants to stop the vessel,stop the vessel.the defendants did not stop.the boarding team made a second approach while repeating the command to stop,but,again,the defendants did not stop.finally,on a third approach,the boarding team told the defendants that force would be used if they did not stop.the defendants turned off their motor at that point and were taken into custody.about twelve minutes elapsed between the time the matinicus activated its blue light and the time the defendants stopped.
the defendants were subsequently charged with failing to obey a federal law enforcement officer order to.a.the government argued at trial that should be convicted as a principal and that should be convicted as an aider and abettor.the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to both defendants,and the district court summarily denied a motion for judgment of acquittal.this appeal followed.
the defendants raise five claims of error on appeal the district court should have entered a judgment of acquittal because there was insufficient evidence that the defendants heard and understood the coast guard orders to the district court erroneously ruled that evidence relating to a prior conviction could be admitted to impeach if he testified at trial the government improperly vouched for its own witnesses during closing arguments the district court erred in refusing to give a missing evidence instruction and the district court engaged in improper questioning during testimony.we address each of these arguments in turn.
sufficiency of the evidence 
to prove a failure to,the government must show that the defendant was the master,operator,or person in charge of the vessel an authorized federal law enforcement officer ordered the defendant to the defendant failed to obey that order and the defendant failure to obey the order was knowing and intentional see a,b.to establish aiding and abetting liability,the government must show that the principal committed the substantive offense charged,and that the accomplice became associated with the principal criminal endeavor and took part in it,intending to assure its success.united states gonzalez,cir internal quotations marks and citations omitted.on review for sufficiency,we ask whether the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,would permit a reasonable jury to find each element beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states,cir.
challenges only the finding that he had the requisite mens rea.he contends that he could be convicted only on proof that he was aware of and understood the coast guard orders.we agree.the statute penalizes those who knowingly disobey an order to,a term that ordinarily goes to the defendant knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.bryan united states.the issuance of an order to is one of the facts constituting the offense in this case.to prove that a defendant knew that an order to was given,it will typically be necessary to prove that he was aware of the order and comprehended its essential message.
points to trial testimony in support of his argument that he lacked the necessary knowledge.testified that he and saw the matinicus spotlight but did not hear the orders to stop.in addition,both and denied hearing the orders in statements given to an immigration official.
however,the jury heard substantial testimony undermining the defendants story.levecque testified that when he and the crew lit the defendants up with a spotlight and started blowing our horn,they kind of turned and obviously behind them.i looked very surprised.there was testimony that the order to stop was given in spanish and english over the loud hailer,which was audible at a distance of to feet,and that the defendants vessel was less than feet from the matinicus at the time.further testimony established that the boarding crew repeated the order to stop during its first two passes,which brought the crew within to feet of the defendants vessel,and that the defendants stopped only when they were warned that force would be used.
in addition,acknowledged in a statement that he saw the flashing lights and admitted we were spotted by the coast guard and i tried to outrun them.he acknowledged having been detained on previous occasions as did and stated that he did not stop because he was scared and did not want to go to jail.finally,when was asked,when you saw the coast guard boat what happened he responded,i told that they were coming.viewed as a whole,the evidence was more than sufficient for the jury to find that heard and understood the orders to stop.
moved for a judgment of acquittal in the district court on the ground that there was no evidence that he was the master,operator,or person in charge of the small vessel.a.the district court denied that motion,and properly appealed.in this court,however,attorney filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the appeal.the attorney stated that he had lost contact with,who apparently returned to the dominican republic after completing his sentence.we denied the motion because the attorney had not shown that affirmatively authorized the withdrawal of his direct criminal appeal.the attorney then filed a motion to adopt two of the arguments made in appellate brief the sufficiency of the evidence argument,discussed above,and an argument relating to the district court aggressive questioning of witnesses during trial,discussed below.see fed.i.no separate appellate brief was filed on behalf.
the rule in this circuit is clear a doption by reference can not occur in a vacuum to be meaningful,the arguments adopted must be readily transferrable from the proponent case to the adopter case.united states david,cir.argument relating to the district judge questioning of witnesses is readily transferable to case.as noted,we address that argument below.it is less clear how sufficiency of the evidence argument might be transferred to case.to the extent that means to argue that he did not hear the order to,his argument fails for essentially the reasons discussed above.there was sufficient circumstantial evidence for the jury to find that both defendants heard the order and knowingly disobeyed it.
other arguments that might have been able to make on his own are forfeited.they would be unavailing in any event.the argument that made to the district he was not the master,operator,or person in charge of the small beside the point because the government theory was that aided and abetted failure to.and the jury could reasonably have interpreted warning to that the coast guard was coming as the sort of encouragement that makes one an aider and abettor as in,they coming,let get out of here.see united states mercado,cir one can aid or abet another through use of words or actions to promote the success of the illegal venture.the district court did not err in denying motion for judgment of acquittal.
evidence of prior conviction 
the district court ruled in limine that evidence of prior drug conviction could be admitted to impeach him under federal rule of evidence a if he chose to testify.although challenges that ruling on appeal,he does so only to preserve the issue for supreme court review.he concedes that his claim is foreclosed under the supreme court decision in luce united states,which held that a defendant who chooses not to testify at trial loses his right to appeal the district court ruling denying his in limine motion to forbid the impeachment use of a prior conviction.united states holmquist,cir did not testify at trial,and we therefore reject his argument.
during closing arguments,the prosecutor rhetorically asked the jury,are you going to give sic the testimony of the united states coast guard officers or are you going to believe the testimony raised by the defendant lodged an objection that the government was improperly vouching for its witnesses,which was overruled.
improper vouching occurs when the government places the prestige of the united states behind a witness by making personal assurances about the credibility of a witness or implies that the jury should credit the government evidence simply because the government can be trusted.united states robinson,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.viewed in context,it is clear that the prosecutor rhetorical question did neither of those things.the prosecutor had just finished outlining the factors he believed undermined credibility.he then told the jury,t here matters of credibility in this case,and rhetorically asked which version of the events the jury would choose to believe.of course,the implicit message was that the government case was more believable than the defendants case.but merely asking the members of the jury to use their common sense in evaluating the witnesses testimony is not improper vouching.united states,cir see also united states rodríguez,cir a n argument that does no more than assert reasons why a witness ought to be accepted as truthful by the jury is not improper witness vouching.wayne lafave et,criminal procedure e ed.t he prosecutor is not prohibited from explaining to the jury why it should conclude the defendant was guilty or accept or reject a particular witness testimony.
the defendants argue that the prosecutor tone and inflection suggested to the jury that the coast guard witnesses should be believed simply because they are coast guard officers.we take that to mean that the prosecutor placed special emphasis on the words united states coast guard officers.if that is true,it might be troubling because such emphasis could be taken to impl y that the jury should credit the government evidence simply because the government can be trusted.robinson,at internal quotation marks omitted.but we have no way to judge the accuracy of the defendants characterization from the trial transcript.on this record,we must necessarily defer to the district court assessment of that issue.reagan brock,cir noting that our ability to comprehend how a question was understood in the courtroom is vastly inferior to the district judge because the judge hears the question with counsel inflection,perceives the length and character of the pause between question and answer,and rules on the party objection within the context of prior questioning and strategies.
adverse inference instruction 
chief warrant officer levecque testified that the matinicus radar equipment was supposed to have recorded a video of the chase.for technical reasons,however,the video did not record properly and could not be played.the government made a number of efforts to play the video,including bringing it back to the matinicus to play it on the cutter recording system.when none of those efforts worked,the government notified the defendants of the technical problem,one month before the trial began.
at trial,the defendants asked the district court to give what they call a missing evidence instruction,which would have advised the jury that it could infer that the video would have been unfavorable to the government based on the government failure to produce it.the district court refused to give the instruction,citing the lack of evidence that the government acted in bad faith and the impossibility of producing the video.it told the defendants they could argue to the jury that the government should have produced the video.the defendants challenge that ruling on appeal.we review for abuse of discretion.united states rose,cir.
in some circumstances,a party failure to produce evidence may justify an inference that the evidence would have been unfavorable to the party this general rule of evidence encompasses everything from the decision not to call a witness to the intentional destruction of documents.the party seeking the instruction has the burden of laying an appropriate evidentiary foundation.united states laurent,cir.although the particulars of the required showing vary from situation to situation,the basic thrust is always the same the circumstances must be such that a reasonable jury could conclude that the evidence in question was unfavorable to the party.see laurent,at spoliation united states myerson,cir missing witness.
in this case,there is no basis for such an inference.the government gave a satisfactory explanation for its failure to produce the radar video the video did not properly record because of a technical mishap.defendants have placed nothing in the record to suggest that the government explanation was untrue.under the circumstances,there is no reason to suppose that the video might have been unfavorable to the government.the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give an adverse inference instruction.
questioning by the district court 
defendants claim that the district court engaged in questioning of on the witness stand that was overly aggressive and signaled to the jury that the judge disbelieved testimony.there was no objection at trial,see.c,so we review for plain error only.united states paz uribe,cir.
the principles governing the defendants claim are easily stated,if less easily applied.it is that the district court is more than a mere moderator in a federal jury trial.quercia united states.among other things,the court has the prerogative,and at times the duty,of eliciting facts he deems necessary to the clear presentation of issues.paz uribe,at quoting llach united states,cir see also.b the court may interrogate witnesses,whether called by itself or by a party.the trial court discretion in this area is broad,and there are many different situations in which judicial interrogation can be warranted.see charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure evidence ed.supp.
at the same time,the power to interrogate witnesses must be exercised judiciously,particularly when the witness is a defendant in a criminal case.united states,cir.each intervention raises the possibility that the jury will perceive the court as biased toward one party or another.the court must therefore take pains to preserve an attitude of impartiality and guard against giving the jury an impression that the court believes the defendant is guilty.paz uribe,at quoting llach,at.
in this case,the district court aggressively questioned witnesses on both sides.however,the court questioning of differed in tenor from his questioning of the government witnesses.whereas the questions directed at the government witnesses by and large related to technical matters,many of the questions directed at focused on perceived gaps and inconsistencies in his story.an excerpt in which the court pressed to explain how he ended up near mona island during a fishing trip will illustrate the general tone of the questioning
