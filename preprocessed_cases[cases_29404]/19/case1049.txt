jason gerhard,cirino gonzalez,and daniel riley were convicted after actively supporting two convicted criminals during a,standoff with federal authorities,and they now appeal.
these three defendants violated several federal statutes by providing material support to edward and elaine brown,who refused to surrender to face punishment following their january federal tax convictions.the browns defied law enforcement authorities from their plainfield,new hampshire,property,turning it into an armed camp.marshals,having learned from past experiences,were anxious to avoid a violent confrontation eventually they peacefully apprehended the browns in october.
defendants helped acquire firearms and explosives and turn the browns property into a potential death trap.they also made statements to the media and through the internet to the effect that any law enforcement officers who attempted to arrest the browns would do so at their peril.defendants were arrested in september.
defendants were indicted in january on charges of conspiring to prevent federal officers from discharging their duties,count,conspiring to commit offenses against the united states,id.count,and being accessories after the fact to the browns tax crimes,id.count.each defendant was also charged in an individual count alleging possession of firearms destructive devices in connection with a crime of violence,c a b gerhard was charged in count,gonzalez in count,and riley in count.
after a jury trial,gerhard and riley were convicted on all counts against them.gonzalez was convicted on counts and the jury hung as to count,the charge,and count,which charged him with possessing a firearm in connection with a violent crime.those counts were dismissed on the government motion.
riley was sentenced to months imprisonment,five years of supervised release,and a special assessment gerhard to months imprisonment,five years of supervised release,and a special assessment and gonzalez to months imprisonment,three years of supervised release,and a special assessment 
defendants now raise a variety of objections.we reject each of their claims and affirm.
factual background 
we describe edward and elaine brown confrontation with federal authorities to set the stage,as well as some of each of the defendant activities.
the browns were indicted on april,for conspiracy to defraud the united states,conspiracy to structure financial transactions to avoid reporting requirements,and aiding and abetting the structuring of financial transactions to avoid reporting requirements,a and.elaine brown was also charged with multiple counts of aiding and abetting tax evasion,and u,and aiding and abetting the willful failure to collect employment taxes,and.the browns trial began on january.
on january,the couple failed to show up for the fourth day of trial.edward brown did not appear for the remainder of the proceedings,and,on january,the district court issued a warrant for his arrest.the marshals service usms convinced elaine brown to return for the balance of the trial as a precaution,the district court barred her from returning to the couple plainfield,new hampshire,edward brown was known to be ordered her to wear a tracking bracelet.on january,the jury returned a guilty verdict against both of the browns on all counts against them.sentencing was scheduled for april.
on february,elaine brown disobeyed the court orders by removing her tracking bracelet and joining edward brown at the plainfield property.the following day,the court issued a warrant for her arrest.on april,the browns were sentenced in absentia to months imprisonment on the charges followed by three years supervised release.they did not surrender to federal authorities.
the browns publicly threatened that any efforts to arrest them on their plainfield property would be met with lethal force.beginning on january,a cadre of supporters,some of them armed,joined edward brown on the couple property.edward brown invoked the specter of past violent confrontations with federal law enforcement personnel in ruby ridge,idaho and waco,texas,should federal authorities try to take the browns into custody.he held widely reported press conferences,gave statements to the media,and contributed to internet broadcasts in which he warned that anyone who attempted to imprison him or his wife would be killed.he also made threats against the lives of officers and elected officials,as well as their families.elaine brown insisted that the couple would either leave their property free or in body bags.
attracted by these statements,television,print,and electronic media set up shop in plainfield to report on the standoff.
the usms,determined to avoid a violent confrontation,went to extraordinary lengths to insure that the standoff would be resolved peacefully without people being injured or killed.as new hampshire marshal testified at the defendants trial 
a lmost immediately edward brown started talking about violence,using violence towards law enforcement if we attempted to go to his house.he talked about waco and ruby ridge.there were supporters there.we knew there were weapons there.so we made a conscious decision in january to proceed in a very deliberate and methodical way to find the best means and the best opportunity to take them safely into custody so that no one got hurt.
from january until,deputy marshals spoke regularly to the browns on the telephone,urging them to surrender.the marshal also sent the browns two letters,describing their legal situation and asking them to give themselves up to authorities.
during this period,the usms did not attempt to enter the browns residence,which sat in the middle of their property and had a very difficult approach.the usms began surveillance of the browns property in january but carefully avoided encounters with the browns or their supporters that could have resulted in violence.
until september,the usms allowed individuals other than the browns to enter and exit the property.the usms hoped this would give them an opportunity to insert undercover deputy marshals and resolve the situation peacefully.the usms also repeatedly warned the public against giving certain forms of aid to the browns.the usms made statements,through the media,that the browns were convicted felons,they were resisting government efforts to get them to surrender,that usms officers were aware that they had weapons at their home,that supporters were going there,and that if you aid or abet the browns,you bring them weapons or supplies or aid them in their effort to obstruct justice,that you could be subjecting yourself to arrest and prosecution.
despite the usms warnings,all three defendants went to new hampshire to support the browns after the couple convictions.jason gerhard,then years old,from brookhaven,new york,traveled to the browns property several times between february and august of and lived there for a while during this period daniel riley,then years old,from cohoes,new york,was a regular visitor between march and september and cirino gonzalez,then thirty years old,from alice,texas,stayed often with the browns from early april until late june.
each of the three defendants came to the new hampshire property anticipating violence and brought at least one weapon with him to the browns home.after assessing the situation firsthand,the defendants each helped prepare the plainfield property to withstand attempts by the usms to arrest the browns.the three worked together to help the couple acquire additional firearms,ammunition,and explosive devices,some of which they placed strategically around the property.their efforts diminished prospects for a peaceful resolution to the standoff and delayed apprehension of the browns.
when acquiring and stockpiling weapons for the browns,the defendants often cooperated closely with each other.for instance,on may,riley gonzalez to coordinate the purchase of two caliber rifles,capable of firing rounds and equipped with specialized scopes for shooting.riley said that gonzalez would only need one for the house.the next day,riley arranged to meet gonzalez at a gun shop in newport,new hampshire,to fill out necessary paperwork to acquire the guns.on may,gonzalez and riley met at a newport gun dealer,where each purchased a caliber rifle.riley later gonzalez to ask if edward brown was happy with our progress,if brown wanted additional rounds of ammunition,and if the supporters in plainfield had rifles.two days after riley query about riles,gonzalez returned to newport to pick up his caliber rifle.gerhard also purchased a firearms for the browns resistance,most of which were found on the browns property after their arrest.
the defendants invested considerable effort in publicizing their efforts to arm the browns stronghold against the usms.they communicated their support of the browns through,online videos,and radio interviews,in which each asserted his willingness to use deadly force to protect the couple from apprehension.the usms knowledge that armed supporters of the browns were on the property was a factor the usms considered when delaying entering the browns property to apprehend the couple during the first four months of the standoff.
the usms efforts went through several stages as events played out.in the early morning of june,the usms deployed two teams of about fifty officers,including new hampshire state troopers,in an effort to arrest edward brown whom,it was thought,would be found at the end of his driveway.a special operations group sog was formed to oversee the operation,which included deputy marshals from other districts.armored vehicles were dispatched to the area,a medical helicopter was placed on alert,and aerial surveillance was conducted to determine how many supporters were on the browns property.sog leaders set up to monitor the raid at a command post in lebanon,new hampshire.
the raid was called off,however,after riley chanced upon the deputy marshals while walking a dog.riley was briefly detained he returned to the browns property soon after his release.following that attempt,the usms increased its pressure on the browns to surrender by cutting off electricity and mail delivery to the browns property.
in the days after the usms june operation,defendants redoubled their efforts to fortify the browns property against any entry by law enforcement and to arm themselves and others for a bloody confrontation in the event the usms attempted to take the couple into custody.on june,gerhard purchased rounds of ammunition.the next day,gerhard bought necessary ingredients for manufacturing pipe bombs.the pipe bombs consisted of cylinders of pipe filled with explosive powder,with space for a fuse to be inserted pipe bombs were found on the browns property after they were arrested.
pipe bombs were not the only explosives the defendants helped manufacture.riley assisted in the construction of deadly one pound hand grenade s consisting of nails taped to cans of gunpowder with fuses inserted the nails were intended as shrapnel to increase the destructive force of the explosion.working with edward brown,riley also built several zip guns,which were designed to fire shells with great accuracy at anyone who broke a trip wire.finally,riley obtained highly explosive chemicals,which he and edward brown used to make a series of bombs.riley then positioned these bombs around the perimeter of the browns property.
in the meantime,the browns resistance continued to draw media attention and supporters.in late june and july,the couple hosted two support ed and elaine brown rall ies on their property.these planned events featured live music,as well as remarks by randy weaver,and attracted many supporters.
by september,the usms had developed a new strategy to apprehend the browns.on september,deputy marshals arrested all three defendants while each was away from the plainfield property.the browns held press conferences in which they discussed defendants arrests.three days later,the usms barred supporters from entering the browns property.having successfully isolated the browns from some of their supporters,whose presence had helped to deter arrest efforts,the usms deployed agents,who entered the property and arrested both browns without incident on october.
in addition to the explosives described above,federal officers found seventeen firearms and about rounds of ammunition on the browns property after the couple arrest.
jason gerhard 
gerhard first met edward brown when brown agreed to gerhard request for an interview for gerhard college newspaper.the interview took place on the plainfield property on february and,after the browns conviction and more than one month after edward brown became a fugitive.gerhard wrote two articles based on his conversations with brown,which appeared on march,denounced the couple sham trial and conviction,and detailed the atmosphere at the browns property.gerhard also reported that he had traveled from new york to new hampshire with a rifle in his trunk,which he hoped would provide enough cover fire to get the hell out of there.
while staying with the browns,gerhard expected a violent confrontation with law enforcement and prepared accordingly by helping the couple secure weapons and fortify their property against any attempts by the usms to apprehend them.gerhard bought six guns from new hampshire firearm dealers,four of which were found at the browns home after their arrest.he also purchased thousands of rounds of ammunition,as well as ingredients to manufacture pipe bombs.in addition,gerhard performed household errands for the browns.
gerhard publicized his support for the browns and his anticipation of impending armed conflict with federal authorities.he sent an to a group list,in which he made the threat from firsthand knowledge that if the feds choose to come into the browns house,it would cause them a lot of pain.he added that edward brown let sic us shoot on his property,which is always good.on june,he sent a message to the same group,saying,some of us believe that it is better to lie in wait and come with surprise at the right time.this sort of thinking does make sense,yet how long can people wait 
gerhard made similar threats to law enforcement officials in person.on july,gerhard was involved in a traffic accident in lebanon,new hampshire,while driving elaine brown car.when summoned to the scene,deputy marshals impounded brown vehicle.the next day,gerhard went to the lebanon police department to complain and encountered several deputy marshals.a very agitated gerhard told the deputy marshals that they had no right to be there and were enforcing unconstitutional laws.in response to gerhard assertion that edward brown was a patriot,one of the marshals asked how he could consider brown a patriot after the threats brown had made against law enforcement officers and their families.gerhard replied that the officers were not following the constitution and were now enemies of the constitution,which was treason,and the penalty for treason was death.
gerhard also admitted his efforts to arm the browns.on july,a new hampshire state trooper pulled gerhard over for speeding in charlestown,new hampshire.the officer noticed a rifle in gerhard rear seat gerhard explained that he had just purchased it and that he was returning to the browns property,where he had been staying.
on september,a deputy marshal and local police arrested gerhard,who had enlisted in the army,at fort leonard wood army base in missouri.
cirino gonzalez 
gonzalez learned about the browns activities in late january,considered the circumstances similar to protests at ruby ridge and waco,and decided to support the browns.in early april,gonzalez packed some belongings,including a handgun and a semiautomatic rifle,and drove from texas to the browns plainfield,new hampshire,property.he stayed with the browns in plainfield for about months.
during his stay,gonzalez served,in his own words,as volunteer security for both browns.in that capacity,he routinely carried at least one firearm.at one meeting in the browns home,gonzalez was observed standing behind the couple,wearing a holstered handgun.as part of a video prepared by brown sympathizers and made available to the public,gonzalez was recorded standing next to randy weaver on the browns porch with a rifle slung over his shoulder.aerial surveillance by the usms on the morning of the failed june raid showed gonzalez walking several feet behind edward brown with a rifle over his shoulder as the two searched for riley.
in addition to providing personal security,gonzalez helped further stock the browns arsenal.as described above,he collaborated with riley to purchase a caliber rifle,which he later brought to the browns residence and kept next to his bed.gonzalez also managed a website which publicized the browns actions.
at some point after the usms failed june raid,gonzalez gave a interview to a we the people radio network correspondent named king mob from the browns property.gonzalez declared,
the only reason why federal law enforcement have rolled in here is because they know they have people that have been trained by their own military and by their own law enforcement that are here now literally and they know how to use the weapons they have been given we have weapons and we are going to defend ourselves because we actually know what going on.
gonzalez wore a shoulder holster throughout the interview.the video was made available to the public online.
gonzalez left plainfield in late june.gonzalez continued to communicate with riley,and he received several updates about events unfolding on the browns property.marshals arrested gonzalez in alice,texas,on september.gonzalez was the only defendant to testify at trial.
daniel riley 
daniel riley learned of edward and elaine brown problems with federal law enforcement in february.between march and september of that year,he traveled repeatedly from his home in cohoes,new york,to the browns plainfield property and was described as the browns very good friend.
riley posted an internet video on march,expressing support for the browns revolution against the thieving international bankers who control the government and are out to destroy the country.riley pledged to give the couple a few things to aid in their resistance.as he had pledged,riley brought a shotgun and other weapons with him to the plainfield property.
as the standoff continued,riley helped get firearms and explosives for the browns in anticipation of a violent struggle with law enforcement.riley coordinated his and gonzalez may purchase of two rifles and instructed gonzalez that only one of the weapons would be needed for the house.riley asked gonzalez if edward brown wanted more ammunition.riley also manufactured a series of explosive booby traps,some of which he personally deployed around the browns property.
riley attempted to persuade gonzalez to return to the browns property.on july,about a month after gonzalez had returned to texas,riley him,urging,we have a war to win and we need everybody.
riley repeatedly expressed his willingness to use lethal force to protect the browns.on july,riley several individuals,including gonzalez,to report that everyone on the property was at battle stations after hearing noises in the woods.the next day,again believing that the marshals were preparing to arrest the browns,riley called into a radio show from inside the browns home and informed listeners that supporters were on high alert,had their guns unchambered,and were prepared to go toe to toe with the usms to resist tyranny and protect the browns.riley sent another in august in which he stated that the number one most important thing the browns needed was people to come and stand to their death,if necessary,to save our country,but no homos,lol.
marshals arrested riley in cohoes on september.a search of his residence revealed a rifle signed by edward brown and randy weaver.
ii.defendants arguments on appeal 
on appeal,the defendants challenge the indictment,the trial,and their sentences.we reject each of their arguments and affirm.
arguments related to the indictment 
the defendants raise three distinct challenges to the indictment.first,gerhard and riley assert that the offenses alleged in count,and count,id.and a,on which they were convicted,are multiplicitous.second,gerhard claims that the crimes charged in count,count,id.and,and count,id,are also multiplicitous.finally,all three defendants argue the indictment insufficiently alleged the browns original offenses of conviction underlying the defendants convictions on count as accessories after the fact.we reject all three claims.
gerhard and riley separate convictions under and and a are not on multiplicitous counts 
gerhard and riley argue that their convictions under count and and a count constituted multiple punishment for the same offense,in violation of the double jeopardy clause,const.amend.v.their claim was properly raised before the district court,so our review is de novo,united states lanoue,cir.
defendants may be subjected to multiple punishment for the same conduct under more than one statute so long as the legislature intended to create separate offenses.united states lemoure,cir citing missouri hunter,d.under the judicially created analysis for discerning legislative intent,we examine whether each offense requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.blockburger united states.see also united states nascimento,cir.the conduct described in one offense must necessarily include the conduct of the second offense to result in a double jeopardy violation.see,ball united states,d.
in fact,the two charges at issue reach conduct that is not necessarily the same,and,to the extent that the charges apply to overlapping conduct,congress intended to create separate offenses.congress chose language that clearly demonstrates that these two offenses are distinct and that one is not a lesser included offense of the other.no double jeopardy problem arises.
these statutes have two separate foci.congress intended the pertinent portion of to criminalize conspiracy to prevent a officer from discharging his duties.by contrast,the conspiracies charged in and a are focused,not on prevention from discharge of duties,but on conspiracies to interfere with an officer while in the performance of his duties.that intent is evident from the texts of and and is reinforced by the provisions legislative histories.
we begin with the text of the statutes in the two charges.section,count,makes it criminal for 
two or more persons in any state,territory,possession,or district to conspire to prevent,by force,intimidation,or threat,any person from accepting or holding any office,trust,or place of confidence under the united states,or from discharging any duties thereof,or to induce by like means any officer of the united states to leave the place,where his duties as an officer are required to be performed,or to injure him in his person or property on account of his lawful discharge of the duties of his office,or while engaged in the lawful discharge thereof,or to injure his property so as to molest,interrupt,hinder,or impede him in the discharge of his official duties.
defendants were charged under only that portion of the statute criminalizing conspiracy to prevent,by force,intimidation,or threat,any person from discharging any duties as an officer of the united states.
as for the other charge,count,a conspiracy to violate a,we read and a together because together they define the crime.section,the general conspiracy statute,creates criminal liability,inter alia,for two or more persons who conspire to commit any offense against the united states,provided one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy.id.section a proscribes forcibly assault ing,resist ing,oppos ing,imped ing,intimidat ing,or interfer ing with a united states officer while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties.id.a.
the question of whether count requires proof of facts not required under count is easily answered.the offense charged under and a requires proof of at least two facts that does not that defendants conspired to use force and that at least one of them acted to achieve the object of the conspiracy.
the defendants more serious argument turns on whether the reverse is also true whether,charged in count,requires proof of at least one fact that and a,charged in count,does not.
defendants concede that is concerned with conspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging his duty,whereas and a address conspiracy to resist,oppose,impede,or interfere with an officer presently engaged in fulfilling his duties.they urge that the words to prevent from in are,f or all intents and purposes,synonymous with the terms used in a,as charged under.in essence,they argue the phrase to prevent from discharging the duties of his office,means the same as to impede while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties,id.a.
the government responds that the statutes address different time frames.it asserts that prevent should be given its common meaning,to keep from happening.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.the common meaning of a term is a useful indication of intent.see,morales trans world airlines,d see also sec tambone,cir en banc.under the government construction,requires proof of intent to keep a federal officer from beginning performance of his duty by preventing the discharge of the duty.by contrast,the plain language of and a mandates a showing that defendants conspired to disrupt a federal officer while presently engaged in the discharge of his duty or on account of his duties.
there is no double jeopardy problem for several different reasons.first,itself makes clear that to prevent an officer from performing his duty is not the same as impeding an officer in the performance of his duty.different facts are required for conviction under than are required under a and.the common meaning of to prevent from is future oriented,not present oriented.second,enactment history shows that congress felt the existing protection under was insufficient and that it needed to enact.third,congress retained after it enacted the general conspiracy statute,demonstrating that it intended to reach different conduct than and.
the charge in the indictment count under quoted only one clause of several in the statute,each of which defines a discrete crime.the balance of text gives context to congressional intent as to the meaning of to prevent.see mullane chambers,cir noting that statutory language must be defined with reference to the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole quoting robinson shell oil,d see also united states jimenez,cir.in this context,congress intended the words to prevent from to have a different meaning than that argued by the defendants.
several additional clauses of reveal two points.first,congress did not equate to prevent from discharging duties with impede or hinder in the discharge of duties.second,congress drew temporal distinctions between different opportunities to disrupt federal officers performing their duties,which again give prevent a different meaning than to impede.we must give significance to congress choice of words.see,smith united states,d.
in the other clauses following the use of prevent,congress used words such as molest,interrupt,hinder,or impede in the discharging of the officer duties.this shows that prevent from was meant to denote conduct different from molest ing,interrupt ing,hinder ing,or imped ing in.see united states ahlers,cir noting that when congress uses certain words in one part of a statute,but omits them in another,we presume that this differential draftsmanship was deliberate.
further,recognizes a series of temporal distinctions.the clause under which defendants were charged addresses preventing officials from accepting or holding federal office or from discharging their duties.id.the next clause addresses inducing officers to leave the place where duties are to be performed.id.another clause addresses injuring an officer on account of or while engaged in discharging of his duties.id.a final clause addresses injuring the officer property so as to molest,interrupt,hinder,or impede him in the discharge of his duties.id.together,these clauses cover a range of time frames before,during,and after the assumption and execution of the responsibilities of federal office.see carr united states,d,congress use of a verb tense is significant in construing statutes.quoting united states wilson,d internal quotation marks omitted.
these distinctions demonstrate that the terms molest,interrupt,hinder,and impede are not synonymous with the term prevent.instead,prevent describes conspiracies to disrupt an officer duties before the officer begins to discharge them.not only is this construction consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word prevent,merriam webster collegiate dictionary,supra,at,it is also amply supported by the statutory context in which the word appears,see mullane,at.
second,the legislative histories of both and reinforce our construction.section,the oldest of the pertinent statutes,was originally enacted in and has remained essentially unchanged since see,reprinted in.the predecessor to was adopted in,at the urging of the attorney general.united states feola,d.later,congress substantially revised existing conspiracy laws,eliminating numerous special conspiracy provisions and adopting,reprinted in.section was one of just ten special conspiracy laws that survived this consolidation.id.a reason congress retained the ten,including,was to preserve the greater punishment attached to them.id.
significantly,the adoption of predecessor reflected congress determination that the existing,piecemeal statutory insufficient to protect federal officers discharge of their duties.see feola,at quoting a letter from the attorney general that appeared in the statute legislative history,which urged that t he need for general legislation for the protection of federal officers and employees other than those specifically embraced in existing statutes becomes increasingly apparent every day see also id.at congress clearly was concerned with the safety of federal officers insofar as it was tied to the efficacy of law enforcement activities.thus,must be seen as not having an identical meaning to.
third,with on the books,the enactment of gave federal authorities a further tool a general conspiracy statute for prosecuting individuals who conspired to violate.and yet congress deliberately retained a fact that bolsters our conclusion that congress intended to reach conduct under the to prevent from clause distinct from that which could be prosecuted under and.
to the extent that defendants urge us to invoke the rule of lenity,see,heflin united states,d,their reliance on the rule is misplaced.t he rule of lenity only applies if,after considering text,structure,history,and purpose,there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that the court must simply guess as to what congress intended.barber thomas,d,citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
indeed,the rule of lenity is founded in significant part on the plain principle that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative,not in the judicial department.united states wiltberger,wheat.marshall,see also id.it is the legislature,not the court,which is to define a crime,and ordain its punishment.where the legislature has clearly defined the crime and punishment,there is no room for the judicially crafted rule of lenity.in light of the text,structure,history,and purpose of the statutes at issue,we perceive no ambiguity in congress intent.
gerhard convictions under,and,and are not multiplicitous 
gerhard makes a separate,undeveloped argument that his convictions under count,and count conspiracy to be an accessory after the fact,and count being an accessory after the fact are multiplicitous.gerhard did not argue this point to the district court,so we review it for plain error,united states patel,cir.the test for plain error review requires gerhard to show 
there is an error the error is clear or obvious,rather than subject to reasonable dispute the error affected the appellant substantial rights,which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.
united states marcus,d,alteration in original quoting puckett united states,d see also united states moran,cir.
under any standard,gerhard claim is meritless.counts,and each mandate evidence of facts the others do not.blockburger,at see also united states,cir comparing multiple statutes.
we begin by comparing counts and.the facts required for conviction under these counts are obviously distinct.count,which charged a violation of,the statute,mandated proof that a defendant knowing that an offense against the united states ha d been committed,receive d,relieve d,comfort d or assist ed the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension,trial or punishment.id.count did not.id.and count required proof,unlike count,that the defendant conspired to prevent a federal officer from performing his duty.id.
count was also not multiplicitous with count,which alleged a conspiracy to violate.unlike count,count demanded proof of an overt act to effect the object of the conspiracy and evidence that the conspirators sought to violate.and.count,as stated,required proof of entirely different conduct.id.
finally,despite any superficial similarity,count conspiracy to be an accessory after the fact and count being an accessory after the fact are also not multiplicitous.i t has long been established that conspiracy to commit a crime is not the same offense as the substantive crime for double jeopardy purposes because the agreement to do the act is distinct from the completed act itself.united states,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the indictment adequately alleged the federal crimes committed by the browns 
all three defendants claim that the accessory counts in the indictment are defective because counts and stated only that the defendants,
knowing that offenses against the united states had been committed by edward brown and elaine brown,received,relieved,comforted and assisted edward brown and elaine brown in order to hinder and prevent their apprehension,trial and punishment.
counts and also incorporated earlier paragraphs,which alleged that a jury had returned verdicts on january,convicting edward brown and elaine brown of conspiracy and a number of federal tax crimes that a federal warrant was issued against edward brown on january,when he failed to appear for the completion of his trial that a federal arrest warrant was issued for elaine brown arrest postconviction when she violated the conditions of her release pending sentencing that on april,the browns were sentenced to months in prison and that while the browns were fugitives,the usms made efforts to arrest them.
the defendants claim that the indictment was insufficient because it did not name or otherwise specifically identify the browns offenses of conviction none of the defendants raised this objection to the trial court,so appellate review is for plain error.united states stein,cir.the defendants argument is misplaced.
the initial issue is whether the indictment gave the three defendants adequate notice of the charges they faced,the elements of the crimes they allegedly committed,and sufficient information for double jeopardy purposes.hamling united states,d see also russell united states,d united states cianci,cir.the statute,makes it a crime for a defendant,knowing that an offense against the united states has been committed,to receive,relieve,comfort or assist the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension,trial or punishment.id.
here,the fact that the indictment charged that the browns were convicted of conspiracy and tax crimes establishes adequate notice to defendants that an offense against the united states ha d been committed.the government gave notice to defendants it intended to prove that they had knowledge that the browns had been convicted of tax crimes and conspiracy and that,with that knowledge,defendants assisted the browns to hinder or prevent the browns apprehension or punishment.all the necessary elements of were charged,and the defendants had sufficient notice of the charges against them for double jeopardy purposes.under these circumstances no more was needed 
finally,for the first time on appeal,gerhard and riley appear to argue that the accessory statute can not apply to conduct that occurred after the browns conviction.the plain text of the statute here reaches conduct that assists a postconviction offender to avoid apprehension or punishment.they have no claim.seahorse marine supplies,sun oil,cir w hen a statute text is encompassing,clear on its face,and productive of a plausible result,it is unnecessary to search for a different,contradictory meaning.
arguments related to the trial 
defendants objections to their trial fall into five general categories a frivolous challenge by riley and gonzalez to federal jurisdiction over their crimes,arguments by riley pertaining to his representation,additional claims by riley,arguments by all three defendants contesting the jury instructions and the verdict form,and gerhard and gonzalez assertion that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions on counts and.each of defendants trial claims,which we address in roughly chronological order,lacks merit.
the united states had territorial jurisdiction to prosecute defendants 
riley,joined by gonzalez,makes an argument that by any objective measure could not have been advanced in good faith nor advanced consistently with the obligations of counsel to the court.see,smith robbins,d a n attorney is under an ethical obligation to refuse to prosecute a frivolous appeal.internal quotation marks omitted see also pimentel jacobsen fishing,cir an appeal is frivolous if the arguments are wholly without merit.internal quotation marks omitted.
they primarily argue that only new hampshire,and not the united states,has jurisdiction to prosecute crimes occurring in plainfield,new hampshire.they also argue that there is no venue in a federal courthouse in concord,new hampshire.their theory is that either the united states must buy the land on which the offense occurred or the land must have been ceded by new hampshire to the federal government for federal criminal laws to attach.defendants murky and confused argument seems to posit that this federal prosecution entails a violation of the sovereignty of the state of new hampshire and that these defendants may assert whatever sovereign rights new hampshire has.the claim is utterly frivolous and has been rejected before by this court and others see,united states lussier,cir.
the argument ignores the fact that new hampshire chose to enter into a national union governed by the constitution.in united states worrall,dall,the supreme court affirmed that the enumerated powers granted to congress in article i,included the general power to create,define,and punish,crimes and offenses,whenever they shall deem it necessary and proper by law to do so,for effectuating the objects of the federal government.id.at see also united states comstock,d noting that the constitution grants congress broad authority to create federal crimes,which congress routinely exercises,and collecting examples.
there is no offense to state sovereignty by this federal prosecution,nor has new hampshire claimed that there is.in fact,new hampshire deployed its own law enforcement to help federal authorities arrest the browns.it is law that an act defined as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each.united states lanza.this doctrine allows for a federal prosecution even after a prior state prosecution for the same conduct,abbate united states,d.
congress has chosen to vest jurisdiction and venue over federal crimes in the federal courts.congress has given the district courts exclusive original jurisdiction over all offenses against the laws of the united states.that jurisdiction is not limited to crimes which occur on federally owned property,nor is a state permission needed for federal prosecution.see united states hamilton,cir united states sitton,cir,abrogated on other grounds by koon united states,d see also cantrell reno,app x,cir.
defendants argument depends upon severely misreading the text of the constitution.defendants point to clause of article i,the exclusive legislation clause,which vests congress with the power 
t o exercise exclusive legislation in all cases and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be,for the erection of forts,magazines,arsenals,and other needful buildings.
id.the argument misses the point that the united states has not claimed it has the exclusive right to promulgate laws over the lands where the crimes were committed new hampshire also has jurisdiction.so the clause is not at issue.
the exclusive legislation clause has been used to limit a state authority to regulate activities on military bases and similarly exclusive federal absent permission from congress.see,united states state tax comm n,d collins yosemite park curry.see also lipsky,the citizen constitution in federalist,madison offers a straightforward explanation for this clause the public money expended on such places,and the public property deposited in them,require that they should be exempt from the authority of the particular state.
finally,there is no basis for a venue objection when the trial took place in concord,new hampshire,and a judge from the district of maine sat because the new hampshire judges were recused.see,united states scott,cir.
riley objections to his representation fail 
riley sixth amendment right to represent himself was not violated 
through his counsel on appeal,riley argues that his sixth amendment right to proceed without counsel,recognized in faretta california,d,was violated at trial.we give a brief chronology of riley representation.on september,riley made his initial appearance and asked that counsel be appointed.his first attorney was appointed that day and moved to withdraw less than three weeks later,on october.on october,riley moved to proceed without counsel.the court allowed the first counsel to withdraw,but it denied without prejudice riley motion because the court was not convinced that riley waiver of counsel was knowing and voluntary.at the same time,it appointed a second lawyer to represent riley.
on december,the court held a brief hearing on riley renewed request to proceed without a lawyer,granted the request,and converted the second lawyer to standby counsel.
on march,at a pretrial conference,riley changed his mind and requested that his standby counsel represent him at trial.the court granted his request and counsel did represent riley at trial,which started on march.
riley argument seems to proceed in several parts.first,riley acknowledges that he was allowed to proceed without counsel earlier when he claimed his right to.the court then appointed standby counsel.he does not complain about having been appointed standby counsel.see mckaskle wiggins,d describing the role of standby counsel.
on march,six days before trial,riley asked the court to permit his counsel to represent him at trial.riley concedes,and the record is quite clear,that he made this request and the court granted it riley complaint on appeal is that he felt he was forced into asking for appointed counsel because he did not feel prepared to represent himself at trial.this feeling was apparently connected to problems he had getting documents when he was representing himself but had standby counsel.
this scenario does not come close to invalidating riley voluntary,knowing,and intelligent waiver of his right to proceed without counsel.faretta,at.he was literate,competent,and understanding,and he voluntarily exercised his informed free will when he asked for trial counsel.he was not forced to do anything.as to difficulties in riley,the court did address his concerns about delays in getting certain trial materials when riley requested trial counsel.
the record is clear that defendant kn ew what he wa s doing and his choice wa s made with eyes open.adams united states ex rel.mccann.
riley ineffective assistance of counsel claim is premature 
riley second claim as to counsel,presented for the first time on appeal,is that his first appointed counsel had a conflict of interest and therefore provided ineffective assistance.this claim was not developed before the trial court and riley brief is devoid of citation to any facts.
this claim is a poster child for invoking the rule that we will decline to hear ineffective assistance claims presented for the first time on appeal.united states,cir united states mala,cir collecting cases.we routinely apply that rule to ineffective assistance claims under strickland washington,d,including claims,united states,cir.
riley remaining claims related to the trial are meritless 
riley was not denied the opportunity to present a theory at trial 
riley asserts,for the first time on appeal and without any citation to the record,that the district court did not allow him to argue a theory of as an affirmative defense to his crimes.at trial,the district court asked if any defendant intended to assert this theory.riley counsel explicitly responded that he had no intention of doing so.riley never requested a jury instruction on,nor has he cited a single instance in which he was denied an opportunity to introduce evidence on this theory.the argument fails.
riley was properly convicted under count,though he was already subject to an enhanced penalty for using a dangerous weapon 
riley challenges his conviction on count,for carrying,using,or possessing a firearm or destructive device in connection with a crime of violence,c a b.relying on a case,busic united states,d,he urges,for the first time on appeal,that his conviction on this count was precluded by the fact that he was already subject to a penalty enhancement for the use of a dangerous weapon for his conviction under count,a.see busic,at holding that c does not apply to a defendant who uses a firearm in the course of a felony that is proscribed by a statute which itself authorizes enhancement if a dangerous weapon is used.this argument fails.
congress explicitly amended c to include a mandatory penalty for the use of a firearm during a federal crime of violence and to statutorily overrule busic.united states,cir per curiam footnote omitted see also id.congress intended to completely revise c so that it would serve as a cumulative punishment in addition to that provided for the underlying violent crime.
there was no error in the verdict form or jury instructions 
a.the district court instructions on reasonable doubt were correct 
gerhard and gonzalez claim the court committed reversible error when it instructed that 
a reasonable doubt does not mean a mere possibility that the defendant may be not guilty nor does it mean a fanciful or imaginary doubt,nor one based upon groundless conjuncture.it means a doubt based upon reason.
they argue there was a reasonable likelihood the jury misunderstood the reasonable doubt standard.see victor nebraska,d noting that the correct standard for prejudice is not whether jurors could have applied an instruction unconstitutionally but whether there is a reasonable likelihood the jurors did so.their objections are misplaced both as to the specific language cited and in the context of the instructions overall.
defendants concede it is permissible to instruct the jury that doubt may not be imaginary or speculative,but they say even a small doubt may be enough to be a reasonable doubt.they rely on cage louisiana,d per curiam,overruled in part by estelle mcguire,d,which stated that certain terms,not those used here,impermissibly suggest a higher degree of doubt than is in fact required.id.at.
in victor,the supreme court expressly found no error in an instruction that reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt.at.there,as here,the phrase was followed by a description that reasonable doubt is not some possible or imaginary doubt.id.following the command of victor,we have found no error in similar instructions.see united states rodriguez,cir.
the language under attack,in any event,must be seen against the charge as a whole.id.at.in its instructions to the jury,the court repeatedly emphasized the presumption of innocence and the government burden of proof.the reasonable doubt instruction was not error and there was no reasonable likelihood the jury was misled.
b.there was no error in the district court instruction that marshals are officers of the united states 
when instructing the jury on counts and,which alleged conspiracy to prevent federal officers from discharging their duties,and to impede them in the discharge of those duties,id.and a,the district court explained that employees of the united states marshals service are in fact officers of the united states.since both and a refer to federal officers,we will assume this is an element of the crimes.
the supposed error was that the jury was prevented from finding an element of a crime and that under apprendi new jersey,d,this purported error could not be harmless.the argument is confused and wrong.
first,as a matter of law,it is true that employees of the usms are officers of the united states.see.defendants,indeed,did not say differently at trial or on appeal.there can be no apprendi error on a statement of law.
second,perhaps defendants mean to argue there was a fact question as to whether the people who defendants conspired to prevent or assault,resist,oppose,impede,intimidate,or interfere with were federal officers.they made no such objection at trial and can not with a straight face make that argument here.
finally,defendants have misrepresented the law.even if there were a failure to submit an element of an offense to the jury,that failure would be subject to the neder rule.neder united states,d.apprendi,contrary to defendants argument,does not alter the neder rule.the supreme court has,repeated that a trial court failure to instruct a jury on all of the statutory elements of an offense is subject to analysis.mitchell esparza,d see also washington recuenco,d.
c.the district court correctly instructed that the jury could find just one defendant guilty of conspiracy 
during its deliberations,the jury asked the court if it had to find either two or three of the defendants guilty of conspiracy for any of the defendants to be guilty.emphasis added.the question had to do with the defendants,and not with other persons.after discussing the question with all parties,the court responded 
the answer to your question is no.you need not find either two or three of the defendants guilty for any of the defendants to be guilty.you should still refer to the definition of a conspiracy as set forth in the instructions.
the conspiracy instructions,in turn,had referred to an agreement between at least two people.riley perfunctorily argues,as he did before the district court,that the instruction in effect entirely negated the requirement that a conspiracy involve an agreement between two or more defendants.we review his claim de novo,united states luisi,cir,and find it utterly without merit.
the court answer to the query was accurate and explicitly referred back to its instruction on conspiracy.when multiple defendants are charged with conspiracy,a jury may convict just one of them.united states rogers,cir.further,the indictment in this case alleged that defendants had conspired with other individuals.in light of the evidence presented at trial,the jury could certainly have found that a single defendant was guilty of conspiring with people other than his.
d.the defendants were properly convicted by general verdict on count 
gerhard and riley urge that the verdict form was deficient for count because it did not allow the jury to specify which object of the conspiracy charged in that count was the basis for its verdict.count charged defendants with conspiracy to interfere with federal officers in the discharge of their duties,in violation of and a count,as well as conspiracy to be an accessory after the fact in violation of and count.
relying on challenges to the legality of counts and that we rejected above,defendants assert that the guilty verdict on count must be vacated because the form phrasing resulted in uncertainty as to the particular object s of the conspiracy on which the jury relied and one or both of them may have been legally insufficient the supreme court has held that a jury may render a general verdict on a multiobject conspiracy,provided the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged,and the jury could not have relied on a defective legal theory.griffin united states,d see also sochor florida,d united states capozzi,cir.since defendants have made no meritorious challenges to the legal or evidentiary sufficiency of either count or count,their argument necessarily fails,griffin,at.
e.the jury was properly instructed in the disjunctive on count 
gonzalez makes a related claim,urging that count must be vacated because the indictment charged defendants with violating both counts and and the jury was instructed that it could find defendants guilty on the basis of either object of the conspiracy.we review gonzalez preserved argument de novo,united states,cir,and reject it.
we have routinely affirmed the use of the conjunctive in indictments followed by the use of the disjunctive in jury instructions.see capozzi,at the indictment followed the usual practice of using the conjunction and in reference to the planned offenses,but guilt can be established by adequate proof on any one of the charged grounds.citing griffin,at see also united states mitchell,cir.
gonzalez attempts to distinguish our precedents,which address general verdicts,by urging that what the jury rendered was a special verdict on count.not so.neither defendants nor the government requested a special verdict,and a straightforward reading of the verdict form and jury instructions confirms that the jury reached a general verdict see united states riccio,cir see also black united states,d,noting that the federal rules of criminal procedure only provide for general verdicts and cautioning against using special verdicts in most criminal trials.
defendants convictions on counts and were supported by sufficient evidence 
gerhard and gonzalez argue that the evidence was insufficient to convict them on count,and conspiracy to be an accessory after the fact,and count,id.being an accessory after the fact.defendants argue that because there was no evidence they were aware of the specific elements of the crimes the browns were convicted of committing,the government could not satisfy the knowledge component of the accessory statute.our review is de novo.we have already rejected the legal premise for the argument in any event,the evidence on this point was ample.
both gerhard and gonzalez were aware the browns had been convicted of federal tax crimes and acted with that knowledge.evidence at trial included two newspaper articles,written by gerhard in february or march of,in which he reported that the browns had been convicted in january of conspiring to commit tax fraud,conspiring to disguise large financial transactions and disguising large financial transactions,and that elaine brown was also convicted of evading income taxes and failing to withhold taxes from her employees.gonzalez acknowledged discussing the browns convictions with edward and elaine brown shortly after his april arrival in new hampshire.that suffices.
arguments related to sentencing 
each defendant argues his sentence was too harsh and based on error.
gerhard received an sentence of months imprisonment,consisting of months on count months on counts and,to run concurrently with each other but consecutively to count and months on count,to be served consecutively to the terms imposed on the other counts.gerhard guidelines sentencing range was to months imprisonment.
gonzalez received an sentence of months imprisonment,consisting of months on count and months on count,to be served consecutively.gonzalez guidelines sentencing range was to months imprisonment.
riley received a sentence of months imprisonment,consisting of months on count,months on counts and to run concurrently with each other and with count,and months on count to be served consecutively to the terms imposed on counts through.riley guidelines sentencing range was to months imprisonment,and his conviction on count carried a minimum sentence of months,c b ii.
