on november,a confidential informant told an undercover hampshire state trooper melissa a man who was selling crack cocaine in manchester.at robles request,the informant called the man to arrange a meeting.that afternoon,the informant and robles drove to a supermarket parking lot in manchester where a man arrived,driving alone in a maroon chevrolet malibu with connecticut license plates,and introduced himself as frenchie.
frenchie entered robles car ensuring that robles was neither wired nor her a baggie containing grams of crack cocaine,taken out of a stash of several baggies,in exchange for in cash whose bill numbers had been recorded.robles and frenchie talked briefly after the sale,and then robles and the informant drove away.a surveillance team observed frenchie,including his entry into and exit from robles car.
between november and july,robles made five other purchases of crack cocaine from frenchie on november,for grams december,for grams january,for grams march,for grams and july,for grams.all but the last purchase occurred in the afternoon in broad daylight and robles said it was still light out during the last,even though it was in the evening.
the surveillance team observed most of these transactions.they also watched frenchie before and after some of them,observing him on several occasions entering with a key and exiting a house at lowell street in manchester,which they concluded was a base for his drug operations.audio recordings were made of some of the meetings between robles and frenchie,and of some phone calls between robles,frenchie and two others.
one of the other phone call participants was frenchie cousin zeus whom robles later identified as jean verdiner frenchie referred robles to zeus on one occasion when frenchie was not available to sell drugs and robles then purchased drugs from zeus.the second participant was a man robles knew as blaze whom robles later identified as wilfrantz verdiner the silver chevrolet impala that frenchie drove to the march and july,transactions was registered in wilfrantz name,which also appeared on the lowell street mailbox.
in between those last two transactions,robles march,an arrest warrant,supplying an affidavit that identified the subject of the warrant as frenchie,a black male who lived at lowell street in manchester.robles arranged with manchester police officers to make that arrest on august.that evening,robles called frenchie to set up a transaction and the two met in a supermarket parking lot in hooksett.
frenchie arrived alone,driving the silver impala that he had driven to the two prior transactions.he was holding a wad of tissues when robles approached his car.when frenchie opened the wad,a small bag fell onto the passenger seat.reaching through the car window,robles placed in marked bills on the seat and took the bag,which contained grams of crack cocaine.after the purchase,robles supervisor directed manchester police sergeant robert moore to effect frenchie arrest.
a member of the surveillance team for some of the prior transactions,moore was parked in the same lot as robles and frenchie on august,and observed them conversing through frenchie car window.moore and fellow officer stephen coco,another member of the team,watched robles drive off and then independently followed frenchie car until two other manchester officers stopped it,with moore and coco as well as another member of the surveillance team confirming from afar that the correct car had been stopped.
the driver,ordered to exit the silver impala,was james laurent,whom moore and coco later identified as frenchie both from seeing him and from his driver license photograph.in the course of the arrest,the officers found in cash on laurent person,including the marked from robles drug purchase money into laurent and a clear plastic bag containing grams of crack cocaine.the car also contained four cell phones.
laurent was indicted on seven counts of distributing crack cocaine the seven transactions already described and one count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine the cocaine seized upon his arrest.a.he filed two motions to suppress evidence seized and statements made in connection with his august,arrest.the district judge denied both motions.
in the jury trial that followed,laurent did not testify,but his primary defense was he was not frenchie,and that instead frenchie might have been jean verdiner,wilfrantz verdiner,or shoubert beauchamps a man who also reportedly lived at lowell street.laurent counsel emphasized that the government had no physical evidence connecting laurent to these charges,specifically,no photographs or video recordings of the meetings between frenchie and robles,and no fingerprint evidence connecting laurent to the bags of crack cocaine.
during of robles,laurent and his counsel learned for the first time that a video recording had been made of the first drug deal on november.robles explained upon further questioning that no video had been offered or would be at trial because when she requested it from the manchester police department a few months after laurent arrest,she learned that the then almost a year been routinely erased by the manchester police department pursuant to standard practice.
laurent promptly filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that the video destruction and the failure to timely disclose its creation and destruction had deprived him of material,potentially exculpatory evidence.robles said she had advised the federal prosecutor of the loss and the prosecutor conceded that in the course of pretrial discovery,she must have learned of the tape and failed to inform laurent of its creation and destruction,but she said her omission was unintentional.in response,the court dismissed the first count against count predicated on the november,drug transaction.
the jury convicted laurent on the seven remaining of distribution and one of possession with intent to found that the drug weight for the last count was greater than grams.rejecting arguments for a lower sentence,the court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment.laurent now appeals from his conviction and sentence.
laurent main arguments on appeal concern the videotape.in considering his claims,we are concerned with two events rather than one the erasure of the tape by the local police and the failure by the federal prosecutor to disclose before trial the prior existence of the tape and its erasure to laurent.it is not clear that the erasure can be held against the united states,which apparently did not control the investigation and certainly did not erase the tape but even if we simplify matters by assuming otherwise,the destruction itself does not give laurent a viable claim.
arizona youngblood,and related cases do recognize a due process violation where the government destroys evidence in a criminal case,but not in all circumstances.the supreme court has distinguished between evidence that was apparently exculpatory before the evidence was destroyed,for which the failure to preserve is a due process violation even without bad faith,and evidence that was only potentially useful for the defense,for which the defendant must establish the government bad faith to show a violation 
here,the video was only potentially useful,as laurent counsel conceded in the district court indeed,unless the several officers were collectively lying,it is more likely than the seller in the tape were the tape would have inculpated laurent.thus,laurent must prove bad faith destruction of evidence,but he has pointed to no evidence that would undermine the government description of a routine erasure,by no means uncommon,united states garza,cir,cert.denied,united states lewis,cir united states arra,cir,nor were the circumstances here suspicious.
laurent second argument,directed against the government delayed disclosure,does implicate the united states,because the federal prosecutor by robles account was told of the tape.brady maryland,requires the prosecutor to produce exculpatory evidence to the defense and this could conceivably include information that a private destroyed exculpatory evidence.but,of course,the tape was not shown to be exc
