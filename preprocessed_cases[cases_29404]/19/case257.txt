michael galatis was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud,in violation of healthcare fraud,in violation of and money laundering,in violation of.the fraudulent activity took place from about january,to about october,and it involved billing medicare for million in false claims,about million of which the government paid out to galatis company,at home vna ahvna.
galatis appeals his convictions,arguing there was trial error.he particularly argues that the district court committed reversible error by allowing galatis associate to testify that the associate had pled guilty to one count of healthcare fraud arising from the same scheme,without sua sponte giving a limiting instruction permitting certain lay and expert witness testimony,which galatis characterizes as concerning the meaning of terms in the applicable medicare regulations and denying galatis preferred jury instruction as to the meaning of a particular certification requirement in the relevant medicare provisions.we affirm the convictions.there is no appeal from the sentence.
home health services are eligible for coverage under medicare if the individual who is the beneficiary of the services is confined to the home the homebound requirement under the care of a physician who establishes the plan of care in need of at least one of a number of enumerated skilled services as certified by a physician under a plan of care as specified under the relevant regulation and receiving services furnished by,or under arrangements made by,a participating home health agency.in order to prove a beneficiary eligibility for medicare payment for home health services,providers must submit two forms to the department of health and human services hhs.the first is a checklist known as an oasis form,a voluminous document that details the beneficiary condition.
in the second document,a form health certification and plan of care form,a physician certifies under pain of fine,imprisonment,or civil penalty under applicable federal laws,that the beneficiary meets the requirements for medicare coverage of home health services.for any care starting on or after april,the form also requires a physician to certify in a separate addendum that a patient encounter has occurred.this requires that there be an meeting between a physician or a qualified practitioner and the beneficiary,which must be related to the primary reason for the beneficiary home health services.
michael galatis set up and owned mjg management,a home health agency,which operated under the name at home vna.the prosecution presented evidence from ahvna nurses and ahvna medical director that ahvna had recruited individual patients by sending nurses to host wellness clinics at assisted living centers and public housing facilities,where the nurses provided services like flu shots,and in doing so collected insurance information and convinc ed residents to sign on with ahvna.nurses would also sometimes recruit patients.ahvna nurses testified that a patient insurance coverage was the only criterion they used to determine whether that person was eligible to be signed up for ahvna services.specifically,nurses were instructed to only sign up patients who were on medicare.
these nurses also testified that galatis janice troisi,his former colleague and codefendant instructed the nurses to fill out oasis forms inaccurately,telling the nurses never to score a patient as a zero in the activities of daily living category a zero signifying full independence and no need for home health services never to check a box indicating that a patient was alert and oriented times three signifying that the patient was extremely alert and not in need of home health services and to write their nurses notes using words that made the care provided appear like skilled nursing services,even when it was not,and words that emphasized the patients need for care.the nurses testified that galatis troisi would review the oasis forms and nurses notes at regular meetings and would force nurses to correct materials that did not make a sufficiently persuasive case for the patients eligibility and need for services.further,galatis and troisi would demand that nurses continue visits to patients whom the nurses had recommended be discharged,or would reassign those patients to new nurses as patients in continuing need of ahvna services.
spencer wilking,ahvna medical director,was responsible for signing the form submitted to hhs.wilking testified that in the first year after he joined ahvna,around,he conducted visits with patients before completing these forms.but beginning in,as the business expanded,wilking began signing the forms without conducting the necessary visits or any other review.by,wilking was signing approximately one hundred and fifty form certifications at each weekly ahvna staff meeting.
starting in,wilking was paid a monthly consulting fee initially per month,and then per month as ahvna patient population increased for his services to ahvna.wilking admitted that he knew he was engaging in misconduct and said he expressed concern about this to galatis three or four times.wilking chose to ignore his own concerns and continued to sign the form certifications because he was being paid quite a lot of money to do so.he estimated he had certified and thousands of ahvna patients between and including the ten patients named in the indictment,none of whom he had in fact seen or could guarantee actually needed home health services.before galatis trial,wilking was separately indicted and pled guilty to one count of medicare fraud arising from his conduct at ahvna.
galatis and troisi were indicted in september.galatis was charged with conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud,see,eleven counts of healthcare fraud,see id,and seven counts of money laundering,see id.at the end of a trial,the jury convicted galatis on all submitted counts.the district court sentenced him to months in prison and three years of supervised release,and ordered him to pay a fine and in restitution.this appeal from his convictions followed.
galatis does not dispute the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions,but does make three claims that the district court committed reversible error at trial.he argues that the district court should have given sua sponte a limiting instruction as to wilking testimony regarding wilking guilty plea.he argues that the court wrongly permitted testimony interpreting the legal meaning of the applicable medicare regulations.and he argues that the district court erroneously rejected his preferred jury charge regarding the encounter regulation.none of these claims succeeds.we address each in turn.
admission of evidence of wilking guilty plea 
galatis argues that the district court erred by not giving a limiting instruction after admitting evidence of wilking guilty plea and that this purported error and questions from the government permitted the jury impermissibly to use wilking plea as substantive evidence of galatis guilt.galatis never requested that the district court give an instruction limiting the use of wilking guilty plea.accordingly,his claim is reviewable for at most plain error.see united states rodriguez,cir.galatis must demonstrate that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.galatis can not meet this standard.
during his testimony,wilking was asked by the prosecutor,did anything happen to you as a result of your involvement with at home vna after the district court overruled an objection from defense counsel,wilking answered that he had pleaded guilty to a count of medicare fraud,and,in response to further questioning,said that he had entered into a plea agreement.the prosecution moved to admit a copy of wilking plea agreement into evidence.the district court initially stated that it would not admit a copy of the plea agreement itself,but after defense counsel affirmatively stated that he had no objection to the document admission,the court allowed the plea agreement
