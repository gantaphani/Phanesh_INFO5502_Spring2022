william gurka appeals from the denial of his motion to withdraw that portion of his guilty plea pleading to gun charges related to a cocaine trafficking crime.see united states gurka,july.his arguments turn on a single legal question whether a defendant who exchanges drugs for guns possesses the guns in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime within the meaning of c a.a plain reading of the statute text shows that he does,and we join the consensus among circuit courts in so holding and in rejecting the defendant claims that united states watson,alters the law on this issue.
we begin with the undisputed facts,to which gurka agreed when he pleaded guilty.on june,gurka met with an undercover agent of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms atf in the agent parked car,beside a highway in smithfield,rhode island.gurka had previously expressed interest in purchasing a cold caliber pistol.at the june meeting,the agent showed gurka three guns a bryco model,caliber pistol,a lorcin caliber pistol with an obliterated serial number,and a high standard caliber pistol with a silencer attached.gurka examined the guns and the silencer and informed the agent that he wanted to buy all of them.in exchange for these items,gurka agreed to pay the agent three bags of cocaine and cash.
gurka first paid the agent the cash.the agent then brought all three guns to gurka nearby pickup truck.gurka placed the guns in the truck and paid the agent two bags of cocaine weighing a combined grams.gurka was then arrested.
gurka waived his miranda rights and wrote a statement,admitting to the purchase of the guns and silencer for cocaine and cash.he also admitted that he had additional cocaine and guns in his home.a search of gurka home later that day revealed an additional grams of cocaine,a small quantity of marijuana,and seven guns,including two loaded pistols.
on october,gurka pled guilty to a information,pursuant to a written plea agreement.this appeal concerns count six which charged gurka with knowing possession of a bryco pistol in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c a.count six carried a mandatory prison sentence.id.c a i.when asked by the district court if he agreed with the facts described above,gurka confirmed that he did.the district court set january,as the date for sentencing.
a few weeks before gurka scheduled sentencing,the supreme court decided watson united states.the decision concerned a defendant who had pled guilty to bartering drugs for guns under a different prong of c a,which provides a sentence for offenders who use a firearm during and in relation to any drug trafficking crime.id.at quoting c a.the supreme court held that receiving a firearm in a trade for guns did not constitute use of the weapon within the ordinary meaning of the word,and so did not fall within that language of the statute.id.at.the court explicitly declined to address whether such a transaction would constitute possession in furtherance of a drug crime under the prong of the statute at issue here.id.
gurka moved to vacate his guilty plea as to count six on january,urging that watson ha d a direct impact on the viability of the charge.gurka written motion conceded that the defendant in watson was charged under a separate provision of c a and that the supreme court decision in that case addressed entirely different statutory text.nonetheless,gurka argued that with the advent of the watson opinion,the plain meaning of possession and in furtherance precluded his liability under the statute.on this basis,gurka urged that he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea and that the district court should dismiss count six as an inappropriate application of c a possession in furtherance provision.
the district court heard argument from both sides on gurka motion at a hearing on march.on july,the district court issued a written order,rejecting gurka argument and denying the motion to vacate his guilty plea.see gurka,slip op.at.
on december,the district court sentenced gurka to a sentence of six months imprisonment on counts one through five,and a consecutive sentence on count six.
this appeal followed.
during the interval between the acceptance of a guilty plea and sentencing,the district court should liberally allow withdrawal of guilty pleas for any fair and just reason.united states,cir quoting.d b.we review the district court denial of a defendant motion to withdraw for abuse of discretion on preserved claims.id.unpreserved issues are reviewed for plain error.id.where,as here,the district court ruling involves an issue of statutory interpretation,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.united states,cir.
a.the record on appeal 
on appeal,gurka revisits his argument before the district court,with a new twist he now claims that his case should be remanded so that the district court may consider further evidence which gurka claims would have altered the judge ruling in light of watson concerns.this material was not presented to the district court,is in violation of fed,and is not properly before us,united states,cir it is elementary that evidence can not be submitted for the first time on appeal.in any event,given our holding,the facts contained in gurka proffer are immaterial.there is no basis for remand.
we nonetheless consider and reject gurka preserved argument concerning whether the ordinary meaning of in furtherance of creates liability under c a for a defendant who uses drugs as payment to purchase a gun.we also address and reject gurka additional,unpreserved claims.
b.the statute,c a 
some background on the statutory text at issue provides context for gurka misplaced reliance on watson.
as originally enacted,c a applied only to a defendant who use d or carrie d a firearm during and in relation to any drug trafficking crime.c a see,stat.congress added the possession in furtherance prong to the text in,stat,shortly after the supreme court ruled that mere possession of a gun in the vicinity of a drug transaction did not constitute use under c a,bailey united states,see also id.had congress intended possession alone to trigger liability under c,it easily could have so provided.the amended text,which concerns us,reads 
except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law,any person who,during and in relation to any drug trafficking crime for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the united states,uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm,shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such drug trafficking crime i be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years.
c a,i emphasis added.
watson was the second case in which the supreme court considered the application of the use language to transactions involving the exchange of guns and drugs.the court had earlier held that c a use provision applied to a defendant who bartered a firearm for drugs.smith united states.watson clarified that the term use did not extend to the opposite situation,in which a defendant exchanged drugs for guns.at.watson noted congress amendment to add the possession in furtherance prong of the statute,but explicitly did not address the amended statute application to such exchanges.id.observing that a exchange may or may not constitute possession in furtherance.no subsequent supreme court opinion has spoken to whether such transactions constitute possession in furtherance.
nonetheless,gurka contends that watson reasoning undercuts the basis for his guilty plea to count six and that it was error to deny him leave to withdraw his plea.he says the facts to which he admitted do not constitute a crime under c a,and urges that the application of the possession in furtherance prong to his conduct runs afoul of watson concerns about using ordinary and natural meanings of language in context.see watson,at see also smith,at.his sole preserved argument is that the timing of the transaction meant that he did not possess the guns until the drug sale had been completed and,as a result,his possession did not further the drug trafficking crime.w
