the united states district court,district of massachusetts sentenced defendant anthony matos to months imprisonment and four years supervised release for three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to launder money on october.matos challenges his sentence in four respects.first,he argues that his sentence on the wire fraud counts was illegal because he was sentenced to a term higher than the statutory maximum for those counts.next,he contends that his sentence should be vacated and remanded for resentencing in light of amendment to the sentencing guidelines adopted after matos was sentenced,which restated the rules for determining when multiple prior sentences should be counted as one for criminal history purposes when imposed on the same day and error committed by the district court in attributing criminal history points to certain of his prior sentences that he claims were excludable under the law.finally,matos challenges the restitution order imposed by the court on the grounds that it derived from dismissed counts and that it may have incorrectly included amounts recovered by the victims.
as the government concedes,the district court erred in imposing a term of four years of supervised release on matos,and therefore we vacate this term of supervised release and remand to the district court to impose a term of supervised release of no more than three years.otherwise,we affirm matos sentence.
from approximately through may,a number of individuals in the springfield,massachusetts area conspired to participate in a scheme.several individuals,including matos,purchased distressed properties typically located in neighborhoods and then sold them at a much higher price to home buyers,many of whom did not have the financial strength to qualify for loans.matos and others worked with mortgage brokers and real estate appraisers to obtain mortgage loans for these otherwise unqualified home buyers by submitting false loan documentation and inflated appraisals to various lending institutions.albert innarelli,a real estate attorney and,generated false closing documents to facilitate and conceal the fraud.the conspirators shared in the loan proceeds they obtained from various lending institutions at the closings of the flipped properties.
ultimately,as one might expect,many of the buyers were unable to pay their mortgage loans and defaulted.
on september,a federal grand jury returned a count superseding indictment charging matos and other with wire fraud,in violation of counts through,and conspiracy to launder money,in violation of h and count.on may,matos pleaded guilty to counts,and of the superseding indictment,and the remaining counts against him were dismissed.
at matos sentencing on october,the court assessed fifteen criminal history points,which under the sentencing guidelines guidelines equated to a criminal history category of vi matos objected to his criminal history category,arguing that it overstated the seriousness of his criminal history and that he should be entitled to a departure pursuant to b sic.finally,the district court calculated matos total offense level to be,and with a criminal history category of vi,the result was an advisory guidelines range of months.
the district court sentenced matos to months imprisonment on each count,to be served concurrently,to be followed by months of supervised release on each count,also to be served concurrently.matos was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of to equicredit corporation now bank of america,and to onell agueda.
ii.discussion 
legality of sentencing above the relevant statutory maximum for the wire fraud.
matos first argues that his concurrent sentences of months imprisonment and four years of supervised release on the wire fraud counts should be vacated because the superseding indictment did not allege that the violations affected financial institutions,and therefore he should have been subjected only to a statutory maximum of five years imprisonment and three years of supervised release on each of those counts.
the presentence report psr stated that matos was subject to a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of thirty years on each of the wire fraud counts and ten years on the money laundering conspiracy.the psr also provided that matos was subject to a statutory maximum term of supervised release of five years on the wire fraud counts and three years on the money laundering conspiracy count matos did not object to either of those calculations,nor did he object to his sentence of months imprisonment and four years of supervised release on the ground that it exceeded the relevant statutory maximums.
because matos did not argue below that he was subject to a statutory maximum term of five years imprisonment on the wire fraud counts,we review only for plain error.united states,cir.to prevail under this standard,matos bears the heavy burden of showing that an error occurred that the error was clear or obvious that the error affected his substantial rights and that the error also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states riccio,cir citations omitted.this is a burden which he can not meet.
matos contends that his sentence of months imprisonment on the wire fraud counts was illegal because the superseding indictment did not allege that his wire fraud offenses affected financial institutions,as required by jones united states,d,and that the correct statutory maximum for those crimes therefore was only five years,not thirty years.while matos is correct that the superseding indictment did not allege that his wire fraud offenses affected financial institutions,he can not establish that his concurrent sentences of months constitute plain error.
at the time of the fraud in matos case,a wire fraud conviction invoked a maximum term of imprisonment of five years,unless the fraud affected a financial institution,in which case the statutory maximum was thirty years imprisonment.see the government concedes that the aggravating circumstance for this the crime affects a financial institution constitutes an offense element that must be alleged in the indictment and either admitted by the defendant or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states ubakanma,cir.the government further concedes that the superseding indictment alleged that matos and his devised a scheme and artifice to defraud and obtain money from various lending institutions and that the term lending institution,at least on its face,does not fall within the statutory definition of financial institution in place at the time of the offenses of conviction.see 
matos therefore may be able to show that in sentencing him in accordance with an aggravating element that was not charged in the indictment,the district court committed error which was clear or obvious however,he can not show that his substantial rights were affected by that error.matos sentences on the wire fraud counts were concurrent with the identical sentence on the money laundering count,which was within the statutory maximum for a violation of the federal money laundering statute.see.any error,therefore,was harmless,as we have held in similar circumstances.see,united states ziskind,cir defendant who argued that his sentence exceeded the authorized statutory maximum was not prejudiced because that sentence ran concurrent with a sentence imposed on the same day on an unrelated charge united states marino,cir rejecting an argument not raised by defendant that it matter ed not to defendant term of incarceration that defendant was sentenced to months imprisonment on two counts when the statutory maximum for those counts was months because defendant equivalent sentence of months on a third count,imposed concurrently,was appropriate see also united states ellis,cir concluding,under plain error review,that sentence in excess of statutory maximum authorized for one count did not affect substantial rights where defendant received valid equal or longer concurrent sentences on other counts.
while we acknowledge matos argument that the district court misunderstanding of the applicable statutory maximum may have contributed to the length of the sentence the court impose d and to the court refusal to depart downward from the guideline sentence,we find it to be unpersuasive.the district court made clear at sentencing that the sentence of months was being guided not by the applicable statutory maximums,but rather by balancing the a factors and taking the advisory guidelines range of months into account.the court noted that matos very substantial criminal history category increased his sentence over the general level of that of his.in explaining the sentence imposed,the court explicitly stated that my decision has to be guided by the context of the advisory guidelines,the considerations set forth in a and under those circumstances,i think that the month sentence is the appropriate sentence here.
additionally,while we are not unmindful of united states klopf,cir,which defendant cites for the proposition that when one sentence of a sentencing scheme is illegal here,the wire fraud sentences,the scheme is disrupted and it is appropriate that the entire case be remanded for resentencing,id.at citations omitted,we are not persuaded.we note that klopf was decided on the basis of established precedent in the eleventh circuit that vacating the sentence for one count disrupts the sentencing package and requires resentencing for all counts of conviction.id.at.we are bound by no such precedent here.
though we find that matos has not met the plain error standard with regard to his sentence of imprisonment,the district court imposition of a term of four years of supervised release was,in fact,plain error,as the government concedes.as the statutory maximum for the wire fraud counts was five years,inasmuch as the superseding indictment did not allege that the offenses affected a financial institution,those crimes constitute class d felonies under a that are subject to a maximum term of supervised release of not more than three years under b.matos money laundering conspiracy conviction constitutes a class c felony under section a that is also subject to a maximum term of supervised release of not more than three years under section b.
consequently,as the maximum term of supervised release for matos crimes was three years,we find that matos term of supervised release should be vacated and remanded for the sole purpose of the imposition of a new term of supervised release on all counts that does not exceed three years.see ziskind,at.
in his reply brief,matos asks us for the first time to review the propriety of his money laundering conviction in light of the supreme court decision in united states santos,d.matos claims that he committed no violation of the money laundering statute,as construed by santos,because he engaged in no monetary transaction involving proceeds obtained from a criminal offense his wire fraud offenses.see a,f,and f.
on a routine basis,we do not consider claims which are raised for the first time in a reply brief,see,esso standard oil puerto rico,cir,and in any event,it is hardly certain that the santos holding would have any application here.we thus decline to address the merits of matos argument.
grouping of certain of matos prior sentences for criminal history purposes 
we next address matos claim that his sentence should be vacated and remanded so that the district court might consider whether five of his prior convictions should be grouped under amendment to the guidelines,which has restated the rules for determining when multiple crimes are to be counted as one for criminal history purposes.
as matos did not argue below that the offenses at issue should be consolidated,pursuant to amendment or otherwise,we apply plain error review see united states ahrendt,cir.
matos argument concerns five prior convictions for which he was sentenced on february,and for which,collectively,the probation office assigned him eleven criminal history points amendment to the guidelines,adopted in after matos was sentenced,states,in relevant part 
prior sentences always are counted separately if the sentences were imposed for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest,the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense.if there is no intervening arrest,prior sentences are counted separately unless a the sentences resulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument or b the sentences were imposed on the same day.count any prior sentence covered by a or b as a single sentence.
a.matos argues that if the revised guidelines had been in effect at the time of his sentencing,the five offenses for which he was sentenced on february,would have been deemed to have been one prior sentence for criminal history purposes because he was sentenced for all five on the same day without,he claims,an intervening arrest.therefore,he argues,we should remand to the district court for resentencing consistent with our decisions in united states ahrendt,cir,and united states godin,cir per curiam,so that the district court might consider the sentencing commission current thinking for whatever use it may be in exercising the court judgment about the proper sentence.godin,at.we find that ahrendt and godin are distinguishable and that remand for resentencing in consideration of amendment is not appropriate in this case.
in both ahrendt and godin,it was evident that if the guidelines as amended in had been in effect at the time of the defendant sentencing,the offenses at issue would have been counted as one.see ahrendt,at godin,at.in this case,that point is far from clear.the guidelines as revised by amendment explicitly state that prior sentences always are counted separately if they were imposed for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest.in this case,the psr indicates that an arrest followed one of the five february,offenses which matos discusses,the last offense in chronological order,and is silent as to whether matos was arrested for the other four 
in both ahrendt and godin,we vacated and remanded not because some error,plain or otherwise,by the district court required it,but because we thought it prudent to allow the district court the opportunity to consider the sentencing commission updated views in light of amendment.see ahrendt,at.under the facts of this case,we do not consider that exercise to be a prudent one.
were we to vacate and remand to provide the district court an opportunity to reconsider matos sentence in light of amendment,the court would first be required to engage in to determine whether the amendment applies to matos,by determining whether the offenses for which he was sentenced on february,were not,in fact,separated by intervening arrests.ultimately,it is highly unlikely that amendment would apply,as the timing of the offenses and arraignments indicates that the offenses were almost certainly separated by intervening arrests.while it is theoretically possible that matos was arraigned for the four crimes as to which there is no arrest information in the psr pursuant to summonses rather than arrests see.a,matos has offered no evidence to support that conclusion.
we conclude that godin and ahrendt do not advocate in favor of remanding for resentencing in light of amendment,and so we elect not to do so.
inclusion of certain of matos prior sentences for criminal history purposes 
next,matos argues that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history by assigning criminal history points to three of his prior convictions operating after a suspended license and attaching wrong motor vehicle plates receiving stolen property and larceny by check.we disagree.
though we would typically review the district court interpretation and application of the guidelines de novo,united states stoupis,cir,matos did not raise this argument below,and so we review only for plain error.united states vasco,cir.matos did object more generally to his criminal history category,arguing that it overstate d the seriousness of his criminal history and that he should be entitled to a departure pursuant to b sic.matos complained that he had received criminal history points for a combination of state misdemea
