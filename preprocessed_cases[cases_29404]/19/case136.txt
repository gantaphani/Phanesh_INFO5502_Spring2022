respondent clair was charged with capital murder for the slaying of linda rodgers.the main evidence at his trial in california state court came from statements clair made to his former girlfriend in a conversation that she secretly recorded for the police.he was convicted and sentenced to death,and his verdict was upheld on direct review.
in,clair commenced federal habeas proceedings by filing a request for appointment of counsel,which the district court granted under.that statute entitles indigent capital habeas petitioners like clair to appointed counsel.it also contemplates that appointed counsel may be replaced upon motion of the defendant,e,but it does not specify a standard for district courts to use in evaluating those motions.clair counsel filed his initial habeas petition in,and in the late,when two associates from the firm representing clair moved to the office of the federal public defender fpd,the fpd was substituted as counsel of record.the district court held an evidentiary hearing on clair habeas petition in august,and the parties submitted their briefs by february.the court subsequently told the parties that it did not wish to receive further material about the petition.in march,clair moved to substitute counsel,claiming that his attorneys were seeking only to overturn his death sentence,not to prove his innocence.after the court asked the parties to address the motion,clair counsel informed it that they had met with clair and that he wanted the fpd to continue representing him.the court accordingly decided that it would take no action.six weeks later,however,clair filed another substitution motion,adding one more charge to his earlier claims that his private investigator had discovered that certain physical evidence from the crime scene had never been fully tested,but that clair attorneys had done nothing to analyze this evidence or follow up on its discovery.the court denied the renewed motion without further inquiry.on the same day,it also denied clair habeas petition.
clair sought review of his substitution motion pro se,and the fpd appealed the habeas ruling.the ninth circuit asked the fpd to address whether substitution was now warranted,and after the fpd informed the court that the relationship had broken down,the court provided clair with a new lawyer.clair then asked the district court to vacate the denial of his habeas petition under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that he should be allowed to explore the significance of the new physical evidence for his case.the district court rejected his request,and clair appealed.consolidating his appeals,the ninth circuit vacated the district court denial of both his substitution request and his habeas petition.holding that the interests of justice standard used in cases,see,should govern substitution motions like clair,it ruled that the district court abused its discretion by failing to inquire into the complaints in clair second letter.because clair had already received new counsel on appeal,the court decided the best remedy was to treat clair new counsel as though he had been appointed in june and to allow him to make whatever submissions he would have made then,including a motion to amend clair habeas petition in light of new evidence.
when evaluating motions to substitute counsel in capital cases under,courts should employ the same interests of justice standard that applies in cases under.
a although guarantees that indigent capital defendants and petitioners seeking federal habeas relief in capital cases will receive the assistance of counsel,see,a,a,e,and contemplates that an appointed attorney may be replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney own motion or upon motion of the defendant,e,the statute fails to specify how a court should decide such a motion.clair argues,and the ninth circuit agreed,that district courts should use the in the interests of justice standard of,which governs the appointment and substitution of counsel in federal litigation.by contrast,the state contends that an appointed lawyer can only be replaced when the defendant has suffered an actual or constructive denial of counsel that is,when the lawyer lacks the requisite statutory qualifications,has a conflict of interest,or has completely abandoned the client.
the court adopts clair approach,based on the history of.before,governed both capital and cases,authorizing courts to appoint counsel for federal habeas petitioners and providing that in all cases in which a court had appointed counsel,substitution motions should be decided in the interests of justice.c.thus,a court in those days would have used that standard to evaluate a request like clair.in,congress enacted what is now,thus displacing for persons facing execution.the new statute grants federal capital defendants and capital habeas petitioners enhanced rights of representation.habeas petitioners facing execution now receive counsel as a matter of right,see a,and in multiple ways the statute aims to improve the quality of their representation it provides them with more experienced counsel than demands,authorizes higher rates of compensation,and provides more money for investigative and expert services.these measures reflec t a determination that quality legal representation is necessary in all capital proceedings to foster fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.mcfarland scott.given this context,the court can not conclude that congress silently prescribed a substitution standard that would make it more difficult for those facing capital punishment to substitute counsel.adopting a more stringent test than would deprive capital defendants of a tool they formerly had,and defendants still have,to handle serious representational problems.by contrast,utilizing standard comports with the myriad ways that seeks to promote effective representation for persons facing capital punishment.
b the dearth of support for the state alternative standard reinforces this conclusion.the state concedes that congress has not considered its standard in any context neither has a federal court used it in any case.the court prefers to use a familiar standard,already known to work,than to try out a new one.moreover,the state proposed test would gut substitution provision,because even absent that provision courts would have an obligation to ensure that the defendant statutory right to counsel was satisfied throughout the litigation.the state counters that only its approach comports with the rule that habeas petitioners generally have no sixth amendment right to counsel.but congress declined to track that amendment in providing statutory rights to counsel in both and.thus,the scope of the amendment can not answer the statutory question presented here.the state also contends that the interests of justice standard will permit substitution motions to become a mechanism to defer enforcement of a death sentence.but the interests of justice standard takes into account whether a substitution motion will cause undue delay.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying clair second request for new counsel under interests of justice standard.in reviewing substitution motions,the courts of appeals have pointed to several relevant considerations,including the timeliness of the motion the adequacy of the district court inquiry into the defendant complaint and the asserted cause for that complaint,including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication between lawyer and client.because a trial court decision on substitution is so,it deserves deference and may be overturned only for an abuse of discretion.
here,the district court received clair second substitution motion on the eve of deciding his habeas petition.just three months earlier,clair had written the court to complain about his attorneys.after making proper inquiry,the court learned that clair and his counsel had settled their dispute and turned once more to ruling on clair habeas petition,only to receive a second letter six weeks later.in it clair maintained his general assertion that his lawyers were not trying to prove his innocence,but he also alleged a new and significant charge of attorney error that counsel had refused to investigate particular,newly located physical evidence.such a charge normally would require the court to make further inquiry a district court can not usually rule on a substitution motion without exploring why a defendant wants new counsel.but here,the motion timing precludes a holding that the district court abused its discretion.the court received the letter while putting the finishing touches on its denial of clair habeas petition.after years of litigation,an evidentiary hearing,and briefing,the court had instructed the parties that it would accept no further submissions.all proceedings had therefore come to a close,and a new attorney could have done nothing further in the district court.in those circumstances,the district court acted within its discretion in denying clair substitution motion.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
a federal statute,of title,entitles indigent defendants to the appointment of counsel in capital cases,including habeas corpus proceedings.the statute contemplates that appointed counsel may be replaced upon motion of the defendant,e,but it does not specify the standard that district courts should use in evaluating those motions.we hold that courts should employ the same interests of justice standard that they apply in cases under a related statute,of title.we also hold that the district court here did not abuse its discretion in denying respondent kenneth clair motion to change counsel.
this case arises from the murder of linda rodgers in.rodgers resided at the home of kai henriksen and margaret hessling in santa ana,california.clair was a squatter in a vacant house next door.about a week prior to the murder,police officers arrested clair for burglarizing the home,relying on information henriksen had provided.on the night the police released clair from custody,hessling returned from an evening out to find rodgers dead body in the master bedroom,naked from the waist down and beaten,stabbed,and strangled.some jewelry and household items were missing from the house.see people clair,cal,app.to pet.for cert.
the district attorney charged clair with rodgers murder and sought the death penalty.no forensic evidence linked clair to the crime instead,the main evidence against clair came from his former girlfriend,pauline flores.although she later recanted her testimony,see app,flores stated at trial that she and clair were walking in the neighborhood on the night of the murder and split up near the house.when they reunited about an hour later,flores recounted,clair was carrying jewelry and other items and had blood on his right hand.according to flores,clair explained to her that he had just finished beating up a woman.clair,cal,at,at.the prosecution then introduced a tape recording of a talk between flores and clair several months after the murder,which flores had made in cooperation with the police.on that tape,clair at one point denied committing the murder,but also made several inculpatory statements.for example,when flores told clair that she had seen blood on him,he replied ai on me no more and they ca prove nothing.app.to pet.for cert.internal quotation marks omitted.and in response to her continued probing,clair explained w hat you fail to realize,how they gon na prove i was there there ai no fingerprints,ai no body seen me go in there and leave out there.at internal quotation marks omitted.the jury convicted clair and sentenced him to death.the california supreme court upheld the verdict,and this court denied review,clair california.
clair commenced federal habeas proceedings by filing a request for appointment of counsel,which the district court granted under.clair and his counsel filed an initial petition for habeas relief in and,after exhausting state remedies,an amended petition the following year.the petition alleged more than claims,involving such matters as jury selection and composition,sufficiency of the evidence,prosecutorial misconduct,nondisclosure of exculpatory materials relating to state witnesses,and ineffectiveness of trial counsel.in the late,two associates from the firm representing clair took jobs at the office of the federal public defender fpd,and the court substituted that office as counsel of record.the court held an evidentiary hearing on clair habeas petition in august,and the parties submitted briefs by february.the court subsequently informed the parties that it viewed the briefing to be complete and d id not wish to receive any additional material about the petition.app.
on march,clair sent a letter to the court stating that the fpd attorneys no longer ha d his best interest at hand and that he did not want them to continue to represent him,at see,at.clair alleged that the lawyers had repeatedly dismissed his efforts to participate in his own defense.prior to the evidentiary hearing,clair wrote,he had become so frustrated with the attorneys that he enlisted a private detective to look into his case.but the lawyers,clair charged,refused to cooperate with the investigator they were seeking only to overturn his death sentence,rather than to prove his innocence.as a result,clair felt that he and his counsel were not on the same team.at.
the district court responded by asking both parties to address clair motion to substitute counsel.see,at.the state noted that w hat the trial court does with respect to appointing counsel is within its discretion,providing the interests of justice are served.at.the state further advised the court that nothing in clair letter require d a change of counsel because the fpd lawyers had provided appropriate representation and substitution would delay the case.ibid.clair replied to the court request through his fpd attorneys on april.their letter stated after meeting with clair,counsel understands that clair wants the fpd to continue to serve as his counsel in this case at this time.at.on the basis of that representation,the court determined that it would take no further action on the matter at this time.at.
but the issue resurfaced just six weeks after the court decision.on june,clair wrote a second letter to the court asking for substitution of counsel.that letter again asserted a total break down of communication between clair and the fpd according to clair,he was no longer able to trust anybody within that office.at.in explaining the source of the problem,clair reiterated each of the points made in his prior complaint.and then he added one more.clair recounted that his private investigator had recently learned that the police and attorney office were in possession of fingerprints and other physical evidence from the crime scene that had never been fully tested.the fpd lawyers,clair asserted,were doing nothing to analyze this evidence or otherwise follow up on its discovery.clair attributed this failure,too,to the fpd decision to focus on his sentence,rather than on questions of guilt.
two weeks later,the district court denied clair renewed request for substitution without further inquiry.the court stated it does not appear to the court that a change of counsel is appropriate.it appears that clair counsel is doing a proper job.no conflict of interest or inadequacy of counsel is shown.at.on the same day,the court denied clair habeas petition in a detailed opinion.clair brown,case no.cv glt cd,june,app.to pet.for cert.
clair sought review of his substitution motion pro se,while the fpd filed a notice of appeal from the denial of his habeas petition.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit instructed the fpd to address whether substitution of counsel was now warranted,and in october,the fpd informed the court that the relationship ha d broken down to such an extent that of counsel would be appropriate.attorney for appellant response to court,order,in,record,doc.the state did not comment or object,and the court of appeals provided clair with a new lawyer going forward.clair then asked the district court to vacate the denial of his habeas petition under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that he should be allowed to explore the significance of the new physical evidence for his case.the district court with a new judge assigned,because the judge previously handling the case had retired rejected that request on the ground that the new evidence did not pertain to any of the claims presented in clair habeas petition.see app.to pet.for cert.clair appealed that decision as well 
after consolidating clair appeals,the ninth circuit vacated the trial court denial of both clair request for new counsel and his habeas petition.see clair ayers,fed.appx.the court of appeals opinion focused on clair substitution motion.holding that the interests of justice standard should apply to that motion,the ninth circuit ruled that the district court abused its discretion by failing to inquire into the complaints in clair second letter.see,at.the court of appeals then considered how to remedy that error,given that clair had received new counsel while on appeal.it decided that the most reasonable solution was to treat clair current counsel as if he were the counsel who might have been appointed in june,and to allow him to make whatever submissions he would have made then,including a motion to amend clair habeas petition in light of new evidence,at.
we granted certiorari to review this judgment,and now reverse.
we first consider the standard that district courts should use to adjudicate federal habeas petitioners motions to substitute counsel in capital cases.the question arises because the relevant statute,contains a notable gap.section first guarantees that indigent defendants in federal capital cases will receive the assistance of counsel,from pretrial proceedings through stay applications.see a,a,e.it next grants a corresponding right to people like clair who seek federal habeas relief from a state death sentence,for all proceedings and related activities.see a,e mcfarland scott,harbison bell.and the statute contemplates that both sets of litigants may sometimes substitute counsel it notes that an attorney appointed under the section may be replaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney own motion or upon motion of the defendant.e but here lies the rub the statute fails to specify how a court should decide such a motion.section says not a word about the standard a court should apply when addressing a request for a new lawyer.
the parties offer us two alternative ways to fill this statutory hole.clair argues,and the ninth circuit agreed,that district courts should decide substitution motions brought under in the interests of justice.that standard derives from,which governs the appointment and substitution of counsel in federal litigation.by contrast,the state contends that district courts may replace an appointed lawyer under only when the defendant has suffered an actual or constructive denial of counsel.brief for petitioner.that denial occurs,the state asserts,in just three situations when the lawyer lacks the qualifications necessary for appointment under the statute when he has a disabling conflict of interest or when he has completely abandoned the client,at.on this matter,we think clair,not the state,gets it right.
a trip back in time begins to show why.prior to,governed the appointment of counsel in all federal criminal cases and habeas litigation,regardless whether the matter involved a capital or a offense.that section provided counsel as a matter of right to most indigent criminal defendants,from proceedings through appeal.see a,c ed.in addition,the statute authorized courts to appoint counsel for federal habeas petitioners when the interests of justice so require d,g and under that,courts almost always appointed counsel to represent petitioners convicted of capital offenses,see ruthenbeck,dueling with death in federal courts,aba criminal justice,fall.in all cases in which a court had appointed counsel,further provided as it continues to do that substitution motions should be decided in the interests of justice.c.so in those days,a court would have used that standard to evaluate a request like clair.
in,congress enacted the legislation now known as to govern appointment of counsel in capital cases,thus displacing for persons facing execution but retaining that section for all others.see abuse act,stat,q ed.recodified at ed.and supp.iv.the new statute grants federal capital defendants and capital habeas petitioners enhanced rights of representation,in light of what it calls the seriousness of the possible penalty and the unique and complex nature of the litigation.d ed.habeas petitioners facing execution now receive counsel as a matter of right,not an exercise of the court discretion.see a.and the statute aims in multiple ways to improve the quality of representation afforded to capital petitioners and defendants alike.section requires lawyers in capital cases to have more legal experience than demands.compare b d with b.similarly,authorizes higher rates of compensation,in part to attract better counsel.compare g with d ed.and supp.iv.and provides more money for investigative and expert services.compare f ed,g,supp.iv,with e ed.and supp.iv.as we have previously noted,those measures reflec t a determination that quality legal representation is necessary in all capital proceedings to foster fundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.mcfarland,at.
that understanding of terms and origins goes far toward resolving the parties dispute over what standard should apply.we know that before passage,courts used an interests of justice standard to decide substitution motions in all cases and that today,they continue to do so in all proceedings.we know,too,that in spinning off,congress enacted a set of reforms to improve the quality of lawyering in capital litigation.with all those measures pointing in one direction,we can not conclude that congress silently prescribed a substitution standard that would head the opposite way.adopting a more stringent test than would deprive capital defendants of a tool they formerly had,and defendants facing lesser penalties still have,to handle serious representational problems.that result clashes with everything else does.by contrast,utilizing standard comports with the myriad ways that seeks to promote effective representation for persons threatened with capital punishment.
the dearth of support for the state alternative standard reinforces the case for borrowing from.recall that the state thinks substitution proper only when counsel is completely denied which,the state says,occurs when counsel lacks the requisite experience actively represents conflicting interests or has total ly desert ed the client.brief for petitioner.as the state acknowledges,this test comes from well,from nowhere.the state conceded during argument that congress has not considered much less adopted the standard in any context neither has a federal court used it in any case.see tr.of oral arg.indeed,the standard is new to the state own attorneys.as noted earlier,when clair first requested a change of counsel,the state responded that substitution is a matter of trial court discretion,based on the interests of justice.app.see supra,at.only later did the state devise its present proposal.inventiveness is often an admirable quality,but here we think the state overdoes it.to be sure,we must infer a substitution standard for in that sense,we are writing on a blank slate.but in undertaking that task,we prefer to copy something familiar than concoct something novel.that enables courts to rely on experience and precedent,with a standard already known to work effectively.
still worse,the state proposed test guts for su
