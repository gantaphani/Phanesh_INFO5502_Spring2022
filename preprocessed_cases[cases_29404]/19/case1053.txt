this appeal involves the timing and elements of causes of action brought under for alleged fourth amendment violations in the nature of false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.in the course of addressing those matters,however,we must iron out a wrinkle concerning the scope and effect of a judicial admission.ruling at the summary judgment stage,the district court found for the defendants.the court concluded in substance that the claim of false imprisonment was and that the claim of malicious prosecution lacked the necessary showing of a predicate fourth amendment violation.the court,however,failed to confront the effect of the judicial admission.
we hold that the admission is not controlling because,in pertinent part,the admitted allegation is unclear and,in any event,concerns a matter of law rather than a matter of fact.and,after separating wheat from chaff on the arguments anent the timing and elements of the asserted causes of action,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
consistent with the summary judgment standard,we rehearse the facts in the light most flattering to the plaintiff,drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.houlton citizens coal.town of houlton,cir.
on june,the plaintiff,monique harrington,went for a ride with a and then repaired to his apartment in nashua,new hampshire.a sexual encounter ensued.the plaintiff alleges that,during this encounter,her raped her.
over two months later,the plaintiff told her fiancé about the incident.he pressed her to report it to the authorities,and she went to the police station for that purpose on september.unbeknownst to her,the,shortly before,had complained to the police that he had received a menacing telephone call.in it,the caller reportedly accused him of having raped the plaintiff.
once the plaintiff arrived at the police station,two officers interviewed her for more than an hour,starting at.at,they turned her over to detective mark schaaf.the plaintiff alleges that,during the ensuing interrogation,detective schaaf refused her repeated requests to go home,denied her entreaty for the presence of a female advocate,and lied profusely telling her,for example,that her had videotaped their sexual encounter and that officers in another room were watching the video.
the interrogation lasted until.at the conclusion of the session,the plaintiff waived her miranda rights,see miranda arizona,d,and retracted her allegations of rape.detective schaaf then arrested the plaintiff without a warrant and swore out a criminal complaint,charging her with making a false report to law enforcement personnel a misdemeanor.see.ann.
the plaintiff was arraigned and released on personal recognizance at approximately on september the conditions of her release required her to appear in court,notify the court of any change in address,forbear from committing any crimes,and refrain from using either controlled substances or excessive amounts of alcohol.on september,following a bench trial in state court,a judge acquitted the plaintiff on the false reporting charge.
on september,the plaintiff repaired to the federal district court and sued the city of nashua,its police department,and detective schaaf.her complaint contained both federal claims and supplemental claims.although she lumped her federal claims together under the rubric of,the district court broke them down into two separate claims.the court noted that the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had violated her fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures by i restricting her liberty without reasonable suspicion false imprisonment and ii wrongfully instituting criminal process against her malicious prosecution.
following the completion of pretrial discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion as to the plaintiff federal claims and simultaneously dismissed without prejudice the supplemental claims.harrington city of nashua,wl june.the court held that the false imprisonment claim was because the plaintiff had sued more than three years after the claim accrued.id.at.the court held that the malicious prosecution claim,though timely,failed to show a cognizable fourth amendment violation.id.at.

on appeal,the plaintiff does not challenge the dismissal of her supplemental claims.instead she takes dead aim at the district court handling of her false imprisonment and malicious prosecution claims.she also criticizes the district court denial of her motion to alter or amend the judgment.
as said,each of the plaintiff federal claims falls under the carapace of.section provides a private right of action against a person who,under color of state law,deprives another of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the united states.evans avery,cir.to satisfy the statute injury requirement,the plaintiff must show a deprivation of a federally secured right.farrar hobby,d.against this backdrop,we address the plaintiff claims of error one by one.
false imprisonment.
although section provides a federal cause of action,the length of the limitations period is drawn from state law.wallace kato,d centro medico del turabo,feliciano de melecio,cir.the federal court must borrow the limitations period from the forum state.owens okure,d centro medico,at.
in this instance,the parties agree that the section claims are governed,temporally,by new hampshire statute of limitations for personal injury tort claims.see.ann.because the plaintiff commenced her action on september,her false imprisonment claim is if it accrued more than three years prior to that date.
unlike the limitations period itself,the accrual date of a section claim is a matter of federal law and,therefore,is governed by federal rules conforming in general to tort principles.wallace,at.the limitations period for a fourth amendment claim of false imprisonment begins to run when the false imprisonment ends that is,when the putative plaintiff is either released or detained pursuant to legal process.see id.at mondragón thompson,cir.
in this case,detective schaaf arrested the plaintiff without a warrant and swore out a criminal complaint against her.these actions occurred in the early morning hours of september,and the plaintiff was immediately arraigned and released on personal recognizance.the clustering of these events on a single date leads unerringly to the conclusion that the plaintiff claim accrued at that time.because the plaintiff did not file suit until more than three years september,false imprisonment claim is barred by the statute of limitations.
the plaintiff does not go quietly into this dark night.she suggests that the accrual of her false imprisonment claim should not be measured by the usual metrics for such claims but,rather,by the metrics applicable to malicious prosecution claims.in service of this suggestion,she argues that,from the officers point of view,the main objective of her detention was to supply probable cause for the ensuing prosecution and,therefore,that malicious prosecution furnishes the most appropriate model from which to determine an accrual date.if that argument prevails,her false imprisonment claim would not have accrued until her acquittal on september,see nieves mcsweeney,cir,making that claim timely.
this suggestion is clever,but it ignores a critical distinction between false imprisonment and malicious prosecution.the supreme court has held that when a plaintiff claim arises out of detention without legal process,the tort of false imprisonment provides the appropriate analogy from which to ascertain the accrual date of a cause of action under section.wallace,at emphasis in original.the court explained that when the period of false imprisonment ends,any unlawful detention thereafter forms part of the damages for the entirely distinct tort of malicious prosecution.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.it is the latter tort,not the tort of false imprisonment,that remedies detention accompanied,not by absence of legal process,but by wrongful institution of legal process.id.emphasis in original.in other words,the commencement of a criminal case by the institution of legal process marks the dividing line between claims of false imprisonment and claims of malicious prosecution,making those species of claims legally separate and distinct.see wilkins dereyes,cir see also fox desoto,cir discussing wallace clarification of the distinction between claims of false imprisonment and those of malicious prosecution.
the plaintiff argument runs aground on these shoals.consequently,her claim that the defendants restricted her liberty without reasonable suspicion begins with her detention at the police station and ends with her release on personal recognizance.the essence of her claim,therefore,is detention without legal process that is a classic claim of false imprisonment,and its timeliness is to be measured by the metrics applicable to the tort of false imprisonment.see wallace,at.because these metrics establish an accrual date of september,the claim is.
the plaintiff has a fallback position.she muses that her false imprisonment claim is timely under a continuing wrong theory.she argues,in effect,that her two imprisonment and malicious inextricably intertwined because the defendants conduct was part of a single plan to deprive her of her liberty interests.thus,her false imprisonment claim accrued at the same time as her malicious prosecution claim,and not before.
in support of this reasoning,the plaintiff relies chiefly on robinson maruffi,cir.there,the court held that a claim of false imprisonment was not because the plaintiff arrest was part of a continuing violation a conspiracy to prosecute him continued until he was finally acquitted.id.at.
the attempt to prop up an untimely claim by invoking robinson is not original.we made short shrift of a substantially similar argument in nieves,where we pointed out that robinson was an unusual case in which the malicious prosecution conspiracy began before the victim arrest and encompassed it.nieves,at.with that in mind,we rejected the plaintiffs theory of a single conspiracy encompassing both false arrest and malicious prosecution.id.
nieves is the beacon by which we must steer.in this case,as in nieves,there is absolutely no evidence of a conspiracy that began before the date of the plaintiff arrest.the plaintiff and the officers were strangers,and the plaintiff has never alleged a preexisting conspiracy.robinson is,therefore,inapposite.
the plaintiff grasps at one last straw.she notes that,in nieves,we left open the possibility of rare and exotic circumstances in which a section claim based on a warrantless arrest will not accrue at the time of the arrest.id.at accord,cir lynch,concurring.but any such opening appears to have been closed by the supreme court.see wallace,at rejecting argument that a false imprisonment claim was actionable after the limitations period had run on the petitioner theory that the initial fourth amendment violation set the wheels in motion for his subsequent conviction and detention.in short,we agree with the seventh circuit that,after wallace,later proceedings are irrelevant to the accrual of a false arrest or false imprisonment claim brought under section brooks city of chicago,cir.
that ends this aspect of the matter.we hold that the plaintiff false imprisonment claim,which accrued on september,is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
malicious prosecution.
the plaintiff remaining cause of action posits that the defendants violated her fourth amendment rights by wrongfully instituting legal process against her.it remains an unanswered question whether a malicious prosecution claim is cognizable under the fourth amendment and section,see wallace,at nieves,at,and we do not propose to resolve that uncertainty today.in its present posture,the record here allows us to assume,without deciding,that malicious prosecution can embody a fourth amendment violation and,thus,ground a cause of action under section.we proceed on that assumption.
to succeed in maintaining a section claim for malicious prosecution,a plaintiff must show a deprivation of liberty,pursuant to legal process,that is consistent with the concept of a fourth amendment seizure.nieves,at britton maloney,cir singer fulton county sheriff,cir.in the typical situation,the requisite legal process comes either in the form of an arrest warrant in which case the arrest would constitute the seizure or a subsequent charging document in which case the sum of deprivations would comprise the seizure.nieves,at.
the plaintiff tries to support her claim that a seizure occurred in several different ways.her first effort hinges on the assertion that her arrest was based on the detective wrongful procurement of a criminal complaint.the evidence is to the contrary.detective schaaf swore in an affidavit that the arrest preceded the swearing out and filing of the complaint,and there are no facts in the record to contradict this sequence of events.
the plaintiff nonetheless derives support for her argument from a procedural anomaly.she points to the answer to her complaint in this civil action,in which the defendants admitted the following allegation defendant schaaf then instituted legal process in the form of a criminal complaint charging the plaintiff with making a false report to law enforcement based upon which legal process the plaintiff was arrested.even though this argument was made below,the district court did not grapple with the effect of the judicial admission.we must do so.
ordinarily,a pleading admitting a fact alleged in an antecedent pleading is treated as a binding judicial admission,removing the fact from contention for the duration of the litigation.see,crest hill land,llc city of joliet,cir see also schott motorcycle supply,am.honda motor,cir.but there are limits to what parties can admit,see,whitfield mun y of fajardo,cir,so it is important to parse the particular admission in each case.
we have no difficulty in holding the defendants to the factual component of the admitted allegation that the detective instituted legal process against the plaintiff in the form of a criminal complaint.the remainder of the allegation,however,speaks to a matter of law whether the relationship between the arrest and the complaint was such as to constitute a seizure pursuant to legal process.admitting that the plaintiff arrest was based upon the complaint does not answer that legal question.the allegation,as framed,can fairly be read to mean that the arrest was based upon the events described in the complaint.
of course,the plaintiff seeks to have us read the admitted allegation to mean that the complaint was the instrument through which the arrest was effected.that reading is not compelled by the language of the allegation,and we are not aware of any authority that requires us to give it credence.to be binding,a judicial admission must be clear,comm l money.union ins,cir,and this one is not.
in all events,a court is not obliged to accept a proposition of law simply because one party elects not to contest it.see id.explaining that legal conclusions are rarely considered to be binding judicial admissions in re teleglobe commc ns,cir holding that judicial admissions must be statements of fact that require evidentiary proof,not statements of legal theories.
here,moreover,the absurdity of the plaintiff interpretation of the admission is manifest.for one thing,that interpretation is the record is pellucid that the plaintiff arrest antedated the issuance of the complaint.thus,as a temporal matter,the former could not have been based upon the latter in the sense that the plaintiff now suggests.
for another thing,the admitted allegation does not purport to contradict the undisputed fact that detective schaaf arrested the plaintiff without a w
