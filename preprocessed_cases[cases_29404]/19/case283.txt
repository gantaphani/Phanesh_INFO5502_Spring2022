john,elizabeth tavares,and william burke appeal their convictions for racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico violations,c,rico conspiracy,d,and mail fraud,based on their roles in a hiring scheme at the massachusetts office of the commissioner of probation ocp from to,tavares,and burke previously served as officials in the ocp.there,they catered to hiring requests from members of the state legislature with the hope of obtaining favorable legislation for the department of probation and the ocp.although the actions of the defendants may well be judged distasteful,and even contrary to massachusetts personnel laws,the function of this court is limited to determining whether they violated the federal criminal statutes charged.we find that the government overstepped its bounds in using federal criminal statutes to police the hiring practices of these massachusetts state officials and did not provide sufficient evidence to establish a criminal violation of massachusetts law under the government theory of the case.we reverse.
we provide a summary of the most salient facts as the jury might have found them.
many of the defendants claims of error are predicated on the sufficiency of the evidence,for which we must evaluate the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and determine whether the evidence,including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom,would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.united states manso cepeda,cir.quoting united states santos rivera,cir.
a.the ocp and the hiring framework 
tavares,and burke worked in the ocp,which serves as the central office of the massachusetts probation department and employs the commissioner of probation,deputy commissioners,and regional supervisors,also known as regional administrators.the ocp is responsible for staffing approximately employees in about probation offices throughout massachusetts.served as the commissioner of probation the commissioner,the position within the department of probation,from to,and he was responsible for appointing all employees.tavares served as second deputy commissioner from to and first deputy commissioner from to,and burke was the deputy commissioner of western massachusetts from to.
prior to,local judges had authority to appoint and promote probation employees,subject to the approval of the chief justice of administration and management cjam.in,new legislation gave the commissioner the exclusive authority for probation hiring and promotion,although his appointments were still subject to the approval of the cjam.the cjam hiring policies for the trial court were promulgated in the personnel policies and procedures manual the manual,copies of which were kept at ocp and distributed to chief probation officers.among other things,the manual provided that the objective of the hiring process is to select the most qualified individuals who can carry out their responsibilities in a competent and professional manner.judge robert mulligan served as the cjam throughout most of the relevant parts of this case,beginning in.
the manual also set out certain procedures for making permanent hires.in practice,openings in the probation department were posted on the massachusetts trial court website,and candidates submitted applications and resumes to the probation department.the applications were collected at the ocp,where janet mucci,supervisor of the human resources department,screened them for minimum education and experience requirements.to further winnow the applicant pool,from onward the ocp had applicants attend a screening interview with a regional administrator.
each applicant who passed the screening round proceeded to a interview before a panel consisting of a chief probation officer,local judge,and regional administrator.every candidate was asked the same set of questions,and each panel member would rank his or her top eight candidates.the second round of interviews was consistent with the manual procedures,which called for an interview committee consisting of the commissioner or designee,the chief probation officer of the division,and a representative of the cjam to interview probation applicants.in addition,the manual directed to develop a standard set of questions which,a t a minimum,each applicant should be asked if interviewed.
the regional administrator received a scoring sheet for each candidate to tally the scores of the panel.the top eight candidates proceeded to a interview at the ocp before two members of probation,typically two of deputy commissioner francis wall,deputy commissioner patricia walsh,and ocp administrative attorney edward mcdermott.set up the third round of interviews,which was not prescribed by the manual.
once the commissioner selected the final candidate or candidates after the interview,their application packages were prepared and sent to the cjam,who typically gave his signature for final approval.the appointment documentation form specified which records were included within each package 
in accordance with the established personnel standards,enclosed are 
the applicant interview and hiring record 
the applicant flow record 
a copy of all applications of the candidates who were interviewed 
a copy of the notice of vacancy job posting 
the jobs hotline confirmation letter f if on the hotline 
the employment eligibility verification form f supporting documentation new hires only 
the statement concerning employment in a job not covered by social security f new hires only 
the consent to criminal record check f new hires only 
the application for allied service credit f probation officer positions only.
for each appointment,the commissioner would certify that he had complied with the trial court personnel standards and that sufficient funding exists in the current fiscal budget to support this position.
b.the hiring scheme 
the defendants abused the hiring process to ensure that favored candidates were promoted or appointed in exchange for favorable budget treatment from the state legislature and increased control over the probation department.told wall,his close friend,that the patronage hiring scheme ensured that he had a good rapport with the legislature to facilitate a beneficial budget to the probation department.during each round of the interview process,various members of the probation department ensured that individuals recommended by legislators and other officials secured their desired positions.as a result,the probation department was the beneficiary of better budgets.the ocp regularly received referrals from legislators by mail and phone,and the names and their recommenders were compiled in sponsor lists sent to.throughout the hiring process,would meet with members of his staff responsible for receiving referrals and maintaining the sponsor lists to discuss which candidates had been referred by whom and for what positions.
before the interviews,tavares and others would give regional administrators assigned to the panel names of candidates that should be passed on to the third round.the regional administrators typically would pass these names to the chief probation officer assigned to the panel but did not always inform the local judge on the panel.the regional administrators and chief probation officers understood that these individuals were to be given priority to ensure they proceeded to the next round one regional administrator testified that he inflate d their ratings,and a chief probation officer explained that the lists influence d his ranking of the individuals.
some of the regional administrators and chief probation officers involved in the hiring process took issue with these practices.ellen slaney,who served as a regional administrator,understood that these individuals had sponsors that were politically influential,and when she explained to tavares that some of the best applicants were being passed over tavares replied that sometimes the political thing had to be done.edward driscoll,who was a chief probation officer and then a regional administrator during the relevant time period,testified that he began using pens rather than pencils when he scored interviewees,as he suspected that his scores were being changed to ensure preferred candidates proceeded to the next round.driscoll recalled a conversation with burke in driscoll expressed concern that a candidate whose husband was a local sheriff had been,to which burke replied,everything going to be fine,and i wrote the book on this stuff.
when members of the panel failed to pass along the selected names,they at times faced retaliation from and his staff slaney recalled an instance in january where called her into his office and appeared upset with her after she did not include a particular individual on the list for a interview.when she explained her reasons for not advancing the individual,replied oh,come on,ellen,everybody has a sponsor.in,after slaney declined to advance a recommended candidate,she was assigned to work on overdue audits,clerical work that slaney perceived as retaliation for not participating in the hiring process i n a way that i was told that i should.
although the manual did not provide for interviews,implemented the final round to ensure that the candidates that he selected would be presented to him as the candidate for the position.during the third round,the same four or five questions,all of which tavares prepared,were posed to each candidate.prior to the interviews,wall would receive a list of names and how they should be ranked from,tavares,or edward ryan,a legislative liaison for the ocp.received these names from legislators,judges,and attorneys who would call or mail referrals.wall testified that it was my responsibility to make sure that those candidates were ranked in the order given to me.to ensure the candidates were ranked according to instructions,the interview panel would help,would change scores,would embellish,pretty much do anything that was necessary to ensure that they were the number candidate.prior to interviews in western massachusetts,wall would meet with burke to advise him who the commissioner advised would be the candidate and what number rank they would be given.
once the preferred candidate was chosen,ocp staff would send the application package and certification to judge mulligan.was responsible for signing off on the certification,and he often certified that the best qualified candidate had been chosen.the ocp would then send out rejection letters to unsuccessful candidates stamped with or tavares signature.
judge mulligan understood that he had the authority to approve the appointment or to reject the appointment,but that he could not substitute his judgment as to who the best person would be.judge mulligan also understood that the appointment should be consistent with the manual and that the certification indicated that the appointment was consistent with a hiring system.
judge mulligan and had a contentious relationship,which judge mulligan described as oppositional almost from the time i took office.sometime in,judge mulligan grew suspicious of appointments and asked his hr department to any cases that they thought were unusual.in particular,he grew concerned that the scores of the final interview panel were taking precedence over the scores of the,local panel,and informed that he did not believe that this selection process would lead to the most qualified candidate since it seem ed designed to ignore the assessments of the local panel and gave to important background characteristics of the candidates.after judge mulligan spoke to a deputy commissioner about one of appointments,the senate chair of the ways and means committee,senator steven panagiotakos,told judge mulligan that he had only limited authority to review appointments.after this conversation,judge mulligan back ed off somewhat in his review of o brien choices for positions.

procedural history 
a federal indictment in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts followed in.the second superseding indictment alleged that,from to,the defendants implemented a sham hiring system and that falsely certified to the cjam that the candidate for employment had been hired pursuant to the procedures mandated by the manual,that is to say,a hiring system.the indictment charged count one for rico conspiracy under d as to all three defendants,count two for substantive rico violations under c as to and tavares,and counts three through twelve for mail fraud under and as to all three defendants.the substantive rico count was based on the predicate acts of mail fraud and massachusetts gratuities and bribery violations each mail fraud count and predicate act was based on a particular hire between and.
the defendants moved to dismiss the indictment on various grounds.among other things,they contended that the alleged mailings rejection letters sent to unsuccessful applicants did not satisfy the interstate commerce element of the federal mail fraud statute.they also sought to dismiss the rico counts on grounds that the government had failed to demonstrate the necessary link between a thing of value and an official act as required under the massachusetts bribery and gratuities statute.following a motion hearing,the district court denied the motion in a written opinion and order.
the parties proceeded to a day jury trial.throughout the trial,the district court allowed the jury to submit questions for the court to pose to the witnesses.jurors submitted questions,of which were asked by the court.the jury found all three defendants guilty of rico conspiracy.and tavares were found guilty of the substantive rico count,with the jury finding ten of the seventeen mail fraud predicates proven as to as a principal and tavares as either an aider and abettor,a coconspirator,or both and nine gratuities acts proven as to.the jury found none of the predicate bribery acts proven.of the nine mail fraud counts ultimately submitted to the jury,and tavares were adjudged guilty of four,with guilty as a principal and tavares guilty as both a coconspirator and aider and abettor as to two and an aider and abettor as to the remaining two.burke was acquitted on the mail fraud counts.
the defendants bring a panoply of arguments on appeal.we address only their most salient claims and pass no judgment on any issues not addressed herein.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,we can conclude that,along with the other defendants and many other members of the probation department,misran the probation department and made efforts to conceal the patronage hiring system.but b ad men,like good men,are entitled to be tried and sentenced in accordance with law.green united states,d black,dissenting.this case involves state officials efforts to increase funding for their department through arrangements with state legislators and other public officials.but not all unappealing conduct is criminal.as sovereigns,states have the prerogative to regulate the permissible scope of interactions between state officials and their constituents,and the supreme court has warned against interpreting federal laws in a manner that involves the federal government in setting standards of good government for local and state officials.mcdonnell united states,d quoting mcnally united states,d.for the reasons discussed herein,we find that the government has not in fact demonstrated that the conduct satisfies the appropriate criminal statutes,and we therefore reverse 
state gratuities count ii predicates b b,b 
under the federal rico statute,i t shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity c.rico and rico conspiracy counts require at least two acts of racketeering activity.a racketeering activity includes any act or threat involving bribery which is chargeable under state law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.a.for,the jury found nine predicate acts under the massachusetts gratuities statute.laws ch.a.argues that the indictment did not sufficiently allege violations of the massachusetts gratuities statute and that the evidence proffered at trial was insufficient to establish the gratuity violations charged.
the massachusetts gratuities statute penalizes those who give illegal gratuities to officials,id.as well as officials who receive illegal gratuities,id.b.here,the government sought to prove that knowingly offer ed or promis ed anything of substantial value to a public official for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by that official.id.a 
a gratuity may be given as a reward for past action,to influence an official regarding a present action,or to induce an official to undertake a future action.scaccia,at.mere proof of the public official position is insufficient to demonstrate an official act under the statute t he insistence upon an official act,carefully defined,seems pregnant with the requirement that some particular official act be identified and proved.united states sun diamond growers of,d.t he government must prove a link between a thing of value conferred upon a public official and a specific official act for or because of which it was given.scaccia,at quoting growers of,at.
in that vein,the government can not show the requisite linkage merely by demonstrating that the gratuity was given to build a reservoir of goodwill that might ultimately affect one or more of a multitude of unspecified acts,now and in the future.growers of,at.recognizing that direct evidence of these sorts of violations may be difficult to obtain,massachusetts courts accept evidence regarding the subject matter of pending legislation and its impact on the giver,the outcome of particular votes,the timing of the gift,or changes in a voting pattern to demonstrate the requisite linkage.scaccia,at.we bypass the question of whether the indictment sufficiently alleged violations of.laws ch.and turn to whether the government presented sufficient evidence that violated the statute we conclude that it did not.
the government groups the predicate acts into two categories the kathleen petrolati predicate act act b and the electric monitoring program elmo appointments predicate acts acts b b,b.both categories of predicate acts relate to a series of temporary hires for purposes of the elmo program.in,the massachusetts legislature passed a new law providing for mandatory electronic monitoring of sex offenders.in and,ocp received additional funding for new hires to implement the monitoring system.proposed that these individuals be hired on a temporary basis.according to mucci,the appointments were designated as temporary so that could get people hired without going through the hiring process and the interviewing process.gave mucci names of individuals and instructions to offer them elmo positions.the individuals did not interview with anyone at the ocp prior to receiving an offer.
the government evidence as to the gratuities predicates does not show adequate linkage between the thing of substantial value conferred by the jobs and an official act performed or to be performed.see life ins.ass of,state ethics comm n,remanding to the state ethics commission to make adequate findings on whether there was any link to a specific act commonwealth vázquez.many of the government arguments are predicated on bootstrapping because was constantly conferring with legislators and hiring based on legislative preferences,any official act taken by an affected legislator must satisfy the nexus requirement.but we do not read the gratuities statute so broadly the supreme court in sun diamond offered a strictly worded requirement that the government show a link to a specific official act to supply a limiting principle that would distinguish an illegal gratuity from a legal one,a principle unnecessary in the extortion or bribery contexts.united states ganim,cir.given a choice between treating a gratuities statute as a meat axe or a scalpel,the supreme court chose the latter,and we follow suit.sun diamond growers of,at.see also valdes united states,cir.sun diamond interpretive gloss,like the rule of lenity,thus works to protect a citizen from punishment under a statute that gives at best dubious notice that it has criminalized his conduct.
the petrolati predicate act 
the government contended that kathleen petrolati husband,massachusetts house representative thomas petrolati,proposed a budget amendment in april that would increase funding for positions in ocp,adding two program managers,two court service coordinators,and ten assistant court service coordinators,in turn,appointed representative petrolati wife,kathleen petrolati,as a program manager in the elmo program in november.that spring,the ocp had funding to add the positions specified in the budget amendment.
the government asserts that the jury could infer the necessary link based on representative petrolati sponsorship of the budget amendment and his wife being appointed a program manager.but seven months passed between these two events,and there was no evidence that knew of representative petrolati connection to the budget amendment or that representative petrolati had change d his voting pattern in anticipation of his wife hire.scaccia,at.to the contrary,representative petrolati also sponsored amendments appropriating money to courts across western massachusetts.
the elmo appointments predicate acts 
for the elmo appointments predicate acts,the government sought to show that gave elmo appointments to representative robert deleo,then chairman of the house ways and means committee,to garner support for deleo run for speaker of the house,and that deleo then offered various legislators the opportunity to appoint individuals for these positions in exchange for their voting for deleo.in addition,in september,after had appointed several elmo candidates referred through deleo office,met with deleo to propose legislation that would curtail the cjam oversight over appointments,grant life tenure,and fix his salary at per year below that of the cjam.
the government contends that one of the official acts was an amendment that proposed at a meeting with deleo that would have made the effective czar of probation.yet the government fails to explain how this meeting is linked to the elmo hires or specify to which elmo hires it relates,instead vaguely noting that had appointed two or three referrals for elmo positions by the time of the meeting.
further,the government did not prove that deleo took any action on proposals,or that pressured deleo to do so for or because of a specific elmo hire.official act is defined as any decision or action in a particular matter or in the enactment of legislation.laws ch.h.the supreme court recently explained that an official act,similarly defined under a requires more than mere discussion 
h osting an event,meeting with other officials,or speaking with interested parties is not,standing alone,a decision or action within the meaning of a,even if the event,meeting,or speech is related to a pending question or matter.instead,something more is required a specifies that the public official must make a decision or take an action on that question or matter,or agree to do so.
mcdonnell united states,d.
all the government demonstrated,however,is that and deleo met.the evidence does not show,for example,that deleo subsequently introduced a bill based on either of proposals or took some official act with respect to such a bill proposed by another legislator.the government also identifies no particular statements that or deleo made about the proposals,or other evidence about that meeting,from which a jury might reasonably infer what specific official act,if any,was trying to induce deleo to take.thus,the evidence reveals no specific official act either taken by deleo or merely sought from him to which we could apply the scaccia factors to determine its possible link to the two or three elmo appointments.the evidence therefore does not support a finding that the official act requirement was met,or that it was linked to the gratuity.
the government also contends that the elmo hires correlate to an official act in that gave deleo office referral opportunities to pass on to legislators to build support for the speaker race.edward ryan,deleo legislative liaison,testified that deleo and his staff used the jobs to gather support for deleo,and that told him that deleo office had identified individuals that they were looking for to vote for bob deleo for the speaker race.
but while a legislator vote in a leadership election may constitute an official act,the government needed to prove,as the district court instructed the jury,a link between the gratuity that gave deleo and a specific official act that deleo would undertake the government does not explain,however,how other legislators votes for deleo could qualify as deleo official acts.and no such explanation occurs to us.
the evidence shows at most that gave deleo control over the elmo appointments to enable deleo to round up votes from other legislators.such evidence may suffice to show that gave the elmo appointments to deleo to facilitate his path to power in the state house,in the hope that,by building up a reservoir of goodwill with deleo,the future speaker would use his power to benefit the probation department budget see sun diamond growers of,at.but that is only evidence that was seeking general legislative support from deleo,and,under and scaccia,that is not sufficient to show a specific public act,and with it an illegal gratuity.see sun diamond growers of,at.scaccia,at.we therefore do not interpret the massachusetts gratuities statute to reach the conduct described here.
mail fraud count i predicate acts,counts 
to prove a violation of the federal mail fraud statute under,the government must prove a scheme to defraud based on false pretenses the defendant knowing and willing participation in the scheme with the intent to defraud and the use of interstate mail communications in furtherance of that scheme.united states hebshie,cir.internal formatting omitted quoting united states cheal,cir.the jury found and tavares guilty of mail fraud counts three,four,five,and six,and found ten predicate acts of mail fraud for purposes of and tavares substantive rico count.and tavares now challenge their mail fraud convictions on multiple fronts,contending that the indictment was insufficient to support the mail fraud allegations and the evidence insufficient to support their convictions.among other things,they contend that the government did not demonstrate that the mailings were in furtherance of the hiring scheme.
the federal mail fraud statute does not purport to reach all frauds,but only those limited instances in which the use of the mails is a part of the execution of the fraud,leaving all other cases to be dealt with by appropriate state law.schmuck united states,d quoting kann united states.t he mailing must be for the purpose of executing the scheme,as the statute requires.united states maze,d quoting kann,at.a mailing furthers a fraudulent scheme if it is,inter alia,designed to lull the victims into a false sense of security,postpone their ultimate complaint to the authorities,and therefore make the apprehension of the defendants less likely than if no mailings had taken place.id.at.
the mailing requirement is interpreted broadly,however,and the use of the mails need not be an essential element of the scheme.schmuck,at.rather,the charged mailing need only be incident to an essential part of the scheme.hebshie,at quoting pereira united states.further,the defendant need not personally mail anything so long as it is reasonably foreseeable that the mails will be used in the ordinary course of business to further the scheme.united states cacho bonilla,cir.
from this,two propositions emerge.first,a mailing can serve as the basis for a mail fraud conviction even if the fraud would have been successful had the mailing never occurred.second,however,that mailing even if dispensable must at least have some tendency to facilitate execution of the fraud.in determining whether the government proved the mailing element,we look to see whether,after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government,and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor,a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.united states soto,cir.quoting hebshie,at.
even assuming that there was a scheme to defraud,the government did not present substantial evidence of a mailing in furtherance of such a scheme.hebshie,at.the government points to form rejection letters that ocp staff mailed to unsuccessful applicants,typically after the final candidates were selected to satisfy the mailing requirement.these mailings fulfilled a requirement in the manual that a pplicants who are not selected for appointment must be notified in writing that they have not been selected.the government argues that such rejection letters in a corrupt hiring system satisfy mailing element where they help to maintain a facade of a system.see united states sorich,cir.determining that rejection letters lent a false air of propriety and regularity to the city hiring process see also united states fernández,cir.these notifications were not merely ancillary to the execution of the fraud,rather,they falsely portray ed to anyone who examined lyons records that the bids submitted were legitimate,thereby concealing the true nature of the scheme.but the government presented no evidence that would allow the jury to infer that the rejection letters in this case served this duplicitous function.had unsuccessful applicants received no notice,they may have assumed they were not hired or else called ocp to check their status.the government identifies language in the rejection letters stating that t he selection of the final candidate was a difficult process and that the deputy commissioners were very impressed with the recipients qualifications to demonstrate that the letters were intended to convince rejected candidates that their selection was based on merit.we are not convinced that such vague platitudes,hallmarks of any rejection letter,sufficiently demonstrate that the rejections had any real tendency to convey a selection system.
in arguing to the contrary,the government points to this circuit decision in united states cacho bonilla,cir.a case in which we found the connection between the scheme and the mailing unusually thin and observed that the mail fraud count would better have been omitted,id.at.in cacho bonilla,the defendants were convicted of mail fraud for their involvement in a scheme where they misused federal funds provided to their corporation,acción social de puerto rico,aspri.id.at.the defendants submitted monthly reports reflecting fraudulent markups to a state agency.id.at.the agency then compiled the reports into summaries and sent the summaries,by mail,to the department of health and human services hhs.id.in determining that these reports satisfied the mailing requirement,this court explained 
much of the scheme depended upon the continuation of federal funding for aspri.in turn,the submission by mail of aspri data to hhs data collection entity perpetuated the relationship that kept funds flowing to aspri so viewed,the perpetuation was essential to the scheme and the mailing was incidental to that perpetuation.
id.at.similarly,in united states hebshie,cir,we found that a letter sent to a defendant after he submitted a fraudulent insurance claim was sufficient under,describing the letter as part of the of mailings that would reasonably be expected when false claims are submitted to insurance companies,are processed,and are ultimately paid,thereby making the fraud successful.id.at quoting united states morrow,cir.
in both cacho bonilla and hebshie,however,the mailing was part of an ongoing relationship whether between aspri and its source of federal funds or between the fraudster and the defrauded insurance company necessary to effectuate the fraud.the supreme court decision in schmuck united states,d,is instructive.in schmuck,the court upheld the mail fraud conviction of a distributor who rolled back the odometers on cars and sold those cars at artificially inflated prices to dealers,who in turn resold the cars to customers.id.at.the retail sellers submission of forms to the state department of transportation on behalf of their customers satisfied the mailing requirement.id.at.the court found that the mailings,which may not have contributed directly to the duping of either the retail dealers or the customers,were necessary to the passage of title.id.at.and the passage of title was essential to the perpetuation of the scheme,id.because the success of the venture depended upon the defendant continued harmonious relations with,and good reputation among,retail dealers,which in turn required the smooth flow of cars from the dealers to their customers,id.at.
here,in contrast,the government has presented no evidence that the continued relationship between the ocp and rejected applicants was of any consequence.nor has the government produced evidence that the rejection letters furthered any relationship say,between the ocp and judge mulligan that was of consequence,or facilitated ability to make appointments or to receive approval for those appointments.
instead,the government reasons that the letters tended to perpetuate the scheme by making the rejected applicant less likely to call to inquire as to his status,thereby making it less likely that such a call might lead to some inquiry that would uncover the scheme.even though employers need not and often do not send rejection letters to unsuccessful applicants,we will assume that the government is correct that sending the letters decreased the odds that rejected applicants would call to learn their status.but the second part of the government nexus hypothesis,that such calls may have led to discovery of the scheme rests on nothing more than rank speculation.the government evidence provided no plausible mechanism by which a call from a rejected applicant asking about his or her status would lead to the discovery of the scheme.nor has the government demonstrated that sending the letters meaningfully decreased the likelihood that some other party would have uncovered the hiring scheme.and while the mailing was certainly incidental to providing a courtesy to unsuccessful applicants,providing such a courtesy was not sufficiently tied to the defendants interest in perpetrating the scheme because it furthered neither the perpetration nor the perpetuation of the scheme.none of the remaining cases cited by the government are factually analogous to the case before us,and they do not require us to find that these rejection letters were sent in furtherance of the defendants scheme.
racketeering predicate acts fourteen and seventeen involved mailings other than rejection letters.predicate act fourteen involved a copy of a letter that judge mulligan sent approving douglas maclean appointment.the government contends that the mailing requirement was satisfied because the chief probation officer that would be working with maclean received a copy of this appointment letter by mail,and judge mulligan written approval was required before maclean could begin his employ.but we know nothing about why the letter was mailed to the chief probation officer in this instance.to be sure,t he in furtherance requirement is to be broadly read and applied.hebshie,at.section mailing requirement,however,places an important limitation on federal authority.see kann,at.
congress could have drafted the mail fraud statute so as to require only that the mails be in fact used as a result of the fraudulent scheme.but it did not do this instead,it required that the use of the mails be for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice.
maze,at.footnote and alteration omitted.the record does not demonstrate that the appointment letter was sent for this purpose,and we therefore find jurisdictional element is not satisfied for purposes of predicate act fourteen.
predicate act seventeen involved a mailed application.but rico claims require two predicate acts,and the government does not present sufficient evidence of a mailing for purposes of any other mail fraud predicate act.accordingly,we need not address whether the evidence of a mailed application is sufficient to satisfy mailing requirement for predicate act seventeen 
juror questions 
although we reverse based on more central issues,making the present issue moot,we must express our reservations about the extent and type of juror questions allowed by the trial judge in this case.
whether to allow juror questions falls to the sound discretion of the trial court.united states sutton,cir.but,as we have previously cautioned,jury questioning should be reserved for exceptional situations,and should not become the routine,even in complex cases.united states cassiere,cir.here,jurors submitted questions,and the district court posed of them to witnesses.that means that,over days of testimony,eight questions were submitted and five questions asked per day on average.this volume of questions is far beyond anything approved of in this circuit and suggests that the district court allowed juror questions to become routine rather than an exception.
furthermore,the content of many of the questions jurors asked is troubling.juror questions should serve the limited purpose of clarification,see id.at,and they should be a exception reserved for the most critical points,sutton,at.here,though,the trial judge told the jurors that their questions should be guided by whether the lawyer gets out what interests you from the witness.this invitation to go beyond seeking clarification led to questions allowed over objection like whether some candidate did not make the list because recommended names were on the list and why did you change james rush score.juror questions of this type elicited not just clarifications but evidence i n a jury trial the primary finders of fact are the jurors.their overriding responsibility is to stand between the accused and a potentially arbitrary or abusive government that is in command of the criminal sanction.united states martin linen supply,d.if a district court allows jurors to ask questions,it must ensure that the jurors do not turn into fact gatherers rather than factfinders by exceeding the bounds delineated in sutton and cassiere.
we find the evidence insufficient to support the defendants convictions and order the entry of judgments of acquittal.
so ordered.
the massachusetts supreme judicial court subsequently appointed an independent counsel to investigate the ocp hiring practices,and the independent counsel concluded hiring and promotion processes have been fraudulently orchestrated from beginning to end in favor of connected candidates.the fraud begins at the top with commissioner,and it extends through most of the hierarchy of the department who participate in interviewing candidates for hiring and promotion.paul ware,report of the independent counsel,in the matter of the probation department of the trial court sjc.

this does not mean that these practices can not have consequences.here,the independent counsel appointed by the massachusetts supreme judicial court recommended both remedial personnel actions and policy changes at the ocp,and a number of steps have been taken to discipline the perpetrators and safeguard the ocp against similar abuses.see report of the independent counsel see also scott allen,sjc orders probation overhaul as report finds rampant fraud,bos.globe.
