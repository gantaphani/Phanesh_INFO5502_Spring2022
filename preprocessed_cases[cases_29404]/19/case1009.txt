a jury found winston mcghee guilty of possession of cocaine base at least five grams,a,and of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute less than five grams,id.a he now appeals on three grounds that the search of his person violated the fourth amendment that the court impermissibly allowed a testifying chemist to rely in part on another chemist test results as to one drug sample the sale of which was not charged and that at sentencing,a youthful offender adjudication was improperly treated as a career offender predicate.
during june and july,jeffrey stone a sergeant in the massachusetts state police and nicholas curelli a detective in the oak bluffs,massachusetts,police department investigated reports of cocaine sales by jordan clements,her boyfriend calvin,and his friend called pooh.on july,a confidential informant made a controlled purchase of a sample from pooh,which stone observed before following pooh back to the nashua house hotel.the sample was contained in a corner of a plastic bag that had been twisted and cut off from the original bag.the officers concluded from appearance and a field test that the sample was crack cocaine,and a nashua house employee informed curelli that clements and two men were staying in room of the hotel.
based on this evidence,the officers obtained a warrant permitting them to search for cocaine and records,money,or paraphernalia related to illegal drug possession in room and on the person or in the possession of clements,calvin,and pooh.that evening,the officers stopped mcghee as he entered the denied using the name pooh and identified himself as winston in a pat down took from him a knife.mcghee walked up to room with the officers,and curelli began to search him while stone searched the room.
there,the officers found fifteen corners and seventeen knotted ends of plastic sandwich bags,a cell phone,and two for the room registration in clements name and one dated that day for a bicycle in mcghee name they found no cocaine and no apparatus for smoking crack.in mcghee pockets and wallet,curelli found identification with mcghee name and in mcghee was unemployed at the another cell phone that displayed the name pooh.the officer found marijuana in mcghee shoes and arrested him.
around this time,two more male and stone and curelli in the room.curelli had mcghee remove his polo shirt and blue jean shorts,leaving him in his underwear an and basketball shorts and revealing a brand or scar of pooh on his arm.stone then instructed curelli to complete his search.
mcghee began to protest,saying that they could not search him or stick a finger up his ass.stone replied that they would not do that,but they would do a complete search.mcghee refused and then physically resisted removal of his underwear against resistance,the officers forced mcghee to the floor,pulled down his shorts,and found a bag protruding from between mcghee buttocks,which mcsweeney picked up.the bag contained individual baggies of what,when later tested,proved to be cocaine base.
mcghee was indicted for possession of cocaine base and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base the grand jury alleged in both counts that the offense involved at least five grams of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base.prior to trial,mcghee moved to suppress the seized evidence but his motion was denied.at his trial the officers testified to the events set forth above including the original sample purchased by the informant,the searches of the room and of mcghee and the evidence obtained in both searches.there was also expert testimony from a chemist that the drugs in the baggies were cocaine base and totaled grams and that the sample was also cocaine base and weighed grams.
the jury found mcghee guilty of both counts in answers to special interrogatories,the jury stated that the substance in both counts was cocaine base,but that the minimum was only shown for the possession count.the separate inquiry was pertinent because,among other things,the figure affected the statutory sentencing range then in force.b b iii,a.at sentencing,the district court ruled over objection that mcghee qualified as a career offender,leading to a guideline range of to months imprisonment,but the district court granted a downward variance and sentenced mcghee to months imprisonment.mcghee now appeals.
we begin with mcghee claim that the district court should have suppressed the package of baggies.police searches are constrained by the fourth amendment reasonableness requirement and,in certain circumstances,by the further requirement of a warrant,arizona gant,lafave,search and seizure a,at ed.mcghee does not argue that a warrant was needed if the requisite grounds existed for so intrusive a search incident to an arrest.conversely the government chose not to assert that the warrant separately authorized a search that included removal of mcghee clothes but defends the search as reasonable incident to the arrest.
mcghee had been validly arrested on a drug offense at the time of the search and,although mcghee was formally arrested only for marijuana possession,there was probable cause to believe that he was a drug trafficker since he had sold a drug sample earlier in the day.in an ordinary arrest,a full search of the person is a conventional means of protecting the arresting officers from weapons and assuring against the destruction of evidence.united states robinson,see also chimel california.
but,as a search extends beyond a pat down and the removal of outer garments,shoes and socks,the case law has required increasing justification for more intrusive measures,see,swain,at our decisions,although sometimes varying in labels,tend to distinguish between a simple strip search involving removal of all or virtually all clothes,a visual inspection of genitals or buttocks requiring some change in posture of the body for example,the subject might be forced to bend over and spread his buttock cheeks,and an actual manual intrusion into such orifices,blackburn snow,cir see also united states barnes,cir 
in this case,the district court found that mcghee was subject on arrest only to the first of these three additional measures,using the term strip search to exclude the more intrusive visual body cavity search.mcghee rather briefly asserts that in fact what occurred here was a visual body cavity search.the district court may be entitled to different measures of deference depending upon whether the focus is upon characterization of evidence or its findings of raw facts,compare ornelas united states,with united states bater,cir,but regardless,the record evidence confirms the district court conclusion.
thus,mcghee argues that while a strip search involves a view of the naked body in a natural posture,the district court found that the officers had held mcghee down and pulled his ankles apart,revealing what was hidden in between the cheeks of his buttocks.but the description is incomplete and the word hidden is inaccurate.the record shows that,far from submitting to the request to strip,mcghee deliberately swung his body into the officers,and the district court found that he made a strip search impossible by clenching his buttocks,by tangling his ankles,by refusing to get up,by resisting in a variety of different ways.
the officers,as the district court ruled,did no more than was necessary to obtain a full strip search the spreading of mcghee legs was only in the sense that an officer untangled mcghee deliberately entangled ankles and,at that point,the officers observed in plain view,protruding from mcghee buttocks,the package containing the baggies of cocaine.in fact,the back of mcghee undershorts were pulled down only enough to expose his buttocks,so the legs,being bound by the garment,probably could not readily have been pulled far apart into some unnatural posture.
the question remains whether the officers had whatever enhanced grounds may be needed to justify any strip search at all.here,the government cites our statement in barnes that t he initial strip search of the defendant for contraband and weapons was clearly justified given barnes arrest for a drug trafficking crime
