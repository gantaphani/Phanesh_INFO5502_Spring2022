following a jury trial,luis ángel manso cepeda manso was convicted for aiding and abetting a convicted felon,lisander casillas sánchez casillas,in possession of a firearm in violation of g and.he directly appeals the district court denial of his motion for acquittal under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.he asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction in light of the advance knowledge requirement for aiders and abettors articulated in rosemond united states,d.for the reasons discussed herein,we affirm.
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution.united states ofray campos,cir.at about,on the evening of january,officer onil tejeda jiménez tejeda was patrolling in his police car in the el hobo and honduras sectors of loíza,puerto rico.sergeant gadiel bonilla sat as a passenger in tejeda car.at that time,tejeda was accompanied by two other patrol cars,one of which was driven by officer josé cruz cervera cruz.
tejeda observed a gray mazda protegé the mazda with windows that appeared to be tinted beyond the level permitted under puerto rico law traveling in the opposite direction.tejeda attempted to initiate a traffic stop,turning on his vehicle rotating lights and sirens and motioning for the vehicle to halt by sticking his hand out the driver side window.the mazda did not comply,instead passing tejeda.
when cruz saw that the mazda had failed to obey tejeda,he turned on his vehicle rotating lights and moved into the mazda lane to block the car.the mazda drove onto the sidewalk to avoid cruz vehicle and continued driving away from the patrol cars.the officers immediately pursued the mazda,with cruz following tejeda and bonilla.
the mazda turned onto another street and briefly stopped during the chase.tejeda and bonilla observed one of the rear passenger doors open.tejeda,who was positioned directly behind the mazda,observed an individual later identified as casillas throw a firearm onto the grass alongside the road.the mazda then accelerated a s fast as it could away from tejeda and bonilla.at that moment,cruz,who was somewhat behind the other two vehicles,arrived at the scene,and bonilla signaled for cruz to continue following the mazda.
tejeda and bonilla remained at the scene where the mazda had stopped.tejeda retrieved the gun,and since it was quite large,placed it in the rear seat of his car.at the trial,expert witness julio vélez identified the firearm as a winchester shotgun,which typically has a barrel that is between and inches.the gun found by tejeda had a barrel that had been sawed down to sixteen inches.the gun was loaded and contained six cartridges.
meanwhile,cruz continued his pursuit of the mazda.the mazda eventually stopped,turning into the entrance of a residence.there,cruz observed an individual holding a black pistol exit the front passenger seat and flee into a wooded area.casillas and the driver,later identified as manso,exited the vehicle.both men were placed under arrest.at the time,casillas was wearing a tee shirt and basketball shorts.
in an interview conducted with special agent josé díaz narváez díaz after his arrest,manso asserted that no one was riding in the front passenger seat and that he had stopped in that neighborhood to pick his wife up from a social gathering.manso explained that he did not halt when tejeda first signaled because he wanted to go to a safer place to stop his car.cruz and tejeda testified that they did not observe manso wife at the residence where he stopped.the jury also heard testimony that,earlier that same day,bonilla and cruz had confronted casillas and observed him and manso with a group of friends at manso father home.
manso was indicted for one count of aiding and abetting a convicted felon in the possession of a firearm under and g at trial,the parties stipulated that casillas was a convicted felon and therefore a prohibited person under g,that casillas knowingly possessed the winchester shotgun loaded with six cartridges in or affecting interstate commerce,and that the mazda was registered to manso mother.at the close of the government case,manso moved for a judgment of acquittal under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,which the district court denied from the bench.following the trial,the jury found manso guilty of aiding and abetting,and manso was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment and three years supervised release.manso filed a renewed motion for judgment of acquittal,which the district court denied in a written opinion and order.he appeals that decision here.

aiding and abetting under rosemond 
manso argument centers on the advance knowledge requirement articulated in rosemond,which involved a defendant conviction for aiding and abetting a violation of c during a drug deal gone bad.rosemond.at.section c a provides minimum mandatory sentences for those who,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime use or carr y a firearm.
the court in rosemond began with the premise that a person is liable under for aiding and abetting a crime if and only if he takes an affirmative act in furtherance of that offense,with the intent of facilitating the offense commission.rosemond.at.for purposes of the intent inquiry,a person who actively participates in a criminal scheme knowing its extent and character intends that scheme commission.id.at.turning to the question of when an aider and abettor must know that a gun will be used,the court clarified that the defendant knowledge of a firearm must be advance knowledge,knowledge at a time the accomplice can do something with it most notably,opt to walk away.id.at.if the gun emerges only when the defendant no longer has a realistic opportunity to quit the crime,the defendant has not shown the requisite intent to assist a crime involving a gun.id.at.yet the supreme court noted that,if a defendant continues to participate in a crime after a gun was displayed or used by a confederate,the jury can permissibly infer from his failure to object or withdraw that he had such knowledge.id.at.
rosemond application to manso 
manso contends that the government only succeeded in establishing that he knew something illegal was afoot inside his vehicle when officer tejeda attempted to conduct a traffic stop.to the contrary,the government presented evidence that would have allowed the jury to infer that manso knew that casillas possessed a gun when casillas first entered the mazda.first,the firearm was over a foot long so long that tejeda needed to place it in the rear seat of his patrol car after he retrieved it.casillas,who wore only a tee shirt and shorts,would have had difficulty concealing a gun of that size.further,casillas and manso had been observed socializing that same day.the jury may have reasonably concluded that manso was not merely giving an acquaintance a ride,but that he had spent time with casillas throughout the evening and may have seen casillas carrying the gun before he entered the car.as a result,it is not unreasonable,insupportable,or overly speculative for the jury to infer that manso was aware of the gun from the moment casillas entered his car.united states spinney,cir reliance on indirect,as opposed to direct,evidence in a criminal case is both permissible and commonplace.
in this way,this case is distinguishable from rodríguez martínez,where we determined that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the defendant aide
