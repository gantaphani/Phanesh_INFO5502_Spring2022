robert urciuoli,the former chief executive officer of roger williams medical center rwmc in providence,rhode island,seeks review of his conviction following his second trial for multiple counts of honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit such fraud he was convicted of the same offense in an earlier trial,but that conviction was vacated on appeal.united states urciuoli urciuoli i,cir.urciuoli i describes some background facts of this case,as well as the governing statute and case law.
the gravamen of the charge against urciuoli was his role in a scheme to the guise of an employment celona,then a rhode island state senator.insofar as urciuoli challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,the facts are to be taken in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states arroyo,cir.the pertinent events and proceedings are as follows.
in the summer of,discussion with urciuoli ceo of rwmc and frances driscoll senior vice president of rwmc spoke and voted against overriding the rhode island governor veto of a bill that if passed would make it hard for a entity to acquire a hospital.urciuoli and driscoll opposed the bill and supported its veto because it would prevent their desired sale of rwmc to another entity.celona failed by two votes to sustain the veto,so the bill became law.
immediately after this effort,celona asked urciuoli for employment,explaining that he was going through financial difficulties.in february,celona signed a contract purportedly employing him to market an nursing home called elmhurst extended care and an assisted living village at elmhurst the village owned partly by an rwmc subsidiary and partly by a separate entity owned by a man named peter sangermano.
although celona did some marketing for the village,his efforts were fairly modest and his compensation substantial.in the case that followed,the government charged that urciuoli was in substance employing celona to use his office on behalf of rwmc in two different respects 
to support or oppose bills in accordance with rwmc interest,including attempts to kill certain bills,and otherwise to promote rwmc interests with respect to pending legislative matters 
to conduct meetings at celona government office with urciuoli and representatives of two major insurance companies in order to resolve longstanding disputes about reimbursements owed to rwmc.
urciuoli,driscoll,sangermano and rwmc were indicted in the rhode island federal district court,and rwmc entered into a plea bargain but the three individual defendants went to trial.although sangermano was acquitted,urciuoli and driscoll were convicted on various counts of honest services mail fraud or aiding or abetting such fraud,urciuoli conspiracy to commit honest services mail fraud,id.
urciuoli and driscoll appealed and we held that certain of the conduct presented to the jury in the first,urciuoli and driscoll role in celona lobbying of municipal officials to increase the number of patients brought to roger williams hospital by not a crime under the honest services statute.urciuoli i,at.because the jury instructions permitted conviction for such conduct and the jury might have convicted on that basis,a new trial was ordered.id.at.
in the new trial,the government presented much of the evidence offered in the first trial,but celona did not testify and this time the government limited its theory to quid pro quo bribery,eschewing any suggestion undisclosed conflict of interest on celona part was sufficient,and avoiding reliance on celona lobbying relating to the ambulance service.the theory thus fits within the supreme court recent interpretation of the honest services provision in skilling united states,wl june,a decision to which we will return in due course 
in the second trial,although driscoll was acquitted,urciuoli was convicted on the same counts as in the first trial substantive counts of honest services mail fraud corresponding to each payment check mailed to celona and one conspiracy count.the district court denied urciuoli motion for judgment of acquittal and his motion for a new trial,and sentenced him to months imprisonment.
urciuoli now appeals from his conviction on three grounds,and we begin with his claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove the crimes charged.urciuoli says that the government failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish either the essential actus exchange of salary payments for celona legislative action or the required mens intent that the salary payments serve as a corrupt quid pro quo bribe.
the government evidence permitted the jury to find that celona work for the village was modest given his ample salary roughly total between february and january that his limited work for the village decreased over the years while his contract was renewed and his weekly fee rose on urciuoli orders from to to that he reported more often to driscoll and urciuoli than to village management and that his salary was covered by rwmc and not the village.
the jury could also find that urciuoli hired celona shortly after celona had exerted legislative efforts in rwmc favor that others at rwmc and the village thought celona lacked the skills for the purported marketing work and that urciuoli renewed celona contract and increased his pay shortly after celona effort to,in urciuoli words,crank around that is,to exert pressure of the insurance companies with whom rwmc was negotiating about reimbursement.evidence further showed that urciuoli sought to hide the extent of rwmc relationship with celona 
from this and other evidence,a rational jury could find that urciuoli purpose was for celona to use his office on behalf of rwmc and that celona did so,that the compensation nominally for marketing was in reality for celona misuse of his powers,and that the result was a conspiracy to deprive rhode island citizens of celona honest services as a rhode island senator.because various mailings occurred in implementing the scheme,those mailings triggered the mail fraud statute,which expressly extends to honest services fraud.see note,above.the inferred conspiracy between urciuoli and celona was also adequately proved.
urciuoli are not persuasive.that celona performed some marketing services did not prevent the jury from regarding the payments as primarily intended by urciuoli to secure celona legislative help.nor does it matter whether celona expressly agreed to help rwmc on specific bills,for the jury could infer an understanding that he provide rwmc general support in exchange for money even if occasionally opposing rwmc urciuoli was free to make such arguments to the jury,but the jury could fairly reject them.
at greater length,urciuoli argues that the jury should have been instructed on the rhode island state law class exception and that urciuoli should be granted a new trial for the court failure to so instruct.the class exception is a rhode island statute declaring that a state legislator privately employed does not have a conflict of interest with his legislative duties if the benefit that accrues to his employer from his actions is no more than that obtained by other employers in the same class.laws b.
urciuoli argues,first,that concerns about federalism,fair notice,and the first amendment right to petition the government require that state law be considered in determining the content of a state legislator duties for which the failure to perform constitutes the deprivation of honest services under section.but as we explained in urciuoli i,n othing in rhode island law purports to authorize or protect quid pro quo bribery.at see also laws to criminally prohibiting bribery of a state official.the class exception does not protect the conduct charged by the government.
the theory that of a conflict of interest was enough,even without a bribe,was advanced by the government in the first trial but,stripping down its case,the government excluded any such theory from its opening argument,the revised indictment and its closing argument.and this time the jury instructions made it clear beyond peradventure that 
the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant urciuoli intended the payment
