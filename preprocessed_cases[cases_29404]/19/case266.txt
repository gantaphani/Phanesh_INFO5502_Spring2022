background 
on march,while román and another man were driving in san juan,puerto rico,román fired one shot from his pistol into the air.agents from the puerto rico police department were in the area,and they arrested román and seized román pistol and an additional magazine.román was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm.
on april,román entered into a plea agreement,which included advisory guideline calculations of a base offense level of twenty and a credit for acceptance of responsibility,for a total offense level of seventeen.this calculation assumed that román prior conviction had been a controlled substance offense under a a.although the parties did not stipulate to a criminal history category chc,the plea agreement advisory guideline calculations indicated that román recommended sentence would be to months if he had a chc of ii.the parties agree d to recommend the lower end of the applicable guideline range.
on august,the probation officer filed a presentence investigation report the psr.the psr calculated a total offense level of seventeen and a chc of ii,resulting in a recommended sentence of to months.román sentencing memorandum,filed on september,stated that his offense level was expected to be level.on august,the probation officer filed an addendum to the psr,which stated that román ha d not filed any written objections.
on september,more than a year after the psr was filed,román filed objections to it.román argued that the psr improperly calculated his total offense level as seventeen,because román prior conviction under article of the puerto rico controlled substances act,laws tit,is not a controlled substance offense in regards to the guideline section.specifically,román asserted that not all offense s under article meet b definition of a controlled substance offense thus,román contended that his total offense level should be twelve not seventeen as the psr and his plea agreement recommended.
the district court held a sentencing hearing the next day,and román affirmed that he reinstate d this objection to the total offense level of seventeen.the government responded that under a modified categorical approach the district court could examine if there are existing documents that allow us to determine whether román particular violation of article was a controlled substance offense.the district court then stated that it had the document here which has the legal basis.according to the district court,that document indicate d that the charges were for violation of a rticle that entails distribution of a controlled substance but were reduced to a violation of a rticle.the district court further explained that the description in this criminal complaint entails and encompasses the possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance.the district court then stated that the offense charged meets the definition of a controlled substance offense.when román asserted that the document s that the court can examine are limited,the district court replied that it had exercise d its due diligence in terms of checking that we had the proper documents.
the document the district court relied on was never entered into the record,and so it is not available to us on appeal.the parties agree,and it is clear from the record,however,that the document was in spanish.
during the argument concerning the proper calculation of román total offense level,the government opposed román arguments on the merits.it never objected,either in writing or at the hearing,to román untimely objection to the psr.after román presented his mitigating facts,the government recommended a sentence at the lower end of the guidelines recommended range.
after the exchange concerning the nature of the controlled substance offense,román ask ed the court to follow the joint recommendation and impose a sentence of months.the district court ultimately sentenced román to months imprisonment,highlighting the fact that román had fired his gun into the air while driving a vehicle in a city,reflecting a blatant disregard for the law and public safety.
román timely appealed his sentence.he argues that the district court committed a procedural error when it determined that román prior conviction was a controlled substance offense under a a,committed plain error by relying on an untranslated spanish document,committed a procedural error by failing to justify its upward variance,and imposed a sentence that was substantively unreasonable.
ii.analysis 
a.the english language requirement and the standard of review 
the jones act requires that a ll pleadings and proceedings in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico be conducted in the english language.it is clear,to the point of perfect transparency,that federal court proceedings must be conducted in english.united states,cir.quoting united states,cir.this rule applies to all stages of a federal court proceeding,including a sentencing hearing id.
román concedes that he did not object to the district court use of the untranslated document.the parties therefore assume that the plain error standard of review applies.they are incorrect.in,the defendants attorney did not object to the presentation of spanish and documents to the jury and in fact objected to an english translation it considered faulty.at.we rejected the government argument that the plain error standard applied,holding that the district court had an independent duty to ensure the proceedings were conducted in english,and so we relieve d the parties of their usual duty to contemporaneously object.id.at.instead,we held that violations of the english language requirement will constitute reversible error whenever the appellant can demonstrate that the untranslated evidence has the potential to affect the disposition of an issue raised on appeal.id.at.we reaffirmed this standard of review in,rejecting the government assertion that we had confined to its facts and declining to follow any opinions that implied a different standard,at.we will therefore overturn román sentence if the untranslated document has the potential to affect the disposition of his appeal id.at.
román did not waive his objection to the calculation of his total offense level 
we must first address the government contention that román knowingly waived his objection to the calculation of his total offense level.waiver,where it occurs,is treated as an intentional,and therefore permanent,abandonment of a position.united states,cir.citing united states walker,cir.a waived issue ordinarily can not be resurrected on appeal.united states rodríguez,cir.by contrast,a mere failure to object forfeits a claim,so review on appeal is generally only for plain error,at.if román waived his objection to his calculated total offense level of seventeen,the district court use of the untranslated document which related only to that calculation can not affect the disposition of his appeal.
the government identifies three ways in which román waived his objection first,by stipulating to the calculation in the plea agreement second,by failing to file a written objection to the psr until the day before the sentencing hearing and third,by acquiescing at the sentencing hearing.the government did not raise román stipulation or untimely objection before the district court,however,and instead addres
