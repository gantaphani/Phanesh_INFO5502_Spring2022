in,carey gonyer began sexually abusing a boy,tt,who worked alongside him at a dairy farm.the following year,at gonyer urging,tt who had,in the interim,turned sixteen took photographs of his own genitals and gave the pictures to gonyer.based on these photographs,gonyer was charged with three counts of sexual exploitation of a child,in violation of a and,and one count of possession of child pornography,in violation of a b and a.
the case proceeded to trial,where the district court,over gonyer objection,permitted the prosecution to elicit testimony about gonyer sexual abuse of tt.the jury convicted gonyer on all four counts.at sentencing,the district court applied several sentencing guideline enhancements,based on tt age at the time his relationship with gonyer began,the fact that gonyer offenses included a sexual act or contact,and gonyer supervisory control over tt,see b,resulting in a sentence of months imprisonment.gonyer appeals both his conviction and sentence.because the sexual abuse evidence was admissible under federal rule of evidence b to,among other things,establish gonyer motive for the offenses and show that his possession of the photographs of tt was not a matter of mistake or accident,and because the sentencing enhancements were permissible under guidelines b,we affirm.
background 
in,gonyer,who was years old,resided in an apartment at the dairy farm where he was employed as a farmhand in the spring of that year,tt,a boy who lived nearby,began working on the farm as well,helping gonyer to clean animal pens,feed and milk the cows,and perform various other chores.tt had not previously done this kind of work,and gonyer taught him what to do.
at first,because school was still in session,tt worked at the farm only on weekends.after school let out for the summer,tt began working at the farm every day.gonyer supervised tt work,and frequently tendered his paycheck.tt also began spending time with gonyer outside of work.the two would drive to a nearby city,where gonyer would buy tt gifts including a stereo,a gun,clothing,cigarettes,and a dvd of adult pornography.they also spent time together watching television in gonyer apartment.
about a month after tt began working at the farm,he spent the night at gonyer apartment because he anticipated having to awaken early the next morning to milk the cows.the two began the evening watching television,per usual,but at some point gonyer suggested that they watch a dvd of adult pornography.while watching this dvd,gonyer began touching tt genitals this contact eventually led to anal intercourse.over the next several months,tt spent most nights at gonyer apartment,and gonyer regularly engaged in sexual acts with tt.
when fall came,tt returned to school and only worked at the farm on weekends,until winter,when the amount of work at the farm dwindled.while tt was not working at the farm,gonyer remained in touch with him via cellular phone.gonyer and tt would exchange text messages,some of which were sexual in nature.the following summer,following his sixteenth birthday,tt began working on the farm on a basis again,and gonyer resumed sexually abusing him.
gonyer and tt continued one another.on three different occasions in the summer and fall of,gonyer requested that tt take a picture of his own penis and send it,via cell phone,to gonyer.tt complied.on another occasion,while tt and gonyer were working on a piece of machinery at the farm,gonyer asked tt to take a picture of tt penis using gonyer phone.tt again complied,retreating to the farmhouse cellar to complete the task while gonyer remained outside.
gonyer sexual abuse of tt,and the photographs tt had taken at gonyer urging,were discovered later in,when tt divulged the abuse to his school guidance counselor.a grand jury returned an indictment charging gonyer with the aforementioned counts of child sexual exploitation and possession of child pornography.gonyer pleaded not guilty.
on the eve of trial,gonyer moved in limine to preclude tt from testifying to gonyer acts of sexual abuse.conceding that testimony regarding the abuse was potentially relevant under rule b of the federal rules of evidence to show motive,plan or intent,gonyer argued that it was nonetheless inadmissible under rule because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.the following day,before the prosecution had responded,the district court denied the motion on the record at an conference,reasoning that tt testimony regarding the sexual abuse would establish that gonyer alleged conduct in enticing tt to take the photographs was not a matter of mistake or accident,and that any prejudice to gonyer from the admission of this testimony could be cured by instructing the jury that it could not treat gonyer prior abuse of tt as character evidence.in its jury charge at the close of the case,the court gave just such an instruction,cautioning the jury that it could not use evidence of the abuse to infer that gonyer had committed the offenses with which he was charged.
after about three hours of deliberations,the jury convicted gonyer of all four counts.following the conviction,the probation office prepared a presentence investigation report psr for gonyer.as is relevant here,for the three counts of sexual exploitation of a child,the psr recommended a increase to the base offense level of because tt was fifteen years old when his relationship with gonyer began,see b b another increase because gonyer had engaged in oral and anal sex with tt,see id.b a and a third increase because tt had been in gonyer care,custody,or control,see id.b gonyer objected to these increases in a sentencing memorandum,which argued that the enhancements were unwarranted because the pictures gonyer had persuaded tt to take did not depict any sexual acts,and because tt was sixteen and not spending the night at gonyer home or in his direct care when they were taken.
the district court rejected these arguments.it concluded that gonyer conduct with tt beginning when the boy was fifteen,including the sexual abuse,was a part of the grooming process that persuaded or induced tt to take the photos,warranting enhancements under b b and b a.the court further noted that gonyer was effectively tt supervisor at the farm,which was the location where the acts of abuse occurred and where one of the pictures was taken,warranting,in the court view,application of b.the result of these and other sentencing enhancements not questioned here was a total offense level of,which,when coupled with gonyer criminal history category of iii,yielded an advisory guidelines sentence of life imprisonment.using this as its starting point,the court imposed the prosecution recommended sentence of months imprisonment.
ii.the conviction 
in contesting his conviction,gonyer raises a single challenge,asserting that the district court erred by permitting tt to testify to gonyer sexual abuse under federal rules of evidence b and.the familiar language of rule b prohibits the use of a person other acts to prove a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.in other words,as this court has previously explained,the rule prohibits the prosecution from introducing evidence that is extrinsic to the crime charged solely for the purpose of showing villainous propensity.united states roszkowski,cir.rule b nonetheless permits such evidence to be used if it has special relevance,that is,if it is relevant for another purpose,such as proving motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident.even if evidence of prior acts has such special relevance,however,that is not the end of the inquiry the evidence may still be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.gonyer attacks both the district court conclusion that evidence of his prior sexual abuse of tt had special relevance and the court determination that the danger of unfair prejudice from that evidence did not substantially outweigh its probative value.
before proceeding to the merits of gonyer arguments,we pause to address a threshold issue concerning the standard to employ when reviewing the district court evidentiary rulings.gonyer acknowledges that historically,this court has reviewed the admission of prior bad acts evidence under rules b and for abuse of discretion.see,united states doe,cir.he argues,however,that in so doing,we are in the minority,and urges us to reconsider our position and to apply the standard of review espoused in united states clay,cir.as the court of appeals for the sixth circuit explained in that case,its approach involves an initial,review of the district court determination that other acts took place a de novo review of the determination that the acts had special relevance under rule b and,finally,review of the determination that the evidence probative value outweighs its unfairly prejudicial impact.see id.at.
the proposition that this panel would be free to adopt clay approach if so inclined is a doubtful one,at best.it is well settled that a panel of this court may not depart from the precedent established by prior panel decisions absent some compelling reason,usually an intervening decision of the supreme court or an en banc sitting of this court.see united states troy,cir.gonyer has identified no such reason.
even if he had done so,moreover,gonyer did not contest the special relevance of evidence regarding the sexual abuse before the district court.rather,as discussed in the preceding section,he in fact conceded that such evidence was potentially relevant under rule b,and instead chose to argue that it was unduly prejudicial and should thus be excluded under rule.gonyer claim that the district court erred in concluding that the evidence had special relevance is,at a minimum,forfeited,so that we review the district court determination of the evidence relevance under rule b only for plain error,see puckett united states,united states reed,cir,while still reviewing its rule determination for abuse of discretion.we find neither.
we turn first to the rule b determination.under the circumstances presented in this case,tt testimony about his abuse at gonyer hands plainly had special relevance apart from establishing gonyer propensity to commit sexual crimes against minors.we have previously remarked that evidence should not be examined in isolation,but in its particular factual setting,and that,under rule b,e vidence of prior conduct is admissible to complete the story of the crime on trial by proving its immediate context of happenings near in time and place.united states,cir quoting weinstein evidence,at see also united states dworken,cir evidence of other criminal acts is admissible when it is so blended or connected with the one on trial as that proof of one incidentally involves the other or explains the circumstances thereof.quotation marks and alterations omitted emphasis in original.that holding applies here,where the prior acts of abuse and the charged conduct involved the same victim and same perpetrator,and occurred within more or less the same period of time.evidence of the abuse provided critical context about gonyer relationship with tt.
by far the most critical aspect of that context is that it establishes gonyer motive for the charged offenses.gonyer suggests that the prosecution could have made its case against him without evidence that he sexually abused tt.maybe so.but had the prosecution not introduced that evidence,the jury would have been presented with an incomplete picture of why gonyer would ask tt to take and send pornographic photographs,and,for that matter,why tt would acquiesce to such a request.tt testimony regarding the abuse provided the answers gonyer was sexually attracted to tt,as evidenced by his prior sexual abuse of the child,and,due to that abusive relationship,tt was predisposed to honoring such a request.along the same lines,tt testimony regarding the abuse also served to dispel any suggestion that tt took explicit photographs of his own initiative and sent them to gonyer phone without having been solicited to do so.in this fashion,evidence of the abuse helped establish that gonyer possession of the photographs was not a matter of mistake or accident on his part as the district court specifically noted.
although gonyer argues otherwise,the use of the evidence for those purposes is not equivalent to using it to show that he was predisposed to committing sexual acts involving minors.rather,it served to avoid creating the inaccurate impression that,prior to the time of the offenses,gonyer and tt had been nothing more than coworkers and friends.we find no error,plain or otherwise,in the district court determination that evidence of gonyer abuse of tt had special relevance 
nor can we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the danger of unfair prejudice from the evidence did not outweigh its probative value.a district court weighing of the positive and negative effects of specific evidence demands considerable respect,especially when,as in this case,limiting instructions were deftly and timely deployed.united states ladd,cir.it is only in rare and extraordinarily compelling circumstances that we will,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weight of probative value and unfair effect.id.the probative value of the evidence was high as noted,it provided necessary context that helped explain the relationship between gonyer and tt,established their motives for acting as they did,and undermined the possible inference that gonyer possession of the offending images was the result of happenstance,accident,or mistake.even grisly evidence including evidence of homicides has been admitted because it possessed such contextual significance.id.citing real hogan,cir united states moreno morales,cir.
it is undoubtedly true that evidence of gonyer sexual abuse of tt could have produced emotional reactions in some members of the jury.but rule does not ensure that trials even criminal trials will be antiseptic affairs.united states mehanna,cir.the district court took pains to negate the danger that the jury would use the evidence for improper purposes,giving a powerful limiting instruction that thrice admonished the jury that it should not use evidence of gonyer prior acts of sexual abuse against tt to infer that he had also committed the acts for which he was on trial an instruction we presume the jury followed.see united states bucci,cir.and throughout the trial,the district court was sensitive to the danger of unfair prejudice,and acted with care to ensure that the jury would not be exposed to material that could taint its verdict.among other things,the court forbade the prosecution from presenting evidence of accusations of sexual abuse that other minors had leveled against gonyer including an occasion on which gonyer allegedly urged another minor to take photographs of his own buttocks and send them to gonyer,citing rules and b as the basis for its rulings.we see no reason to believe,on this record,that the district court abused its discretion in ruling that the unfairly prejudicial effect of tt testimony about gonyer abuse did not substantially outweigh its probative value.
iii.the sentence 
again,the district court applied three enhancements to b base offense level of for sexual exploitation of a enhancement for tt age,another for the inclusion of a sexual act or contact in the offense,and a third for gonyer supervisory control over tt.gonyer contends that the district court erred in applying each of these enhancements.we review the district court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo,and its underlying factual findings for clear error.see,united states batchu,cir.for the reasons discussed below,we find no error in the district court application of any of the three enhancements.
age of the victim 
guidelines section b b provides for a enhancement i f the offense involved a minor who had attained the age of twelve years but not attained the age of sixteen years.the district court acknowledged that tt was sixteen years old when he took the photographs that prompted the charges against gonyer.the court noted,however,that to prove the charges of sexual exploitation of which gonyer was convicted,the prosecution was required to show that gonyer employed,used,persuaded,induced,enticed,or coerced tt to engage in the sexually explicit conduct depicted in the photographs,see a,and concluded that the process of enticement took place over the year preceding the time that the photographs were taken,beginning when tt was fifteen years old.the court then explained that it would apply the enhancement b ased on its analysis of the statute.
on appeal,the parties have bid adieu to the district court reasoning.whereas,as just discussed,the district court appears to have relied primarily upon the notion that gonyer conduct with tt when the boy was fifteen was part and parcel of the offense of conviction as defined by the statute,gonyer proceeds upon the assumption that the court application of the enhancement depended upon a conclusion that this conduct was relevant conduct within the meaning of.a a,which permits a sentencing court to consider all acts and omissions committed,aided,abetted,counseled,commanded,induced,procured,or willfully caused by the defendant that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction,in preparation for that offense,or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense when determining specific offense characteristics.the government takes the bait and runs with it,seeking to defend that conclusion.we are not inclined to follow suit.
as just noted,in choosing to apply this enhancement,the district court quoted the language of a,which,in relevant part,provides for the punishment of a ny person who employs,uses,persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any minor to engage in any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct.it continued 
t he trial evidence is that the defendant befriended the victim when he was,bought him cigarettes,sneakers,a jacket,made trips to shop with him,showed him pornographic movies,and spent about a year grooming the victim,during which time he was sexually abusing him before the photographs were taken.
there no question,from my perspective,based on the testimony i heard,that the defendant viewed his gifts as a quid pro quo for sex from the victim.according to the victim testimony,in the defendant own very crude words,he told the victim,when he bought him a bb gun,that he would take it out on his ass.the defendant attempt to isolate the taking of the photographs from the relationship is unrealistic,from my perspective,and also contrary to the statute.
the victim here testified that it was the defendant who told him to take the photographs of his genitals,and the victim did so at his request.and turning this around in a different way,let just assume that the defendant had approached a year old boy without any relationship with that boy and demanded that that boy go into another room or text him and tell him to take a picture of his genitals.that simply would happen.so to take the photo the act of photography,the demand,and the photograph and the sending of the photographs as the crime,i do think is consistent with the a realistic understanding of what happened here.
further,the determination that he was when,in part,this when this crime began depends on or is consistent with the jury finding that the defendant,quote,employed,used persuaded,induced,or enticed enticed or coerced the victim.this process of persuasion began in the summer before the photographs were taken.that the charge.the charge is that the defendant persuaded or induced or enticed the victim in this case to produce the images.that process of enticement,what is sometimes referred to as grooming,is something that had taken place over the year preceding the time that the photographs were taken.
the emphasized portions of the district court remarks make clear that the court analysis relied upon the language of the statute,and that the court viewed the conduct as part of the offense of conviction itself.to be sure,after making these remarks,the district court then briefly mentioned,the relevant conduct guideline,and cited an eleventh circuit case that reached a similar conclusion based in part on its application of.see united states holt,appx,cir.viewing the district court references to in context,though,we are unable to view those references as anything more than an alternative justification for the court application of the enhancement.indeed,after referring to,the district court concluded its discussion of the enhancement by stating that it would apply the enhancement b ased on its analysis of the statute and the facts in the case emphasis added.and,when the court subsequently issued written findings affecting sentencing that cited provisions of the guidelines pervasively,those findings did not so much as mention,let alone discuss.
while it is an maxim that we are not wedded to the lower court rationale,shinderman,at,neither should we ignore that rationale simply because the parties have chosen to do so.we find it unnecessary to explore the precise contours of what qualifies as relevant conduct under,and affirm the district court application of the enhancement based upon its conclusion,just detailed,that gonyer conduct with tt when the boy was fifteen was part of the offense of conviction defined by the statute 
we turn to gonyer arguments,which,though they are directed at the district court alternative relevant conduct rationale,still have some applicability to the court primary offense of conviction rationale.gonyer argues that in order for.b b to apply to a defendant convicted of sexually exploiting a child,the minor must be between the ages of twelve and fifteen at the time a visual depiction of the minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct is produced.in other words,as gonyer puts it in his brief,he takes the position that the enhancement is a black or white question either the sexually explicit image involved a minor under the age of or it did not.we do not agree with this interpretation,and are aware of no binding authority to support it.
gonyer position results from a misunderstanding of the variant of the offense of sexual exploitation of a minor of which he was convicted,as defined by a.the statute does not simply criminalize the production of sexually explicit images of a minor.rather,as the district court noted,the statute prohibits employ ing,us ing,persuad ing,induc ing,entic ing,or coerc ing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of the conduct.a.indeed,to violate this section,it is not necessary that a visual depiction of the minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct actually results from the defendant actions only that the defendant intended that result.see united states smith,cir.it follows that the age of the minor at the time an image if any is produced is not of controlling relevance in deciding whether b b applies.
that,of course,begs the question what is relevant to this determination although gonyer himself has not done so,one might argue that because the offense is not fully realized until the minor has engaged in sexually explicit conduct,the minor age at the time of that conduct should control.but the minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct is only one element of the offense.for the defendant to be convicted,it is also necessary for the prosecution to establish that the defendant caused the minor to engage in that conduct.the acts with which the defendant caused the minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct whether they consist of persuasion,inducement,enticement,coercion,or some other thing are as integral a part of the offense as the conduct itself,so long as the defendant engaged in those acts with the purpose of producing a visual depiction of the conduct.when deciding whether the offense involved a minor of a certain age,then,a sentencing court is justified in taking into account the minor age at the time of those enticing or coercive acts.
the district court in this case did just that,and found that tt was under the age of sixtee
