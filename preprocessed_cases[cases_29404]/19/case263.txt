nelson pereira was convicted of conspiring to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute,and aiding and abetting others to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute,in violation of and a.on appeal,pereira contends that a new trial is warranted as a result of,inter alia,the prosecutor improper questioning that compelled him to comment on the veracity of two cooperating government witnesses,a problem that was exacerbated by improper judicial intervention in support of the prosecutor questions.for the reasons that follow,we vacate pereira conviction and remand for a new trial.
pereira does not challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction,and in such situations,there is a lack of clear consensus in this circuit whether to recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states,cir.because the manner of review of the facts would make no difference to this appeal,we elect to present them in a neutral and balanced way.
this case stems from a conspiracy to smuggle drugs from puerto rico into the continental united states.the government evidence established the following.a group led by wilfredo rodríguez conspired to transport drugs and proceeds in luggage onboard american airlines aa flights between san juan,puerto rico,and newark,new jersey.many of the were aa employees with baggage handling responsibilities and who had knowledge of airport security as well as access to nonpublic airport areas.rodríguez masterminded the scheme from puerto rico,while frank prats prats,an aa employee at newark liberty international airport,oversaw the newark side of the operation.
the scheme involved packaging drugs or drug proceeds inside suitcases,smuggling these suitcases aboard aa flights,and relaying the flight information and suitcase location to conspirators at the destination airport.these conspirators would then arrange for the suitcases unloading into the baggage claim area for pickup by other previously instructed conspirators.this conspiracy began sometime in and continued for a decade,until september,when authorities arrested and indicted numerous conspirators.these arrests subsequently yielded additional evidence against other individuals who were not initially indicted,including defendant pereira.
on march,pereira was indicted for conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of a,and for aiding and abetting possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute in violation of a and.
pereira,who worked at newark airport,was alleged to have participated in this conspiracy by orchestrating the baggage handling at newark to ensure that the drug suitcases were properly picked up upon arrival,by giving instructions to the making the pickups,and by stepping in for prats when he was unavailable to receive instructions and payments from rodríguez.
at trial,the primary evidence against pereira came from two cooperating government witnesses,gerardo torres and javier olmo.these individuals had previously pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy.torres role in the conspiracy was to receive money and make payments in puerto rico,to relay the flight and suitcase information from puerto rico to the newark conspirators prats and pereira once the flights had departed san juan,and,on a few occasions,to fly to newark with suitcases containing cocaine and to bring back suitcases containing money.olmo role in the conspiracy was to physically transport on his person drugs or monies onboard aa flights and to prepare the cocaine for shipments from san juan to newark.torres and olmo both testified that pereira was the man of prats who oversaw the newark operations,with a crucial role in the conspiracy to ensure the smooth pickup of the drug suitcases at newark,as well as providing and receiving instructions and payments to and from.torres testified specifically that pereira had once allowed him access to the aa locker room to exchange a bag of drug money.olmo testified specifically that pereira had warned a against picking up a drug suitcase on one occasion due to monitoring,and that pereira had traveled to puerto rico to meet with rodríguez to provide aa luggage tags for use in furtherance of this conspiracy.
beside the testimony of torres and olmo,the government sole evidence connecting pereira to the conspiracy was a piece of prats stationery containing pereira first name and phone number and evidence that pereira took an unusually short trip to puerto rico supporting an inference that it was in furtherance of the conspiracy rather than a vacation.the piece of paper was found during a search of rodríguez house and was used to link pereira to rodríguez.given the lack of other evidence,the credibility of torres and olmo was crucial to the government case.
during the trial,pereira testified in his own defense.he admitted knowing rodríguez and prats as fellow aa employees,but denied participating in a conspiracy with them.pereira also denied knowing torres or olmo,or undertaking the actions in furtherance of the conspiracy that they had attributed to him.pereira did admit to having taken a short trip to puerto rico as one of several such short vacations that he enjoyed as an aa employee who received free airfare and discounted hotel rates.
on,the prosecutor inquired into the stark discrepancy between pereira testimony and torres and olmo testimony.the central question is whether the prosecutor engaged in improper conduct when he repeatedly asked whether pereira thought torres or olmo had made up these allegations as a part of a setup.
on april,the jury found pereira guilty of c onspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine,and a iding and abetting in possession with intent to distribute five kilograms of cocaine,in violation of and a.def.add.on may,pereira was sentenced to months in federal detention,years of supervised release thereafter,and a monetary penalty of.
on appeal,pereira contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutorial questions about whether the cooperating government witness testimony was made up or was a part of a setup improperly compelled pereira to comment on torres and olmo veracity.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review preserved objections of prosecutorial misconduct for harmless error.united states carpenter,cir.under harmless error analysis,a new trial is unwarranted so long as we are able to conclude with a high degree of confidence that the alleged prosecutorial misconduct did not affect the outcome of the trial.united states smith,cir.
we first address whether the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by asking whether pereira thought torres and olmo had made up testimony against him as a part of a setup.at oral argument,the government agreed that by asking the defendant whether he thought he was being set up by the witness or whether he thought the witness made up testimony about the defendant,the prosecutor was effectively asking the defendant whether he thought the government witnesses were lying.see also united states,cir.holding that questions phrased in the form of making that up or inventing stories about you are equivalent to asking if the witness was lying.
over the past years,this court has consistently held that counsel should not ask one witness to comment on the veracity of the testimony of another witness.we expect that the office of the united states attorney will abide by the rule.united states sullivan,cir.citations and footnote omitted.other cases,utilizing similar language,also make the same point.see,united states thiongo,cir.this court has held it is improper for an attorney to ask a witness whether another witness lied on the stand.underlying this rule is the concept that credibility judgments are for the jury,not witnesses,to make.citation omitted united states akitoye,cir.i t is not the place of one witness to draw conclusions about,or cast aspersions upon,another witness veracity.the question framed by the prosecutor should never be posed.citations omitted.
this circuit is not alone in reaching this conclusion.m ost of the federal courts of appeals that have examined the propriety of questions posed to a criminal defendant about the credibility of government witnesses have found that such questions are improper.united states schmitz,cir.collecting cases such questions invade the province of the jury.id.at see also united states boyd,cir.holding that questions about whether another witness would make up testimony impermissibly infringes on the jury right to make credibility determinations.these types of questions are also improper because rule a of the federal rules of evidence does not permit a witness to testify that another witness was truthful or not on a specific occasion.schmitz,at.such questions also ignore other possible explanations for inconsistent testimony which put the testifying defendant in a situation of either accus ing another witness of lying or undermin ing his or her own version of events.id.at.finally,these questions are argumentative,and often their primary purpose is to make the defendant appear accusatory.id.the danger is that the prosecutor first forces the defendant to label government witnesses as liars who are making up stories,and then,after laying this groundwork,seeks to convince the jury that it is the accusatory defendant and not the prosecution witnesses who is unworthy of belief.
in united states desimone,cir,this court clarified that although 
i t is improper for an attorney to ask a witness whether another witness lied on the stand,i t is not improper to ask one witness whether another was wrong or mistaken,since such questions do not force a witness to choose between conceding the point or branding another witness as a liar.there is no error in simply asking a witness if he agreed with or disputed another witness testimony.
id.at citations and quotation marks omitted see also united states wallace,cir.same thiongo,at same.
against this background,pereira contends that by compelling him to comment on torres and olmo veracity,each instance of prosecutorial misconduct was designed to,and did,unfairly undercut pereira credibility and bolster that of torres and olmo.appellant br.he also argues that,under the doctrine,see united states sepulveda,cir,the errors that occurred at his trial are sufficiently serious in the aggregate to warrant a new trial even if they would not necessitate such relief if viewed individually.
we have excerpted and numbered the relevant question sets below in chronological order.while the excerpts from the testimony are lengthy,setting them out in full provides the necessary context.
set of the prosecutor questions related to pereira denial of any knowledge of or connection to torres.the prosecutor asked,on,why,if that was the case,torres would have had a photograph of pereira as torres had earlier testified.ja.
do you have any idea why gerardo torres would have this picture of you do you have any idea 
i ca answer why,but i can answer how.he went to my facebook account,and that my profile picture.
my question is do you have any idea why gerardo torres would be going to your facebook page do you know why 
defense your honor,this is calling for speculation.the witness is not here.he asking for what the other person thought,what the other person wanted.that beyond the direct.
court i do think it beyond the direct.i allow the question.
do you do you have think sic idea why gerardo torres would be going to your facebook page and getting your photo off your page 
defense that calling for speculation,your honor,do you have any idea that an improper question.
do you know why 
court do you know 
a.the only reason why is probably to set me up.
q.so he set you up 
okay.and he set you up back in prior to your arrest in this case right 
q.so it was part of an elaborate plan to set you up right 
i can not answer for him.
q.but you have no idea why gerardo torres would have gotten your photo other than to set you up right 
defense objection,your honor.it calling also for speculation.what ideas 
court he already said it was to set him up.overruled.
court other than that reason,there no other reason why torres would get your picture off facebook.that the question.that you know of.
i do know what he was thinking.
set related to torres testimony that his interactions with pereira during the conspiracy entailed calling pereira about the flight information for the smuggled drug suitcases,and that pereira was prats trusted helper in handling the drug suitcases.ja.
q.during the years to,you never received a call from gerardo torres pertaining to suitcases full of drugs.correct that your testimony 
that correct.
q.so this was part of torres setting you up when he testified about that 
i ca answer for him.
q.you heard him testify about that,did you 
yes.he was telling the truth.
okay.and when he testified that you were one of the people that franklin pratts sic put in charge of the whole suitcases bringing them to the carrousel,that was true either right that your testimony 
a i not understanding what the question is.
q.so the statement that he was the one who arranged the job and put people he could trust in charge of the job,you being one of them that not true right 
a.he also said i was downstairs picking up the bags,and then he also said i was upstairs helping him with the bags.
q.so that ca be true can it right 
a.you ca be in two places at the same time.
and so the statement that you were one of frank pratts sic trusted people who could handle the suitcases full of drugs that was a true statement right 
a.that was not a true statement.
q.that was not a true statement because you were not one of frank pratts sic trusted people,were you 
no.i guess i was one of his trusted people.
and you were always outside to help the person pick up the suitcase then.right that was another statement of gerardo torres.that was true at all,was it 
a.the only way i could be outside picking up bags was if there was a crew chief that would allow me to get away from my assigned work so i could go upstairs and help somebody pick up bags.
set related to torres testimony that,to help ensure smooth pickups of the drug suitcases,pereira would meet picking up the suitcases at the baggage carousel to provide further instructions.ja.
because you did know gerardo torres,the fact that he met you,frank pratts sic that never happened either right 
no.it did not happen.
q.so that not correct then.that was another thing that torres made up right 
defense your honor,questions as to what gerardo torres made up or did make up,it like bringing something out.
court overruled.
that something else that gerardo torres made up and put against you.
yes.it a good story,but it did happen.
set related to torres testimony that on one occasion,in furtherance of the conspiracy,pereira allowed torres and camacho inside an aa locker room to exchange a bag of drug money to be smuggled to puerto rico.ja.
q.if gerardo torres said that you were with gerardo and camacho,once again,that another thing he making up against you right right 
can i explain that one,sir 
is it something he making up against you 
court is he making that up the question is if torres said that you were with him and camacho,whether that true or not.
a.that was the question he asked me.but no,that not true.
q b ut you never seen carlos camacho before until you got to court right 
correct.i never met carlos camacho.
q.so that something he made up right 
you answering your own question.
no.i asking you what the question is.
court let not get into an argument here.the question is if that something that torres made up.
defense but he is not the person to say that torres made it up or not.he is not torres.
court overruled.if it not true,then it something torres made up.
correct.it a lie.
set related to olmo testimony that pereira was part of the conspiracy.ja.
q.so javier olmo you were also present for his testimony,sir 
and once again,is he also involved in the same setup as gerardo torres against you 
i ca say what they 
defense objection,your honor.we objecting to the setup.that improper.we do know what they did,but it proper sic saying they were set up.
prosecution i using his own words,your honor.
court he using the witness own language.i think the witness understands what he means.
defense your honor,this is testimony as to olmo.
prosecution i asking him.
court yes.he said it about torres.now the question is about olmo,whether what olmo said was trying to get at you.do you know that 
i do personally know that.
set related to olmo testimony that prats and pereira were known as catchers among the conspirators because they were the ones who would receive and unload the drugs off the airplanes.ja.
q w hen javier olmo described you and frank pratts sic as catchers do you remember when he testified about that 
and once again,that was something he made up right with regard to you.
yes.he made that up.
set related to olmo testimony that pereira was the for prats when prats was absent,in delivering and receiving drugs and payments in furtherance of the conspiracy.ja.
and so when javier olmo said that you would be the deliverer of large payments in cash when frank pratts sic was around,that something he made up right 
defense that an improper question.
court overruled.
and javier olmo said that you would be the person to deliver large amounts of cash from drugs,that was something he made up about you right you did do that right you did deliver money to anybody who was a member of this organization.
i did not do that.
finally,set of the prosecutor questions related to olmo testimony that pereira activities in the conspiracy included delivering drug monies,communicating directly with rodríguez,and once tipping off a about monitoring of a drug suitcase.ja.
and these are all things that javier olmo,if he said,would have had to have been made up.
the government argues that a lthough defense counsel objected to some of the questions at issue as allegedly speculative,defense did not argue as pereira does on appeal that the question s violated the general rule proscribing a lawyer from asking a witness whether another witness was lying.thus,this objection did not preserve pereira argument on appeal.appellee br.citation omitted.
we disagree with the government that such objections did not preserve this ground for appeal at least as to question sets.
with respect to question set,as we discuss below in section d,we do not decide whether the questions were improper due to the defendant having used the setup language in the first instance.under these circumstances,we need not address whether pereira preserved an objection.with respect to question set,there were no proper objections,thus making the error unpreserved.
in question set,the defense objected that your honor,questions as to what gerardo torres made up or did make up,it like bringing something out.ja.the objection focused on what gerardo torres made up or did make up,which identified the problem with the prosecutor questions.moreover,the context of earlier objections in question set,particularly the objection your honor,this is calling for speculation.the witness is not here.he asking for what the other person thought,what the other person wanted,ja,provided context that the defendant was objecting in question set based on speculation.
with respect to question sets and,the objections were explicit.in question set,the defense objected but he is not the person to say that torres made it up or not.he is not torres.ja.in question set,the defense objected objection,your honor.we objecting to the setup.that improper.we do know what they did,but it proper sic saying they were set up.ja.it is clear that these objections are on the grounds that pereira should not be required to speculate as to whether other witnesses are making up testimony or setting him up.
in question set,the defense objected t hat an improper question.ja.it is clear from earlier objections and the context that this was in response to a make up question.
finally,the defense did not object during question sets and after counsel had repeatedly objected to similar questions earlier in the examination.the court must have realized the prior objections applicability as covering the entire testimony on the issue,and the defense undoubtedly felt that further objection would be futile at this point.united states elkins,cir.therefore,having objected repeatedly to setup and made up questions in these instances during,we conclude that the defense counsel sufficiently preserved an objection based on speculation for question sets,and.
as for the sufficiency of the speculation ground for objection,the very rationale for the rule is that witness credibility judgments are for the jury,not witnesses,to make.thiongo,at.objections that the questions asked for speculation about other witnesses,or that pereira is not the person to say that torres made it up or not,ja,fit precisely within the heart of the rule rationale.we agree that such objections suffice because the defense demonstrate d that the ground for the objection was obvious from the context in which it was made.boyd,at see also elkins,at recognizing that when a court realizes that an objection covers the entire testimony,further objections are unnecessary.
we next consider whether the questions in sets were improper.each of these six sets contains questions that effectively asked pereira whether he thought torres or olmo was lying seven times in questioning the witness about torres testimony and six times in questioning the witness about olmo testimony including the questions posed by the court.the government does not dispute that these questions violated the general rule prohibiting a prosecutor from asking a witness whether another witness was lying,and the government could hardly argue otherwise.
the prosecutor improper questions were further exacerbated by judicial intervention that compelled pereira to answer for example,with respect to the issue of whether pereira had ever met camacho,the court interjected and asked directly the question is if that something that torres made up.ja.the court went on to further rephrase if it not true,then it something torres made up.ja.in another example,the court expanded the prosecutor setup questions about torres to be used in the questions about olmo.when the defense counsel objected,the court overruled,reasoning that y es,h e said it about torres.now the question is about olmo,whether what olmo said was trying to get at you.do you know that ja.instead of sustaining objections to improper prosecutorial questioning or issuing curative instructions,judicial intervention here seemed to have reinforced the prosecutorial misconduct.
in response,the government makes two arguments as to why this general rule should be inapplicable here.
first,the government argues that pereira himself opened the door to these setup questions during the cross examination.this may have merit with respect to set,where the government asked why torres would go into pereira facebook page and obtain his photo,and the defendant answered without inducement that the reason was probably to set me up.ja the problem is that with respect to question sets and,the government seized upon pereira answers in question set,and veered into asking the witness similar questions about other subjects of torres testimony as to which pereira had not suggested a setup motivation.
moreover,even if we were to agree with the government that pereira himself opened the door to the prosecutor questions by freely testifying that torres set him up,appellee br,as to the questions concerning torres testimony,the government certainly engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when it followed up during question sets,and,asking whether the other government cooperating witness olmo also made up testimony as a part of a setup.with respect to olmo,the government conceded that the defendant did not introduce any answers on his own that would justify such questions.see oral arg.agreeing that t he defendant did open up that line of questioning as to olmo.we therefore reject the government argument that the extension of testimony after set was permissible because pereira had opened the door.
second,the government argues that because pereira and the cooperating government witnesses gave directly contradictory testimony,this left open only the suggestion that torres and olmo were making up stories,rather than an interpretation that torres and olmo simply spoke out of mistake or hazy recollection.appellee br.thus,according to the government,because of the clear conflict,it was proper for the prosecution to ask the defendant whether the government witnesses were lying.the government relies on two state law cases,state hart,and people overlee,app.div,to support its proposed rule that where there exists a direct contradiction in testimony,this justifies asking whether another witness is lying.we decline to follow these cases.our reasons are several.
the government does not call to our attention any federal cases that hold that a direct conflict in witness testimony renders questions appropriate.quite the contrary,this court and other circuits have clearly held that such questions are improper in situations where witness testimony did directly conflict.for example,in sullivan,we held the following exchange to be improper 
q so,i take it you would deny that you ever stated to witness that you wished you did have so many people involved in the robbery 
a i certainly do,yes.
q i take it that,when witness testified to that,you would say he was lying i take it you would say that that was a lie,that you never said anything like that.
a you take that correctly,yes.
sullivan.at.similarly,in united states fernandez,cir,we held the following exchange to be improper 
q you showed the agent a roll of money you had in your pocket,did you,sir 
a no,negative.
q so,witness who testified yesterday,he lying 
a i do know why he said that,but i did not show it.
q sir,you did state that that place was full of customs agents,did you 
a god,i have said anything like that.
q so,witness who testified yesterday that you said that is lying,right so witness is making all that up,right,sir 
a i do know what i could say.i did say anything as to that matter.
id.at second alteration in original.
in united states boyd,cir,the defendant testified that he never held a bag of cocaine in his possession while two government witnesses testified that he did,which prompted the prosecutor to ask the defendant why the government witnesses would be making this up.id.at.in united states harris,cir,the prosecutor restated various assertions of police witnesses that directly contradicted harris s testimony and then asked harris if it was his testimony that the police witnesses were lying.id.at.and in united states combs,cir,the government witness testified that the defendant had stated that he manufactured methamphetamine,while the defendant denied making this statement,which prompted the prosecutor to ask the defendant if he thought the government witness was lying in his testimony.id.at.in each of these exchanges,there was certainly a direct contradiction between two witnesses,and in each instance,the questioning was held to be improper.
even where there is a direct conflict between a defendant testimony and a government witness testimony,asking if one of these witnesses is lying still runs counter to important policies of the rule.one of the policies behind this prohibition is to not force a witness to choose between conceding the point or branding another witness as a liar.united states gaines,cir.such accusatory answers,if required,would put a defendant in a disadvantageous position in front of the jury.
the very structure of the question is designed to pit the testifying witness against every other adverse witness,suggesting to the jury that someone is deliberately deceiving the court t he questions prejudicially force the testifying defendant to accuse or not.even worse,the defendant answer often does not matter because the predomina nt purpose of such questions is to make the defendant look bad.
schmitz,at.another policy behind prohibiting such questions is because they seek an answer beyond the personal knowledge of the witness.id.at.a witness would lack personal knowledge of whether another is intentionally seeking to mislead the tribunal,harris,at,regardless of whether his or her testimony is in conflict with the other witness.therefore,where there is a direct conflict in testimony,important policies behind this rule are still implicated.
finally,restricting the government from asking questions does not unreasonably impair the government ability to question a witness fully.we recognize that it is often necessary on to focus a witness on the differences and similarities between his testimony and that of another witness,and this is proper if the defendant is not asked to testify as to the veracity of the other witness.schmitz,at quoting harris,at.the objective of highlighting the conflict can be achieved by a sking a witness whether a previous witness who gave conflicting testimony is mistaken,to highlight the objective conflict without requiring the witness to condemn the prior witness as a purveyor of deliberate falsehood,a liar.united states gaind,cir.for example,in gaines,when the government witnesses identified the defendant as the drug dealer but the defendant denied these allegations a direct contradiction this court approved of questions where t he prosecutor did not ask the witness whether he believed the others had lied.instead,he asked whether the other witnesses were wrong,rather than lying.at.
we conclude that the government questions in this case in sets were both extensive and improper.in these circumstances,we do not have to consider whether question set was improper or whether question set constituted plain error.w hen there are both preserved and unpreserved errors,analysis should proceed as follows first,the preserved errors should be considered as a group under review.if,cumulatively,they are not harmless,reversal is required.united states caraway,cir.as we now discuss,the preserved errors were not harmless.
that this rule was violated by the prosecution is not the end of the analysis.the next question is whether the violation of the rule was harmless.sullivan,at.in deciding whether a new trial is required because of prosecutorial misconduct,we consider the severity of the misconduct,whether it was deliberate or accidental,the likely effect of the curative instruction,and the strength of the evidence against the appellants.united states cox,cir.see also sepulveda,at holding that harmless error analysis is a inquiry considering,among other things,the centrality of the tainted material,its uniqueness,its prejudicial impact,the uses to which it was put during the trial,and the relative strengths of the parties cases.
here,the repeated and numerous occasions in which the prosecutor engaged in these questions were surely deliberate.so too the prosecutor repeated setup questions constituted severe misconduct when coupled with judicial intervention that significantly exacerbated the misconduct as discussed further below.there were no curative instructions for any of the improper questions.nor was there substantial untainted evidence against pereira.
in assessing the strength of the evidence,we look at the record excluding the improper questions and the testimony generated by those questions.see,fernandez,at holding that m uch of the case against fernandez rested on undisputed evidence not generated by the improper questions,and concluding that g iven the strength of the government case,it stretches credulity to believe that the improper questions affected the outcome of the trial.excluding the improper questions and the testimony generated by those questions,the case against pereira was largely dependent precisely on the assessment of pereira credibility versus the credibility of torres and olmo.the testimony of torres and olmo,moreover,had little substance,and the circumstances presented a basis to infer that they had a reason to lie.the testimony of torres and olmo was essential and primary to the government case.beside their testimony,the only other evidence against pereira was a piece of prats stationery found at rodríguez house containing pereira first name and phone number and the fact that pereira took an unusually short trip to puerto rico.there was no other evidence that could support a conviction.in short,this was a case in which we can not conclude with a high degree of confidence that the improper questions and the testimony generated by those questions had no effect on the jury assessment of the credibility battle between pereira and the prosecution witnesses.in the context of such a case,which hinged on the outcome of a swearing contest that would well have been affected by improper questions,it is difficult to see how the improper questions in sets could be harmless error under the prevailing test.
nevertheless,relying on sullivan,the government recycles the argument that the prosecutor questions here only made clear to the jury that the opposing witness testimony was directly contradictory.
in sullivan,the government primarily relied on testimony from two cooperating witnesses who had participated in a robbery with the defendant to convict sullivan of armed robbery.at.at trial,a secondary government witness testified that the defendant had made a tangential remark about the robbery,which sullivan denied having said,prompting the prosecutor to ask whether sullivan thought the witness was lying.id.at.this court held that the question was improper but harmless,because there were a total of six witnesses who testified against the defendant and the improper question only pertained to a single tangential remark made by a secondary witness,which made the court conclude that the error was on a minor point.id.at see also united states moreland,cir.holding that two witnesses were peripheral witnesses because they testified regarding matters of minor importance to the case.while sullivan mentioned in passing that it was obvious that there was a contradiction between the government witness testimony and the defense testimony,at,sullivan can not be read to suggest that in every case the existence of directly contradictory testimony renders the questions harmless.
the government also relied on two other cases,fernandez,at,and united states robinson,cir,which contained improper questions that were reviewed under a plain error standard.in plain error review,the standard for finding an error harmless is less demanding,at least in the sense that the defendant bears the burden of showing prejudice.united states olano,holding that the important difference between plain error review and harmless error review is that,in the former,i t is the defendant rather than the government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice see also united states,cir.holding that the main practical difference between the two standards is that plain error requires not only an error affecting substantial rights but also a finding by the reviewing court that the error has seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings alteration in original quotation marks omitted.
like sullivan,fernandez is clearly distinguishable because the court emphasized the other strong government evidence linking the defendant to his crimes.moreover,the questions were limited in number and scope,and only pertained to tangential,corroborated testimony.at.robinson also held that such questioning was harmless.at.the robinson court discussed the directly conflicting nature of the testimony in finding an absence of prejudice from these questions.id.at.however,like sullivan,robinson is distinguishable because the government had other strong evidence linking the defendant to the crime.furthermore,there were only two improper questions,they both pertained to tangential testimony,and an objection was sustained as to one of the two.see id.at.
desimone,not relied on by the government,is also distinguishable.there,the questions concerning whether prior witness testimony was false or untruthful were held to be in error but found to be harmless.at.while the court relied on the rationale that t here were obvious inconsistencies between desimone testimony and that of other witnesses which were apparent to the jury for finding harmless error,the untainted evidence against desimone was substantial,including evidence of flight to avoid prosecution,id.at.in fact,the desimone court cited prior case authority recognizing that the greater the weight of the other evidence against the defendant,the less likely it is that a given error swayed the jury.united states cudlitz,cir.
most important from a harmless error perspective,in none of these cases sullivan,fernandez,robinson,and desimone was the improper questioning nearly as extensive as it was here and in none of these cases did the district court participate in the improper questioning.
this case is far more similar to united states geston,cir,where even applying a plain error review,the ninth circuit held that permitting the prosecutor to ask defense witnesses whether they thought the government witnesses were lying was an error that required reversal.in geston,the case rested on conflicting testimony,in which four eyewitnesses testified for the government and two for the defense.id.at.the prosecutor asked the two defense witnesses whether they thought the government witnesses were lying.on appeal,the court held that it is reversible error for a witness to testify over objection whether a previous witness was telling the truth.id.at.the court went on to explain that t his case was a close one defendant fate hinged on resolution of the conflicting testimony presented by the parties.in a case where witness credibility was paramount,it was plain error for the court to allow the prosecutor to persist in asking witnesses to make improper comments upon the testimony of other witnesses.id.at citation omitted.
as we have discussed,witness credibility was also paramount in this trial.in his closing argument,the prosecutor emphasized the improper questioning by referring to the pretty elaborate setup,and telling the jury that if it believe s that setup,then it ca believe javier olmo,and ca believe gerardo torres.it that simple.add.the government itself recognized the core credibility contest on which the case against pereira hinged,and the important role that the setup questions played.
finally,and perhaps crucially,here,as in combs,the prejudicial effect of the improper questioning was compounded when the district judge placed upon it his imprimatur.at.in combs,the district court twice instructed the defendant to answer the prosecution question about the truthfulness of the government witness trial testimony.id.at.here,the district court was even more actively involved than in combs.for example,in question sets and,the court directly asked pereira over objection the improper questions that the prosecutor had been asking pereira.thus,the error of the improper prosecution questions was further exacerbated by judicial intervention.
