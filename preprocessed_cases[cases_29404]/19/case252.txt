in,a jury convicted jorge rivera of two counts of money laundering,in violation of and.he now appeals.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
makes it a felony to knowingly engage or attempt to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than and is derived from specified unlawful activity.a emphasis added.the statute goes on to define criminally derived property as follows any property constituting,or derived from,proceeds obtained from a criminal offense.id.f.
in,a federal indictment charged rivera with violating and,which punishes aiders and abettors as though they were principals.according to the indictment,rivera and several,aiding and abetting each other,did knowingly engage or attempt to engage in two transactions to purchase cars with criminally derived property of a value greater than and is derived from specified unlawful activity.
the indictment alleged that the two vehicle purchases occurred in september and may,respectively.the specified unlawful activity was a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by rosa castrillon,the daughter of rivera wife 
according to the indictment,in september,rivera and castrillon used criminally derived funds from castrillon fraudulent scheme to make a down payment of for a toyota sequoia sport utility vehicle.in addition,several months later,rivera again helped castrillon purchase a sport utility vehicle this time,a bmw by making a p ayment toward the vehicle purchase price of approximately with funds in excess of that were criminally derived from castrillon fraudulent scheme.
the indictment described castrillon fraudulent scheme as follows.castrillon would tell her victims,most of whom were friends and family members,that a large sum of money for which she was the ostensible beneficiary had been frozen in a local bank.castrillon would then request money to help release these frozen funds.the victims could not afford the large sums of money castrillon requested.she thus would either complete fraudulent loan applications on behalf of her victims or instruct them to take out loans themselves.castrillon would then take the cash from those loans.all told,castrillon defrauded her victims out of millions of dollars.
at trial,rivera introduced evidence that castrillon gambled extensively and that she used money taken from her gambling winnings rather than from the money that she had taken from the fraud victims to supply the funds that rivera then used to make the car purchases.rivera thus contended that,because the money that he used in buying the cars came from the gambling winnings,it was not criminally derived property.rivera also argued that he did not know that the funds that he received from castrillon and that he then used in buying the cars constituted criminally derived property,even if those funds somehow were so derived.instead,he argued,he thought that the funds that castrillon gave him were just funds that she took from her gambling winnings.
in response,the government sought to show at trial that the money from the gambling winnings actually did constitute criminally derived property.the government did so by putting in evidence that castrillon had used the money that she took from her fraud victims to fund her gambling.the government also put forward evidence to show that rivera knew that castrillon had done so.
after a trial,the jury convicted rivera of two counts of money laundering,in violation of and.the jury acquitted him,however,of the two other counts that he faced conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud in violation of,and wire fraud,in violation of.
the district court sentenced rivera to months of imprisonment.on appeal,rivera makes a number of challenges to his convictions.we consider each one in turn.
we start with the challenge that is the primary focus of the parties rivera contention that the district court erred in instructing the jury regarding one part of.we find that this challenge has no merit.
the district court instructed the jury that,just as f provides,the term criminally derived property means any property constituting,or derived from,proceeds obtained from a criminal offense.rivera does not challenge this instruction.he instead challenges the instruction that immediately followed,which purported to define the term proceeds in the statute definition of criminally derived property.
that instruction informed the jury that proceeds were any property derived from or obtained or retained,directly or indirectly,through some form of unlawful activity,including the gross receipts of such activity.rivera points out that this instruction tracked,word for word,the definition of proceeds that congress set forth in an amendment to,which became law in as part of the fraud enforcement and recovery act of fera,pub,stat.rivera contends that,under the ex post facto clause,this definition of proceeds could not lawfully have been applied to his case because the specified unlawful activity castrillon fraudulent scheme had begun years before fera passage 
rivera goes on to argue that the instruction was more expansive and elastic than the definition of proceeds that the district court should have used.to make this argument,rivera first directs our attention to the companion statute to,which is 
prior to fera passage,rivera notes,that statute like did not define the word proceeds.there was thus no reason to conclude that proceeds in meant anything other than what that word meant in.this fact matters,rivera argues,because,in,in united states santos,the supreme court narrowly construed the word proceeds in and thus,according to rivera,necessarily also set forth the same narrow construction of that word in 
specifically,according to rivera,santos made clear that proceeds meant only the net receipts or,put otherwise,the profits of specified unlawful activity and not the gross receipts of that activity.rivera also contends that santos made clear that,in any event,proceeds whether gross or net never means more than the receipts from the specified criminal activity.
from this premise,rivera contends that the district court instruction,by relying on fera definition of proceeds,expanded the scope that santos had given to that term in in two key respects.unlike the definition of proceeds set forth in santos,rivera points out,the instruction tracking fera expressly stated both that proceeds includes gross receipts and that proceeds includes any property derived from or obtained or retained,directly or indirectly,through some form of unlawful activity.c as amended emphasis added.
in pressing this challenge,rivera emphasizes that the government first proposed this instruction as to the meaning of proceeds only after castrillon had testified for the defense about her gambling activity.during that testimony,rivera notes,castrillon stated that the money that she gave to rivera to purchase the cars came from her gambling winnings.rivera contends that the government proposed the instruction defining proceeds in order to argue to the jury that it was simply irrelevant whether the money used to buy the cars was gambling winnings or fraud proceeds because rivera was guilty either way.as a result,he argues,the instructional error went to the very heart of the case.it impermissibly enabled the jury,rivera contends,to find that castrillon gambling winnings constituted the proceeds of specified unlawful activity,even though those winnings were not the actual funds taken from castrillon fraud victims and thus were not in rivera view the proceeds of that fraud under santos.
rivera concedes that he did not object at trial to the jury instruction that he now challenges on appeal.our review,therefore,is only for plain error.
under this standard,rivera faces the heavy burden of showing that an error occurred that the error was clear or obvious that the error affected his substantial rights and that the error also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states prieto,cir.quoting united states riccio,cir.assuming a clear or obvious instructional error,rivera need not,under the third prong of the review standard,prove by a preponderance of the evidence that but for the error things would have been different.united states rodr√≠guez,cir.quoting united states dominguez benitez,insertion in original.but,a showing of mere possibilities is not enough to prove that an instructional error affected a defendant substantial rights.united states procopio,cir.rivera thus must show that the outcome of the case would likely have changed had the erroneous instruction not been given.united states colon,cir.
the government disputes whether rivera is right that the district court erred in basing the proceeds instruction on the definition of the term that fera set forth,given when fera became law.the government also disputes whether he is right about how narrowly santos construed proceeds.santos,at stevens,concurring in judgment.but even if rivera is right on both counts,his challenge to the instruction still fails because he can not show that the instruction likely affected the outcome of the case.
the record makes clear that the part of the instruction that defined proceeds to include gross receipts did not likely affect the outcome of the case.the record shows that castrillon fraud entailed little in the way of expenses.the record also shows that the gross receipts from the fraud were extremely large totaling more than million.the expenses of the fraud,therefore,were simply too paltry for the instruction definition of proceeds to include gross receipts to have made any difference.nor does rivera point to anything in the record to suggest otherwise.
the record similarly shows that the part of the instruction that defined proceeds by using what rivera calls expansive and elastic words any property derived from or obtained or retained,directly or indirectly did not likely affect the outcome of the case.emphasis added.as we have noted,the instructions as a whole made clear that,consistent with f,property derived from the proceeds of specified unlawfully activity is itself criminally derived property.united states brown,cir.when applying the plain error standard in the context of jury instructions,we look at the instructions as a whole to ascertain the extent to which they adequately explain the law without confusing or misleading the jury.quoting united states troy,cir.
thus,the government did not need to prove that castrillon gambling winnings themselves constituted the proceeds of her fraud.to make the case that rivera,in using money taken from those winnings to buy the cars,used criminally derived property,the government needed to prove only that the money that he used from the gambling winnings constituted property derived from the fraud proceeds.
this feature of the definition of criminally derived property dooms rivera challenge to the instruction.as we explain more fully in addressing rivera separate challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,the record provides ample support for a jury to find that castrillon generated her gambling winnings exclusively from the funds that she took from the fraud or,put otherwise,from the proceeds of it.the record also provides ample support for a jury to find that the fraudulently obtained funds that castrillon used to generate the gambling winnings totaled at least as much as the amount of money that castrillon then gave to rivera to buy the cars.given the strength of the evidence that castrillon gambling winnings were derived from the proceeds of castrillon fraud and thus that the proceeds were criminally derived rivera fails to show that the outcome of the case would likely have changed had the challenged instruction on proceeds not been given 
rivera,moreover,makes no developed argument to the contrary.he instead focuses solely on how the jury instruction expansive and elastic language defining proceeds permitted the jury to find that the gambling winnings were proceeds.but,as we have just explained,that focus is too limited,given how defines criminally derived property.see united states zannino,cir.i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.
accordingly,we conclude that rivera challenge to the jury instruction concerning the definition of the term proceeds in fails.for even if the instruction was given in error,rivera has not shown how that error affected his substantial rights.
we turn,then,to rivera contention that the evidence was insufficient.our review is de novo.united states,cir.in undertaking that review,we consider the evidence,both direct and circumstantial,in the light most favorable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence,including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom,would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.id.quoting united states,cir.applying these standards,we reject rivera sufficiency challenge,which,as we will explain,has two distinct aspects.
first,rivera argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the money that he used to purchase the two vehicles was criminally derived property.but,we do not agree.see united states,cir.explaining that on sufficiency review the government need not succeed in eliminating every possibly theory consistent with the defendant innocence internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the government adduced a wealth of evidence that showed that castrillon generated the gambling winnings by using fraudulent funds in an amount far greater than the amount that she testified that she gave to rivera to make each car purchase.specifically,castrillon testified that she obtained more than million from the victims of her fraud,which began in.moreover,castrillon testified that she began her gambling addiction,it was for five years,or that,as of,her income from her prior employment had come to an end and that,over time,she suffered gambling losses of much more than half a million dollars.
a jury could thus reasonably infer that the source of the money that castrillon used to generate the gambling winnings was exclusively the money that castrillon took from the proceeds of the fraud.a jury could also reasonably infer that the amount of fraudulently obtained funds she used to fund her gambling totaled at least as much as the amount of money that she gave to rivera to buy the cars.and,for the reasons that we have just explained regarding the scope of the derived from prong of definition of criminally derived property,a jury that could reasonably make those inferences also could reasonably find the following.insofar as rivera used the gambling winnings to make each car purchase that is at issue here,he each time used criminally derived property in excess of from specified unlawful activity to do so.
to make the contrary case,rivera advances a number of arguments about the state of the record.but we do not find them to be persuasive.
rivera first contends that it is possible that castrillon made money from gambling before the fraud began in.he thus argues that a jury reasonably could have found that rivera made the car purchases with funds taken from these,untainted gambling winnings.but,rivera identifies no plausible source nor do we find one in the record for castrillon hypothetically untainted gambling winnings,let alone evidence that such untainted winnings were of a size sufficient to supply more than towards a car purchase not once,but twice.
to the contrary,by her own testimony,castrillon began gambling in,or,and she did not testify that the gambling preceded the fraud.nor did she at any point testify that her gambling luck if any she had generated amounts of any significance.in fact,castrillon made clear that she used the fraudulently obtained funds to feed her casino gambling in the down periods,which she also testified were frequent enough or unlucky enough that castrillon gambling losses at a san juan hotel casino well exceeded half a million dollars.
rivera next notes that,at one point during her testimony,castrillon stated that the funds that rivera used to buy the bmw came from money that she made off of the electronic lottery.and,rivera contends,a jury reasonably could find that the lottery winnings were not tainted by the fraud.
rivera never identifies evidence in the record,however,that reveals an untainted source of the funds that castrillon might have tapped to play the electronic lottery.nor did castrillon herself identify one.rather,castrillon,as we have just noted,testified that she had no source of income from her prior employment after and that she had casino gambling losses in excess of.she also agreed during her testimony at trial that the money she would gamble with was from her fraud victims,which funds totaled more than million 
finally,rivera points to the gap in time between late october,when castrillon received the last of the funds she took directly from the fraudulent scheme,and may,when the second vehicle was purchased.but rivera identifies no plausible separate source of funds that is,funds that were not derived from the proceeds of the fraud scheme with which castrillon might have gambled after the scheme ended and from which the funds used to pay for the cars could have come.we thus do not see how this gap helps rivera argument.
that leaves only the circuit precedents that rivera relies upon.but,given the evidence in the record,these cases are readily distinguished.
the first precedent rivera relies on is our decision in united states carucci,cir.there,the government sought to prove that the defendant was guilty of violating because he had laundered funds derived from the criminal activities of stephen flemmi,the notorious leader of boston winter hill gang.id.at.we explained that,in light of the record,a ccepting that flemmi income was illegitimate,it could have been linked to any number of criminal activities and thus there was no evidence that flemmi had engaged in the specified unlawful activities charged in the indictment in the relevant time period.id.at.
rivera case is very different.the record here does not reveal plausible sources for the money that rivera used to help castrillon buy the two cars other than the gambling winnings that the record sufficiently shows were derived from the proceeds of her fraud.instead,the evidence offers no plausible untainted source form which the gambling winnings were made.
similarly is united states wright,cir.there,the seventh circuit held that the government failed to prove a violation of because the defendant used only in drug proceeds an amount below the statute threshold for the amount that must be involved in a transaction charged under to purchase a property that the defendant later sold for approximately.id.at.in rivera case,however,the government did not rely on the value of the assets purchased the cars to get over the statutorily imposed threshold for criminally derived property.the government instead relied on extensive evidence that showed the following.the gambling winnings came exclusively from the funds that castrillon took from her fraud.and,the fraudulently obtained funds that she used to gamble totaled well in excess of the amount of money that would have been needed to cover the money that rivera got from castrillon to buy the cars,which exceeded per transaction.
for related reasons,united states rutgard,cir,is also no help to rivera.there,the ninth circuit held that money derived from funds that were not criminally derived property and that were sufficient to pay for a transaction in excess of does not become criminally derived just because the clean funds are commingled in an account that also contains criminally derived property.id.at see also saccoccia united states,fed.appx,cir.but here,the record overwhelmingly indicates that only funds that were,at the least,derived from the proceeds of the fraud were used to give rivera the funds that he used to buy the cars.thus,the circumstance rutgard addressed is not presented here.
the other aspect of rivera sufficiency challenge concerns the evidence of his mens rea.he argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to prove that he knew that more than of criminal money was involved in the second vehicle purchase.emphasis added.he bases this contention on castrillon testimony that she told him that the money for the car was gambling winnings.
the record,however,reveals evidence of rivera close ties to castrillon including her testimony that it was a s if he was her father.rivera also concedes that the government presented evidence of rivera participation in the fraud scheme,including evidence that he recruited new victims,pressured them to take out loans,assured them the frozen funds at the heart of the scheme were real,and threatened victims who came to complain to castrillon mother.
thus,a jury could reasonably infer that rivera knew that castrillon had no source of revenue for her gambling activity other than the fraudulently obtained funds and that he knew that the fraudulent scheme was extremely profitable generating,per castrillon testimony,over million.and a jury that could reasonably make this inference could also reasonably infer that rivera knew that money obtained from that scheme funded castrillon gambling and,consequently,that the funds she took from her gambling activity to give to him to make the two car purchases was criminally derived.this part of his sufficiency challenge,therefore,fails as well.see united states richard,cir.t he government must prove that the defendant had general knowledge of the subject property criminal nature.
having dispensed with rivera challenges to the jury instructions and to the sufficiency of the evidence,we now address the two remaining challenges that rivera makes that concern the tie between castrillon gambling winnings and her fraud.neither challenge has merit.
rivera contends first that his convictions must be reversed because of statements that the prosecutor made in his closing argument.in those statements,the prosecutor told the jury that it could convict rivera if the money used to buy the vehicles came from casino winnings and not directly from victims because that money was nevertheless criminally derived property.rivera contends that these statements amounted to an erroneous assertion that the jury was legally required to apply a presumption that all of castrillon money was dirty.
rivera concedes that he did not object to the prosecutor statements at trial.our review,therefore,is for plain error.united states,cir.we find none.as we read the record,the prosecutor did not argue that a legal presumption of taint applied to all the funds that were used to purchase the cars.the prosecutor merely summarized his view of what had been revealed by the circumstantial evidence presented at trial about the nature of the funds used to make those transactions moreover,the district court instructed the jury that the closing arguments are not evidence.for these reasons,the prosecutor statements supply no basis for sustaining rivera challenge.united states allen,cir.noting that even a mischaracterization of the defendant testimony,provided it was unintentional and isolated and corrected by a cautionary instruction by the district court,did not prejudice the outcome of the case and therefore did not constitute plain error.
rivera also argues that his convictions must be overturned because the district court did not permit his attorney to adduce evidence quantifying castrillon gambling winnings.rivera did preserve this challenge,and so our review is for abuse of discretion.united states decologero,cir.
the record does not show that the district court barred rivera from presenting this evidence.rather,after rivera attorney,on,withdrew a question in which he sought to quantify castrillon gambling winnings,the district court emphasized that rivera attorney could pursue this line of questioning if he could show the relevance and accuracy of that information.
moreover,the additional evidence at issue could not have helped rivera identify a plausible untainted source for the funds used to buy the cars.much evidence was adduced at trial about the size of castrillon fraud and her lack of independent sources of income.in fact,during his direct examination of castrillon,rivera attorney withdrew without objection his question about h ow much money castrillon would win while gambling when the district court told him that such testimony was needlessly cumulative.thus,there was no abuse of discretion by the district court.
we now take up rivera three remaining challenges.none supports the reversal of his convictions.
rivera first contends that the prosecutor acted improperly by asking castrillon whether four other trial witnesses were lying.because rivera did not raise this challenge below,our review is for plain error.
the government does not dispute that the prosecutor error in this regard was clear and obvious.see united states thiongo,cir.noting that it is improper for an attorney to ask a witness whether another witness lied on the stand.in order to constitute plain error,however,the prosecutor improper questions must potentially have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.united states fernandez,cir.quoting united states olano.we see no basis for concluding that they did.
rivera first points to the government question about whether the salesperson who testified that rivera was present when the toyota sequoia was purchased was lying.but the jury heard testimony and was presented extensive accompanying documentary evidence that rivera purchased the toyota sequoia on castrillon behalf.we thus do not see how the comment by the prosecutor that is at issue even if improper was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant overturning the verdict.see id.at given the strength of the government case,it stretches credulity to believe that the improper framing of these questions affected the outcome of the trial.
rivera also fails to show the requisite prejudice from the three other instances that he identifies in which the prosecutor asked castrillon whether other witnesses were lying the government put forth considerable evidence of rivera participation in the two vehicle purchases,his closeness to castrillon and,as rivera himself concedes,his knowledge of and participation in the fraud scheme itself.thus,w e see no way that these few miscast questions could have so tainted the trial as to affect its outcome.id.at see also united states pereira,wl,at cir,noting a lack of prejudice to the defendant,and thus no plain error,where the questions were limited in number and scope,and only pertained to tangential,corroborated testimony.
rivera next argues that the district court erred in granting the government motion in limine to exclude evidence that concerned the negligence or lack of due diligence of castrillon victims.rivera contends that the district court ruling limited his ability to demonstrate just how successful castrillon was in duping people,thereby making it more likely that rivera himself was duped.our review is for abuse of discretion.decologero,at.
as the government correctly points out,the district court permitted rivera to argue to the jury that he was a victim of castrillon manipulation and to present evidence in support of that argument.thus,we do not see how the district court erred.it merely excluded evidence that would have been at best cumulative and,at worst inconsistent with a side point that rivera wished to make but that was not even in dispute that castrillon was a skilled fraudster.thus,there was no abuse of discretion.
finally,we reject rivera claim of cumulative error.the record contains strong evidence that the gambling winnings rivera used to buy the cars were,at the least,derived from the proceeds of castrillon fraud.the errors that rivera alleges,however,are not responsible for the jury having heard that evidence.we thus conclude that the errors rivera points to,if any there were,in the aggregate,do not come close to achieving the critical mass necessary to cast a shadow upon the integrity of the verdict.united states sepulveda,cir.
for these reasons,we affirm rivera convictions.
subsection f provides that the term specified unlawful activity is to be given the meaning that term has in c.the parties do not dispute that castrillon scheme for which she was charged with violating,the federal identity fraud statute,the federal wire fraud statute,and,the federal bank fraud statute qualifies as specified unlawful activity under.see f,c.
among other things,fera defined proceeds in the companion statute,to encompass any property derived from or obtained or retained,directly or indirectly,through some form of unlawful activity,including the gross receipts of such activity.c as amended.fera then also expressly provided that the term proceeds used in the definition of criminally derived property in shall have the meaning given proceeds in section.f as amended.the definition of criminally derived property in subsection f of,however,has not been modified since the statute passage in.see abuse act of,pub,stat.we note that the simple insertion of the new,definition of proceeds from c into f appears to lead to a strange result the term criminally derived property means any property constituting,or derived from,any property derived from or obtained or retained,directly or indirectly,through some form of unlawful activity,including the gross receipts of such activity,obtained from a criminal offense.thus,we think congress likely intended for the definition of criminally derived property in subsection f to read something like the following the term criminally derived property means any property constituting or derived from,proceeds,obtained from a criminal offense,including the gross receipts of such activity.see,at explaining that because santos mistakenly limited the term proceeds to the profits of a crime,fera was designed to amend the criminal money laundering statutes to make clear that the proceeds of specified unlawful activity include the gross receipts of the illegal activity,not just the profits from the illegal activity see also cong.rec.daily ed,statement of levin r ecent court decisions have misdefined the term proceeds from the money laundering statute to mean only the net receipts from unlawful activities this act will fix these decisions and explicitly define proceeds to include not only net but gross receipts from unlawful activities.
prior to,provided whoever,knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity a with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than twenty abuse act emphasis added.
in santos,the court considered whether the expenses of operating the defendant illegal lottery including payments to runners,winners,and collectors constituted proceeds under.at.a plurality concluded that they did not.because,on the plurality view,the meaning of the term proceeds was ambiguous,the plurality applied the rule of lenity to hold that the term proceeds means the net profits of criminal activity,and thus did not encompass the illegal lottery expenses.id.at.concurring in the judgment,justice stevens declined to adopt a categorical definition,instead suggesting that the court need not pick a single definition of proceeds applicable to every unlawful activity.id.at.like the plurality,however,justice stevens was concerned that applying a gross receipts definition to the specific facts of santos would lead to the merger problem,whereby the defendant would be convicted of the substantive offense of operating a gambling business,and then convicted again,under,of money laundering for the mere payment of the expense of operating an illegal gambling business.id.at.this possibility,justice stevens noted,was in practical effect tantamount to double jeopardy.id.applying the rule of marks united states,we held in united states,cir,that justice stevens concurrence is the controlling law.
although castrillon fraud began several years before santos was decided,rivera does not contend that the definition of the term should be anything other than one that he contends that santos provided.
a number of sister circuits,had construed the derived from portion of the statute definition of criminal
