bahman habibi raises three challenges to his october conviction for possession of a stolen firearm in violation of.j habibi argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting extensive evidence relating to his heroin use and heroin trafficking.habibi also argues that the district court abused its discretion in allowing an fbi agent involved in the investigation that led to habibi arrest to testify on issues relating to dna residue.and,finally,habibi argues that the district court should have instructed the jury on transitory possession,as he sought to build his defense against the possession charge on that basis.we find no merit to any of these challenges and therefore affirm the conviction.
we begin with the challenge to the admission of the evidence of habibi past drug use and trafficking.although e vidence of a crime,wrong,or other act is not admissible to prove a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.b,t his evidence may be admissible for another purpose.b.in particular,the federal rules of evidence specifically enumerate a number of purposes for which such evidence may be used proving motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident.b.and that list of purposes is not exhaustive.united states landry,cir.
thus,where a defendant challenges a district court admission of prior bad acts evidence,the first question for a reviewing court is whether the evidence has special relevance to the case,by which we mean that the evidence is relevant for any purpose apart from showing propensity to commit a crime.united states doe,cir quoting united states rodríguez berríos,cir.for if the evidence does have such special relevance,then rule b does not bar its admission.
here,proof of possession was complicated by the fact that habibi apparently was not involved in either the initial theft of the firearm which was taken from a police officer personal vehicle or the robberies in which the gun was subsequently used.but the gun was found in habibi home,in a secret hiding place.the government thus sought to show how it got there and thus,that habibi had knowing possession of the stolen by introducing evidence that habibi had taken possession of the gun and kept it at his home both in consequence of his ties to two of his heroin customers and out of his concern that the government would prosecute him on the basis of his drug trafficking.
according to the government,therefore,the evidence relating to habibi heroin use and trafficking was not introduced to show habibi propensity to engage in criminal behavior.instead,the government claims,it introduced this evidence to provide context for the crime,to help explain how habibi came to possess the gun by showing the extent of his relationships to those who claimed he took possession of it,and to show why he had a special motive to do so.
specifically,the government called two longstanding heroin customers of habibi to testify at trial about how the gun came to be in habibi possession.these two customers testified that they,along with a friend who had stolen the gun,hid the gun prior to the friend arrest.and these customers further testified that,after their friend arrest,the two of them,plus habibi,together retrieved the gun.the two government witnesses explained,however,that it was habibi who picked up and carried the gun back to the car,and it was habibi who hid the gun in a hole in the wall in the basement of his residence after they had secreted it away.
the government also put on evidence relating to habibi heroin trafficking to show that habibi had a special motive to keep possession of the stolen gun.in particular,the two heroin customers testified that habibi wanted to hold onto the gun in case he was arrested for drug trafficking and needed leverage,which he thought the stolen police gun could provide.
on this record,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence was not evidence extrinsic to the crime charged that the government introduced solely for the purpose of showing villainous propensity.united states gonyer,cir quoting united states roszkowski,cir.as the government contends,the evidence about habibi customers frequenting his residence to use heroin that he supplied them helped the jury understand the basis for those customers trusting relationship with habibi.see united states arias montoya,cir evidence may have special relevance where it shows a common scheme or suggested course of continuous dealing or where the earlier bad act is likely to provide context or complete the story of the one subsequently charged united states harrison,evidence of past drug distribution admissible to show course of dealing and intent on instant drug charges.and,as the government further contends,the testimony from those customers about habibi heroin trafficking was highly probative of habibi motive and intent regarding his possession of the firearm.see.b motive and intent are valid purposes for prior bad acts evidence.thus,the evidence had more than sufficient special relevance for admission under rule b.
that conclusion,however,does not end our inquiry.evidence that has special relevance may still be inadmissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,misleading the jury,undue delay,wasting time,or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.and while even habibi concedes that some limited reference to drug trafficking a rguably may have been appropriate to establish motive,he contends that the government leveraged this evidence to such an extent that it crossed the line set forth by rule.
but district courts are afforded especially wide latitude in balancing the relative probative and prejudicial values of evidence.united states nai fook li,cir quoting united states rivera,cir.and thus,o nly rarely and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances will we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.id.at quoting freeman package mach,cir.
given the government legitimate purpose in showing both that habibi had extensive ties to certain heroin users implicated in the gun theft and that habibi prior involvement in drug trafficking supplied his motive in taking hold of the gun,this case is not the rare and extraordinarily compelling one that requires us to reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.united states green,cir quoting nai fook li,at see also united states burdulis,cir reversal under rule appropriate only if reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the court made a clear error of judgment quoting united states trenkler,cir.we thus find no abuse of discretion in the district court admission of the evidence of habibi drug use and trafficking.see united states vizcarrondo casanova,cir.affirming admission of cumulative and nearly overshooting evidence that was used to establish that the defendants had reason to trust one another,cert.denied.
habibi next argues that the district court abused its discretion in allowing fbi special agent christopher peavey to testify on issues relating to dna residue.habibi bases his challenge on the limitations rules and of the federal rules of evidence place on opinion testimony.
the government asked agent peavey one of the law enforcement officers involved in the investigation and arrest a few questions about his experience with dna residue to address the fact that test results showed that dna on the stolen gun did not belong to habibi.other government witnesses had testified that habibi had handled the gun and placed it in his basement.the government thus wanted to put on this testimony to show that detectable dna is not left every time someone touches an object with his bare hands.
after voir dire on the inquiry,and over the objection of defense counsel,the district court permitted the government to ask,and agent peavey to ans
