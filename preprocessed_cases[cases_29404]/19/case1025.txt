defendant leroy gentles gentles was convicted on four counts of distributing crack cocaine in maine.he was sentenced to months imprisonment,followed by four years supervised release,with a special condition of substance abuse treatment counseling.on appeal,gentles argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial based on repeated improprieties in the government closing argument the prosecutor improperly vouched for the government witnesses,depriving him of a fair trial the admission of prior bad acts evidence deprived him of a fair trial and his sentence was unreasonable.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual background 
in the spring of,james bellino bellino,a former crack addict,contacted agents of the drug enforcement administration dea and thereafter became a paid confidential informant ci.bellino testified at trial that he was motivated by the desire to do the right thing and straighten his life around.
on may,bellino informed the dea about a man,known on the streets as junior,who was selling crack cocaine in portland and who had been bellino personal drug dealer for the past two years.under the supervision of dea agents,and at their request,bellino placed a recorded call to junior telephone number and arranged a meeting.during this initial conversation,as well as subsequent recorded calls,dea agents noticed that junior had a distinct jamaican accent.
early that same afternoon,and under constant audio and visual surveillance by the dea,bellino drove himself to a local market and waited for junior.the dea had equipped bellino with an audio transmitter and in serialized bills.using binoculars,dea supervisor agent paul wolf wolf saw a black male cross the street and enter the door of bellino vehicle suv.while agents followed,bellino drove in a large circle through nearby streets.
once in bellino suv,junior sold bellino thirteen rocks of crack cocaine,a total of grams,for.thereafter,the two returned to the local market and agents wolf and kate barnard barnard saw junior get out of bellino suv and enter a champagne colored ford windstar van.dea agents followed the van long enough to determine that its registered owner was the defendant,black man.they also obtained a driver license photograph of him.at trial,wolf and bellino testified that junior the man who entered the door of bellino the defendant,gentles.agent jack daley daley,another member of the surveillance team,confirmed their testimony.
in june,laura bisha bisha,a former drug addict and dealer,became the second ci for the dea in its ongoing investigation of junior.on june,bisha gave agents the telephone number for the person she knew as junior.it was the same number that bellino had previously provided.while dea agents listened in,bisha made four recorded telephone calls to that number.during this exchange,bisha and junior arranged to meet at a local mall.in preparation for this meeting,dea agents provided bisha with in serialized bills and a backpack equipped with a camera,microphone,and transmitter.dea agents observed a black ford taurus pull up next to bisha as she stood waiting in front of the mall she climbed into the rear seat.at trial,bisha testified that the man sitting in the front passenger seat,whom she knew as junior,was gentles.a video recording of the transaction showed junior pass a package to bisha.during this transaction,junior sold five grams of crack cocaine,in fourteen separate baggies,to bisha in exchange for.once again,agents followed junior after the transaction was complete.this led them to wilson address listed on the registration for the ford windstar van.
bisha purchased crack cocaine from junior on two other occasions on july,for grams and on august,for grams.at trial,barnard and agent paul buchanan buchanan,another member of the surveillance team,both testified that the man they observed meeting bisha on these two occasions was the defendant,gentles.testing and analysis following each transaction confirmed that the drugs were indeed crack cocaine.
on july,gentles was indicted on four counts of distribution of cocaine base,also known as crack cocaine,in violation of a.a warrant for his arrest issued the same day,and gentles was arrested on july.
gentles trial began on december.while he did not testify,his primary defense was he was not junior.gentles counsel emphasized that none of the videotapes showed junior face,that the cis were not credible,that their memories had faded,and that no records connected gentles to the phones used in the recorded calls.
during the closing charge,the court stated that credibility was for the jury to decide,but that the cis testimony should be considered with particular caution.the court went on to say that lawyers arguments and statements were not evidence.
in his closing,defense counsel argued that the cis were drug addicts whose testimony was bought and paid for by the government and that they were in bed with the government.in response to this argument,the assistant united states attorney ausa suggested that the cis had undertaken risks in testifying against gentles and that the trial was dissimilar to those depicted on television.during the ausa rebuttal,defense counsel made three separate objections,all of which were sustained by the court.once the ausa rebuttal was finished,the court completed its instructions to the jury.
immediately following the court instructions,both parties were called to a sidebar.while neither party objected to the charge,defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on statements made by the ausa during its rebuttal.the motion was denied.before sending the jury to deliberate,the court reminded the jury that even though gentles name appeared in the transcripts of the recorded tapes,gentles contested the identification.in its final statement to the jury,the court advised the jury to take heed that a federal criminal trial is significantly different from what is portrayed on television.
on december,after two hours of deliberation,a jury found gentles guilty on all four counts.thereafter,on march,the court sentenced gentles to months imprisonment on each count,to be served concurrently,followed by four years supervised release on each count,to be served concurrently,with the additional condition of participation in substance abuse treatment counseling.the court further recommended enrollment in a hour drug treatment program while gentles was serving his prison term.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
denial of gentles motion for mistrial 
prosecutorial misconduct 
gentles first argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based on statements made by the ausa during rebuttal.gentles asserts that these statements were based on facts not in evidence and prejudiced the outcome of his case,warranting a new trial.we review the denial of a motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion.see united states decologero,cir.the pertinent portion of the rebuttal that gentles claims is impermissible went as follows 
ausa the cis were willing to come into court in a public hearing and testify before you all over the last couple of days.they were willing to air their dirty laundry and have it dragged through the courtroom,and they were willing to accept the risk,not that that it happened in this case 
defense counsel objection.
the court sustained.counsel,move on.
ausa we live in the real world,ladies and gentlemen.in this world,the defendant is a crack dealer.in this world,we have proven that.this is csi.there is has actually been a couple of studies done on how shows like csi actually deal 
defense counsel objection,your honor.
the court counsel,that not in evidence.
ausa it not about what not in evidence.
the agents did ask what they had.
defense counsel objection.
the court counsel,let just stick with the evidence.
we begin by determining whether the ausa statements constituted misconduct.as we have previously stated,the term misconduct does not suggest deliberate wrongdoing but rather a statement of fact that is mistaken or unsupported by any evidence.united states azubike,cir.cognizant of this definition,we think it is clear that the ausa statements constitute impermissible argument and therefore amount to prosecutorial misconduct.first,there was absolutely no evidence presented at trial that gentles was a violent man who would retaliate against the cis.accordingly,any argument asserting otherwise was improper.see united states de leon davis,cir see also charles alan wright,nancy king susan klein,federal practice and procedure ed.it is misconduct for a prosecutor to make an assertion to the jury of a fact,either by way of argument or by an assumption in a question,unless there is evidence of that fact.similarly and as the district court admonished,there was no evidence of any studies,csi or otherwise,presented at trial 
although we find that misconduct occurred,misconduct alone is insufficient to reverse a conviction absent a showing of prejudice.see azubike,at.to determine if prejudice resulted,the test is whether the prosecutor misconduct so poisoned the well that the trial outcome was likely affected,thus warranting a new trial.id.at quoting united states joyner,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this test is composed of three separate prongs.first,we determine whether the prosecutor conduct was isolated deliberate next,we consider whether the trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary instruction and finally we determine whether it is likely that any prejudice surviving the instruction could have affected the outcome of the case.id.citing joyner,at.
statements regarding cis risk 
in applying the first prong of the test,we agree with the government that the ausa statements relating to risk were unintentional,brief,and benign.see united states shoup,cir finding no plain error where prosecutor references were relatively benign and there was no indication that the references were deliberate.the moment defense counsel objected,the court sustained the objection and told the ausa,counsel,move on.thereafter,the ausa never returned to the subject of risk.azubike,at repeated reference by ausa to improper topics.though we find the ausa remarks improper,the court immediate directive neutralized any prejudice to gentles.
moving to the second prong,while the district court did not give a curative instruction,we first note that one was not requested.nevertheless the court,on its own initiative,instructed the jury twice during the opening charge and a third time in the closing charge that lawyers arguments were not evidence.see united states robinson,cir finding no error where defendant failed to request a curative instruction and court gave general instructions before deliberation as to what the jury could and could not consider as evidence.the court further instructed that if it had sustained an objection,the jury should not speculate about what was stricken.see id.it is a well established tenet of our judicial system that juries are presumed to follow such instructions.united states riccio,cir.given the court ample admonishments,it is unlikely that any prosecutorial misstatement referencing unsubstantiated risk to the cis sullied the jury verdict.
lastly,applying prong three of the test,we find that there was no prejudice because this is not a close case and there is no likelihood that the remarks could have affected its outcome.riccio,at.based on the record,it is clear that there was an abundance of independent evidence that gentles was the man known by the cis as junior.see id.considering the evidence in this case,the terse character of the remarks and the thorough general instructions given by the court,it is unlikely that the remarks altered the result of the trial.see also joyner,at standard corrective instruction sufficient to dissipate all prejudice where there was overwhelming evidence of the defendant guilt which eliminate d any lingering doubt that the remarks could have unfairly prejudiced the jury deliberations.
statements regarding csi effect and studies 
we further conclude that the ausa comments about the csi effect and studies did not warrant a mistrial.first,as was the case with the comments regarding risk,the moment defense counsel objected to the remark,the court sustained the objection.the court also admonished the ausa by saying,counsel,that not in evidence.furthermore,after the objection was sustained,the ausa never returned to the subject of csi or the specific studies about it.while the ausa did follow up with an incomplete statement regarding what was not in evidence,defense counsel once again objected immediately.the court sustained the objection and cautioned the ausa,counsel,let just stick with the evidence.second,while the court did not give a curative instruction immediately following the remark,it did,during the final instruction,caution that a federal criminal trial is very different from what jurors see on television.this instruction was in addition to the three other repeated instructions throughout the trial that lawyers arguments were not evidence.see de leon davis,at holding that trial court instructions to the jury were sufficient to correct any possible prejudice where jury was amply admonished on the point that argument of counsel was not evidence,and finding it unlikely that any prejudice remained to infect the verdict.
finally,any statements regarding the csi effect and studies did not prejudice gentles to such an extent that the outcome of his trial was affected.again,there was substantial independent evidence to convict gentles of the crimes charged.furthermore,in denying gentles motion for a mistrial,the court found that there was no prejudice because the ausa did not get into the actual argument this conclusion is supported by the record.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that although prosecutorial misconduct occurred,it was isolated and not deliberate,the general instructions given to the jury on three separate occasions that attorney arguments were not evidence were adequate,and finally,there is no chance that the remarks made prejudiced the outcome of gentles trial.after careful review of the proceedings below,it is clear that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying gentles motion for a mistrial.riccio,at.
improper vouching 
gentles next argues that certain statements made by the ausa during his opening statement and closing argument improperly vouched for the credibility of the cis,prejudicing the outcome of his trial.b ecause no objection was raised at trial,we review only for plain error.united states hansen,cir.review for plain error entails four showings that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.see united states,cir quoting united states duarte,cir.we begin our analysis with a discussion of the applicable legal framework.
improper vouching occurs when the government place s the prestige of the united states behind a witness by making personal assurances about the credibility of a witness or implies that the jury should credit the government evidence simply because the government can be trusted.robinson,at internal quotation marks omitted.although the prosecution success often depends on its ability to convince the jury of a particular witness credibility,it can not entice the jury to find guilt on the basis of a government agent opinion of the witness veracity.united states,cir.gentles alleges that the ausa improperly vouched for the cis on four separate occasions.we will address each in turn.
in the first challenged remark,the ausa said,
unfortunately for the defendant in,for different reasons,the cis had decided to start working for the drug enforcement administration,dea,in an undercover capacity.
so on these four occasions in,the defendant was not only selling crack cocaine to the cis,he was selling crack cocaine to the dea.
according to gentles,these statements by the ausa were not based on facts in evidence and further suggested that the cis were agents of the dea.we disagree.to the contrary,the fact that the cis were acting on the dea behalf was made clear by the ausa during the government direct case.see united states,cir the prohibition of improper vouching is intended to keep the government from inviting a verdict based on facts not before the jury or on a prosecutor or government witness personal assurance of credibility.on direct examination,agents described how and when the cis came to cooperate with the dea,described the cooperation agreements signed by both cis,and testified to the dollar amount each ci was paid.moreover,despite gentles allegations,the record makes clear that the ausa never said that the cis were agents of the dea.furthermore,the fact that gentles did not object to these challenged remarks at the time they were made,yet objected to other statements made by the ausa throughout the trial,indicates that even gentles himself failed to regard the comments as having a damaging effect.see united states procopio,cir the fact that the defense did not object also may suggest that,in the conditions of the courtroom,the passage in question passed by as mere rhetoric.accordingly,we find unpersuasive gentles contention that the ausa remarks had the effect of bolstering the credibility of the cis.see united states,cir.there was no error.
gentles second challenge is to remarks made during the government closing argument.here,the ausa said,f irst of all,you got to keep in mind that the cis were providing information on a drug dealer.i would consider that public service that they are getting paid for.the government concedes that the ausa would have been better advised to avoid using the pronoun i or describing how he would characterize the informants cooperation.see united states smith,cir prosecutor use of i think during closing argument was improper see also united states auch,cir even though prosecutor statement did not use i think language,statement conveyed a personal opinion to the jury and was therefore improper.nonetheless,we tend to refrain from concluding that prosecutors improperly vouch for a witness when their remarks are made in an attempt to counter harmful allegations by the defense.see,at see also united states,cir giving the prosecutor greater leeway when improper vouching came in response to defense counsel inflammatory statements.
in this case,the ausa remarks were in direct response to defense counsel arguments that the cis were getting a complete pass for their own wrongdoing,gave testimony that was bought and paid for by the government,and were in bed with the government.the ausa closing argument was a logical counter to the assertions of defense counsel that the cis were not credible,at.moreover,gentles failure to object to the remark suggests that even he thought the remark had little impact upon the jury and was not prejudicial.see procopio,at.the ausa remark did not constitute plain error.
gentles third vouching challenge is to statements made by the ausa during rebuttal.specifically,the ausa said,
the cis were drug dealers looking for a profit like gentles,the defendant.on occasions that they used,they pooled their resources together.they may have gone to a contact to get drugs and share with other people and under the legal definition,that is distribution,but they were doing it for profit,and there is a big difference between that and what the conduct of gentles has been.
gentles argues that these remarks misrepresented the evidence because both cis admitted to selling drugs in the past.he further alleges that the remarks improperly conveyed the ausa personal opinion to the jury.
while it is true that both bellino and bisha admitted on that they sold drugs,the ausa elicited extensive evidence of both cooperators drug use and distributions,without objection,at the outset of the ausa direct examination of both cis.see,at finding no wrongdoing where prosecutor reference was to facts in the record.moreover,the ausa emphasis on the cis purchase,use,and sharing of drugs was directly in response to gentles credibility attack on both cis for those very reasons.specifically,gentles suggested that because the cis engaged in the same conduct as he,they should not be believed.see united states sepulveda,cir arguments that are incited or invited by,or fairly respond to,defendants closing statements generally not considered prejudicial,particularly where the argument does not escalate the level of fire and brimstone that characterized the defense oratory,and do not provoke a contemporaneous objection.furthermore,the record shows that the district court instructed the jury on two separate occasions that it was not necessary to show that gentles benefitted in any way from distributing drugs in order to convict him of the crimes charged.a s we have noted many times,we presume juries understand and follow the court instructions,at.accordingly,the ausa remarks did not constitute plain error.
gentles last challenge is also to the rebuttal,where the ausa stated,t hey were given letter immunity because the government wanted them to have no reservation about telling the truth,the whole truth and nothing but the truth,and yes,that includes their past relevant conduct which is the use,possession and occasional distribution of crack cocaine.
gentles contends that this remark suggested to the jury that the government had independently verified the cis testimony.we think that is a strained interpretation indeed.even if such an interpretation were plausible,and we do not think that it is,we have held that when a prosecutor comments,fairly viewed,are susceptible to two plausible meanings,one of which is unexceptionable and one of which is forbidden,context frequently determines meaning.united states taylor,cir.accordingly,this court will not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury,sitting through a lengthy exhortation,will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.id.furthermore,we have held that a prosecutor properly may admit a witness plea agreement into evidence,discuss the details of the plea during closing arguments,and comment upon a witness incentive to testify truthfully.united states bey,cir.lastly,during of both cis,defense counsel insinuated that their immunity agreements gave them an incentive to frame gentles.consequently,the ausa remark was a logical counter to defense counsel theory,at.this remark,like all the others before it,does not constitute plain error.
evidence of gentles prior bad acts 
at trial,the ausa elicited testimony from the cis on direct examination that gentles had sold them drugs prior to their cooperation with the dea.on appeal,gentles argues that this evidence should not have been admitted under rule b because its sole purpose was to demonstrate his propensity to commit the crimes charged.alternatively,gentles argues that even if the evidence was admissible under rule b,it should not have been admitted under rule because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.united states varoudakis,cir quoting.because gentles failed to object to this evidence during trial,we again review for plain error.hansen,at.we begin with the applicable legal framework.
under rule b,evidence of a defendant prior bad acts may not be admitted to prove his criminal character or propensity to commit crimes similar to those he is on trial for 
however,rule b does not provide an absolute bar.to be sure,evidence of prior bad acts may be admitted if it passes two tests.first,the evidence must have special relevance to an issue in the case,and the evidence must not include bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain.united states frankhauser,cir.prior bad act evidence is said to have special relevance if it pertains to issues such as the defendant intent,knowledge,plan,absence of mistake,or identity.varoudakis,at discussing.b.second,e ven if the special relevance is established,the evidence must still satisfy rule in order to be admitted.united states whitney,cir.
in this case,both parties agree that the only contested issue presented to the jury was the identity of junior the man who sold the cis drugs.beginning with his opening s
