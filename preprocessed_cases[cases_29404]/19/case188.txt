the federal sentencing statute at issue provides that a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment of more than year may receive credit toward the service of that sentence of up to days at the end of each year subject to the bureau of prison bop determination that,during that year,the prisoner has behaved in an exemplary fashion.b.credit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment is prorated.ibid.the bop applies this statute using a methodology that awards days of credit at the end of each year the prisoner serves and sets those days to the side.when the difference between the time remaining in the sentence and the amount of accumulated credit is less than one year,the bop awards a prorated amount of credit for that final year proportional to the awards in other years.
petitioners claim that the bop calculation method is unlawful because b requires a calculation based on the length of the term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge,not the length of time that the prisoner actually serves.the district court rejected this challenge in each of petitioner cases,and the ninth circuit affirmed.
held because the bop method for calculating good time credit reflects the most natural reading of the statute,it is lawful.
a the statute language and purpose,taken together,support the bop method.that method tracks b language by providing a prisoner a maximum credit of days for each full year of imprisonment and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for any additional time served that is less than a full year.as b directs,the bop awards the credit at the end of each year of imprisonment.petitioners approach can not be reconciled with the statute.because it awards credit for the sentence imposed,regardless of how much time is actually served,a prisoner could receive credit for a year that he does not spend in prison.moreover the calculation of credit for such a year would not be made at the end of that year.nor could the bop determine whether the prisoner had exemplary behavior during that year.this language did not find its way into the statute by accident.the differences between the prior provision repealed in which granted the prisoner a deduction at the outset of his sentence,subject to forfeiture for breaking prison rules and the present statute under which credit is earned at the end of the year based on an evaluation of behavior during that year show an intent to move from a prospective entitlement to a retrospective award.the bop method also furthers the basic purpose of the statute.section was part of the comprehensive sentencing reform act of,which sought to achieve both increased sentencing uniformity and greater honesty by mak ing all sentences basically determinate.mistretta united states.thereafter,the sentence the judge imposed would be the one the offender actually served,with a sole statutory exception for good time credits.ibid.section b states the reason for the exception to provide an incentive for prisoners to compl y with institutional disciplinary regulations.the exception is limited and tailored to its purpose credit is earned at the end of the year after compliance with institutional rules is demonstrated and thereby rewards and reinforces a readily identifiable period of good behavior.the bop approach furthers objectives by tying the award directly to good behavior during the preceding year.in contrast,petitioners approach would allow a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion of his sentence that he served and the portion offset with earned credit,which would loosen the statute connection between good behavior and the good time award.
b arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.context indicates that the phrase term of imprisonment as used in the portion of b at issue here refers to prison time actually served not,as petitioners contend,to the sentence imposed by the judge.petitioners reliance on legislative history is misplaced.a sentencing commission supplementary report is not helpful to them either,because there is no indication that the commission,in that report or in the guidelines themselves,considered or referred to the particular question whether to base good time credit on time served or the sentence imposed.nor,in light of the statute text,structure,history,and purpose,is this a case in which there is a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute,muscarello united states,permitting application of the rule of lenity.because the bop calculation system applies the statute as its language is most naturally read,and in accordance with the statute basic purpose,this court need not determine the extent to which congress has granted the bop authority to interpret the statute more broadly,or differently than it has done here.chevron natural resources defense council.and because the bop approach reflects the statute most natural reading and is the most consistent with its purpose,it is also preferable to the dissent alternative interpretation.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
federal sentencing law permits federal prison authorities to award prisoners credit against prison time as a reward for good behavior.b.petitioners,two federal prisoners,challenge the method that the federal bureau of prisons uses for calculating this good time credit.we conclude that the bureau method reflects the most natural reading of the statute,and we reject petitioners legal challenge.
a federal sentencing statute provides 
a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than year may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner sentence,beyond the time served,of up to days at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment,beginning at the end of the first year of the term.c redit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.b.
the bureau of prisons bop applies this statute using a methodology that petitioners in this case challenge as unlawful.in order to explain the bop method,we shall use a simplified example that captures its essential elements.the unsimplified calculations described by the bop in its policy statement,see app,will reach approximately the same results as,and are essentially the mathematical equivalent of,the simplified system we describe there may be other ways to describe the calculation as well.to the extent that there are any differences between the methodology employed by the bop and that reflected in our example,they are of no consequence to the resolution of petitioners challenge and are therefore not before us.similarly,although petitioners committed their crimes before the current version of was enacted and are therefore subject to a previous version that differed slightly in certain details,see ed,the differences between the two versions are immaterial to the questions presented by this case.the parties refer to the current version as the relevant provision of law,see brief for petitioners brief for respondent,and we shall do the same.
in our example we shall imagine a prisoner who has received a sentence of years imprisonment.we shall assume that his behavior throughout his confinement is exemplary and that prison authorities will consequently consider him to merit the maximum good time credit that the statute will allow.and we shall ignore leap years.
thus,at the end of the first year year that prisoner would earn the statute maximum credit of days.the relevant official whom we shall call the good time calculator would note that fact and,in effect,preliminarily put the days to the side.at the end of year the prisoner would earn an additional days of good time credit.the good time calculator would add this days to the first days,note the provisional total of days,and again put the days credit to the side.by the end of year,the prisoner would have earned a total of days of good time credit years times days.at that time,the good time calculator would note that the difference between the time remaining in the sentence years,or days and the amount of accumulated good time credit days is less than year minus equals days,which is less than.the days of good time credit that the prisoner has earned by the end of year are sufficient to wipe out all of the last year of the prison term and to shorten the prisoner year of imprisonment by days.
year of the sentence will consequently become the prisoner last year of imprisonment.further,because the prisoner has already earned days of credit against that year days already earned minus days applied to year leaves days to apply to year,the prisoner will have no more than days left to serve in year.now the good time calculator will have to work out just how much good time the prisoner can earn,and credit against,these remaining days.
as we said,the statute provides that good time for this last year or portion thereof shall be prorated.thus,the good time calculator must divide the days into two parts days that the prisoner will have to serve in prison,and credit for good behavior the prisoner will earn during the days served in year.in other words,the number of days to be served in year plus the number of good time credit days earned will be equal to the number of days left in the sentence,namely.and to keep the award of credit in the last year proportional to awards in other years,the ratio of these two parts of year,the number of good time days divided by the number of days served must be,the same ratio that the bop applies to full years served.we can use some elementary algebra,described in the appendix,infra,to work out the rest.the result is that if the prisoner serves days,he can earn an additional days of credit for good behavior.that is to say,of the days remaining in his sentence,the prisoner will have to serve days in confinement,after which point,his sentence will be fully accounted for given the additional days credit earned,and he will be released.in sum,a prisoner subject to a sentence who earns the maximum number of days the statute permits will serve days in confinement and receive days of good time credit,about of the prison time actually served.
in this case petitioners claim that the bop calculation method is unlawful.they say that b ed.requires a straightforward calculation based upon the length of the term of imprisonment that the sentencing judge imposes,not the length of time that the prisoner actually serves.thus,if a sentencing judge imposes a prison term of years as in our example,then,in petitioners view,the statute permits a maximum good time award of days years times days,not the days that the method described above would allow.and if the judge imposes a prison term of years and months,then the statute permits days days for the years plus days for the extra months,not the days that the method above would allow.according to petitioners,the bop method causes model prisoners to lose seven days of good time credit per year of imprisonment,and because their sentences are fairly long one,michael barber,was sentenced to years and months the other,tahir,was sentenced to years and months,the difference in their cases amounts to several months of additional prison time.
the district court in each of these cases rejected the prisoner challenge.civ.mo d,app.thomas,civ.mo d,app.and in each instance the court of appeals affirmed the district court.tablada thomas,app.see also tablada thomas.because the bop administration of good time credits affects the interests of a large number of federal prisoners,we granted the consolidated petition for certiorari to consider petitioners challenge.
having now considered petitioners arguments,we conclude that that we must reject their legal challenge.the statute language and its purpose,taken together,convince us that the bop calculation method is lawful.for one thing,that method tracks the language of b.that provision says that a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment of more than a year and less than life may receive credit of up to days at the end of each year subject to the determination by the bureau of prisons that,during that year,the prisoner has behaved in an exemplary fashion.ibid.emphasis added.and it says that credit for the last year or portion of a year shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.ibid.as the example in part i makes clear,the bop interpretation provides a prisoner entitled to a maximum annual credit with days of good time credit for each full year of imprisonment that he serves and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for any additional time served that is less than a full year.and,as b directs,the bop awards the credit at the end of each year of imprisonment except,of course,for year,which is subject to the statute special instruction requiring proration and crediting during the last six weeks of the sentence.
we are unable similarly to reconcile petitioners approach with the statute.their system awards credit for the sentence imposed,regardless of how much time is actually served.thus,a prisoner under petitioners system could receive days of credit for year despite the fact that he would be released after less than years in prison.the good time calculation for year would not be made at the end of year nor within the last six weeks of a sentence ending during that year.neither could the bop determine whether the prisoner had behaved in exemplary fashion during that year.b emphasis added see also white scibana,the bureau can not evaluate a prisoner behavior and award credit for good conduct if the prisoner is not still in prison mcginnis royster,where there is no evaluation by state officials and little or no rehabilitative participation for anyone to evaluate,there is a rational justification for declining to give credit 
we can not say that this language at the end of,during that year found its way into the statute by accident.under the previous good time provision,a prisoner was entitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence beginning with the day on which the sentence commences to run.ed.repealed.this deduction,granted at the outset of a prisoner sentence,was then made subject to forfeiture if the prisoner commit ted any offense or violate d the rules of the institution.repealed.the present statute,ed,in contrast,creates a system under which credit is earned at the end of the year based on an evaluation of behavior during that year.we agree with the government that t he textual differences between the two statutes reveal a purpose to move from a system of prospective entitlement to a system of retrospective award.brief for respondent see also white,supra,at.
for another thing,the bop method better furthers the statute basic purpose.the good time provision in is part of the sentencing reform act of,stat,et,a comprehensive law that reformed federal sentencing practice and directed the newly created united states sentencing commission to devise guidelines to be used for sentencing in district courts,mistretta united states.under the previous regime,the united states parole commission,as a general rule,could conditionally release a prisoner any time after he serve d of the judicially fixed term.united states grayson.if,for example,a judge imposed a prison term of years,the parole commission might have released the prisoner after only years.and it routinely did so.see united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual,ussg d efendants often serv ed only about of the sentence handed down by the court the result was confusion and implicit deception.ibid.with the sentencing reform act,congress sought to achieve both increased sentencing uniformity and greater honesty by mak ing all sentences basically determinate,mistretta,supra,at.see ussg,at statutory objectives included honesty in sentencing,uniformity,and proportionality emphasis deleted.
thereafter,the sentence the judge imposed would be the sentence the offender actually served,with a sole statutory exception for good time credits.mistretta,supra,at a prisoner is to be released at the completion of his sentence reduced only by any credit earned by good behavior while in custody citing b.the reason for this exception is provided in b itself to provide an incentive for prisoners to compl y with institutional disciplinary regulations.the good time exception is limited to days per year and tailored to its purpose credit is earned at the end of the year after compliance with institutional rules is demonstrated and thereby rewards and reinforces a readily identifiable period of good behavior.
the bop approach furthers the objective of.it ties the award of good time credits directly to good behavior during the preceding year of imprisonment.by contrast,petitioners approach,insofar is it would award up to days per year of time sentenced as opposed to time served,allows a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion of his sentence that he serves and the portion of his sentence that he offsets with earned good time credit.in other words,petitioners argue that the bop should award good time credit not only for the days a prisoner spends in prison and behaves appropriately,but also for days that he will not spend in prison at all,such as year in our example.by doing so,it loosens the statute connection between good behavior and the award of good time and transforms the nature of the exception to the basic rule.and to that extent,it is inconsistent with the statute basic purpose.
we are not convinced by petitioners several arguments against the bop methodology.first,petitioners point to the statement in b that a prisoner may receive credit at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment.emphasis added.the words term of imprisonment,they say,must refer to the years of the term that the sentencing judge imposed years in our example,not the years of the term that the prisoner actually served once good time credits were taken into account.after all,the very first phrase of that provision makes eligible for good time credits a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than year other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner life.ibid.emphasis added footnote omitted.the words term of imprisonment in this phrase almost certainly refer to the sentence imposed,not to the time actually served otherwise prisoners sentenced to a year and a day would become ineligible for credit as soon as they earned it.and,as petitioners emphasize,we have recognized a presumption that a given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute,brown gardner.
the problem for petitioners,however,is that this presumption is not absolute.it yields readily to indications that the same phrase used in different parts of the same statute means different things,particularly where the phrase is one that speakers can easily use in different ways without risk of confusion.atlantic cleaners dyers,united states,general dynamics land systems,cline.see,at age has different meanings in the age discrimination in employment act of united states cleveland indians baseball,same for wages paid in the internal revenue code robinson shell oil,same for employee in title vii of the civil rights act of.
the phrase term of imprisonment is just such a phrase.it can refer to the sentence that the judge imposes,see,a a prisoner shall be released at the end of the prisoner term of imprisonment,less any time credited for good behavior,but it also can refer to the time that the prisoner actually serves.thus,d of the statute before us requires bop to furnish a prisoner with suitable clothing,money,and transportation u pon the release of the prisoner on the expiration of the prisoner term of imprisonment.emphasis added.the statute here means to assure that the prisoner is provided with these necessities at the time of his actual release from prison sometime during year in our example,not at the end of the term that the judge imposed which would be over a year later.since the statute uses the same phrase term of imprisonment in two different ways,the presumption can not help petitioners here.and,for the reasons we have given,see part ii,supra,context here indicates that the particular instance of the phrase term of imprisonment at issue refers to prison time actually served rather than the sentence imposed by the judge.
second,petitioners seek to draw support from the statute legislative history.but those who consider legislative history significant can not find that history helpful to petitioners here.petitioners point,for example,to a statement in the senate report accompanying the sentencing reform act,which says that the method of calculation of good time will be considerably less complicated than under current law in many respects,and that credit toward early release is earned at a steady and easily determined rate that will have an obvious impact on the prisoner release date.see brief for petitioners.but these statements are consistent with the bop interpretation of the statute.its method,as we understand it,is not particularly difficult to apply and it is certainly less complex than prior law,which provided for the accumulation of two different kinds of good time credit general and industrial,calculated in different manners prospectively and retrospectively,and awarded at different rates,depending on the length of sentence imposed on the prisoner to days per month for general or the year of employment or days per month for industrial.see,ed.
petitioners also point to various statements contained in the act conference report and made by individual legislators that describe good time credit as providing sentence reductions of.see brief for petitioners citing,conf,cong.rec.remarks of hamilton.but there is nothing in the context of these statements to suggest that they amounted to anything other than rough approximations or that they were made with the present controversy in mind.see,conf,at noting simply that an increase in the amount of maximum annual credit from days to days increases good time that accrues from percent to percent cong.rec.statement of hamilton under reform act law,about of all criminals are paroled after serving one third of their time.now sentences will be reduced only for good behavior and whatever interpretive force one attaches to legislative history,the court normally gives little weight to statements,such as those of the individual legislators,made after the bill in question has become law.see,heintz jenkins.
third,petitioners rely on a statement in the united states sentencing commission supplementary report on the initial sentencing guidelines and policy statements issued in hereinafter supplementary report.in that report,the commission summarized its analysis of recent sentencing practice,which it had used to help draft the guidelines.the results of the analysis were presented in a table that permits comparison of the likely consequences of the new guidelines with prison time actually served under practice specifically,by identifying the guidelines offense level that is closest to the average time served by offenders convicted of a particular crime,supplementary report.because the guidelines refer to sentences prior to the awarding of good time because a guidelines sentence of,say,months imprisonment does not necessarily mean that the offender will serve the entire months in prison,the commission adjusted the average time served by dividing by good time when the term exceeded months.ibid.this adjustment,the commission explained,made sentences in the t able comparable with those in the guidelines.ibid.
pointing to this adjustment and a reference in later editions of the guidelines to a potential credit of approximately fifteen percent for good behavior,see,ussg,at,petitioners maintain that the commission set its guideline ranges with the expectation that prisoners would receive good time credit of up to of the sentence imposed,not of the time actually served.they add that,in setting the guidelines ranges in this way,the commission exercised congressionally delegated power to interpret the sentencing reform act,see mistretta,at approving congress delegation of the power to promulgate sentencing guidelines,and that as long as that interpretation is reasonable,courts must defer to it.see chevron natural resources defense council.
again,however,we can find no indication that the commission,in writing its supplementary report or in the guidelines themselves,considered or referred to the particular question here before us,that is whether good time credit is to be based on time served or the sentence imposed.the guidelines manual itself,a more authoritative account of the commission interpretive views than the supplementary report,says nothing directly on that subject.moreover,with respect to comparisons between guidelines sentences and practice,the original manual cautioned that the guidelines did not simply cop y estimates of existing practice as revealed by the data,but rather departed from the data at different points for various important reasons.ussg,at see also,g,at while guideline sentences in many instances will approximate existing,practice,the commission did not conside r itself bound by existing sentencing practice emphasis added.because the commission has expressed no view on the question before us,we need not decide whether it would be entitled to deference had it done so.if it turns out that the calculation of good time credit based on prison time served rather than the sentence imposed produces results that are more severe than the commission finds appropriate,the commission remains free to adjust sentencing levels accordingly.see,at acknowledging that the process is evolutionary and that the commission functions as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in the federal courts throughout the nation 
fourth,petitioners ask us to invoke the rule of lenity and construe ed.in their favor,that is,in a way that will maximize the amount of available good time credit.we may assume for present purposes that b can be construed as imposing a criminal penalty.see bifulco united states,rule of lenity applies to interpretations of the penalties imposed by criminal prohibitions but see sash zenk,sotomayor,holding that b is not a criminal statute for the purposes of the rule of lenity.even so,the rule of lenity only applies if,after considering text,structure,history,and purpose,there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute,muscarello united states,internal quotation marks omitted,such that the court must simply guess as to what congress intended.bifulco,supra,at quoting ladner united states.see united states hayes,slip,at united states,plurality opinion.having so considered the statute,we do not believe that there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statutory provision before us.nor need we now simply guess what the statute means.
finally,we note that petitioners urge us not to defer to the bop implementation of b.in our view,the bop calculation system applies that statute as its language is most naturally read,and in accordance with what that language makes clear is its basic purpose.no one doubts that the bop has the legal power to implement the statute in accordance with its language and purposes hence we need not determine the extent to which congress has granted the bop authority to interpret the statute more broadly,or differently than it has done here.chevron,supra,at.
acknowledging that petitioners arguments can not carry the day,the dissent has proposed a third possibility,post,at opinion of kennedy,not raised by either party nor,to our knowledge,used elsewhere in the criminal code.the dissent reads the statutory phrase term of imprisonment to refer to the administrative period along which progress toward eventual freedom is marked.post,at.it derives from this reading the following method of calculation as applied to our example.first,t he sentence is divided into segments.ibid.at the end of the first segment,a prisoner may receive up to days of credit for good behavior.these credits immediately go toward completion of the next year so that the prisoner need only serve another days behind bars before the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an end.ibid.this process repeats itself until the segment,in which a prisoner receives an unspecified credit in a prorated amount.ibid.in the end,the prisoner will have served administrative segments,collectively comprising days in prison and days of credit.
the dissent claims r eading term of imprisonment this way is consistent with all parts of the statute.post,at.we see at least four problems.first,the opening sentence of a instructs that a prisoner shall be released upon the expiration of the prisoner term of imprisonment,less any time credited for good behavior.but if a prisoner term of imprisonment is the period that a prisoner must complete in order to earn his freedom,post,at,and it is accounted for through a combination of prison time and credits,post,at,then a prisoner should be released exactly at the end of his term of imprisonment without any further adjustment.because the dissent approach would require us to read words out of the statute,or give prisoners double credit,its definition can not be used here.
second,b tells us that a prisoner receives credit at the end of each year based on behavior during that year.under the dissent approach,however,a prisoner may receive credit at the end of each administrative segmen t presumably based on his behavior during that segment.and because an administrative segmen t is made up of some combination of service and credits,post,at,each one lasts less than a calendar year.we do not see how a system in which a prisoner may complete a particular year of his term in less than calendar days,and receive full good time credit for doing so,can possibly represent the most natural reading of this statutory language.nor do we know,because the bop has not had an opportunity to tell us,whether a system in which a year lasts anywhere from to calendar days and in which the years of a single prisoner sentence may all be of different lengths,is easily administrable.we doubt that this system will be more comprehensible to prisoners than one,like the bop,that provides credit for actual years.
third,under the dissent approach,credit is earned at different rates during a single sentence.for the first administrative segmen t in its example,the prisoner serves days and earns days of credit.the ratio of credit earned to days served is.for the second administrative segmen t,the prisoner serves days and earns days of credit.this time,the ratio of credit earned to days served is.for the last administrative segmen t,the dissent tells us the prisoner will receive credit in a prorated amount,but it does not tell us which ratio should be used for the proration.post,at.the use of different rates finds no support in the statute.the dissent objects that the statute prescribes no particular rate,post,at,but in fact it does days of credit per year of good behavior and it further requires that credit for the last year be prorated using the same proportion.moreover,the dissent application of different rates leads to odd results.for example,a model prisoner sentenced on two separate terms with a break in between will serve a different number of days from one sentenced to a single term.how can this be if both prisoners are earning days of credit for each of their years in prison 
fourth,b provides that good time credit shall vest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.this provision does not apply to prisoners,like petitioners,who committed their offenses before it was amended in,but the dissent plainly intends for its approach to apply more broadly.see post,at noting the effect on almost federal prisoners yet under the dissent approach,credit appears to vest immediately.see post,at days of credit for the first year go toward completion of the next year so that the prisoner would need another days behind bars before the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an end and if it does not,then the situation quickly becomes complicated.what happens if,say,on the last day of the administrative segmen t somewhere in the calendar year,a prisoner badly misbehaves and prison officials punish him by taking away all of his previously earned credit cfr prescribing sanctions for prohibited acts.does the bop retroactively adjust the duration of all of his administrative segments to days so that the prisoner now finds himself in the middle of the administrative segmen t again we do not know if the bop would find such a system administrable,and we doubt that this system would be more comprehensible to a prisoner.if so,does the prisoner have a second opportunity to earn credit for good behavior for the administrative segmen t that he had previously completed but now must account for again b credit that has not been earned may not later be granted or,having previously awarded and taken away credit for that segment,are prison authorities left without any incentive to offer for good behavior 
finally,the dissent,like petitioners,invokes the rule of lenity to support its interpretation.but,the best efforts of the dissent notwithstanding,we still see no grievous ambiguity or uncertainty that would trigger the rule application.we remain convinced that the bop approach reflects the most natural reading of the statutory language and the most consistent with its purpose.whatever the merits of the dissent policy arguments,the statute does not require the bop to accept them.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that the bop methodology is lawful.the ninth circuit judgment is 
a fuller example of the bop method for calculating credit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment 
the defendant is sentenced to years imprisonment.as a prisoner he exhibits exemplary behavior and is awarded the maximum credit of days at the end of each year served in prison.at the end of year,the prisoner has years remaining in his sentence and has accumulated days of good time credit.because the difference between the time remaining in his sentence and the amount of accumulated credit,is less than a year days,year is the last year he will spend in prison.year has been completely offset by of the days of accumulated credit.further,year will be a partial year of days the other days of the year being offset by the remainder of the accumulated credit.
here is where the elementary algebra comes in.we know that x,the good time,plus y,the remaining time served,must add up to.this gives us our first equation x y.
we also know that the ratio of good time earned in the portion of the final year to the amount of time served in that year must equal the ratio of a full year good time credit to the amount of time served in a full year.the latter ratio is or.thus,we know that,or to put it another way,x because we know the value of x in terms of y,we can make a substitution in our first equation to get y y.we then add the two y terms together y,and we solve for y,which gives us y.now we can plug that value into our first equation to solve for x the good time credit.if we subtract from,we find that x.
the offender will have to serve days in prison in year,and he will receive days additional good time credit for that time served.the prisoner total good time is days.his total time served is days.
as a final matter,while we have described the foregoing as the method to calculate credit for the portion of the last year to more transparently track the relevant statutory language,we note that the mathematical formula can be used to calculate the amount of maximum available credit for an entire sentence.using the equations supplied above,if we divide the total number of days in a sentence by,we get the minimum number of days that a defendant must serve in that sentence.if we then subtract the number of days served from the total number of days in the sentence,we arrive at the maximum number of good time credit days the prisoner can earn.the statute,however,awards them on a yearly basis but for the last year or portion thereof.
michael gary barber,et,petitioners thomas,warden 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kennedy,with whom justice stevens and justice ginsburg join,dissenting.
the court has interpreted a federal sentencing statute in a manner that disadvantages almost federal prisoners.see pet.for cert,and.it adopts this reading despite the existence of an alternative interpretation that is more consistent with the statute text.absent a clear congressional directive,the statute ought not to be read as the court reads it.for the court interpretation an interpretation that in my submission is quite incorrect imposes tens of thousands of years of additional prison time on federal prisoners according to a mathematical formula they will be unable to understand.and if the only way to call attention to the human implications of this case is to speak in terms of economics,then it should be noted that the court interpretation comes at a cost to the taxpayers of untold millions of dollars.see,at.the interpretation the court adopts,moreover,will be devastating to the prisoners who have behaved the best and will undermine the purpose of the statute.these considerations,and those stated below,require this respectful dissent.
the federal sentencing statute at issue here provides 
a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than year,other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner life,may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner sentence,beyond the time served,of up to days at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment,beginning at the end of the first year of the term,subject to determination by the bureau of prisons that,during that year,the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations.c redit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.b emphasis added.
according to the court,the phrase term of imprisonment must mean time actually served the third time that it appears in this particular subsection.but the court gives the phrase a different interpretation the first two times it is used in the very same sentence.this in itself indicates that something is quite wrong here.
petitioners invite the court to read term of imprisonment to mean the sentence imposed.this,too,seems unworkable.and it can be acknowledged that the court rejection of this interpretation is correct.
the choice,however,is not just between the court reading and that offered by petitioners.there is a third possibility,one more consistent with the statute than either of these two alternatives.
a fair reading of the statute,and a necessary reading to accomplish its purpose best,is to interpret the phrase term of imprisonment to refer to the span of time that a prisoner must account for in order to obtain release.the length of the term is set at the outset by the criminal sentence imposed.the prisoner earns release when that term has been fully completed.most of the term will be satisfied through time spent behind bars.assuming the prisoner is well behaved,however,he may earn good time credits along the way and those credits may substitute for actual prison time.each year of the term comprises a full days,which must be accounted for through a combination of prison time and credits.thus conceived,a prisoner term is the administrative period along which progress toward eventual freedom is marked.
consider the court example of a prisoner subject to a sentence.see ante,at.the sentence is divided into ten segments.each segment constitutes a year of the term.the prisoner will spend the first days behind bars.in the statute words,he has reached the end of the first year of the term.now is the time for credit to be awarded,and he may receive up to days if sufficiently well behaved.because he has already completed a full year of his term,those credits go toward completion of the next year.if,based on good behavior,he has earned the maximum of days,he would need another days behind bars before the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an end because.if he has earned fewer than days,a longer incarceration will be required to reach.regardless,once the prisoner reaches the en
