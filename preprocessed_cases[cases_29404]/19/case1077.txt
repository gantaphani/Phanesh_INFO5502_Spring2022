factual background 
the structure of the conspiracy and the appellants roles in it are described below as a rational jury could have found further facts relevant to the claims on appeal follow.
between and manuel,not a party to these appeals,led an organization that distributed cocaine,crack cocaine,heroin,and marijuana in the el cerro ward of naranjito.each of the appellants worked for,in various roles.
drug organization sold only to known or clients,usually from el cerro.el cerro geography,which sets it apart from the rest of naranjito,also limited the scope of this organization drug trade.el cerro rests atop a hill,and only one road,which cuts through el cerro,connects it to naranjito.
el cerro runners supplied street dealers with drugs and ensured the dealers gave correct money to.sellers then sold those drugs at regular drug points in el cerro,including a basketball court and a nearby stairwell.sellers sold small packets of drugs out of black fanny packs,a characteristic of the el cerro organization.escorts,usually local drug users,brought clients to drug points and vouched for them.
luis supervised the cocaine trade for.marcos was a seller.juan carlos cooked cocaine hydrochloride into crack cocaine.and rivera maldonado,a naranjito municipal police officer,provided information to the group.
the conspiracy first came to the attention of law enforcement during a separate drug and money laundering investigation.a confidential informant in that case set up a meeting to sell drugs rolando,a member of the conspiracy in this case,came to that drug meeting.for two months in,federal officials wiretapped phone and learned that cooked crack cocaine for his cousin.they also learned that was neighbor and cooked crack with,and that rivera maldonado was cousin and,as well as a corrupt officer.
federal officers investigated the el cerro drug organization for almost two years.investigators conducted personal and video surveillance,wiretapped phones,completed about thirteen controlled drug buys through an undercover police officer buyer,and used a confidential informant from el cerro.
on september,a federal grand jury handed up a indictment against thirty individuals,including the four on appeal in this case,for their participation in the conspiracy.the defendants in this case were charged in count one with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances,and in count with criminal forfeiture,id,
on may,a jury convicted,the seller,the crack cooker,and rivera maldonado,the corrupt officer,on the conspiracy count,count one.the jury also imposed criminal forfeiture on and.on august,the district court sentenced and to months in prison and rivera maldonado to months in prison.it also sentenced all three defendants to five years supervised release and a special assessment.
earlier,on march,luis,the supervisor of the cocaine trade,had pled guilty to the conspiracy and forfeiture counts,specifically to conspiring to distribute between and kilograms of crack cocaine.that quantity,combined with criminal history category,gave him a base offense level of after a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility.sentencing guidelines range was to months.the government,per the plea agreement,recommended a sentence of months in prison,which the court accepted and imposed.
ii.claims of marcos,juan carlos,and emanuel rivera maldonado as to their convictions 
three defendants argue that the evidence of intent and agreement to participate in the conspiracy was insufficient for a conviction.and also argue that the court erred in admitting the testimony of federal bureau of investigation special agent regino chavez,alleging chavez gave improper overview testimony.we reject both claims.
sufficiency of the evidence 
we review the sufficiency of the evidence for a conviction de novo.united states azubike,cir.we take the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution.id.if a reasonable jury could find the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all elements of the charged offense,we must affirm the conviction.id.
on count one,the prosecution had to prove,through direct or circumstantial evidence,beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant knowingly and voluntarily agreed with others to distribute drugs.united states rivera caldern,cir.evidence of a knowing agreement could include evidence that the defendants took actions that furthered the conspiracy goals.united states,cir.
marcos admits on appeal,as he conceded while testifying at trial,that he sold drugs in el cerro,but he says the evidence did not show he sold drugs for the conspiracy.
sufficient evidence connected to the conspiracy.both a lead investigator in the case and a confidential informant identified him and testified that he sold drugs in el cerro.videos showed him selling drugs from black fanny packs,as the conspiracy other sellers did.was shown selling drugs from the stairwell near the basketball court,a regular drug point for this conspiracy.videos showed selling to,interacting with,and standing nearby known conspiracy members and clients.
a jury could easily reject the idea that and his coconspirators would permit a competing drug dealer to sell in the heart of their small,isolated neighborhood at one of their usual drug points.a reasonable juror instead could conclude that sold drugs for this conspiracy and therefore agreed and intended to further its aims.
juan carlos 
the crack cooker,who lived twenty minutes from el cerro,also argues that the evidence showed at most he cooked crack with his neighbor,but not for the rest of the el cerro conspiracy led by.
the evidence was sufficient.in several phone calls,played at trial,and discussed cooking crack together.the evidence supported the jury conclusion that they were collaborating to cook crack for el cerro organization for two reasons.
first,the jury heard many phone calls in which discussed his work as a cooker with a number of conspiracy members over a period of months.in particular,discussed his work with the conspiracy leader,who was cousin.he reported his progress cooking crack,discussed how to buy more cocaine to cook,and planned how to deliver drugs to and receive payment.
second,many calls played before the jury between and supported the inference that they were working for,since they referenced several times by his street name.reported to instructions and comments about their work cooking crack,and he did so once shortly after he had ended a call with.
emanuel rivera maldonado 
rivera maldonado,the former naranjito municipal police officer,urges that the evidence did not show that he intended to help a drug conspiracy or even that he knew he had spoken with a conspiracy member he says he was simply helping family.he did,from his position as a police officer,provide help to the conspiracy,and a reasonable jury could conclude that he knew what he was doing and intended to assist the drug conspiracy.phone calls captured on the wiretap between rivera maldonado and rolando,who cooked for the el cerro group,linked rivera maldonado to the larger conspirac
