a person with three convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses who commits a federal firearms crime is an armed career criminal and must be sentenced to at least years in prison so says the armed career criminal act acca,for short.see e.under the governing rule,the government must prove the existence of the prior convictions by a preponderance of the evidence.see united states mulkern,cir.see also united states dancy,cir.the standard is a rule.mulkern,at quoting united states vixamar,cir.
now meet james edwards,the defendant in today case.edwards pled guilty without a plea agreement to a bunch of federal firearms offenses under g these pleas added to his already long criminal record,which included massachusetts convictions for unarmed robbery,assault with a dangerous weapon,distribution of a controlled substance,and armed assault with intent to murder.the district judge concluded that convictions and unarmed robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon,respectively are violent felonies.and edwards conceded then,as now that conviction distribution of a controlled substance is a serious drug offense.as for conviction armed assault with intent to murder the judge thought it is not a violent felony because no binding caselaw directly holds that it is.so relying on convictions,and,the judge deemed edwards an armed career criminal and sentenced him to years behind bars.
unhappy with this outcome,edwards appeals.but examining the matter afresh,see united states dawn,cir,we affirm though our analysis differs in some respects from the judge.
narrowing of the issues 
edwards attacks his sentence on a variety of grounds,not all of which require extended discussion.
for example,edwards insists that the judge blundered by imposing sentence on the basis of prior convictions that were not included in the indictment,not admitted by him,and not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.recognizing that his argument runs smack into almendarez torres united states,a precedent we must apply until the justices themselves say otherwise,he raises the issue only to preserve it for possible supreme court review.so we need say no more about that argument.and though he says that united states whindleton,cir,cert.dismissed,and cert.denied,holds that assault with a dangerous weapon in massachusetts is a violent felony,he notes his objection to that holding simply to preserve it for possible further review.enough said about that issue too.with two predicates properly counted assault with a dangerous weapon thanks to whindleton and distribution of a controlled substance thanks to his concession edwards is left to argue that neither the conviction nor the conviction is a violent felony.and so,his argument continues,neither conviction can provide the necessary third predicate for his acca sentence.but because for reasons shortly stated we conclude that his conviction does qualify as an acca predicate,we need not decide whether his conviction does as well.
on,then,to the issue.
conviction as the third acca predicate 
acca basics 
pertinently for edwards case,acca defines a violent felony as a crime punishable by a prison term exceeding one year that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,see e b i this is known as the elements clause and physical force,we know,means not simply what force means in physics,but violent force that is,force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.johnson united states johnson i.
in deciding whether the elements clause covers armed assault with intent to murder,we look only to the crime statutory definition,not to edwards specific conduct courts call that the categorical approach.see,mathis united states,and after figuring out the crime definition,we must see whether the minimum conduct criminalized by the statute elements matches acca definition,see moncrieffe holder,if there is no match,then the state conviction is not an acca predicate,see mathis,at.but and it is an important but as we shall see our focus is not an invitation to apply legal imagination to the state offense there must be a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that massachusetts would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside acca definition.see moncrieffe,at quoting gonzales,
statute of conviction 
the relevant statute of conviction pertinently says that w hoever,being armed with a dangerous weapon,assaults another with intent to murder shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than twenty years.laws ch,b.according to massachusetts highest court the supreme judicial court armed assault with an intent to murder requires proof of assault while armed with a dangerous weapon and a specific intent to kill that equates with malice,with malice in this context meaning a lack of justification,excuse,or mitigation.commonwealth vick,quoting commonwealth johnston.and,unsurprisingly,an intent to kill may be inferred from the defendant conduct,commonwealth henson,seen in light of the surrounding circumstances,see commonwealth lewis.
parties positions 
the gist of the parties arguments is easily stated.
focusing on the word assault in the phrase armed assault with intent to murder,edwards correctly says that in massachusetts a person can commit an assault in one of two ways through an attempted battery or through an immediately threatened battery.see whindleton,at citing and quoting commonwealth porro.a battery,he rightly adds,is a harmful or offensive touching.see id.citing and quoting commonwealth burke.relevantly for our purposes,we know that a harmful battery results from a ny touching with such violence that bodily harm is likely to result,while an offensive battery results from an intentional,touching that is an affront to the victim personal integrity.burke,at quoting commonwealth farrell,see also commonwealth eberhart.now,an offensive touching,he further and again correctly notes,does not necessarily involve sufficient force under johnson i,see united states martinez,cir.remember,johnson i says the type of force that comes within the elements clause is force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person,see at.putting this all together,he insists that because a person may be convicted of armed assault with intent to murder under the branch of assault,the conviction is not a predicate violent felony under acca elements clause.
for its part,the government rightly points out that we quote from its brief t he crime of armed assault with intent to murder adds the additional elements that a defendant be armed and have a specific intent to kill that equates with malice.and these additional elements,the government continues,negate the possibility that a defendant might be convicted of armed assault with the intent to murder that involves a mere attempted or threatened offensive touching.so according to the government,edwards conviction is a predicate violent felony under acca elements clause.
we believe the government has the better of this debate.yes,as edwards argues,someone can commit the massachusetts crime of simple assault with offensive touching the prototypical examples being spitting on the victim,see commonwealth cohen.app,tickling her,see commonwealth hartnett.app,or physically moving her to another room,see parreira commonwealth.and yes,as he also notes,offensive touching fails the force requirement sketched in johnson see whindleton,at discussing martinez,at.but we can not accept the next part of his argument that because the statute has assault as an element and because someone can commit an assault without the sort of violent force required by johnson i,a conviction under that statute can not be an acca predicate.for doing so would require us to read the state statute with blinders on.and that we can not do in seeing if a crime involves the use,attempted use,or threatened use of in johnson i words force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person,we must focus not just on one element here,assault but on all elements.see id.
recall how the statute outlaws emphases ours assault with intent to murde
