on april,respondent burt lancaster,a former police officer with a long history of severe problems,shot and killed his girlfriend.at his jury trial in michigan state court,lancaster asserted a defense of diminished capacity.under michigan court of appeals precedent,the defense permitted a legally sane defendant to present evidence of mental illness to negate the specific intent required to commit a particular crime.apparently unpersuaded by lancaster defense,the jury convicted him of murder and a related firearm offense.lancaster,however,later obtained federal habeas relief from these convictions.
by the time of lancaster retrial,the michigan supreme court had rejected the defense in its decision in carpenter.although the murder with which lancaster was charged occurred several years before carpenter was decided,the judge at his second trial applied carpenter and therefore disallowed renewal of his defense.lancaster was again convicted.affirming,the michigan court of appeals rejected lancaster argument that the trial court retroactive application of carpenter violated due process.
lancaster reasserted his due process claim in a federal habeas petition.the district court denied the petition,but the sixth circuit reversed.concluding that the michigan supreme court rejection of the defense was unforeseeable in april,when lancaster killed his girlfriend,the sixth circuit held that,by rejecting lancaster due process claim,the michigan court of appeals had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.
held lancaster is not entitled to federal habeas relief.
a under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,lancaster may obtain federal habeas relief only if the michigan court of appeals,in rejecting his due process claim,unreasonably applied clearly established federal law,as determined by this court.d.this standard is difficult to meet lancaster must show that the michigan court of appeals decision rested on an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington richter.to determine whether lancaster has satisfied that demanding standard,the court first considers two key decisions bouie city of columbia,and rogers tennessee.it then considers whether the michigan court of appeals decision qualifies as an unreasonable application of those decisions to lancaster case.
b bouie concerned petitioners who had refused to leave a south carolina drug store restaurant area after entering without notice that the store policy barred their entry.they were convicted under a south carolina trespass statute prohibiting entry upon the lands of another after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.at.the south carolina supreme court based its affirmance of the petitioners convictions on its prior decision in mitchell,where the court held that the trespass statute reached both unauthorized entries and the act of remaining on the premises of another after receiving notice to leave.at.mitchell,however,was rendered months after the petitioners arrest.this court held that the due process clause prohibited mitchell retroactive application to the bouie petitioners,stressing that mitchell interpretation of the state trespass statute was clearly at variance with the statutory language and ha d not the slightest support in prior south carolina decisions.at.
in rogers,the petitioner contested the tennessee supreme court retroactive abolition of the year and a day rule,which barred a murder conviction unless the victim had died by the defendant act within a year and a day of the act.at.this court found no due process violation.j udicial alteration of a common law doctrine of criminal law,the court held,violates the principle of fair warning,and hence must not be given retroactive effect,only where the alteration is unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.at.judged by this standard,the retroactive abolition of the year and a day rule encountered no constitutional impediment.the rule was widely viewed as an outdated relic of the common law,had been routinely rejected by modern courts and legislators,and had been mentioned in reported tennessee decisions only three times,and each time in dicta.at.
c the michigan court of appeals rejection of lancaster due process claim does not represent an unreasonable application of the law this court declared in bouie and rogers.
the michigan court of appeals first recognized the defense in.two years later,the michigan legislature prescribed comprehensive requirements for defenses based on mental illness or retardation.in,the michigan court of appeals ruled that the defense fit within the codified definition of insanity.the michigan supreme court decision in carpenter,however,rejected that position,holding that the defense was not encompassed within the michigan legislature comprehensive scheme for defenses and thus could not be invoked by criminal defendants.
in light of this court precedent and the history of michigan defense,the michigan court of appeals decision applying carpenter retroactively is not an unreasonable application of clearly established f ederal law.d.this case is a far cry from bouie,where the south carolina supreme court unexpectedly expanded narrow and precise statutory language that,as written,did not reach the petitioners conduct,at.in carpenter,by contrast,the michigan supreme court rejected a defense that the court reasonably found to have no home in a comprehensive,statute enacted by the michigan legislature.although lancaster due process claim is arguably less weak than the due process claim rejected in rogers,the court did not hold in rogers that a newly announced judicial rule may be applied retroactively only if the rule it replaces was an outdated relic rarely appearing in a jurisdiction case law,at.distinguishing rogers thus does little to bolster lancaster argument that the michigan court of appeals decision unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.this court has never found a due process violation in circumstances remotely resembling lancaster case,where a state supreme court,squarely addressing a particular issue for the first time,rejected a consistent line of lower court decisions based on the supreme court reasonable interpretation of the language of a controlling statute.fairminded jurists could conclude that a state supreme court decision of that order is not unexpected and indefensible by reference to existing law.at.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
burt lancaster was convicted in michigan state court of murder and a related firearm offense.at the time the crime was committed,michigan intermediate appellate court had repeatedly recognized diminished capacity as a defense negating the mens rea element of murder.by the time of lancaster trial and conviction,however,the michigan supreme court in people carpenter,had rejected the defense.lancaster asserts that retroactive application of the michigan supreme court decision in carpenter denied him due process of law.on habeas review,a federal court must assess a claim for relief under the demanding standard set by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.under that standard,lancaster may gain relief only if the decision he assails was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by this court.d.we hold that lancaster petition does not meet aedpa requirement and that the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit erred in granting him federal habeas relief.
on april,lancaster,a former police officer with a long history of severe problems,shot and killed his girlfriend in a parking lot.at his jury trial in michigan state court,lancaster admitted that he had killed his girlfriend but asserted insanity and defenses.under michigan court of appeals precedent,a defendant who pleaded diminished capacity,although he was legally sane,could offer evidence of some mental abnormality to negate the specific intent required to commit a particular crime.carpenter,at,at.if a defendant succeeded in showing that mental illness prevented him from form ing the specific state of mind required as an essential element of a crime,he could be convicted only of a lower grade of the offense not requiring that particular mental element.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.
apparently unpersuaded by lancaster defenses,the jury convicted him of murder,in violation of.comp.laws ann.west and possessing a firearm in the commission of a felony,in violation of b west cum.supp.lancaster later obtained federal habeas relief from these convictions,however,because,in conflict with batson kentucky,the prosecutor had exercised a peremptory challenge to remove a potential juror.see lancaster adams.
lancaster was retried in.by that time,the michigan supreme court had disapproved the series of michigan court of appeals decisions recognizing the defense.carpenter,at,at.in rejecting the defense,michigan high court observed that,in,the michigan legislature had enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme concerning defenses based on either mental illness or mental retardation.at,at.that scheme,the michigan supreme court concluded,demonstrate d the legislature intent to preclude the use of any evidence of a defendant lack of mental capacity short of legal insanity to avoid or reduce criminal responsibility.ibid.
although the murder with which lancaster was charged occurred several years before the michigan supreme court decision in carpenter,the judge presiding at lancaster second trial applied carpenter holding and therefore disallowed renewal of lancaster defense.following a bench trial,lancaster was again convicted.the trial court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment for the murder conviction and a consecutive sentence for the related firearm offense.
lancaster appealed,unsuccessfully,to the michigan court of appeals.see app.to pet.for cert.the appeals court rejected lancaster argument that retroactive application of carpenter to his case violated his right to due process.d ue process concerns prevent retroactive application of judicial decisions in some cases,the court acknowledged,especially where the decision is unforeseeable and has the effect of changing existing law.app.to pet.for cert.but carpenter did not involve a change in the law,the court of appeals reasoned,because it concerned an unambiguous statute that was interpreted by the michigan supreme court for the first time.app.to pet.for cert.
after the michigan supreme court declined review,lancaster reasserted his due process claim in a federal habeas petition filed under.the district court denied the petition,supp.ed,but it granted a certificate of appealability,see c.
a divided panel of the sixth circuit reversed.the michigan supreme court decision in carpenter was unforeseeable,the court of appeals majority concluded,given the michigan court of appeals consistent recognition of the defense the michigan supreme court repeated references to the defense without casting a shadow of doubt on it and the inclusion of the defense in the michigan state bar pattern jury instructions,at.these considerations persuaded the sixth circuit majority that,in rejecting lancaster due process claim,the michigan court of appeals had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law,at.accordingly,the sixth circuit ruled that lancaster was entitled to a new trial at which he could present his defense,at.dissenting,chief judge batchelder concluded that the michigan court of appeals denial of lancaster due process claim was reasonable because the defense was not in michigan and its elimination was,therefore,foreseeable.at.
this court granted certiorari.
to obtain federal habeas relief under aedpa strictures,lancaster must establish that,in rejecting his due process claim,the michigan court of appeals unreasonably applied federal law clearly established in our decisions.see d this standard,we have explained,is difficult to meet to obtain habeas corpus relief from a federal court,a state prisoner must show that the challenged ruling rested on an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington richter,slip,at.to determine whether lancaster has satisfied that demanding standard,we consider first two of this court key decisions bouie city of columbia,and rogers tennessee.we then consider whether the michigan court of appeals decision qualifies as an unreasonable application of those decisions to the particular circumstances of lancaster case 
in bouie,the petitioners were convicted of trespass under south carolina law after they refused to comply with orders to leave a drug store restaurant department,a facility reserved for white customers,at.this court held that the convictions violated the due process requirement that a criminal statute give fair warning of the conduct which it prohibits.at.the state statute under which the petitioners were convicted,the court emphasized,prohibited entry upon the lands of another after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.at emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted.it was undisputed that the petitioners were invited to enter the store and had received no notice that they were barred from the restaurant area before they occupied booth seats,at.nevertheless,the south carolina supreme court affirmed the petitioners convictions based on its prior decision in charleston mitchell.bouie,at.the mitchell decision,which the south carolina supreme court found dispositive,was rendered months after the petitioners arrest,at.mitchell held that the trespass statute under which the petitioners were convicted reached not only unauthorized entries it proscribed as well the act of remaining on the premises of another after receiving notice to leave.at.
we held that the due process clause prohibited mitchell retroactive application to the bouie petitioners.in so ruling,we stressed that mitchell interpretation of the south carolina trespass statute was clearly at variance with the statutory language and ha d not the slightest support in prior south carolina decisions.at.due process,we said,does not countenance an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of narrow and precise statutory language.at.
in rogers,the petitioner contested the tennessee supreme court retroactive abolition of the year and a day rule.at.that rule barred a murder conviction unless the victim had died by the defendant act within a year and a day of the act.ibid.the victim in rogers had died some months after the petitioner stabbed him,at.we held that the tennessee supreme court refusal to adhere to the year and a day rule in the petitioner case did not violate due process,at.the due process limitations on the retroactive application of judicial decisions,we explained,are not coextensive with the limitations placed on legislatures by the constitution ex post facto clauses,at.see also,art.i,cl,cl.calder bull,dall,seriatim opinion of chase,describing four categories of laws prohibited by the constitution ex post facto clauses.strictly applying ex post facto principles to judicial decisionmaking,we recognized,would place an unworkable and unacceptable restraint on normal judicial processes and would be incompatible with the resolution of uncertainty that marks any evolving legal system.rogers,at.j udicial alteration of a common law doctrine of criminal law,we therefore held,violates the principle of fair warning,and hence must not be given retroactive effect,only where the alteration is unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the
