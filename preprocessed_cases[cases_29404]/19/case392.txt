in these consolidated criminal appeals,karapet dzhanikyan and ronald martinez raise a number of challenges to their convictions,including some that concern the district court decision to try the two men together.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm each of the convictions except for martinez conviction for conspiring to use extortionate means to collect an extension of credit in violation of a.
the initial indictment charging dzhanikyan and martinez was handed down in and arose out of a wiretap investigation of a suspected drug trafficker named safwan madarati.a superseding indictment,containing eleven total counts and naming fifteen defendants,was handed down in.
five counts of the superseding indictment named dzhanikyan or martinez.dzhanikyan was charged with one count of conspiring with madarati and others to distribute oxycodone,in violation of count.martinez was charged with two counts of conspiring with madarati and others to attempt to collect a debt through extortionate means,in violation of a counts and,and two counts of possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute it,in violation of a counts and.
before trial,martinez moved to be tried separately from all of his,including dzhanikyan.martinez also moved to be tried separately on each of the four counts he faced.in january of,the district court denied martinez motions for severance.dzhanikyan made no severance motion.
by the time the trial began on june,all of the of dzhanikyan and martinez had pleaded guilty.the trial thus proceeded with only dzhanikyan and martinez as defendants.
after the presentation of the evidence at trial,martinez moved under federal rule of criminal procedure a for acquittal on all the counts for which he had been charged.the district court granted martinez motion as to the first of the two counts that had charged him with using extortionate means to collect an extension of credit count.that extortion count charged martinez with conspiring to use extortionate means to collect an extension of credit by madarati to a jewelry store owner.the alleged extortionate means involved shooting the store windows and resulted in injuries to several people.
the district court denied martinez motion as to the remaining counts against him,including as to the second extortion count count.that extortion count charged martinez with conspiring to use extortionate means to collect a separate extension of credit by madarati.the alleged extortionate means involved an attempted of the house of the purported debtor.
following the district court ruling on the rule a motion,jury deliberations began.in the midst of the deliberations,the jury submitted two questions to the district court.one of those questions is at issue in these appeals can we use all the evidence presented during the trial as we evaluate each individual charge the district court proposed to answer that question by saying simply,yes.
martinez counsel raised a concern about the proposed answer.she requested that the district court make clear that the jury could not rely on evidence from martinez dismissed,extortion count in considering at least the remaining extortion count against martinez.martinez counsel did not actually propose such an instruction,however.martinez counsel explained that she would need some time to come up with the right wording.the district court made clear that in its view there was no need for any limiting instruction.dzhanikyan raised no objection to the district court proposed answer to the jury question.
the district court called the jurors back into the courtroom and told them that the answer to their question was,yes.after addressing the jury other question,the district court asked the jury and you understand the use of all of the evidence with respect to each charge as it applies to that charge the jury responded by nodding.
the jury returned guilty verdicts against dzhanikyan and martinez on all four remaining counts.following the verdicts,the defendants moved for both a judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure a and a new trial under federal rule of criminal procedure the motion for a new trial contended that the district court yes response to the jury question resulted in evidentiary spillover,a variance,and retroactive misjoinder.the district court denied the defendants rule a motions and their joint motion for a new trial.
in considering the defendants challenges on appeal,we start with their individual challenges to the district court initial decision to try them together and to the district court denial of their joint motion for new trial.we then consider martinez separate challenges to his extortion conviction on count.
a trial judge has considerable latitude in deciding severance questions,and thus,even when a challenge to a decision to try a defendant jointly has been properly preserved,the judge resolution of those questions will be overturned only if that wide discretion is plainly abused.united states,cir quoting united states natanel,cir.an abuse of discretion in declining to sever a trial may be found,however,if a defendant who seeks a separate trial can mak e a strong showing of evident prejudice.id.and that strong showing may be made if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.id.quoting zafiro united states,d.with that background in place,we now turn to the challenges the defendants bring both individually and jointly to the decision to try them together.
dzhanikyan contends that there was a serious risk here that,in consequence of the joint trial,the jury would not be able to render a reliable verdict because the evidence the government intended to put forth about martinez involvement in the two alleged extortion schemes was highly inflammatory and prejudicial.dzhanikyan did not raise this challenge below,however,and so his challenge,if not waived,is subject to review only for plain error.see united states magana,cir reviewing unpreserved misjoinder claim for plain error 
to satisfy the demanding standard,dzhanikyan must show that an error occurred,the error was obvious,the error affected substantial rights,and the error seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states lanza v√°zquez,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.but he can not make that showing.
it is not obvious that the government evidence about martinez use of extortionate means to collect an extension of credit would create a serious risk that the jury would be prevented from making a reliable judgment about dzhanikyan role in committing the distinct and unrelated drug conspiracy crime for which he was charged.that evidence,to be sure,did involve descriptions of very violent activity.but given the minimal risk that the jury would believe that the evidence against martinez pertaining to extortion was relevant to the government case against dzhanikyan for drug distribution,we conclude that dzhanikyan has not shown that the district court plainly erred in exercising its broad discretion to decide whether to sever dzhanikyan trial from that of martinez.see united states de la paz rentas,cir rejecting a defendant severance challenge where the trial included substantial evidence of his gun dealings with which the defendant had no involvement but where there was no reason for the jury to be confused about the defendant role.
before trial,martinez offered a different reason for contending that the district court should try the two defendants separately.martinez contended that the decision to try the two of them together risked prejudicing the jury ability to make a reliable judgment about whether martinez intended to distribute the crack cocaine that he was charged with possessing.
on appeal,the government contends that martinez has failed to renew this challenge to us and that this challenge has therefore been waived.but even assuming the government is wrong on that score,martinez challenge to the district court decision not to sever his trial from dzhankiyan still fails.
martinez bases his severance argument on the evidence that the government was to put forth concerning dzhanikyan alleged involvement in madarati alleged conspiracy.that evidence concerned dzhanikyan alleged travel to california to make substantial purchases of oxycodone pills on behalf of madarati.martinez contends that this evidence regarding his alleged involvement in drug distribution would prejudice the jury evaluation of whether martinez possessed the requisite intent to distribute the drugs that he was charged with possessing.
martinez points out that other evidence supported his contention that he possessed the drugs for personal use.and he points in that regard to the trial testimony of an expert witness that the amount of crack cocaine with which martinez was charged with possessing grams of crack cocaine was consistent with possession for personal use rather than with possession with an intent to distribute.
but martinez does not contend on appeal that his trial on the extortion counts should have been severed from his trial on the crack cocaine possession count.and thus martinez necessarily concedes that even if his trial had been severed from dzhanikyan,the jury still would have been exposed to evidence about madarati drug distribution conspiracy.after all,to show that martinez conspired to use extortionate means to collect an extension of credit,as count alleged,the government needed to put forward evidence that there was an extension of credit.and the government case in that regard consisted,in significant part,of evidence that a man named victor loukas had traveled more times to california on behalf of madarati than had dzhanikyan,and as part of madarati conspiracy,to buy more total oxycodone pills for more money than had dzhanikyan.
in consequence,any severance challenge martinez makes on appeal necessarily amounts only to a complaint about the incremental additional risk of prejudice that would arise from the jury hearing more about a topic about which the jury would already have heard much.we thus do not see how martinez can successfully contend that the jury exposure to the additional evidence about drug distribution that pertained to dzhanikyan created the kind of serious risk of prejudice that could suffice to show that the district court abused its discretion in deciding to try martinez and dzhanikyan together.see,at.we thus reject martinez challenge to the district court initial decision to decline to sever his trial from that of his codefendant.
looking past the district court initial decision not to sever the trials of martinez and dzhanikyan,the defendants contend as they did in their joint motion for new trial that they were impermissibly prejudiced once the trial began by the yes answer that the district court gave to the jury question about which evidence the jury could use.specifically,the defendants renew their contention that the district court answer to the jury question caused evidentiary spillover,resulting in a variance,in which the crimes charged against them varied from the crimes for which they were ultimately convicted,see united states dellosantos,cir,or a retroactive misjoinder,in which trying the defendants together was rendered improper by developments at trial,see united states mubayyid,cir.
but the defendants contention does not hold up.i nstructions must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the entire charge.jones united states,d.and once the district court answer to the jury is considered in this way,it becomes clear that the district court answer to the jury question did not give rise to the concern about the claimed evidentiary spillover on which the defendants variance and retroactive misjoinder challenges depend.
in its main charge,the district court expressly instructed the jury that the defendants were charged with different crimes and that the jury had a duty to consider the evidence separately as to each defendant and as to each count which a defendant is charged.the district court then explained each count as it related to each defendant and instructed the jury what it would need to find to convict each defendant on each count and,finally,the district court sought to confirm the jury proper understanding of the instructions as a whole.the district court did so by saying,after offering its yes answer to the jury question about what evidence could be used and you understand the use of all of the evidence with respect to each charge as it applies to that charge 
thus,considered in the context of the instructions as a whole,the district court affirmative answer to the jury question did not effectively instruct the jury that it could use evidence of one crime to make a judgment of guilt about a separate crime to which that evidence had no relation.accordingly,the defendants challenge to the district court denial of the motion for a new trial must fail.
we now turn to martinez separate challenges to his conviction on count.in that count,the government charged martinez with violating a by conspiring with madarati and another man named kabba to use extortionate means to attempt to collect an extension of credit that had been made by madarati.
martinez raised his challenge in his motion for acquittal,and so we review the record de novo.see united states munyenyezi,cir.in doing so,we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the verdict.id.we may reverse the conviction only if on the basis of this evidence no rational jury could have found martinez guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
thus,to sustain martinez conviction on this count,the government must show that there was sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could find not only that martinez conspired to use extortionate means,but also that martinez had used those means to collect payment for an underlying extension of credit from madarati.martinez contends that there was not sufficient evidence to support the conviction because the record provides too little evidence that madarati had made an extension of credit.and we agree with martinez on this point 
in evaluating martinez challenge,we start with the text of the criminal statute and how it defines what an extension of credit is.under a,it is a crime to knowingly participate in any way,or conspire to do so,in the use of any extortionate means to collect or attempt to collect any extension of credit.the statute then defines t o extend credit as to make or renew any loan,or to enter into any agreement,tacit or express,whereby the repayment or satisfaction of any debt or claim,whether acknowledged or disputed,valid or invalid,and however arising,may or will be deferred.id.
the government charged martinez with conspiring with madarati to use extortionate means making threats and planting evidence to attempt to collect an alleged extension of credit that madarati had made to victor loukas.loukas was the man who took two trips to california to purchase thousands of dollars of oxycodone pills for madarati with madarati money.
in giving loukas money to buy pills for madarati,madarati was not fronting money to loukas for his personal use.madarati was supplying loukas with the means to perform a service for madarati namely,purchasing drugs that madarati could then.thus,consistent with its presentation to the jury below,the government does not argue on appeal that,in giving the money to loukas to make the purchases,madarati made a loan within the meaning of.united states bruce,cir 
but,as the plain text of reveals,the statute has a broad reach and clearly bars the use of extortionate means to collect payment for more than traditional loans.see united states hoyle,cir citing united states sedlak,cir.in particular,the statute covers any attempt to use extortionate means to collect an extension of credit.and the statute defines that phrase expansively,so that it encompasses any agreement,tacit or express,whereby the repayment or satisfaction of any debt or claim,whether acknowledged or disputed,valid or invalid,and however arising,may or will be deferred.
the key question,therefore,is whether the record supplies sufficient indicia of such an agreement.see hoyle,at finding sufficient indicia of agreement to conclude that an agreement to defer payment of the debts existed.before delving into what the record shows about whether such an agreement existed here,however,we need to say more about what is meant by the requirement that there be an agreement.
in our last case addressing the issue,hoyle,at,we noted that the third circuit has reasoned in upholding the sufficiency of an indictment under that w hen a creditor appears before his debtor and demands satisfaction,the creditor posits both a debt and the prior deferral of its repayment.united states dipasquale,cir see hoyle,at.and the third circuit has cited the rule of dipasquale in finding sufficient evidence of an agreement to defer payment and thus an extension of credit to support convictions under on at least two occasions.see bruce,at united states traitz,cir hoyle,at finding it unnecessary under the circumstances to rely on dipasquale to uphold the conviction.
but to the extent dipasquale suggests that a mere demand for payment,or even that a demand for payment that is not immediately followed by the use of extortionate means,suffices to show that there has been an agreement to defer payment and thus an extension of credit,we disagree.by its plain terms,the statute distinguishes a mere debt from an extension of credit on the basis of whether there has been an agreement to defer payment.see united states boulahanis,cir section does not make it a crime to use extortion to collect debts,but only to exact repayment of credit previously extended.
thus,when there is not a loan,we hold consistent with the decisions of a number of our sister circuits that the government must prove that the creditor manifested an assent even if only unilaterally and even if only tacitly to defer payment.see united states wallace,cir united states stokes,cir p roof of some manifestation by the creditor of his assent to defer,however minimal,burdens the government case.boulahanis,at the extension of credit is a deliberate act by a creditor.only then is there sufficient evidence of an agreement whereby the repayment or satisfaction of any debt or claim may or will be deferred.
accordingly,in reviewing the record here,we are looking not merely for evidence of a demand for immediate payment.we are looking for what we found in hoyle sufficient indicia of agreement to conclude that an agreement to defer payment of the debt existed.see hoyle,at.absent such evidence,the conviction must be reversed.
the question of exactly what constitutes evidence of an agreement for legal purposes is often not susceptible to a answer.rather,one must consider the facts in light of the context.and this is true for the agreement referenced in.
the same actions or communications may carry different implications depending on that context.in some circumstances,for example,a creditor silence might fairly be characterized as a tacit agreement to defer payment such as where the creditor faces his debtor and stays silent rather than making or implying a demand for immediate payment.see hoyle,at.but in others,the creditor silence may indicate only an intent not to alter whatever message the creditor had most recently communicated to the debtor.and where that message was a demand for immediate payment,silence may indicate only that the prior demand has not been withdrawn.
thus,as the relevant precedents amply demonstrate,determining whether the record in a given case includes sufficient indicia of agreement to support the inference that a creditor agreed to defer payment will often require a particularized review of both the creditor conduct and the surrounding context.here,our review of the record leads us to the conclusion that madarati never agreed tacitly or expressly to defer loukas payment.
the government brief is less than clear in identifying the evidence in the record that suffices to show that madarati agreed to defer the payment of what loukas owed.but at oral argument,the government explained that it does contend that the deferral occurred at the time loukas took off to california with the money.the government contended instead that the agreement to defer repayment or satisfaction occurred later,when loukas returned from california.
at that point,the government contends,loukas did owe madarati either the pills that loukas was to buy with madarati money or the money itself.and,in the government view,when madarati made contact with loukas following his return to boston but then waited more than a week before undertaking extortionate means to collect payment,madarati tacitly agreed to defer payment by loukas 
in pressing this contention,the government identifies certain specific actions that madarati took or,in some cases,failed to take that allegedly show that he was tacitly agreeing to give loukas more time to pay.but,we conclude,the record does not supply sufficient evidence of such a tacit agreement on madarati part.
to see why,it first helps to describe what the record shows about what had transpired before madarati met with loukas when loukas came back to boston from his trip to california.loukas testified that on march,as he was on his way to the airport in los angeles at the end of his second solo trip to california on madarati behalf,he called madarati.in that call,loukas testified,he told madarati that the police had pulled loukas over while loukas was heading to the airport and confiscated all the pills that loukas had just purchased with madarati money.
in truth,however,according to loukas testimony,loukas had purchased the pills for madarati as requested but then given the pills to a friend who sold the pills on his own and split the profit with loukas.in other words,loukas testified,the police had not confiscated the pills.instead,loukas stole the pills from madarati and then came up with a cover story to tell madarati in order to hide his theft.
there is no evidence in the record about how madarati responded to loukas false story when he first heard it.but loukas conceded in his testimony that the story he told madarati was an outrageous one that no one would likely believe.and thus it is not surprising that the record shows that when loukas arrived in boston,he basically disappeared for a day,such that madarati had no idea where i was.
in light of what the record shows regarding these events,a rational jury could not find that madarati assented even tacitly to give loukas more time to provide the pills or the money as of the first day after loukas had returned to boston.the record shows only that,as of that time,loukas had told madarati an outrageous lie to explain why he did not have the pills or the money and that loukas then effectively hid from madarati upon returning to boston.
nor does the record provide sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find that madarati assented to the deferral of loukas payment thereafter.to explain why we reach this conclusion,we begin with what the record shows about the first contact that loukas made with madarati after loukas came back to boston.
loukas testified that about a day after he got back from los angeles,loukas turned his phone back on,called madarati,and told him to meet me at my home.according to the testimony given by loukas,he and madarati talked for about an hour when they met on march.at that meeting,according to loukas testimony,loukas repeated the same false story that he had relayed to madarati over the phone from california.then,loukas testified,at madarati suggestion the two men left loukas house in madarati wife car and drove to a convenience store.
loukas testified that during that ride,madarati made no threats to loukas and that a t that moment i thought he was buying the story.but,loukas testimony reveals,madarati quickly changed his tone once the two men arrived at the convenience store.loukas testified that when the two men got to the parking lot of the convenience store,madarati proceeded to let me know that he hoped it was me who took the pills because he would take care of the problem like he did at the jewelry store,referring to the shooting incident that resulted in injuries to innocent bystanders and provided the basis for count of the indictment in this case.
neither completely excusing a debt or claim,nor threatening violence if no payment is made,can fairly be characterized by itself as assenting to the deferral of the payment of what is owed.and thus,on these facts,it would be overly speculative for a jury to conclude that,in making clear the dire consequences that would befall loukas if he was lying about what had happened to the pills,madarati was actually agreeing to give loukas more time to pay the debt.see wallace,at n one of the evidence presented at trial amounted to the formation of a credit agreement,because wallace and his representatives never agreed to defer the collection of their money.after making their threats,they merely and temporarily left capri intact.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted united states morillo,cir we must conduct a close review of the record and reject those evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable,insupportable,or overly speculative.citation omitted.
that leaves only the time period between the conversation and the actual use of extortionate means.but the record does not show that madarati did anything during that time period that would provide sufficient evidence for a jury to find that madarati was agreeing even tacitly to give loukas more time to pay.
the record shows that on march,the day after the two men spoke in the convenience store parking lot,madarati called loukas and repeatedly demanded his shit,even telling loukas he would see him today.moreover,in the only other conversation between the two men reflected in the record,madarati spoke to loukas in loukas driveway and made clear to loukas that madarati wanted his money or he wanted the pills.thus,madarati did not in these interactions in any way suggest that loukas had more time to pay.
in arguing that madarati nevertheless tacitly agreed to defer the payment following the conversation,the government cites to a series of conversations between madarati and the third man charged in the conspiracy,kabba,between april and april.in those conversations,the two men discussed ways to intimidate loukas and to induce him to pay.the government notes in particular an april call between kabba and madarati during which madarati expressly chose not to go through with a plan to frame loukas by planting cocaine in his house and calling the police.and the government contended at oral argument that the delay between that call and the ultimate execution by madarati and kabba of another version of their plan which led to martinez arrest near loukas house on april provides a sufficient evidentiary basis for a jury to find that madarati tacitly agreed to a deferral given the time that passed before madarati resorted to the use of extortionate means.
but the record evidence concerning madarati conversations with kabba between april and april is not sufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that madarati was,despite his demands for immediate payment,actually agreeing to allow loukas to take more time to pay.in plotting how best to effect the collection of what he was owed and what he had demanded be paid,madarati did not at any point withdraw his earlier,clearly stated demand for immediate payment,which followed right on the heels of the threat.indeed,during each conversation between madarati and loukas in the period in question,madarati demanded immediate payment from loukas.
to be sure,as the government emphasizes,madarati did delay the use of extortionate means to collect payment for a number of days.but it is the use of extortionate means to collect an extension of credit and not their use to collect a debt that the statute prohibits.see boulahanis,at.and thus evidence of a delay in using extortionate means to collect a debt for which a demand for immediate payment has been made does not itself suffice to show that credit has been extended.see wallace,at 
for these reasons,this case is not just like hoyle,at,even though the government,like the district court,relies on that precedent to support the conviction.in that case,an electrician had provided electrical contracting services to multiple customers without a written contract and without then demanding immediate payment.id.some months later,the indictment charged,the electrician used extortionate means to collect on the services.id.
in sustaining a conviction under against a challenge,we held that on the record in that case it was logical to infer,at the very least,that there was a tacit agreement to defer repayment of the debt there at issue.id.and in explaining that o nce the services were provided and immediate payment was not demanded,an extension of credit was established,we noted that it would have been unreasonable for the beneficiaries of the services to have assumed that the services were provided at no cost or that a bill would not be forthcoming in due course.id.
but while in hoyle the agreement to defer payment could be logical ly inferred from the electrician silence upon providing the services,no similar logical inference can be drawn from madarati actions or inaction.the electrician chose not to present a bill within any expected time frame.id.madarati,by contrast,was not silent upon loukas return to boston.instead,madarati threatened him during their first meeting and then made two explicit demands for payment in the only two conversations that the record shows they had thereafter.and while madarati took a little more than a week to make good on his threat,he did nothing in between that could reasonably be understood as a withdrawal of the demand for payment he had just made.
the district court did also note that this case was arguably similar to hoyle for the separate reason that it would have been unreasonable for loukas to assume that madarati was paying him and providing resources for services that would not be performed.on that reasoning,the deferral of payment occurred at the very outset of the transaction,when madarati first gave his money to loukas,as madarati would receive the pills or the money he had handed over only later.
but,as we have explained,the government affirmatively represented at oral argument that it was not contending that the deferral occurred at the time that loukas took off to california with the money,and the government instead has urged us to find an extension of credit on the basis of the evidence of madarati words and actions in the time period after loukas returned to boston.consistent with the government view of when any deferral could have occurred,the record shows that,in providing the money to loukas to buy pills on his behalf,madarati was providing the funds necessary for loukas to carry out a task which gave rise to a debt.the record provides insufficient evidence that madarati was at that time assenting to the deferral of its repayment.thus,on these facts,we agree with the government concession that there was no assent by madarati to defer a deadline for and thus no extension of credit prior to loukas return from california.
congress has made clear that is to be construed broadly,at.t he conferees wish to leave no doubt of the congressional intention that chapter is a weapon to be used with vigor and imagination against every activity of organized crime that falls within its terms.and an agreement to defer payment need not be express or even bilateral.see hoyle,at citing sedlak,at.thus,on some facts,a creditor delay in collecting a prior demand for payment might suffice to show an agreement to defer payment.but,consistent with hoyle and the plain text of a,the record in each instance must show sufficient indicia of agreement to conclude that an agreement to defer payment of the debts existed in order for there to be sufficient evidence to sustain that element of the crime.see hoyle,at.and here,the record reveals only that madarati threatened harm to loukas if he failed to pay what he owed and then quickly followed up that threat by twice demanding immediate payment while he finalized his preferred method of using extortionate means to collect on the debt.we therefore can not conclude that the record sup
