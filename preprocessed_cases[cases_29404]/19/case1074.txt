carol aranjo was chief executive officer,treasurer,and a director of the edward wells federal credit union wells,a federally chartered financial institution in springfield,massachusetts.wells was regulated by the national credit union administration ncua,an independent federal agency that regularly examines credit unions for compliance with regulatory requirements.
between and,two ncua examiners discovered problems with wells books,including an unusually high and loan to a entity,friends of the credit union friends,the treasurer of which was aranjo husband alphonso smith.aranjo resisted the examiners investigation,refusing to permit them to view the credit union financial information such as members loan and deposit data and the friends loan documentation.
partly because of the friends loan,ncua decided in late that it could no longer conclude that wells was sound and,in february,ncua placed wells in conservatorship in order to return it to solvency.during conservatorship,ncua discovered significant negative balances on several wells accounts,including aranjo and her husband personal accounts,which showed negative balances of and,respectively,as well as large suspicious transfers among wells accounts that made negative accounts appear positive.
ncua was forced to liquidate wells,and aranjo and smith were indicted and tried in federal district court on charges that included conspiracy to embezzle and to make false entries in a federal credit union books,embezzlement,id,bank fraud,id,and filing false tax returns.some of the counts were directed at aranjo alone or smith alone.aranjo was additionally charged with making false entries,and obstructing the examination of a financial institution,id.
a trial ensued and the jury convicted both aranjo and smith of conspiracy to embezzle and to make false entries,as well as of four counts of embezzlement.aranjo was also convicted of separate counts charging substantive offenses embezzlement,filing false tax returns,bank fraud,fraudulent false entries,and obstructing the examination of a financial institution and smith of two other substantive offenses four counts of filing false tax returns and one count of bank fraud.there were acquittals on a few other counts.
aranjo was sentenced to months in prison and smith to months and one day.both were ordered to provide in restitution to ncua,with aranjo to provide an additional million to a credit union insurer.both now appeal and each argues that the government peremptory challenge of an juror violated their rights under batson kentucky.smith makes several other claims,but we begin with the batson challenge common to both appellants.
during jury selection,aranjo counsel joined by smith counsel objected to one of the prosecutor peremptory challenges,noting that the prospective juror was seemingly the one african american woman on the jury panel which implicates both classes race and gender.aranjo counsel pointed out to the court different,male juror probably was not,and that there were very few women on the jury.
the court then asked the prosecutor to explain her challenge.she replied that there were 
two reasons,both relating to the juror employment with the job corps,which is a federally funded organization that has some government regulatory oversight.it also serves a population of juveniles who have been in trouble with the law,and treats them at a residential setting.so i am concerned about her identification with individuals who have been charged with crime,as well there going to be a lot of testimony here with respect to dealing with federal regulators and the federal government as part of the defense in this case.
after some back and forth,the prosecutor explained that,based on her prior experience with job corps cases,she knew that job corps employees are not strictly speaking federal employees or part of a federal agency but instead are hire d from the outside by the department of labor,such that their relationship with federal supervisors can be contentious.aranjo counsel noted that the prosecutor had not struck a white male juror who had admitted a juvenile conviction and claimed that this showed the prosecutor proffered reasons were in this respect a pretext for racial discrimination.
the court then allowed the government peremptory challenge,accepting that the prosecutor acted on the reason that the juror is associated with an entity that is under the eye of the federal government and would be unduly affected by that.after the court ruled,the prosecutor noted that there would be testimony about aranjo work with the youth credit union,the mission of which included helping to keep kids out of trouble.
the format in the trial court for framing and deciding a batson challenge is as follows 
first,a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race.second,if that showing has been made,the prosecution must offer a basis for striking the juror in question.third,in light of the parties submissions,the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.
cockrell,citations omitted.the defendant ultimately bears the burden of persuasion as to discriminatory purpose.johnson california.where the trial judge has found that the burden has not been carried,review of a preserved batson claim is for clear error.united states girouard,cir.
the parties dispute whether the defendants established a prima facie case of discrimination and whether the district court so found,but as the prosecutor offered an explanation and the judge accepted it,we do not pursue the issue.some case law suggests that this sequence makes it unnecessary to decide the prima facie issue.hernandez new york,united states perez,cir.certainly that is true where,as here,we uphold the trial judge finding that the explanation was adequate.
aranjo and smith argue that the prosecutor concern about the struck juror job corps affiliation was pretextual,pointing to two sets of white jurors that they claim were similarly situated but were not struck the two jurors who had reported being accused of crimes in their youth,see note above,and two who had ties to the banking industry.true enough,i n considering batson claims,courts may examine whether similarly situated jurors from outside the allegedly targeted group were permitted to serve.aspen bissonnette,cir.
but the connections between two jurors and the banking industry were more attenuated than the challenged juror connection to the job corps one had a on a savings bank board and another had a daughter who worked for a bank by contrast,the challenged juror in this case worked directly for the job corps.several of the charges against aranjo involved alleged obstruction of supervisory officials,so a concern about an antagonistic relationship between job corps employees and federal managers could be legitimate.
the prosecutor gave no specifics beyond a general reference to her own experience,but none were sought.further,a batson challenge is a preliminary matter handled by the judge with few formalities.nor is the accuracy of the prosecutor assessment critical it is enough if her explanation was and reflected her true motive.purkett elem,per curiam mitleider hall,cir united states thomas,cir.peremptory challenges are regularly based on counsel prior experience with jurors.
as for the jurors criminally accused as youth,the accusations were decades earlier for both,while the prosecutor said she was concerned about a juror who did or had worked with an organization that might identify with those charged with crime.further,the struck juror was the only one who fit both of the prosecutor negative concerns possible identification with those criminally accused and potential antagonism toward federal regulators.in all,the district judge did not clearly err in accepting the proffered reasons.
smith alone makes a number of other claims of error.we begin with smith claim that the evidence against him was insufficient.with some basis,the government treats this as a challenge only to smith conviction for conspiracy and not to the substantive counts on which he was convicte
