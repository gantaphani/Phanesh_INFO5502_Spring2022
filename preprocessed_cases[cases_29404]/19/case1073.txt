harry guzman appeals from his january conviction under i,and his life sentence for his role in an april,arson that killed a mother and her infant daughter.as to trial error,guzman primarily argues that the district court should have suppressed a november confession he made to bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms atf agents,given that guzman,when earlier arrested for a june,arson,had invoked his right to counsel and had been released on bail for that offense.at the time of his november confession he was in state custody for violating his july bail conditions.this claim requires us to apply the supreme court recent decision in maryland shatzer.ed d.
guzman also raises claims regarding several of the court evidentiary rulings,and whether the arson affected interstate commerce.as to his life sentence,guzman argues the district court failed to give an adequate explanation for the sentence at the sentencing hearing,as required by c,that the district court misapplied the sentencing guidelines,and that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.we affirm.
we review the basic facts of the case.where there are disputes of fact,they are not material to the issues we decide.there was also no clear error in the trial court assessment of the facts for purposes of its rulings.additional facts regarding guzman claims are developed as we discuss each claim.
the fatal fire took place around on april,at a apartment building on manchester street,in lawrence,massachusetts.the building owner lived in the building first floor unit and rented out the remaining four units on the second and third floors.at least fifteen people lived in the building.the fire was started on the rear porch of the building and caused extensive damage.matilda medina and her baby,angelic duran,who lived on the third floor,died as a result of the fire.
on the evening of april,guzman was sleeping in his girlfriend car outside her apartment,around the corner from manchester street.at some point in the evening,juan cruz arrived in the neighborhood.he approached guzman,and the two agreed to burn the building.accounts differ as to why they decided to light the fire at the building where medina lived.by one account,the targeting of the building was motivated by a person living next door to the building having earlier sold cruz bad drugs since the drug dealer building was built from bricks,guzman and cruz instead targeted medina building.by another account,it was the result of a fight cruz had with a woman about unpaid drug money and was intended to send a message.
cruz and guzman walked up a set of stairs behind the building and lit a fire on the building second floor back porch,using a container of gasoline and a cloth.according to guzman november confession to an atf agent that we discuss later,he supplied the gasoline and acted as the lookout.by other accounts,he was more actively involved and may have actually lit the fire 
this april fire was one of a series of arson fires that occurred in that neighborhood in the spring and summer of.the last arson occurred on june.the same day,guzman was arrested for the june fire and taken to the police station.after a massachusetts state police officer read him his miranda rights,guzman invoked his right to counsel and was not questioned further.as guzman was waiting in the police captain office to be taken to his cell,state trooper matthew gravini,whom guzman already knew,arrived at the police station.after guzman waved to gravini,gravini approached guzman and asked how he was doing.guzman expressed concern for himself and his family and then made statements implicating juan cruz in the earlier,fatal april fire.when gravini indicated that he wanted to take his statement in written form,guzman once again invoked his right to counsel,and gravini immediately ended the conversation.
guzman was charged in state court for the june arson and was released on bail in july until november,when he was returned to state custody for violating bail conditions.he was held at the essex county correctional facility in middleton,massachusetts.
on november,two atf agents traveled to the facility to interview guzman about the april arson.pursuant to facility policy,the deputy superintendent of the facility asked guzman if he would be willing to speak with the agents,and guzman agreed and signed a form consenting to the interview.guzman met the two agents in a large conference room.at the outset of the meeting,the agents advised guzman of his miranda rights,and guzman signed the top half of a form acknowledging that he had been advised of his rights.the bottom half of the form,containing a waiver of miranda rights,remained unsigned at this time.guzman was also told by the agents several times that he could leave the meeting at any time.
the atf agents told guzman that they were there to speak about the april fire.for the next hour of conversation,the agents told guzman that he had been implicated in the crime and that there was a difference between an intentional killing and an accident.after listening to the agents for about an hour,guzman responded,saying that the april fire had been bothering him.he gave his version of the events and admitted that he had helped cruz commit the arson by providing fuel and acting as a lookout.after guzman had told his story,the atf agents asked guzman to provide a written or recorded version of his statement.guzman said that he would do so only with his lawyer present.the agents ceased questioning him but asked guzman to sign the bottom half of the miranda waiver form,indicating that he had waived his rights and agreed to talk with them.guzman signed the waiver at approximately,but,at the agents request,guzman indicated on the form that he had waived his rights at,when he began telling his version of events to the officers.
on september,a grand jury in the district of massachusetts returned a superseding indictment charging guzman with arson of two separate buildings used in any way affecting interstate commerce,in violation of i,for the april and june fires.the district court later severed the two counts to proceed in separate trials,and this case concerns only the trial on count one,the fatal april fire.
before trial,guzman moved to suppress his june statements to trooper gravini and his november statements to the atf agents,on grounds that they were elicited from him by the officers after he had invoked his right to counsel.after a hearing,the district court granted the motion to suppress as to the june statement but denied suppression of guzman november admissions to the atf agents.those admissions were introduced at trial through the testimony of the two atf agents.neither guzman nor juan cruz testified at trial.
guzman also moved for dismissal before trial on the ground that the arson did not affect interstate commerce.the district court denied this motion.
the jury trial began on january.a government witness at trial was guzman former cellmate,juan ramos.ramos testified that guzman had confessed his involvement in the arson to ramos ramos also testified to guzman description of the crime.guzman attorney elicited from ramos that ramos had alternate sources for this information ramos knew guzman was keeping discovery documents in their shared cell,and guzman had told ramos about his conversations with guzman attorney.on the government objection,however,the court did not allow guzman trial counsel to elicit from ramos the contents of the discovery documents.guzman objected in writing to the court limiting of his.the court rejected his argument.
the government also made a motion in limine to prevent admission of two hearsay statements by cruz that guzman claimed were statements against penal interest,which implicated cruz in the fire and showed cruz acted alone.the district court granted the government motion without explanation in a ruling from the bench.
on january,the jury found guzman guilty.guzman already had four earlier convictions,including several charges of disorderly conduct,and two instances of resisting arrest,which,according to the presentence report psr,qualified him as a career offender.at the end of the may,sentencing hearing the district court sentenced guzman to life in prison,three years supervised release,payment of restitution in the amount of,and a special assessment.the court did not explain its reasons for the life sentence at the hearing.in a written statement of reasons,filed june,the district court indicated that it adopted the psr without change and within the sentencing guideline range,noting that it imposed the sentence after considering all the surrounding circumstances and the probation department determination as to the advisory guideline range.
a.there was no error in the denial of the motion to suppress 
guzman claims error in the district court failure to suppress his november,statements.we review the district court findings of facts for clear error and its application of the law to those facts de novo.united states dunbar,cir.
guzman argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress for two reasons.first,he argues that the november statements were made during a custodial interrogation and that because he had invoked his right to counsel five months earlier to the state police following his june arrest,the atf agent questioning of him violated the rule of edwards arizona,d.second,guzman insists that,under the circumstances of his meeting with the atf agents,he did not validly waive his miranda rights.
shatzer forecloses defendant argument based on edwards 
in his original briefing for this case and at oral argument,guzman argued that he was in the atf agents custody at the time that he gave the november statement,and that,as a result,his june invocation of his right to counsel barred the atf agents from initiating further interrogation,even though he was released on bail for a period of about four months between the time of the first and second interrogations.see minnick mississippi,d arizona roberson,d edwards,at.because of the very recent supreme court decision in shatzer,guzman argument fails.even assuming arguendo that the november meeting between guzman and the agents was a custodial interrogation,shatzer forecloses the claim.
in shatzer,the supreme court established a rule that if a suspect who has invoked his right to have counsel present during a custodial interrogation is released from police custody for a period of fourteen days before being questioned again in custody,then the edwards presumption of involuntariness will not apply.at.the court stressed that the edwards rule was a,rule,which could be justified only by reference to its prophylactic purpose.id.at.in reaching this decision,the court noted its concern that a suspect,held in uninterrupted custody in an unfamiliar,atmosphere,might be coerced or badgered into abandoning his earlier invocation of the right to counsel.id.at.in contrast to that situation,the supreme court noted that w hen a suspect has been released from his pretrial custody and has returned to his normal life for some time before the later attempted interrogation,there is little reason to think that his change of heart regarding interrogation without counsel has been coerced.id.at.under those circumstances,the suspect decision to speak to officers is not likely to be attributed to badgering but to the suspect coming to believe that cooperation is in his best interest.id.
in this case,guzman was released on bail for about four months between the time that he originally invoked his right to counsel and the atf agents subsequent attempt to question him.this far exceeds the time period required by shatzer and thus its exception to edwards applies.
after shatzer was decided,we obtained supplemental briefing from the parties.guzman acknowledged in his supplemental brief that a exception to edwards exists,but argued that even after shatzer the edwards rule should nonetheless apply because his miranda rights were not scrupulously honored in the first instance when trooper gravini questioned him on june.he cites no authority in support of such a contention and we conclude that,after having been released for four months,guzman can not contend that his prior invocation of his miranda rights applied.
the court did not err in finding there was a valid waiver 
that leaves guzman argument that the trial court erred in holding that he validly waived his miranda rights during the november discussions with the atf.a defendant may waive his miranda rights if the waiver is made voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently.united states palmer,cir.an express waiver is not required.united states mejia,cir see also north carolina butler,d.we review the determination of whether a waiver of rights was voluntary de novo.united states bezanson perkins,cir.
here,the trial judge supportably found that guzman waiver was voluntary.the court was presented evidence that guzman consented in writing to speak with the atf agents before the meeting even began.the atf agents explained to guzman his miranda rights and guzman signed a form indicating that he understood them.it is true that he did not sign the portion of the form waiving his miranda rights at the time apparently he was not asked to do so.nonetheless,as counsel for guzman admitted before this court at oral argument,guzman verbally agreed to speak with the agents about the events of april without a lawyer present.at the close of the interview guzman signed a form indicating he had waived his right to remain silent.oral waivers of miranda rights are sufficient,and individuals may properly invoke their right to counsel before making written statements while still waiving their miranda rights with respect to oral statements.see connecticut barrett,d.
the district court rejected counsel reliance on language from missouri seibert,d,that failure to give warnings and obtain a waiver before initiation of custodial questioning generally requires exclusion of any statement obtained.the court distinguished seibert and found that the atf agents had told guzman he could leave if he did not want to talk and had shown him the door was unlocked.that the agents spoke with guzman for approximately an hour before he agreed to tell his side of the story does not mean his decision to speak was coerced or involuntary.
guzman argues that the atf agents misled him by presenting him with the waiver form and by not asking him to sign the waiver form until the end of the interview.he couples that with the argument that the atf agents knew from guzman june conversation with trooper gravini that guzman drew a distinction between what he said and written statements,and that guzman was spooked by requests to write things.that may be true,but guzman was told his rights and he confirmed that he understood them.see united states van dusen,cir.that the agents chose certain conversational tactics after giving the warning does not make guzman choice to talk a coerced choice 
b.there was no error in the court exclusion of hearsay statements offered by guzman and limits on cross examination 
guzman next argues that the district court erred in granting the government motions in limine excluding two separate hearsay statements by cruz,and in preventing guzman from further the government witness,ramos,on whether he actually learned from discovery documents that guzman had obtained from his lawyer the information he attributed to an admission from guzman.we review a district court exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion.united states rivera hernandez,cir.the district court did not abuse its discretion for the reasons that follow.
the exclusion of cruz hearsay statements was not prejudicial error 
guzman argues that the hearsay statements should have been admitted as statements against penal interest under.b.the district court excluded the statements,without explanation,after receiving written motions from both parties and hearing brief arguments.counsel for guzman did not at the time request an explanation for the court rulings.
first,guzman sought to admit a portion of a recorded conversation between cruz and a confidential informant.the conversation occurred just after cruz and the informant drove past the site of the fatal april fire.the informant asked cruz whether he committed the a
