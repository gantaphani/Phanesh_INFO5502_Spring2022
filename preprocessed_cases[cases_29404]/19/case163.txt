in,deputies called to drug dealer johnson california home found johnson wounded and klein fatally wounded.johnson claimed that he was shot in his bedroom by respondent richter codefendant,branscombe that he found klein on the living room couch and that his gun safe,a pistol,and cash were missing.his account was corroborated by evidence at the scene,including,relevant here,spent shell casings,blood spatters,and blood pooled in the bedroom doorway.investigators took a blood sample from a wall near the bedroom door,but not from the blood pool.a search of richter home turned up the safe and ammunition matching evidence at the scene.after his arrest on murder and other charges,richter initially denied his involvement,but later admitted disposing of johnson and branscombe guns.the prosecution initially built its case on johnson testimony and the circumstantial evidence,but it adjusted its approach after richter counsel,in his opening statement,outlined the theory that branscombe shot johnson in and that klein was killed in the crossfire in the bedroom doorway,and stressed the lack of forensic support for the prosecution case.the prosecution then decided to call an expert in blood pattern evidence,who testified that it was unlikely that klein had been shot outside the living room and then moved to the couch,and a serologist,who testified that the blood sample taken near the blood pool could be johnson but not klein.under,she conceded that she had not tested the sample for and that a degraded sample would make it difficult to tell if it had blood of klein type.defense counsel called richter to tell his conflicting version of events and called other witnesses to corroborate richter version.richter was convicted and sentenced to life without parole.he later sought habeas relief from the california supreme court,asserting,inter alia,that his counsel provided ineffective assistance,see strickland washington,when he failed to present expert testimony on blood evidence,because it could have disclosed the blood pool source and bolstered richter theory.he also offered affidavits from forensics experts to support his claim.the court denied the petition in a summary order.subsequently,he reasserted his state claims in a federal habeas petition.the district court denied his petition.a ninth circuit panel affirmed,but the en banc court reversed.initially it questioned whether d which,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,limits the availability of federal habeas relief for claims previously adjudicated on the merits in state court applied to richter petition,since the state supreme court issued only a summary denial.but it found the decision unreasonable anyway.in its view,trial counsel was deficient in failing to consult blood evidence experts in planning a trial strategy and in preparing to rebut expert evidence the prosecution might and later did offer.
section d applies to richter petition,even though the state court order was unaccompanied by an opinion explaining the court reasoning.
a by its terms,d bars relitigation of a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless,among other exceptions,the earlier decision involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by this court,d.nothing in its text which refers only to a decision resulting from an adjudication requires a statement of reasons.where the decision has no explanation,the habeas petitioner must still show there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.there is no merit to the assertion that applying d when state courts issue summary rulings will encourage those courts to withhold explanations.the issuance of summary dispositions can enable state judiciaries to concentrate resources where most needed.
b nor is there merit to richter argument that d does not apply because the california supreme court did not say it was adjudicating his claim on the merits.when a state court has denied relief,adjudication on the merits can be presumed absent any contrary indication or procedural principles.the presumption may be overcome by a more likely explanation for the state court decision,but richter does not make that showing here.
richter was not entitled to the habeas relief ordered by the ninth circuit.
a that court failed to accord the required deference to the decision of a state court adjudicating the same claims later presented in the federal habeas petition.its opinion shows an improper understanding of d unreasonableness standard and operation in the context of a strickland claim.asking whether the state court application of strickland standard was unreasonable is different from asking whether defense counsel performance fell below that standard.under aedpa,a state court must be granted a deference and latitude that are not in operation in a case involving direct review under strickland.a state court determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as jurists could disagree on the correctness of that decision.yarborough alvarado.and the more general the rule being considered,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.ibid.the ninth circuit explicitly conducted a de novo review and found a strickland violation it then declared without further explanation that the state court contrary decision was unreasonable.but d requires a habeas court to determine what arguments or theories supported,or could have supported,the decision and then to ask whether it is possible jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with a prior decision of this court.aedpa unreasonableness standard is not a test of the confidence of a federal habeas court in the conclusion it would reach as a de novo matter.even a strong case for relief does not make the state court contrary conclusion unreasonable.section d is designed to confirm that state courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional challenges to state convictions.
b the ninth circuit erred in concluding that richter demonstrated an unreasonable application of strickland by the state court.
richter could have secured relief in state court only by showing both that his counsel provided deficient assistance and that prejudice resulted.to be deficient,counsel representation must have fallen below an objective standard of reasonableness,strickland,at and there is a strong presumption that counsel representation is within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,at.the question is whether counsel made errors so fundamental that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment.prejudice requires demonstrating a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.at.surmounting strickland high bar is never easy.padilla kentucky.strickland can function as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture.the question is whether an attorney representation amounted to incompetence under prevailing professional norms,not whether it deviated from best practices or most common custom.establishing that a state court application of strickland was unreasonable under d is even more difficult,since both standards are highly deferential,s,at,and since strickland general standard has a substantial range of reasonable applications.the question under d is not whether counsel actions were reasonable,but whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied strickland deferential standard.
the ninth circuit erred in holding that because richter attorney had not consulted forensic blood experts or introduced expert evidence,the state supreme court could not reasonably have concluded counsel provided adequate representation.
a state court could reasonably conclude that a competent attorney could elect a strategy that did not require using blood evidence experts.rare are the situations in which the latitude counsel enjoys will be limited to any one technique or approach.there were any number of experts whose insight might have been useful to the defense.counsel is entitled to balance limited resources in accord with effective trial tactics and strategies.in finding otherwise the ninth circuit failed to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct and evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.strickland,supra,at.given the many factual differences between the prosecution and defense versions of events,it was far from evident at the time of trial that the blood source was central to richter case.and relying on the harsh light of hindsight to cast doubt on a trial that took place over years ago is precisely what strickland and aedpa seek to prevent.see bell cone.even had the value of expert testimony been apparent,it would be reasonable to conclude that a competent attorney might elect not to use it here,where counsel had reason to question the truth of his client account.making blood evidence a central issue could also have led the prosecution to produce its own expert analysis,possibly destroying richter case,or distracted the jury with esoteric questions of forensic science.defense counsel opening statement may have inspired the prosecution to present forensic evidence,but that shows only that the defense strategy did not work out as well as hoped.in light of the record here there was no basis to rule that the state court determination was unreasonable.
the court of appeals erred in dismissing such concern as an inaccurate account of counsel actual thinking,since strickland examined only the objective reasonableness of counsel actions.as to whether counsel was constitutionally deficient for not preparing expert testimony as a response to the prosecution,an attorney may not be faulted for a reasonable miscalculation or lack of foresight or for failing to prepare for remote possibilities.here,even if counsel was mistaken,the prosecution itself did not expect to present forensic testimony until the eve of trial.thus,it is at least debatable whether counsel error was so fundamental as to call the trial fairness into doubt.even if counsel should have foreseen the prosecution tactic,richter would still need to show it was indisputable that strickland required his attorney to rely on a rebuttal witness rather than on to discredit the witnesses,but strickland imposes no such requirement.and while it is possible an isolated error can constitute ineffective assistance if it is sufficiently egregious,it is difficult to establish ineffective assistance where counsel overall performance reflects active and capable advocacy.
the ninth circuit also erred in concluding that richter had established prejudice under strickland,which asks whether it is reasonably likely the verdict would have been different,at,not whether a court can be certain counsel performance had no effect on the outcome or that reasonable doubt might have been established had counsel acted differently.there must be a substantial likelihood of a different result.the state supreme court could have reasonably concluded that richter prejudice evidence fell short of this standard.his expert serology evidence established only a theoretical possibility of klein blood being in the blood pool and at trial,defense counsel extracted a similar concession from the prosecution expert.it was also reasonable to find richter had not established prejudice given that he offered no evidence challenging other conclusions of the prosecution experts,that the blood sample matched johnson blood type.there was,furthermore,sufficient conventional circumstantial evidence pointing to richter guilt,including,the items found at his home.

kelly harrington,warden,petitioner joshua richter 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
the writ of habeas corpus stands as a safeguard against imprisonment of those held in violation of the law.judges must be vigilant and independent in reviewing petitions for the writ,a commitment that entails substantial judicial resources.those resources are diminished and misspent,however,and confidence in the writ and the law it vindicates undermined,if there is judicial disregard for the sound and established principles that inform its proper issuance.that judicial disregard is inherent in the opinion of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit here under review.the court of appeals,in disagreement with the contrary conclusions of the supreme court of the state of california and of a united states district court,ordered habeas corpus relief granted to set aside the conviction of joshua richter,respondent here.this was clear error.
under d,the availability of federal habeas relief is limited with respect to claims previously adjudicated on the merits in proceedings.the first inquiry this case presents is whether that applies when relief is denied without an accompanying statement of reasons.if it does,the question is whether the court of appeals adhered to the statute terms,in this case as it relates to claims judged by the standard set forth in strickland washington.a second case decided today,premo moore,post,presents similar issues.here,as in that case,it is necessary to reverse the court of appeals for failing to accord required deference to the decision of a state court.
it is necessary to begin by discussing the details of a crime committed more than a decade and a half ago.
sometime after midnight on december,sheriff deputies in sacramento county,california,arrived at the home of a drug dealer named joshua johnson.hours before,johnson had been smoking marijuana in the company of richter and two other men,christian branscombe and patrick klein.when the deputies arrived,however,they found only johnson and klein.johnson was hysterical and covered in blood.klein was lying on a couch in johnson living room,unconscious and bleeding.klein and johnson each had been shot twice.johnson recovered klein died of his wounds.
johnson gave investigators this account after falling asleep,he awoke to find richter and branscombe in his bedroom,at which point branscombe shot him.johnson heard more gunfire in the living room and the sound of his assailants leaving.he got up,found klein bleeding on the living room couch,and called.a gun safe,a pistol,and cash,all of which had been in the bedroom,were missing.
evidence at the scene corroborated johnson account.investigators found spent shell casings in the bedroom where johnson said he had been shot and in the living room where johnson indicated klein had been shot.in the living room there were two casings,a caliber and a caliber.one of the bullets recovered from klein body was a and the other was a.in the bedroom there were two more casings,both caliber.in addition detectives found blood spatter near the living room couch and bloodstains in the bedroom.pools of blood had collected in the kitchen and the doorway to johnson bedroom.investigators took only a few blood samples from the crime scene.one was from a blood splash on the wall near the bedroom doorway,but no sample was taken from the doorway blood pool itself.
investigators searched richter residence and found johnson gun safe,two boxes of caliber ammunition,and a gun magazine loaded with cartridges of the same brand and type as the boxes.a ballistics expert later concluded the caliber bullet that struck klein and the caliber shell found in the living room matched the ammunition found in richter home and bore markings consistent with the model of gun for which the magazine was designed.
richter and branscombe were arrested.at first richter denied involvement.he would later admit taking johnson pistol and disposing of it and of the caliber weapon branscombe used to shoot johnson and klein.richter counsel produced johnson missing pistol,but neither of the guns used to shoot johnson and klein was found.
branscombe and richter were tried together on charges of murder,attempted murder,burglary,and robbery.only richter case is presented here.
the prosecution built its case on johnson testimony and on circumstantial evidence.its opening statement took note of the shell casings found at the crime scene and the ammunition and gun safe found at richter residence.defense counsel offered explanations for the circumstantial evidence and derided johnson as a drug dealer,a paranoid,and a gun fanatic who had drawn a pistol on branscombe and richter the last time he had seen them.and there were inconsistencies in johnson story.in his call,for instance,johnson first said there were four or five men who had broken into his house,not two and in the call he did not identify richter and branscombe among the intruders.
blood evidence does not appear to have been part of the prosecution planned case prior to trial,and investigators had not analyzed the few blood samples taken from the crime scene.but the opening statement from the defense led the prosecution to alter its approach.richter attorney outlined the theory that branscombe had fired on johnson in and that klein had been killed not on the living room couch but in the crossfire in the bedroom doorway.defense counsel stressed deficiencies in the investigation,including the absence of forensic support for the prosecution version of events.
the prosecution took steps to adjust to the counterattack now disclosed.without advance notice and over the objection of richter attorney,one of the detectives who investigated the shootings testified for the prosecution as an expert in blood pattern evidence.he concluded it was unlikely klein had been shot outside the living room and then moved to the couch,given the patterns of blood on klein face,as well as other evidence including high velocity blood spatter near the couch consistent with the location of a shooting.the prosecution also offered testimony from a serologist.she testified the blood sample taken near the pool by the bedroom door could be johnson but not klein.
defense counsel probed weaknesses in the testimony of these two witnesses.the detective who testified on blood patterns acknowledged that his inferences were imprecise,that it was unlikely klein had been lying down on the couch when shot,and that he could not say the blood in the living room was from either of klein wounds.defense counsel elicited from the serologist a concession that she had not tested the bedroom blood sample for.she said that if the sample had degraded,it would be difficult to tell whether blood of klein type was also present in the sample.
for the defense,richter attorney called seven witnesses.prominent among these was richter himself.richter testified he and branscombe returned to johnson house just before the shootings in order to deliver something to one of johnson roommates.by richter account,branscombe entered the house alone while richter waited in the driveway but after hearing screams and gunshots,richter followed inside.there he saw klein lying not on the couch but in the bedroom doorway,with johnson on the bed and branscombe standing in the middle of the room.according to richter,branscombe said he shot at johnson and klein after they attacked him.other defense witnesses provided some corroboration for richter story.his former girlfriend,for instance,said she saw the gun safe at richter house shortly before the shootings.
the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all charges.richter was sentenced to life without parole.on appeal,his conviction was affirmed.people branscombe,cal.rptr.cal.app.officially depublished.the california supreme court denied a petition for review,people branscombe,no,cal.lexis june,and richter did not file a petition for certiorari with this court.his conviction became final.
richter later petitioned the california supreme court for a writ of habeas corpus.he asserted a number of grounds for relief,including ineffective assistance of counsel.as relevant here,he claimed his counsel was deficient for failing to present expert testimony on serology,pathology,and blood spatter patterns,testimony that,he argued,would disclose the source of the blood pool in the bedroom doorway.this,he contended,would bolster his theory that johnson had moved klein to the couch.
he offered affidavits from three types of forensic experts.first,he provided statements from two blood serologists who said there was a possibility klein blood was intermixed with blood of johnson type in the sample taken from near the pool in the bedroom doorway.second,he provided a statement from a pathologist who said the blood pool was too large to have come from johnson given the nature of his wounds and his own account of his actions while waiting for the police.third,he provided a statement from an expert in bloodstain analysis who said the absence of a large number of satellite droplets in photographs of the area around the blood in the bedroom doorway was inconsistent with the blood pool coming from johnson as he stood in the doorway.app.richter argued this evidence established the possibility that the blood in the bedroom doorway came from klein,not johnson.if that were true,he argued,it would confirm his account,not johnson.the california supreme court denied richter petition in a summary order.see in re richter,no,app.to pet.for cert.richter did not seek certiorari from this court.
after the california supreme court issued its summary order denying relief,richter filed a petition for habeas corpus in united states district court for the eastern district of california.he reasserted the claims in his state petition.the district court denied his petition,and a panel of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed.see richter hickman.the court of appeals granted rehearing en banc and reversed the district court decision.see richter hickman.
as a preliminary matter,the court of appeals questioned whether d was applicable to richter petition,since the california supreme court issued only a summary denial when it rejected his strickland claims but it determined the california decision was unreasonable in any event and that richter was entitled to relief.the court held richter trial counsel was deficient for failing to consult experts on blood evidence in determining and pursuing a trial strategy and in preparing to rebut expert evidence the prosecution might and later did offer.four judges dissented from the en banc decision.
we granted certiorari.
the statutory authority of federal courts to issue habeas corpus relief for persons in state custody is provided by,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.the text of d states 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
as an initial matter,it is necessary to decide whether d applies when a state court order is unaccompanied by an opinion explaining the reasons relief has been denied.
by its terms d bars relitigation of any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court,subject only to the exceptions in d and d.there is no text in the statute requiring a statement of reasons.the statute refers only to a decision,which resulted from an adjudication.as every court of appeals to consider the issue has recognized,determining whether a state court decision resulted from an unreasonable legal or factual conclusion does not require that there be an opinion from the state court explaining the state court reasoning.see chadwick janecka,wright secretary for of corrections,sellan kuhlman,bell jarvis,en banc harris stovall,aycox lytle,james bowersox.and as this court has observed,a state court need not cite or even be aware of our cases under d.early packer,per curiam.where a state court decision is unaccompanied by an explanation,the habeas petitioner burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.this is so whether or not the state court reveals which of the elements in a multipart claim it found insufficient,for d applies when a claim,not a component of one,has been adjudicated.
there is no merit to the assertion that compliance with d should be excused when state courts issue summary rulings because applying d in those cases will encourage state courts to withhold explanations for their decisions.practices in state courts are influenced by considerations other than avoiding scrutiny by collateral attack in federal court.in re robbins,cal,state procedures limiting habeas are a means of protecting the integrity of our own appeal and habeas corpus process,rather than a device for insulating our judgments from federal court review emphasis deleted.at the same time,requiring a statement of reasons could undercut state practices designed to preserve the integrity of the tradition.the issuance of summary dispositions in many collateral attack cases can enable a state judiciary to concentrate its resources on the cases where opinions are most needed.see brief for california attorneys for criminal justice et as amici curiae noting that the california supreme court disposes of close to cases a year,including more than original habeas corpus petitions.
there is no merit either in richter argument that d is inapplicable because the california supreme court did not say it was adjudicating his claim on the merits.the state court did not say it was denying the claim for any other reason.when a federal claim has been presented to a state court and the state court has denied relief,it may be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or procedural principles to the contrary.harris reed,presumption of a merits determination when it is unclear whether a decision appearing to rest on federal grounds was decided on another basis.
the presumption may be overcome when there is reason to think some other explanation for the state court decision is more likely.see,ylst nunnemaker.richter,however,does not make that showing.he mentions the theoretical possibility that the members of the california supreme court may not have agreed on the reasons for denying his petition.it is pure speculation,however,to suppose that happened in this case.and richter assertion that the mere possibility of a lack of agreement prevents any attribution of reasons to the state court decision is foreclosed by precedent.see ibid.
as has been noted before,the california courts or legislature can alter the state practices or elaborate more fully on their import.see evans chavis.but that has not occurred here.this court now holds and reconfirms that d does not require a state court to give reasons before its decision can be deemed to have been adjudicated on the merits.richter has failed to show that the california supreme court decision did not involve a determination of the merits of his claim.section d applies to his petition.
federal habeas relief may not be granted for claims subject to d unless it is shown that the earlier state court decision was contrary to federal law then clearly established in the holdings of this court,d williams taylor,or that it involved an unreasonable application of such law,d or that it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the record before the state court,d.
the court of appeals relied on the second of these exceptions to d relitigation bar,the exception in d permitting relitigation where the earlier state decision resulted from an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.in the view of the court of appeals,the california supreme court decision on richter claim unreasonably applied the holding in strickland.the court of appeals lengthy opinion,however,discloses an improper understanding of d unreasonableness standard and of its operation in the context of a strickland claim.
the pivotal question is whether the state court application of the strickland standard was unreasonable.this is different from asking whether defense counsel performance fell below strickland standard.were that the inquiry,the analysis would be no different than if,for example,this court were adjudicating a strickland claim on direct review of a criminal conviction in a united states district court.under aedpa,though,it is a necessary premise that the two questions are different.for purposes of d,an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.williams,supra,at.a state court must be granted a deference and latitude that are not in operation when the case involves review under the strickland standard itself.
a state court determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court decision.yarborough alvarado.and as this court has explained,e valuating whether a rule application was unreasonable requires considering the rule specificity.the more general the rule,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.ibid.i t is not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for a state court to decline to apply a specific legal rule that has not been squarely established by this court.knowles mirzayance,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.
here it is not apparent how the court of appeals analysis would have been any different without aedpa.the court explicitly conducted a de novo review,at and after finding a strickland violation,it declared,without further explanation,that the state court decision to the contrary constituted an unreasonable application of strickland.at.aedpa demands more.under d,a habeas court must determine what arguments or theories supported or,as here,could have supported,the state court decision and then it must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this court.the opinion of the court of appeals all but ignored the only question that matters under d.lockyer andrade.
the court of appeals appears to have treated the unreasonableness question as a test of its confidence in the result it would reach under de novo review because the court of appeals had little doubt that richter strickland claim had merit,the court of appeals concluded the state court must have been unreasonable in rejecting it.this analysis overlooks arguments that would otherwise justify the state court result and ignores further limitations of d,including its requirement that the state court decision be evaluated according to the precedents of this court.see renico lett,slip,at.it bears repeating that even a strong case for relief does not mean the state court contrary conclusion was unreasonable.see lockyer,supra,at.
if this standard is difficult to meet,that is because it was meant to be.as amended by aedpa,d stops short of imposing a complete bar on federal court relitigation of claims already rejected in state proceedings.felker turpin,discussing aedpa modified res judicata rule under.it preserves authority to issue the writ in cases where there is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court decision conflicts with this court precedents.it goes no farther.section d reflects the view that habeas corpus is a guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems,not a substitute for ordinary error correction through appeal.jackson virginia,stevens,concurring in judgment.as a condition for obtaining habeas corpus from a federal court,a state prisoner must show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.
the reasons for this approach are familiar.federal habeas review of state convictions frustrates both the states sovereign power to punish offenders and their attempts to honor constitutional rights.calderon thompson,internal quotation marks omitted.it disturbs the state significant interest in repose for concluded litigation,denies society the right to punish some admitted offenders,and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.reed,at kennedy,dissenting.
section d is part of the basic structure of federal habeas jurisdiction,designed to confirm that state courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional challenges to state convictions.under the exhaustion requirement,a habeas petitioner challenging a state conviction must first attempt to present his claim in state court.b.if the state court rejects the claim on procedural grounds,the claim is barred in federal court unless one of the exceptions to the doctrine of wainwright sykes,applies.and if the state court denies the claim on the merits,the claim is barred in federal court unless one of the exceptions to d set out in d and applies.section d thus complements the exhaustion requirement and the doctrine of procedural bar to ensure that state proceedings are the central process,not just a preliminary step for a later federal habeas proceeding,see,at.
here,however,the court of appeals gave d no operation or function in its reasoning.its analysis illustrates a lack of deference to the state court determination and an improper intervention in state criminal processes,contrary to the purpose and mandate of aedpa and to the now meaning and function of habeas corpus in the federal system.
the conclusion of the court of appeals that richter demonstrated an unreasonable application by the state court of the strickland standard now must be discussed.to have been entitled to relief from the california supreme court,richter had to show both that his counsel provided deficient assistance and that there was prejudice as a result.
to establish deficient performance,a person challenging a conviction must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.at.a court considering a claim of ineffective assistance must apply a strong presumption that counsel representation was within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,at.the challenger burden is to show that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.at.
with respect to prejudice,a challenger must demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.at.it is not enough to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.at.counsel errors must be so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.at.
surmounting strickland high bar is never an easy task.padilla kentucky,slip,at.an claim can function as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture and raise issues not presented at trial,and so the strickland standard must be applied with scrupulous care,lest intrusive inquiry threaten the integrity of the very adversary process the right to counsel is meant to serve.strickland,at.even under de novo review,the standard for judging counsel representation is a most deferential one.unlike a later reviewing court,the attorney observed the relevant proceedings,knew of materials outside the record,and interacted with the client,with opposing counsel,and with the judge.it is all too tempting to counsel assistance after conviction or adverse sentence.at see also bell cone,lockhart fretwell.the question is whether an attorney representation amounted to incompetence under prevailing professional norms,not whether it deviated from best practices or most common custom.strickland,at.
establishing that a state court application of strickland was unreasonable under d is all the more difficult.the standards created by strickland and d are both highly deferential,at lindh murphy,and when the two apply in tandem,review is doubly so,knowles,at slip,at.the strickland standard is a general one,so the range of reasonable applications is substantial,at slip,at.federal habeas courts must guard against the danger of equating unreasonableness under strickland with unreasonableness under d.when d applies,the question is not whether counsel actions were reasonable.the question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied strickland deferential standard.
with respect to defense counsel performance,the court of appeals held that because richter attorney had not consulted forensic blood experts or introduced expert evidence,the california supreme court could not reasonably have concluded counsel provided adequate representation.this conclusion was erroneous.
the court of appeals first held that richter attorney rendered constitutionally deficient service because he did not consult blood evidence experts in developing the basic strategy for richter defense or offer their testimony as part of the principal case for the defense.strickland,however,permits counsel to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.at.it was at least arguable that a reasonable attorney could decide to forgo inquiry into the blood evidence in the circumstances here.
criminal cases will arise where the only reasonable and available defense strategy requires consultation with experts or introduction of expert evidence,whether pretrial,at trial,or both.there are,however,countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case.even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.at.rare are the situations in which the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions will be limited to any one technique or approach.ibid.it can be assumed that in some cases counsel would be deemed ineffective for failing to consult or rely on experts,but even that formulation is sufficiently general that state courts would have wide latitude in applying it.here it would be well within the bounds of a reasonable judicial determination for the state court to conclude that defense counsel could follow a strategy that did not require the use of experts regarding the pool in the doorway to johnson bedroom.
from the perspective of richter defense counsel when he was preparing richter defense,there were any number of hypothetical experts specialists in psychiatry,psychology,ballistics,fingerprints,tire treads,physiology,or numerous other disciplines and subdisciplines whose insight might possibly have been useful.an attorney can avoid activities that appear distractive from more important duties.bobby van hook,per curiam slip,at.counsel was entitled to formulate a strategy that was reasonable at the time and to balance limited resources in accord with effective trial tactics and strategies.see knowles,supra,at slip,at rompilla beard,wiggins smith,strickland,at.
in concluding otherwise the court of appeals failed to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct and evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.at.in its view klein location was the single most critical issue in the case given the differing theories of the prosecution and the defense,and the source of the blood in the doorway was therefore of central concern,at.but it was far from a necessary conclusion that this was evident at the time of the trial.there were many factual differences between prosecution and defense versions of the events on the night of the shootings.it is only because forensic evidence has emerged concerning the source of the blood pool that the issue could with any plausibility be said to stand apart.reliance on the harsh light of hindsight to cast doubt on a trial that took place now more than years ago is precisely what strickland and aedpa seek to prevent.cone,at see also lockhart,at.
even if it had been apparent that expert blood testimony could support richter defense,it
