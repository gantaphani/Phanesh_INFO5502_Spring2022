arthur sotirion pled guilty to racketeering and tax offenses pursuant to a plea agreement that contained a waiver of his right to directly appeal and collaterally attack his conviction or sentence.he appeals from the district court dismissal of his petition to vacate,set aside or correct his sentence,in which he claimed that the district court erred in calculating his advisory sentencing guidelines range.he contends that the appellate in his plea agreement is invalid because the court failed to specifically apprise him of the waiver at his hearing as required by federal rule of criminal procedure b n,and therefore the waiver was not knowing and voluntary.he further contends that the waiver should not be enforced because such enforcement would constitute a miscarriage of justice.the government responds that sotirion procedurally defaulted his challenge to the appellate waiver by not first raising it on direct appeal,and alternatively contends that sotirion appellate waiver is valid and enforceable.
rejecting the government procedural default argument,we nevertheless conclude that sotirion has not demonstrated that his appellate waiver is invalid on the basis of a plain error challenge to the district court compliance with rule b n.we further conclude that despite the failure of this plain error challenge to the rule procedure,we retain the discretion to refuse to enforce the appellate waiver if such enforcement would work a miscarriage of justice,see united states teeter,cir.however,sotirion has not demonstrated that enforcement of the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice in this case.accordingly,we affirm.
because sotirion conviction and sentence followed the entry of a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the colloquy and the uncontested portions of the revised presentence investigation report.see united states jimenez,cir.
sotirion began working at the springfield housing authority sha in and served as the assistant executive director of operations for many years until his resignation in april.in that position,he oversaw the operation and maintenance of sha housing projects and played a critical role in the awarding of contracts.together with raymond asselin,the executive director of the sha,sotirion orchestrated a massive scheme of bribery,embezzlement,and fraud.as of,sotirion and asselin began to solicit and receive bribes from sha contractors in exchange for awarding them contracts and other preferential treatment at sha.sotirion also embezzled money directly from sha.sotirion orchestrated this conspiracy over a period,managing at least a dozen corrupt contractors and sha employees.in addition,he did not report the income received from these schemes on his federal income tax returns.
in january,a grand jury returned a superseding indictment against sotirion and twelve,charging sotirion with counts related to the corrupt operation of the sha from until april.sotirion was charged with multiple counts of racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering,c,d bribery and conspiracy to commit bribery,conspiracy to commit theft against the government,mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud,extortion,witness tampering,and filing false income tax returns.
pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement,sotirion pled guilty to three and the government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts against him.the plea agreement also substantially limited sotirion forfeiture and restitution obligations.the government agreed that all of sotirion forfeiture obligations would be discharged by sotirion forfeiture of specified properties,and that in lieu of forfeiture he could pay half the market value of these properties,which amounted to only.
the plea agreement contained a separate section titled waiver of rights to appeal and to bring collateral challenge that stated 
defendant is aware that defendant has the right to challenge his sentence and guilty plea on direct appeal.defendant is also aware that defendant may,in some circumstances,be able to argue that his plea should be set aside,or his sentence set aside or reduced,in a collateral challenge such as pursuant to a motion under.
in consideration of the concessions made by the attorney in this agreement,defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives his right to appeal or collaterally challenge 
defendant guilty plea and any other aspect of defendant conviction,including,but not limited to,any rulings on pretrial suppression motions or any other pretrial dispositions of motions and other issues 
the adoption by the district court at sentencing of any of the positions found in paragraph which will be advocated by the attorney with regard to offense conduct,adjustments criminal history under the sentencing guidelines and 
the imposition by the district court of a sentence which does not exceed that being recommended by the attorney,as set out in paragraph and,even if the court rejects one or more positions advocated by the attorney or defendant with regard to the application of the sentencing guidelines.
defendant waiver of rights to appeal and to bring collateral challenges shall not apply to appeals or challenges based on new legal principles in first circuit or supreme court cases decided after the date of this agreement which are held by the first circuit to have retroactive effect.
paragraph three of the plea agreement set forth the positions the government would take at sentencing the government would argue for a base offense level of for bribery resulting in government losses of between million and million under a b and would argue for certain adjustments in that offense level,including a increase under because the offense involved an abuse of a position of trust and would recommend an adjusted offense level of,for a sentencing range of months.the plea agreement further stated that sotirion could contest these calculations at sentencing.paragraph four of the agreement stated that the government would recommend a term of incarceration within the sentencing range of months.
at the hearing before a magistrate judge,the judge inquired into sotirion understanding of the plea agreement and the consequences of his plea.the judge called attention to the waiver provision,asking,and do you understand that you are waiving your right to appeal this case except i guess if there are legal issues that arise subsequent hereto.okay sotirion responded,yes.in addition,the magistrate judge confirmed with sotirion that he had had an opportunity to go over the plea agreement in detail,he understood the terms of the plea agreement,he understood that at sentencing the government would argue for a increase for abuse of trust and would argue for a sentencing range of months,there were no aspects of the plea agreement that he did not understand or wanted to raise with the court,and he had gone over the plea agreement line by line with counsel.
at sentencing,the court calculated an adjusted offense level of,based in part on the increase for abuse of a position of trust.although defense counsel successfully challenged several increases sought by the government counsel did not object to the increase for abuse of trust.this adjusted offense level,combined with sotirion criminal history category of i,resulted in an advisory sentencing guidelines range of months.the court sentenced sotirion to months of imprisonment,the middle of the guidelines range at the close of the hearing,the court stated that sotirion had a right to appeal the sentence.even though you pled guilty,that does not limit your right to appeal.
in january,sotirion filed a petition arguing that the increase for abuse of trust was not applicable to his offense under the sentencing guidelines.see,cmt.stating that an increase for abuse of trust under does not apply to an offense level calculated under.he contended that his sentence was therefore based on inaccurate information in violation of due process and was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing.the district court dismissed the petition,noting that the government did not contest that a technical error had been made in the advisory guidelines calculation,but concluding that the appellate waiver was knowing and voluntary and its enforcement would not constitute a miscarriage of justice.this appeal followed.
procedural default 
the government first contends that sotirion has procedurally defaulted his challenge to the validity of the appellate waiver by failing to raise it on direct review,and therefore he can obtain collateral relief only if he can demonstrate cause for his procedural default and actual prejudice resulting from the alleged error.see bousley united states.however,as the government concedes,it did not raise this procedural default argument in the district court,and the district court did not dismiss sotirion petition on this basis.because the government failed to raise procedural default as a defense to sotirion petition,we deem it waived.see united states,cir the government waived the issue of procedural default by not raising it in response to the petitions below.we decline to overlook the government waiver.oakes united states,cir p rocedural default is an affirmative defense and therefore,the government may lose the defense by neglecting to raise it in a response to a habeas petition.
appellate waiver 
the government next contends that sotirion entered into a valid and enforceable waiver of his right to appeal or collaterally attack his sentence,and therefore his claim of sentencing error is barred.sotirion argues that the waiver provision is unenforceable because the magistrate judge did not inquire specifically into his waiver of appellate rights at the colloquy,as required by federal rule of criminal procedure b n,and therefore did not ensure that he entered into the waiver knowingly and voluntarily,and enforcement of the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice.
in this circuit,presentence waivers of appellate rights are enforceable if they meet certain criteria.teeter,at.first,we require that the defendant enter into the waiver knowingly and voluntarily.id.at accord united states,cir.in examining whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights,the text of the written plea agreement and the colloquy are of critical importance.teeter,at.we evaluate whether the written plea agreement contains a clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating its scope,and whether the district court inquire d specifically at the hearing into any waiver of appellate rights,as required by rule b n.id.second,even if the waiver is knowing and voluntary,we retain discretion not to enforce the waiver if it would result in a miscarriage of justice.id.at accord,at.
claim of rule b n error 
sotirion contends that the magistrate judge failed to adequately inform him of the scope of his appellate waiver as instructed by rule b n,and therefore his appellate waiver was not knowing and voluntary.
rule b n states that prior to accepting the defendant guilty plea,the court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands,the following n the terms of any provision waiving the right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence.this provision was added to rule in to aid courts in ensur ing that waivers of appellate rights are knowing and voluntary.united states,cir citing.advisory committee notes.
in united states vonn,the supreme court addressed the standard for reviewing a defendant unpreserved claim that his guilty plea should be set aside on the basis of rule that case,the court failure to apprise the defendant of his right to counsel if he went to trial.the court held that a defendant who does not lodge a timely objection to rule error in the district court must satisfy the plain error standard in federal rule of criminal procedure b.id.at.in a later case,the court clarified the showing a defendant must make to obtain relief for an unpreserved claim of rule error under the third prong of the plain error test.united states dominguez benitez.the court held that a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea,on the ground that the district court committed plain error under rule,must show a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.id.at.
in,as a matter of first impression,we applied vonn and dominguez benitez to a defendant claim that his waiver of appellate rights should be set aside because the district court failed to comply with rule b n at his colloquy.we held that the plain error standard applies to unpreserved claims of violations of.b n,reasoning that vonn was not by its terms restricted to particular types of rule errors,at.we further held that,in order to establish that the rule b n error affected his substantial rights under the third prong of the plain error test,the defendant must show a reasonable probability that he would not have entered the plea had the error not been made.id.at.
sotirion concedes that his unpreserved rule b n challenge to the waiver is subject to plain error review under vonn and in order to show plain error,a defendant must demonstrate that there is error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
the magistrate judge inquiry into sotirion appellate waiver during the colloquy,although not as thorough or precise as it could have been,did not constitute obvious rule b n error under the second prong of the plain error test.sotirion does not dispute that his plea agreement contained a clear waiver of his right to directly appeal or collaterally attack his sentence.he agreed to waive his appellate rights if,inter alia,the court imposed a sentence that did not exceed that being recommended by the attorney,as set out in paragraph,months.sotirion sentence falls squarely within the scope of this waiver 
the magistrate judge specifically called attention to the waiver provision during the colloquy,albeit briefly,asking,and do you understand that you are waiving your right to appeal this case except i guess if there are legal issues that arise subsequent hereto.okay sotirion responded,yes.the magistrate judge did not fail to address the waiver provision entirely,nor did he contradict the terms of the written waiver.thus,this colloquy is different from the one found deficient in teeter,on which sotirion primarily relies.see teeter,at finding waiver not knowing and voluntary where district court not only omitted any mention of appellate waiver during colloquy,but also directly contradicted waiver,asking d o you also understand that both you and the government will have a right to appeal any sentence i impose.
furthermore,at the plea colloquy,sotirion,a college graduate,stated that he had reviewed the plea agreement line by line with counsel,he understood the terms of the agreement,and there were no aspects of the agreement he wished to raise with the court.he further stated that he understood that at sentencing,the government would argue for a increase for abuse of trust and a sentencing range of months.defense counsel confirmed that he had discussed the plea agreement with sotirion.
sotirion contends that the magistrate judge statement that he was waiving his appellate rights except i guess if there are legal issues that arise subsequent hereto was misleading because it suggested that sotirion retained the right to appeal or collaterally attack his sentence based on errors that occurred after the entry of the guilty as,for example,errors at sentencing.the magistrate judge language does not support this strained interpretation.we agree with the government that the judge mention of an exception for legal issues that arise subsequent hereto referred to the plea agreement clear statement that the waiver shall not apply to appeals or challenges based on new legal principles 
sotirion further argues that the rule colloquy was inadequate because the magistrate judge did not separately discuss the waiver of his right to collaterally attack h
