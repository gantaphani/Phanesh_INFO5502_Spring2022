when appellant joan laplante factoring business ran into serious financial trouble,she allegedly defrauded a number of lenders to obtain more money to help get her out of the mess.after a government investigation,indictment and trial,a jury convicted laplante of mail fraud under.laplante now appeals her conviction,challenging the district court jury instructions on the elements of mail fraud and claiming ineffective assistance of counsel.because neither argument prevails,we affirm.
background 
a.the scheme 
we walk through the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the government.united states hebshie,cir.starting in,laplante began running a company called jrl funding group jrl.while the company engaged in marketing,consulting and asset liquidation,much of its business involved factoring.factoring is a business arrangement whereby a company purchases an entity accounts receivable at a discount and collects on those accounts.the company profits when it collects more than what it paid for them.to run a factoring business in the first instance,a company needs sufficient capital to purchase another entity receivables even at the discounted rate.to finance jrl purchases of receivables,laplante obtained loans from various companies and individuals.she used the money she borrowed for that purpose until january.
in january,faced with financial woes,laplante business went under and her factoring business came to a screeching halt.yet from january to february,she continued to seek and obtain loans from individuals based upon her representation the money would be used for her factoring business which no longer existed,borrowing anywhere from to from a given individual.with respect to each loan,laplante and the lender executed a loan agreement describing jrl as a factoring,marketing and consulting business,and providing the interest rate on the loan.lenders could choose to either receive monthly interest payments or roll the interest back into the account.regardless of the option lenders chose,laplante promised to repay either one half of the funds in their account within days or all of the funds within days of receiving a written request for such repayment.each month,laplante mailed lenders an account statement reflecting the principal and the interest that had accumulated on their accounts to date.however,when it came time to repay certain lenders the principal and interest on their loans,laplante was repeatedly unable to deliver on her promise to do so.at one point,laplante estimated she owed lenders a total of one million dollars.
b.the trial 
laplante was indicted in march on one count of mail fraud in violation of.she was charged with devising a scheme and artifice to defraud and to obtain money by means of false and fraudulent pretenses,representations and promises,by allegedly lying to lenders about her ability to repay the loans and about the fact that the loans would be used for her factoring business.
trial began on february.as indicated by opening statements,the defense main theory was that laplante did not intend to deceive any of the individual lenders.according to the defense,the lenders should have known by looking at the loan agreements they signed that their loans were not being used solely for the factoring side of the business,but for the consolidated business which included marketing and consulting services.
the government told a starkly different story.the government theory was that laplante knew her business had stopped actively factoring by january,but she continued to seek and borrow money from individuals on the false representation that the money would be used for factoring.the government theorized that laplante was not using that money for factoring,but instead was using the money to repay other loan debts she owed.
to support its theory,the government presented evidence primarily through the testimony of a federal bureau of investigation fbi forensic accountant and attorney james normand,who represented a victim lender in a civil suit against laplante,that laplante company was not factoring during the relevant time period.the fbi accountant testified that she had reviewed jrl financial records and concluded that only a few transactions related to factoring were executed after january.without going into detail about the complaint allegations in the civil case,attorney normand testified on direct that the documentation laplante produced in connection with that case showed that jrl had not purchased any accounts receivable after january.the government also introduced into evidence a taped interview of laplante by the new hampshire attorney general office,during which she admitted jrl was not engaged in factoring activities after january.
through the testimony of more than twelve individuals from whom laplante had borrowed money between january and february,the government put forth evidence that laplante,as the sole person in charge of her business,lied to lenders about the viability of her business and lied that her company was actively engaged in factoring at the time.a number of witnesses testified that,from their conversations with laplante,they believed she sought loans from them for factoring specifically.
after the conclusion of the evidence and closing statements,the district court delivered its jury charge more on the jury instructions to come.the jury returned a guilty verdict the same day.laplante was later sentenced to months imprisonment with three years of supervised release and ordered to make restitution in the amount of.she timely appealed.
discussion 
jury instructions 
on appeal,laplante argues two jury instruction related errors occurred below.because,as laplante concedes,she failed to object to the jury instructions at trial,we review for plain error.united states riccio,cir.to establish plain error,a defendant must show that an error occurred,the error was obvious,the error affected substantial rights,and the error seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states vargas de jess,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.laplante can not satisfy the first prong of this test.thus,our analysis starts and ends with that prong.
title united states code section provides in relevant part 
whoever,having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises,for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do,places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter,any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the postal service,or deposits or causes to be deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
in charging the jury,the district court described the elements of mail fraud and explained that the jury decision had to be unanimous as to whether the government had proven those elements.the district court instructed that mail fraud consists of three elements the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt a scheme or artifice to defraud the defendant knowing and willing participation in the scheme to defraud with the specific intent to defraud and the use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme.as to the first element,the district court explained that a scheme to defraud is a plan to deprive another of money or property by trick,deceit,deception or swindle and that the scheme must relate to a material fact or matter.the district court described a material fact as one that has a natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the decision of the person to which it was addressed and instructed the jury that if it were to find a particular statement of fact was false,you must then determine whether that statement was one that a reasonable person would h a ve considered important in making his or her decision.the same principle applies to fraudulent or omissions of material facts.
with respect to the second element,the court defined knowingly as act ing voluntarily and deliberately,rather than mistakenly or inadvertently and willfully as act ing knowingly and purposefully with an intent to do something the law forbids.the jury was instructed that intent to defraud means to act willfully with a specific intent to deceive or cheat or for the purpose of either causing some financial loss to another or bringing about some financial gain to oneself.the court further instructed that the question of whether the defendant acted knowingly,willfully and with the intent to defraud is a question of fact for the jury to resolve and goes to the defendant state of mind.direct proof of intent,the court explained,is not required intent may be established by circumstantial evidence.
moving on to the third element,the court instructed the jury that the government had to prove the use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme to defraud,which means the mails must further or assist in carrying out the scheme.the court made clear that the burden to prove all of the elements rested with the government.
laplante first argues the district court erred when it instructed the jury on the elements of a scheme to defraud rather than on the elements of a scheme to obtain money or property by false or fraudulent pretenses,representations or promises.specifically,laplante argues that a scheme to obtain money by false pretenses includes proof of a false statement,whereas a scheme to defraud does not involve such proof.she says that because the government evidence at trial focused on the false statements laplante made to lenders,the heart of the government case focused on a scheme to obtain money or property by false or fraudulent pretenses,representations or promises,not a scheme to defraud.laplante contends that as a result,the district court should have conform ed its jury instructions to the government evidence of false statements at trial by instructing the jury on the elements of a scheme to obtain,and that failing to do so constituted error.we find no error,plain or otherwise.
the crux of laplante argument is based on the fundamentally flawed premise that a scheme to defraud can not be proven using false statements.enacted in,the original mail fraud statute prohibited the use of mails to further a ny scheme or artifice to defraud.durland united states.internal quotation marks omitted.the statute language did not include the words or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises,as it does today.the supreme court early on rejected a narrow interpretation of the phrase any scheme or artifice to defraud that would have confined the statute reach to such cases as,at common law,would come within the definition of false pretenses,such as cases involving an actual misrepresentation of a material fact.id.at.rather,durland broadly interpreted the words scheme to defraud to include everything designed to defraud by representations as to the past or present,or suggestions and promises as to the future.id.at.
codifying the holding in durland,congress amended the mail fraud statute in,giving further indication that the statute purpose is protecting property rights.mcnally united states,d superseded on other grounds.the amendment added the words or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises after the original phrase any scheme or artifice to defraud.id.quoting act of,ch,stat.the added language,the supreme court has said,is based on the statement in durland that the statute is intended to reach everything designed to defraud.mcnally,at.instead of using that phrase,however,congress chose any scheme or artifice for obtaining money or property.id.at.the meaning of the words to defraud which refer to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes and usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick,deceit,chicane or overreaching did not change after the amendment.id.quoting hammerschmidt united states.the obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses language simply made it unmistakable that the mail fraud statute reached false promises and misrepresentations as to the future as well as other frauds involving money or property.mcnally,at.
thus,as was the case before the language was added in,a scheme to defraud captures within its ambit false representations.see,durland,at mcnally,at.indeed,as we have said,a scheme to defraud includes any plan,pattern or cause of action,including false and fraudulent pretenses and misrepresentations that is,the government may,but is not required to,prove a scheme to defraud using evidence of false misrepresentations.united states brandon,cir quoting united states goldblatt,cir defining the terms scheme and artifice used in connection with the bank fraud statute,see also united states daniel,cir holding a scheme to defraud includes any plan or course of action by which someone intends to deprive another by deception of money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises internal quotation marks and citation omitted we have not distinguished a scheme to defraud from obtaining money or property by false or fraudulent pretenses in the restrictive manner suggested by laplante.we have instead taken the broader approach,consistent with supreme court precedent,that the government may secure a mail fraud conviction by prov ing the existence of a scheme conceived for the purpose of defrauding by means of false pretenses,representations or promises and the use of the united states mails in furtherance of that scheme.united states serrano,cir internal quotation marks,alterations,and citation omitted.
the government evidence in this case that laplante lied to lenders about the viability of her business and lied that jrl was actively factoring during the relevant time period sought to prove mail fraud and specifically,a scheme to defraud.the use of false misrepresentations as evidence against her does not,as laplante says,automatically mean a scheme to obtain was the only provision of the mail fraud statute under which the district court could have appropriately instructed the jury accordingly,the district court more than adequately instructed the jury on the necessary elements of a scheme to defraud and we find no error,plain or otherwise,with its instructions.
laplante next contends that even if the district court correctly focused its jury instructions on a scheme to defraud,the district court erred in failing to give a specific unanimity instruction on which particular false statement alleged in the indictment was used to carry out the fraud.we find no error.the court was not required to give that unanimity instruction because the jury is not required to agree on the means the specific false statement laplante used to carry out her fraudulent scheme.the requirement that a jury must come to a unanimous agreement on the principal facts underlying its verdict what courts have tended to call the elements of the offense does not extend to subsidiary facts what the supreme court has called brute facts.united states lee,cir see also united states reeder,cir following schad arizona,d noting a jury must agree unanimously that the government has proven all the elements of the offense,but it need not agree on the means by which all the elements were accomplished.t the supreme court has never suggested that in returning general verdicts in such cases the jurors should be required to agree on a single means of commission,any more than the indictments were required to specify one alone.united states hernandez albino,cir quoting schad,at finding no error in failure to give unanimity instruction on which gun the defendant carried in case involving a conviction for carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime.a jury,faced with divergent factual theories in support of the same ultimate issue,may decide unanimously,as is the case here,that the government has proven a scheme to defraud even if they may not be unanimous as to the precise manner in which it occurred.lee,at.on this we are not alon
