appellants paul decologero paul,paul decologero paul,and john decologero,john were members of a criminal organization known as the decologero crew.in,all three were convicted of violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico and a number of related crimes.appellants have now moved under to vacate their convictions.their motions are based on two federal bureau of investigation fbi reports that they claim are exculpatory evidence that the prosecution should have produced before trial under brady maryland,d.the district court denied the motions,finding that the prosecution team was not aware of the reports prior to the trial and that the reports were not material for brady purposes.we only address the materiality issue and affirm on that basis.
we recite the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the verdicts.bucci united states,cir.the facts are described in greater detail in our opinion on the direct appeals.see united states decologero,cir decologero i.
in the,paul ran the decologero crew criminal enterprise out of a gym he operated in woburn,massachusetts.his nephews paul and john,and other associates,assisted paul in his efforts to control part of boston drug trade.the crew traded in guns and drugs,and used force to compete with rival criminal factions.
a.the silva murder 
in,members of the crew,acting on orders from paul,murdered a year old woman named aislin silva,because paul was afraid that she would betray the crew to the police.the testimony at trial regarding silva killing came primarily from stephen dicenso,a former member of the decologero crew who was closely involved in the murder.according to dicenso,in november,the police found a stash of guns that the decologero crew had hidden in silva apartment.paul decided to kill silva because he was afraid that she would implicate him and his associates if the police interrogated her about the guns.
initially,paul planned to get silva to overdose on heroin,and he instructed paul to acquire some heroin for that purpose.dicenso and another decologero crew member,kevin meuse,then gave silva the heroin and told her that it was good cocaine.she took the heroin but did not overdose.when that plan failed,paul ordered meuse to kill silva by force.dicenso testified that meuse brought silva to dicenso father apartment and killed her by breaking her neck.dicenso and derek capozzi,another decologero crew member,subsequently arrived at the apartment to help meuse dispose of the body.the three of them dismembered her body in a bathtub,stuffed her body parts into plastic garbage bags and gym bags,and then drove to home depot to purchase a shovel and other items to assist with silva burial.then,they drove to a on the north shore of massachusetts and buried her remains there.they disposed of the garbage bags and gym bags in a dumpster in danvers,massachusetts.
dicenso testimony was corroborated by the testimony of two other former members of the decologero crew,john decologero john and thomas regan.as a crew member,regan took orders from paul and robbed a number of drug dealers with other associates.john was the brother of crew leader paul and father of paul and john.john testified that he had heard paul say that the heroin intended to kill silva did not work.he also testified that john told him that meuse had killed silva and that dicenso and capozzi had helped meuse dispose of her body.regan testified that paul told him that meuse and dicenso had killed silva and cut up her body.
dicenso testimony was also corroborated by physical evidence,including the bloody trash bags and gym bags found in the dumpster in danvers.dna from the blood,hair,and tissue on the bags belonged to silva.a security video from home depot showed capozzi and meuse leaving the store with a shovel and other items a receipt from the home depot included the purchase of a shovel,gloves,and flashlights.packaging for the flashlights and gloves was found in the danvers dumpster.meuse fingerprint was also found on an item in the dumpster.
at trial,appellants attempted to argue,with little success,that another criminal organization led by vincent marino,also known as gigi portalla,was responsible for silva murder.first,appellants contended that dicenso was actually a member of portalla crew,not the decologero crew,because dicenso had allegedly told a government informant that he worked for portalla.however,on,dicenso denied that he made the statement and said that he had not worked for portalla.second,portalla was seen at silva apartment a few weeks before her murder.however,the evidence demonstrated that portalla was there with paul to inspect the guns stored at the apartment to see if he wanted to purchase any guns from the decologero crew stash.finally,appellants argued that regan was lying because he was not a member of the decologero crew,but in fact was a member of the rival salemme faction.
appellants case was hurt by their failure to get portalla and his associates to testify at trial.paul initial witness list included portalla and portalla crew members charles mcconnell and robert nogueira.however,nogueira had died years earlier,and mcconnell was never subpoenaed.portalla was subpoenaed during trial,but he was in federal custody at the time,and could not be transferred quickly enough to testify.paul appealed the district court refusal to expedite portalla transport from a federal penitentiary in pennsylvania or to provide a continuance until portalla had arrived.we affirmed the district court decision,faulting paul for waiting until the middle of trial to make his request and stating that portalla proffered testimony was tangential and potentially cumulative.decologero i,at.
for his part in ordering silva death,paul was convicted of witness tampering conspiracy,witness tampering by misleading conduct,witness tampering by attempting to kill,and witness tampering by killing.several predicate acts underlying his substantive rico conviction also stemmed from his role in silva death.paul was convicted of witness tampering conspiracy,witness tampering by misleading conduct,and witness tampering by attempting to kill the latter two crimes were also predicate acts for his rico conviction.john was not charged with any offenses relating to the silva killing.all three were also convicted of other crimes not directly relevant to this appeal.paul received a life sentence,paul was sentenced to years,and john was sentenced to months.on direct appeal,we affirmed their convictions and sentences.see id.at.
b.the fbi reports 
in september,more than four years after appellants convictions,paul former attorney received a fax containing two fbi reports describing interviews with a woman named michelle noe the noe reports.according to the reports,the interviews with noe took place in the fall of,about two years before appellants were indicted by a federal grand and three years after silva was killed.the first report is three pages and describes two interviews that noe had with eugene kee of the massachusetts state police and detectives thomas romeo and michael murphy of the north reading police soon after she was arrested on an outstanding warrant for an unarmed bank robbery on september.noe reported that,in,mcconnell her came home in a panic with his clothes and arms covered in blood.after washing the blood off his arms,mcconnell put the bloody clothes in a green garbage bag,and left the house.about minutes later,noe looked outside the window and saw mcconnell talking to portalla on the sidewalk.when mcconnell returned to the house,he initially told noe that portalla would kill her if he told her what had happened.eventually,mcconnell said,i did something,i ca believe i did.she was your age.i not going into details.remember the girl i used to take you by the house with portalla.she worked at mvp.we did something to her,she ratted.mcconnell stated that portalla and nogueira were with him at the time,and if the police talk to noe,she should say that mcconnell was with her the entire evening.although the report does not identify silva by name,the parties do not dispute that noe was referring to silva as the girl who worked at mvp,a sporting goods store.
later noe was not sure of the time frame,when the news reported that human remains were found in a dumpster,mcconnell told noe,they going to put the puzzle together.i had to get rid of the knife in salt water.noe also stated in the interview that she had visited silva apartment in medford,massachusetts with mcconnell and portalla at least ten times over several months,and had seen nogueira at the apartment at least twice.noe added that mcconnell had told her that silva would purchase cocaine from portalla and that silva had been storing guns for portalla in exchange for cocaine.
only one page of the second fbi report is in the record.it describes an october,interview of noe with kee,along with vincent martin and fbi special agent charles gianturco.noe reported that in,mcconnell and portalla came to her apartment and tortured her by drugging her and burning her back.the one page of the report does not explain why they tortured her,or whether this event was related to the silva killing.
c.the motions 
in,all three appellants filed motions,arguing that the government violated their fifth amendment due process rights under brady by failing to disclose the two noe reports before trial.the motions were handled by the same district court judge who presided over appellants trial in.she denied appellants motions without holding an evidentiary hearing.see united states decologero,rwz,wl,at.july,decologero ii.the court provided two independent reasons for its decision.first,it held that appellants have not shown any brady violation because they have not shown that the prosecution team or any of its agents knew of the noe exculpatory reports before trial.id.at.second,the court held that,even if the prosecution team had been aware of the noe reports,the reports were not material for brady purposes because they do not raise a reasonable probability of a different outcome on the counts related to the silva killing or on unrelated counts.id.at.the district court granted a certificate of appealability as to petitioners brady claims based on the fbi reports,id.at,and appellants timely filed this appeal.
appellants contend that the district court erred by denying their motions without holding an evidentiary hearing.they challenge the court findings that the prosecution team was not aware of the noe reports,and the reports were not material under brady.we only address the materiality issue and do not consider whether the district court erred with regard to the government knowledge of the noe reports.
appellants make two arguments on materiality.first,they contend that the district court should have granted their motions and vacated their convictions based solely on the disclosure of the two noe reports.second,in the alternative,they contend that the district court erred by deciding the materiality issue without holding an evidentiary hearing.we address each argument in turn.
materiality 
we ordinarily review the district court dismissal of a brady claim raised in a motion de novo.seei moreno morales united states,cir.however,t he materiality question under brady is a mixed question of law and fact.conley united states,cir citing ouimette moran,cir.for this reason,we accord some deference to the district court resolution of the materiality issue.see conley,at some deference to the district court resolution of questions in the brady context is due,even on collateral review.united states sanchez,cir due to its inherently nature,the district court determination on the materiality of newly discovered evidence in prosecutorial nondisclosure cases is ordinarily accorded deference.quoting united states bagley,d white,concurring.deference is particularly warranted where,as here,the district court judge reviewing the motions was the same judge who presided over the trial.united states paladin,cir noting,in an appeal of the denial of a motion for a new trial based on a brady claim,that t he trial judge,having seen and heard the witnesses at first hand,has a special sense of the ebb and flow of the recently concluded trial.thus,her views about the likely impact of newly disclosed evidence deserve considerable deference.internal quotation marks omitted.
under brady,a defendant right to due process is violated when the prosecution suppresses evidence that is both favorable to the accused and material either to guilt or innocence.moreno morales,at citing brady,at.to demonstrate that exculpatory evidence is material,appellants must show a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.kyles whitley,d quoting bagley,at souter.a reasonable probability is one that undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.bagley,at.we must consider the favorable,undisclosed evidence along with the evidence presented at trial,and determine whether it could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.kyles,at see also id.at the question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,but whether in its absence he received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.withheld information is material under brady only if it would have been admissible at trial or would have led to admissible evidence.see ellsworth warden,cir.
because the noe reports are relevant in different ways to each appellant,we first analyze the materiality question separately for each of them,and then address the arguments that are applicable to all three.
the jury convicted paul for his part in overseeing and directing the conspiracy to kill silva.he contends that the noe reports are material because they contradict the government theory of the case that the decologero crew killed silva.instead,the reports support paul theory that portalla stored the guns at silva house and his crew including mcconnell and nogueira murdered silva.paul further argues that,if he had been aware of the reports before trial,he would have called noe to testify at trial,and her testimony would have corroborated his version of silva murder.
the government counters that the noe reports themselves are inadmissible hearsay and appellants have failed to demonstrate how their disclosure would have led to material admissible evidence.therefore,the government argues,and the district court found,that given the overwhelming weight of the trial evidence,the fbi reports do not raise a reasonable probability of a different outcome.decologero ii,wl,at.
at trial,multiple witnesses testified that paul led the decologero crew,that he stored guns at silva apartment,that he instructed his crew members to kill silva because she could not be trusted if interrogated by the police,and that his crew members dicenso,capozzi,and meuse killed silva and disposed of her body.the witnesses who implicated paul in silva murder included dicenso,john paul brother,and regan.furthermore,as the district court stated,the witnesses testimony was consistent and corroborated by the physical evidence discovered by police.id.
paul counters that much of the witness testimony can not be trusted because it was solicited from former members of the decologero crew,many of whom were testifying pursuant to cooperation agreements with the government.furthermore,paul argues that none of the physical evidence at trial directly implicated him in the murder.the physical evidence consisted of bloody bags containing silva dna in a dumpster in danvers,a security video and home depot receipt showing that capozzi and meuse had purchased items to assist in disposing of silva body,and meuse fingerprint on an item in the danvers dumpster.while none of this evidence directly connects paul to the crime,it does provide support for dicenso testimony that meuse had killed silva and that dicenso and capozzi had helped meuse dispose of her body.notably,no physical evidence supports the theory of the crime found in the noe reports that portalla,mcconnell,and nogueira were responsible for silva murder.
paul responds that even if dic
