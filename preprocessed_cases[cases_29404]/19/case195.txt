criminal defendants have a sixth amendment right to trial by an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.see taylor louisiana.to establish a prima facie violation of the requirement,a defendant must prove that a group qualifying as distinctive is not fairly and reasonably represented in jury venires,and systematic exclusion in the process accounts for the underrepresentation.duren missouri.
at voir dire in the kent county circuit court trial of respondent smith,an,the venire panel included between and individuals,only of whom,at most,were.at that time,constituted of the county population,and of the pool from which potential jurors were drawn.the court rejected smith objection to the panel racial composition,an jury convicted him of murder and felony firearm possession,and the court sentenced him to life in prison with the possibility of parole.
on order of the michigan court of appeals,the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on smith claim.the evidence at the hearing showed,inter alia,that under the order in effect when smith jury was empaneled,the county assigned prospective jurors first to local district courts,and,only after filling local needs,made remaining persons available to the countywide circuit court,which heard felony cases like smith.smith calls this procedure siphoning.the month after smith voir dire,however,the county reversed course and adopted a assignment order.it did so based on the belief that the district courts took most of the minority jurors,leaving the circuit court with a jury pool that did not represent the entire county.the trial court noted two means of measuring the underrepresentation of on circuit court venires.first,the court described the absolute disparity test,under which the percentage of in the jury pool is subtracted from the percentage of in the local,population.according to this measure,were underrepresented by.next,the court set out the comparative disparity test,under which the absolute disparity is divided by the percentage of in the population.the quotient indicated that,on average,were less likely,when compared to the overall population,to be on the list.in the months after kent county discontinued the assignment policy,the comparative disparity,on average,dropped from to.the hearing convinced the trial court that were underrepresented on circuit court venires.but smith evidence,the trial court held,was insufficient to prove that the order,or any other part of the process,had systematically excluded.the court therefore rejected smith claim.
the state intermediate appellate court reversed and ordered a new trial with jurors selected under the assignment order.reversing in turn,the michigan supreme court concluded that smith had not established a prima facie sixth amendment violation.this court,the state high court observed,has specified no preferred method for measuring whether representation of a distinctive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable.the court noted that lower federal courts had applied three tests the absolute and comparative disparity tests and a standard deviation test.adopting a approach allowing consideration of all three means of measuring underrepresentation,the court found that smith had failed to establish a legally significant disparity under any measurement.nevertheless giving smith the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation,the court determined that he had not shown systematic exclusion.
smith then filed a federal habeas petition.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa prohibits federal habeas relief unless the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,d.finding no infirmity in the michigan supreme court decision when assessed under aedpa standards,the district court dismissed smith petition.the sixth circuit reversed.the court of appeals ruled,first,that courts should use the comparative disparity test to measure underrepresentation where,as here,the allegedly excluded group is small.the court then held that smith comparative disparity statistics demonstrated that representation in county circuit court venires was unfair and unreasonable.it next stated that smith had shown systematic exclusion.in accord with the michigan intermediate appellate court,the sixth circuit believed that the assignment order significantly reduced the number of available for circuit court venires.smith was entitled to relief,the sixth circuit concluded,because no important state interest supported the allocation system.
held the sixth circuit erred in ruling that the michigan supreme court decision involv ed an unreasonable application o f clearly established federal law,d.duren hardly establishes no less clearly so that smith was denied his sixth amendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.
a the duren defendant readily met all three parts of the court prima facie test when he complained of the dearth of women in a county jury pool.first,he showed that women in the county were both numerous and distinct from men.at.second,to establish underrepresentation,he proved that women were of the population,but accounted for only of those summoned for jury service,and only of those on the postsummons weekly venires from which jurors were drawn,at.finally,to show the systematic cause of the underrepresentation,he pointed to missouri law permitting any woman to opt out of jury service and to the manner in which the county administered that law.this court noted that appropriately tailored hardship exemptions would likely survive a challenge if justified by an important state interest,at,but concluded that no such interest could justify the exemption for each and every woman,at.
b neither duren nor any other decision of this court specifies the method or test courts must use to measure underrepresentation.each of the three methods employed or identified by the courts below absolute disparity,comparative disparity,and standard deviation is imperfect.absolute disparity and comparative disparity measurements can be misleading where,as here,members of the distinctive group compose only a small percentage of the community population.and it appears that no court has relied exclusively on a standard deviation analysis.even absent aedpa constraint,this court would have no cause to take sides here on the appropriate method or methods for measuring underrepresentation.although the michigan supreme court concluded that smith statistical evidence failed to establish a legally significant disparity under either the absolute or comparative disparity tests,the court nevertheless gave smith the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation in order to reach the issue ultimately dispositive in duren to the extent underrepresentation existed,was it due to systematic exclusion see duren,at.
c smith evidence gave the michigan supreme court little reason to conclude that the assignment order had any significant effect on the representation of on circuit court venires.although the record established that some county officials believed that the assignment order created racial disparities,and the county reversed the order in response,the belief was not substantiated by smith evidence.he introduced no evidence that were underrepresented on the circuit court venires in significantly higher percentages than on the district court for grand rapids,which had the county largest population.he did not address whether grand rapids had more need for jurors per capita than any other district in kent county.and he did not compare the representation levels on circuit court venires with those on the federal district court venires for the same region.see duren,at.smith best evidence of systematic exclusion was the decline in comparative underrepresentation,from to,after kent county reversed its assignment order.but that evidence indicated no large change and was,in any event,insufficient to prove that the original assignment order had a significantly adverse impact on the representation of on circuit court venires.
d in addition to renewing his siphoning argument,smith urges that a laundry list of factors,the county practice of excusing prospective jurors without adequate proof of alleged hardship,and the refusal of county police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to appear combined to reduce systematically the number of appearing on jury lists.no clearly established precedent of this court supports smith claim.smith urges that one sentence in duren,at,places the burden of proving causation on the state.but smith clipped that sentence from its context the sentence does not concern the demonstration of a prima face case instead,it speaks to what the state might show to rebut the defendant prima facie case.the michigan supreme court was therefore far from unreasonable,d,in concluding that duren first and foremost required smith himself to show that the underrepresentation complained of was due to systematic exclusion.this court,furthermore,has never clearly established that features of the kind on smith list can give rise to a claim.rather,the taylor court recognized broad discretion in the states to prescribe relevant qualifications for their jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions.at.and in duren,the court understood that hardship exemptions resembling those smith assails might well survive a challenge.at.

justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
the sixth amendment secures to criminal defendants the right to be tried by an impartial jury drawn from sources reflecting a fair cross section of the community.see taylor louisiana.the question presented in this case is whether that right was accorded to respondent diapolis smith,an convicted of murder by an jury in kent county,michigan in.at the time of smith trial,constituted of kent county population,and of the pool from which potential jurors were drawn.
in duren missouri,this court described three showings a criminal defendant must make to establish a prima facie violation of the sixth amendment requirement.he or she must show that the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community and that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the process.at.the first showing is,in most cases,easily made the second and third are more likely to generate controversy.
the defendant in duren readily met all three measures.he complained of the dearth of women in the jackson county,missouri,jury pool.to establish underrepresentation,he proved that women were of the population,but accounted for only of the persons summoned for jury service,and only of the persons on the postsummons weekly venires from which jurors were drawn.to show the systematic cause of the underrepresentation,duren pointed to missouri law exempting women from jury service,and to the manner in which jackson county administered the exemption.concluding that no significant state interest could justify missouri explicitly exemption,this court held the law,as implemented in jackson county,violative of the sixth amendment requirement.
we here review the decision of the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit holding that smith satisf ied the prima facie test established by duren,and granting him habeas corpus relief,release from imprisonment absent a new trial commenced within days of the court of appeals order.despite marked differences between smith case and duren,and a cogent michigan supreme court decision holding that smith ha d not shown systematic exclusion,people smith,the sixth circuit found the matter settled.cognizant of the restrictions congress placed on federal habeas review of convictions,the court of appeals considered that a decision contrary to its own would involv e an unreasonable application o f clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,at.
the sixth circuit erred in so ruling.no decision of this court clearly establishe s smith entitlement to relief.according to the sixth circuit,smith had demonstrated that a kent county procedure,which smith calls siphoning,systematic ally exclu ded under this procedure,kent county assigned prospective jurors first to local district courts,and,only after filling local needs,made remaining persons available to the countywide circuit court,which heard felony cases like smith.the michigan supreme court,however,had rejected smith siphoning plea for lack of proof that the assignment procedure caused underrepresentation.smith,at,at.as that determination was not at all unreasonable,the sixth circuit had no warrant to disturb it.see d.
in addition to renewal of his siphoning argument,smith here urges that a host of factors combined to reduce systematically the number of appearing on kent county jury lists,for example,the kent county court practice of excusing people without adequate proof of alleged hardship,and the refusal of kent county police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to appear.brief for respondent.our decisions do not address factors of the kind smith urges.we have cautioned,however,that t he principle must have much leeway in application.taylor,at see,at court holding that sixth amendment is violated by systematic exclusion of women from jury service does not augur or authorize the fashioning of detailed codes by federal courts.
on november,christopher rumbley was shot and killed during a bar brawl in grand rapids,michigan.the bar was crowded at the time of the brawl,with people on the premises.all patrons of the bar were.the state charged smith with the murder in kent county circuit court.
voir dire for smith trial took place in september.the venire panel included between and individuals.the parties agree that,at most,three venire members were.smith unsuccessfully objected to the composition of the venire panel.
smith case proceeded to trial before an jury.the case for the prosecution turned on the identity of the man who shot rumbley.witnesses from the bar,including smith,testified at the trial.of those,two testified that smith fired the gun.five testified that the shooter was not smith,and the remainder made no identifications of the shooter.the jury convicted smith of murder and possession of a firearm during a felony,and the court sentenced him to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.
on first appeal,the michigan court of appeals ordered the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on smith claim.the hearing occurred in early.smith evidence showed that grand rapids,the largest city in kent county,was home to roughly of kent county population,and to of its residents.felony charges in kent county were tried in a sole circuit court.misdemeanors were prosecuted in district courts,each covering a discrete geographical area.to fill the courts venires,kent county sent questionnaires to prospective jurors.the circuit court administrator testified that about of the forms were returned as undeliverable,and another to were not answered.app.from the pool of prospective jurors who completed questionnaires,the county granted requests for hardship exemptions,for lack of transportation or child care,at.kent county then assigned nonexempt prospective jurors to their local district courts venires.after filling the district courts needs,the county assigned the remaining prospective jurors to the circuit court panels,at.
the month after voir dire for smith trial,kent county reversed the assignment order.it did so,according to the circuit court administrator,based on t he belief that the respective districts essentially swallowed up most of the minority jurors,leaving the circuit court with a jury pool that did not represent the entire county.at.the jury minority representation committee,its testified,held the same view concerning the impact of choosing district court jurors first and not returning unused persons to the pool available for circuit court selections,at.
the trial court considered two means of measuring the extent of underrepresentation of on circuit court venires absolute disparity and comparative disparity.absolute disparity is determined by subtracting the percentage of in the jury pool here,in the six months leading up to smith trial from the percentage of in the local,population here.by an absolute disparity measure,therefore,were underrepresented by.comparative disparity is determined by dividing the absolute disparity here,by the group representation in the population here.the quotient here,showed that,in the six months prior to smith trial,were,on average,less likely,when compared to the overall population,to be on the list.app.to pet.for cert.
isolating the month smith jury was selected,smith statistics expert estimated that the comparative disparity was.app.in the months after kent county discontinued the assignment policy,the comparative disparity,on average,dropped from to,at.
smith also introduced the testimony of an expert in demographics and economics,who tied the underrepresentation to social and economic factors.in kent county,the expert explained,these forces made less likely than whites to receive or return questionnaires,and more likely to assert a hardship excuse,at.
the hearing convinced the trial court that were underrepresented in circuit court venires.app.to pet.for cert.but smith evidence was insufficient,that court held,to prove that the order,or any other part of the process,had systematically excluded,at.the court therefore rejected smith claim.
the michigan court of appeals concluded that the system in place at the relevant time did result in the underrepresentation of,at.reversing the trial court judgment,the intermediate appellate court ordered a new trial,with jurors selected under the assignment order installed shortly after the voir dire in smith case.see supra,at.
the michigan supreme court,in turn,reversed the court of appeals judgment,concluding that smith ha d not established a prima facie violation of the sixth amendment requirement.smith,at,at.the michigan high court observed,first,that this court has specified no preferred method for measuring whether representation of a distinctive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable.at,at.the court then noted that lower federal courts had applied three different methods to measure fair and reasonable representation the absolute and comparative disparity tests,described supra,at,and the standard deviation test.
recognizing that no single test was entirely satisfactory,the michigan supreme court adopted a approach allowing consideration of all three means of measuring underrepresentation.smith,at,at.smith statistical evidence,the court found,failed to establish a legally significant disparity under either the absolute or comparative disparity tests.at,at.the parties had presented no expert testimony regarding application of the standard deviation test,at,at,supra,at.
nevertheless grant ing smith the benefit of the doubt on unfair and unreasonable underrepresentation,the michigan supreme court ultimately determined that he ha d not shown systematic exclusion.smith,at,at.smith evidence,the court said,did not show how the alleged siphoning of african american jurors to district courts affected the circuit court jury pool.at,at.in particular,the court observed,t he record does not disclose whether the district court jury pools contained more,fewer,or approximately the same percentage of minority jurors as the circuit court jury pool.ibid.the court also ruled that the influence of social and economic factors on juror participation does not demonstrate a systematic exclusion.at,at.
in february,smith filed a habeas corpus petition in the united states district court for the western district of michigan,reasserting his claim.because smith is in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,governed the district court review of his application for federal habeas corpus relief.under the controlling provision of aedpa,codified in d,a state prisoner application may not be granted as to any claim adjudicated in state court unless the state court adjudication 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
applying these standards,the district court dismissed smith habeas petition.app.to pet.for cert.
the court of appeals reversed.where,as here,the allegedly excluded group is small,the sixth circuit ruled,courts should use the comparative disparity test to measure underrepresentation,at.in that court view,smith comparative disparity statistics sufficed to demonstrate that the representation of african american veniremen in kent county was unfair and unreasonable.ibid.as to systematic exclusion,the sixth circuit,in accord with the michigan intermediate appellate court,believed that the order in effect when smith jury was empaneled significantly reduced the number of available for circuit court venires,at.smith was entitled to relief,the court concluded,because no important state interest supported that allocation system,at 
the state petitioned for certiorari attacking the sixth circuit decision on two principal grounds first,the state charged that the federal appellate court erred in adopting the comparative disparity test to determine whether a distinctive group was underrepresented in the jury pool.pet.for cert.ii.second,the state urged that,in any event,there was no systematic exclusion of african americans from juries in kent county,michigan,at,and no warrant for the sixth circuit contrary determination we granted review,and now reverse the sixth circuit judgment.
according to the sixth circuit,the michigan supreme court rejection of smith sixth amendment plea involved an unreasonable application o f clearly established federal law,as determined by this court in duren.d see,at.we disagree.as explained below,our duren decision hardly establishes no less clearly so that smith was denied his sixth amendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.
to establish a prima facie violation of the requirement,this court pathmarking decision in duren instructs,a defendant must prove that a group qualifying as distinctive is not fairly and reasonably represented in jury venires,and systematic exclusion in the process accounts for the underrepresentation,at see supra,at.
the defendant in duren successfully challenged jackson county administration of a missouri exemption permitting any woman to opt out of jury service,at.the court explained why it was plain that defendant duren had established a prima facie case.first,women in jackson county were both numerous and distinct from men.at quoting taylor,at.second,duren statistical presentation showed gross underrepresentation women were over half the population in stark contrast,they accounted for less than of jury venires,at.
duren also demonstrated systematic exclusion with particularity.he proved that women underrepresentation was persistent occurring in every weekly venire for almost a year and he identified the two stages of the process when the systematic exclusion took place.at.first,questionnaires for prospective jurors stated conspicuously that women could opt out of jury service.less than of those summoned were female,suggesting that women in large numbers claimed the exemption at the questionnaire stage.ibid.moreover,at the summons stage women were given another opportunity to opt out.at.and if a woman ignored the summons,she was deemed to have opted out no further inquiry was made,at.at this final,
