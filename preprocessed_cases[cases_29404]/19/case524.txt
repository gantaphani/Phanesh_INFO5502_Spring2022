this appeal illustrates both the considerable responsibility granted to a jury,and the restricted scope of federal court review of state court convictions.a heinous crime most certainly occurred.less certain is the perpetrator identity.no confession,testimony,dna,or similar evidence pointed the finger confidently at any one person.rather,the direct evidence simply narrowed the list of suspects.a properly instructed massachusetts superior court jury then found that the circumstantial evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that one of the suspects,keith winfield,committed the crimes.now serving a life sentence for assaulting and raping a child,winfield filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,seeking to invalidate his conviction on two grounds.
first,he claims that the evidence against him was so insufficient that no reasonable jurist could have concluded that a rational jury could have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.second,he claims that the state trial court refusal to permit him to the victim mother about her potential bias arising from pending criminal charges against her constituted an unreasonable application of the clearly established sixth amendment confrontation right.the district court,concluding that the state courts rejection of winfield claims did not constitute an unreasonable application of federal law,denied the petition.we now affirm.
background 
factual summary 
the charges on which winfield was convicted stemmed from the vaginal and anal rape of his niece with a curling iron on october.we recount the evidence presented against winfield largely as it was described in the opinion of the massachusetts appeals court,supplementing that description,where appropriate,with other record facts consistent with the state court findings.see,lynch ficco,cir.
the victim,who was the daughter of winfield wife sister,was born in,and lived with her mother and maternal grandparents in tewksbury,massachusetts.in september,the victim mother,who was seeking employment,began leaving her daughter with winfield wife,patricia,on those days when she was out looking for a job.winfield and patricia themselves had two daughters at the time,one was four years old,and the other was eight months old.winfield,patricia,and their two daughters lived on the first floor of a home in melrose,massachusetts.

on tuesday,october,the victim mother returned home from work,and,upon changing her daughter diapers,found bruises on her daughter arms and legs.she nevertheless returned the victim to patricia and winfield home the next day.that day,after work,she noticed additional bruising on her daughter face,arms,and abdomen.the victim mother called patricia to inquire about the bruises,but both patricia and winfield,who was on leave from his job and would later report that he was home on that day,denied knowledge of them.
at the end of the following day,wednesday,october,the victim mother noticed more bruises on the victim arms and stomach.the only evidence of who was with the victim that day other than her mother was contained in winfield statement to police detectives on november.in that statement,winfield reported that he did not assist his wife in taking care of the victim that day.rather,he slept late,then left for approximately four hours,returning just as the grandmother arrived to pick up the victim.
on the morning of thursday,october,the victim mother changed the victim diaper before driving to patricia to drop the victim off.the victim mother noticed nothing of concern in the victim genital or anal area.she again dropped off the victim at the winfield home,and went to work.winfield was asleep when the victim was dropped off,but awoke between to winfield father and brother,who lived in the upstairs unit,were not home that day.

the victim mother called a third time,immediately after hanging up,but the line was busy.the final call took place at,and winfield answered the telephone.when the victim mother asked winfield if her daughter was okay,the defendant replied that she was fine and was just sitting and playing.
when the grandmother arrived at winfield home to pick up the victim that afternoon,winfield and patricia were both at home,and the victim was sleeping.after a few minutes,the victim awoke and ran to her grandmother,crying.as they went to the car,the grandmother tried to get the victim to walk,but she refused,and continued to cry.as an explanation,winfield offered only maybe her legs are still asleep.the victim continued to cry all the way to tewksbury.once inside the tewksbury house,the grandmother changed the victim diaper,and noticed that her vaginal area was red and puffy 
that evening,the victim mother changed the victim diaper at,and the victim cried and appeared to be in pain.the victim vaginal and anal areas were very red.the victim continued to cry,but eventually fell asleep,around around,the victim woke up and said she needed a diaper change.the mother again changed the victim diaper,this time noticing that the victim genital and anal areas were bleeding,and that the skin in those areas was blistering.the victim cried during the change,but soon fell back asleep.

at allen suggestion,the mother took the victim to children hospital,where the victim was seen at approximately by a team of physicians that included alice newton,the medical director of the child protection team at children hospital.the team examined and photographed the victim,and determined that there were second and burns on the victim genitals and anus.the victim labia majora and the structure inside it were red and blistered.also red,blistered,and peeling was a four to area around the victim anus.internal examination revealed that the burns extended almost an inch inside the victim anus,and that there were three tears from stretching of the anal tissue.the doctors concluded that these injuries indicated impalement by a hot,cylindrical instrument.in addition,they observed bruises on the victim left jaw,her forehead,her cheek,her chest,and her right nipple.newton opined at trial that the vaginal and anal burns were intentionally inflicted,with a cylindrical instrument such as a curling iron,between and hours before she examined the victim at approximately midnight on october,between noon and midnight on thursday,october,the last day the child was at winfield home.
a cat scan of the victim,taken on october,at,revealed that the victim also had a large skull fracture on the rear left side of her head,with internal bleeding near her brain.newton opined that the cause of such an injury must have been a traumatic event,but that she could not say whether the injury was accidental or purposefully inflicted.she opined that the injury was sustained within three days of the cat scan.

procedural history 
in august,a middlesex county grand jury indicted winfield on two counts of rape of child,see.laws ch,indecent assault and battery on child under the age of fourteen,see id,and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon causing serious bodily injury,see id.c i.at trial,he timely moved for a required finding of not guilty.the judge denied his motion.on the second day of deliberations,the jury returned guilty verdicts on all charges.winfield received concurrent life sentences on both rape charges,and concurrent year sentences on the remaining two convictions.
winfield timely appealed to the massachusetts appeals court,arguing,inter alia,that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the commonwealth case,and by refusing to allow him to impeach the victim mother for bias stemming from her pending criminal charges.after briefing and oral argument,the appeals court affirmed his convictions.see commonwealth winfield.in rejecting his sufficiency claim,it reasoned as follows 
the main evidence presented against the defendant was the medical evidence and the defendant recorded police interview.from the medical evidence,the jury could have concluded that the burns and skull fracture of the victim were inflicted shortly after midday on october,and that the victim would have cried aloud as she suffered the injuries.the jury could also infer that,because the victim would have cried aloud,the injuries were inflicted at a time when no one was around to hear the victim cries.moreover,from the defendant prior recorded statements to the police,the jury were aware that,on the day the injuries were inflicted,the defendant was at home during midday with only the victim and his eight month old daughter.therefore,the defendant was the only adult who had access to the victim during the time span in which the injuries occurred.
in addition to having access to the victim,the defendant had the means to commit the crimes.in the bathroom of the defendant home was a small curling iron.after viewing photographs of the victim injuries,the jury could find that the pattern of the burns to the victim anus were consistent with having been inflicted by a hot instrument the same shape and size of a small curling iron.
finally,the jury could consider the fact that the defendant,and not his wife,had expressed displeasure over the presence of the victim in his home.in his recorded interview,the defendant stated that he never wanted his wife to care for the victim.while such evidence is insufficient to establish motive,the jury could infer the defendant hostility toward the victim,which is relevant to motive.there was no evidence that such hostility was shared by his wife.
in sum,the judge correctly ruled that the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the commonwealth,permitted a rational trier of fact to find the defendant guilty of the indictments.
id.at footnotes omitted.
winfield sought further appellate review from the massachusetts supreme judicial court.after his application was denied,see commonwealth winfield,he timely filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.the district court denied his petition,but issued a certificate of appealability as to both issues.winfield appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.analysis 
sufficiency of the evidence 
in seeking to set aside a verdict under the federal constitution for lack of sufficient proof,winfield needed to convince the massachusetts courts that,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,magraw roden,cir.this standard exhibits great respect for the jury verdict,magraw,f d at,but nevertheless does not insulate such a verdict from reversal if based on evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable,insupportable,or overly speculative.id.quoting united states spinney,cir.
with the massachusetts courts having rejected winfield direct appeal by concluding that the jury verdict was based on sufficient evidence,this collateral attack seeking a writ of habeas corpus from a federal court provides winfield with a second,more limited opportunity to set aside the jury verdict.as constrained by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,our collateral federal review is limited to determining whether the state courts decision finding the evidence constitutionally sufficient was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.in other words,we do not ask,as we might on direct review of a conviction in federal court,whether the evidence was constitutionally sufficient.we ask,instead,whether the state courts ruling that the evidence is constitutionally sufficient was itself unreasonable.id unreasonable in this context means that the decision evinces some increment of incorrectness beyond mere error.leftwich maloney,cir see generally hurtado tucker,cir habeas review involves the layering of two standards.the habeas question of whether the state court decision is objectively unreasonable is layered on top of the underlying standard governing the constitutional right asserted.the resulting test raises a high bar,but it is nevertheless a bar that can be met.see,cir acknowledging the extremely high bar that must be overcome on habeas review to overturn a state court decision,but finding the bar met.
