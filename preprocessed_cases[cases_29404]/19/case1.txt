bobby james moore,petitioner texas 
on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
bobby james moore fatally shot a store clerk during a botched robbery.he was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.moore challenged his death sentence on the ground that he was intellectually disabled and therefore exempt from execution.a state habeas court made detailed factfindings and determined that,under this court decisions in atkins virginia,and hall florida,moore qualified as intellectually disabled.for that reason,the court concluded,moore death sentence violated the eighth amendment proscription of cruel and unusual punishments.the habeas court therefore recommended that moore be granted relief.
the texas court of criminal appeals cca declined to adopt the judgment recommended by the state habeas court in the cca view,the habeas court erroneously employed guides currently used in the medical community rather than the guides adopted by the cca in ex parte briseno.see ex parte moore.the appeals court further determined that the evidentiary factors announced in briseno weigh ed heavily against upsetting moore death sentence,at.
we vacate the cca judgment.as we instructed in hall,adjudications of intellectual disability should be informed by the views of medical experts.at slip,at see,at slip,at.that instruction can not sensibly be read to give courts leave to diminish the force of the medical community consensus.moreover,the several factors briseno set out as indicators of intellectual disability are an invention of the cca untied to any acknowledged source.not aligned with the medical community information,and drawing no strength from our precedent,the briseno factors creat e an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed,at slip,at.accordingly,they may not be used,as the cca used them,to restrict qualification of an individual as intellectually disabled.
in april,bobby james moore and two others were engaged in robbing a grocery store.ex parte moore.crim.app.app.during the episode,moore fatally shot a store clerk,at.some two months later,moore was convicted and sentenced to death.see,at.a federal habeas court later vacated that sentence based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel,see moore collins,dist.lexis,sd,and the fifth circuit affirmed,see moore johnson.moore was resentenced to death in,and the cca affirmed on direct appeal.see moore state,wl,cert.denied.
moore subsequently sought state habeas relief.in,the state habeas court conducted a hearing on whether moore was intellectually disabled.see ex parte moore,jud,harris,app.to pet.for cert.the court received affidavits and heard testimony from moore family members,former counsel,and a number of experts.the evidence revealed that moore had significant mental and social difficulties beginning at an early age.at,moore lacked basic understanding of the days of the week,the months of the year,and the seasons he could scarcely tell time or comprehend the standards of measure or the basic principle that subtraction is the reverse of addition,at.at school,because of his limited ability to read and write,moore could not keep up with lessons,at.often,he was separated from the rest of the class and told to draw pictures.ibid.moore father,teachers,and peers called him stupid for his slow reading and speech,at.after failing every subject in the ninth grade,moore dropped out of high school,at.cast out of his home,he survived on the streets,eating from trash cans,even after two bouts of food poisoning,at.
in evaluating moore assertion of intellectual disability,the state habeas court consulted current medical diagnostic standards,relying on the edition of the american association on intellectual and developmental disabilities aaidd clinical manual,see aaidd,intellectual disability definition,classification,and systems of supports hereinafter,and on the edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published by the american psychiatric association apa,see apa,diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders hereinafter.app.to pet.for cert.the court followed the generally accepted,uncontroversial diagnostic definition,which identifies three core elements deficits indicated by an iq score approximately two standard deviations below the mean a score of roughly adjusted for the standard error of measurement,at adaptive deficits the inability to learn basic skills and adjust behavior to changing circumstances,hall flor ida,slip,at and the onset of these deficits while still a minor.see app.to pet.for cert.citing,at.see also hall,at slip,at 
moore iq scores,the habeas court determined,established subaverage intellectual functioning.the court credited six of moore iq scores,the average of which indicated mild intellectual disability.app.to pet.for cert.and relying on testimony from several experts,the habeas court found significant adaptive deficits.in determining the significance of adaptive deficits,clinicians look to whether an individual adaptive performance falls two or more standard deviations below the mean in any of the three adaptive skill sets conceptual,social,and practical.see,at.moore performance fell roughly two standard deviations below the mean in all three skill categories.app.to pet.for cert.based on this evidence,the state habeas court recommended that the cca reduce moore sentence to life in prison or grant him a new trial on intellectual disability.see,at.
the cca rejected the habeas court recommendations and denied moore habeas relief.see.at the outset of its opinion,the cca reaffirmed ex parte briseno.crim.app,as paramount precedent on intellectual disability in texas capital cases.see,at.briseno adopted the definition of,and standards for assessing,intellectual disability contained in the ninth edition of the american association on mental retardation aamr manual,predecessor to the current manual.see,at citing aamr,mental retardation definition,classification,and systems of supports ed.hereinafter.
briseno incorporated the requirement that adaptive deficits be related to deficits,at quoting,at to determine whether a defendant has satisfied the relatedness requirement,the cca instructed in this case,texas courts should attend to the seven evidentiary factors first set out in briseno,at no citation to any authority,medical or judicial,accompanied the briseno court recitation of the seven factors.see,at.
the habeas judge erred,the cca held,by us ing the most current position,as espoused by aaidd,regarding the diagnosis of intellectual disability rather than the test in briseno.at.this court decision in atkins virginia,the cca emphasized,left it to the states to develop appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction on the execution of the intellectually disabled,at.thus,even though i t may be true that the aaidd and apa positions regarding the diagnosis of intellectual disability have changed since atkins and briseno,the cca retained briseno instructions,both because of the subjectivity surrounding the medical diagnosis of intellectual disability and because the texas legislature had not displaced briseno with any other guideposts,at.the briseno inquiries,the court said,remai n adequately informed by the medical community diagnostic framework.at quoting hall,at slip,at.
employing briseno,the cca first determined that moore had failed to prove significantly subaverage intellectual functioning,at.rejecting as unreliable five of the seven iq tests the habeas court had considered,the cca limited its appraisal to moore scores of in and in,at.the court then discounted the lower end of the range associated with those scores,at see infra,at describing standard error of measurement.regarding the score of,the court observed that moore history of academic failure,and the fact that he took the test while exhibit ing withdrawn and depressive behavior on death row,might have hindered his performance,at.based on the two scores,but not on the lower portion of their ranges,the court concluded that moore scores ranked above the intellectually disabled range above.see,at.
even if moore had proven that he suffers from significantly general intellectual functioning,the court continued,he failed to prove significant and related limitations in adaptive functioning.at.true,the court acknowledged,moore and the state experts agreed that moore test scores fell more than two standard deviations below the mean,at see supra,at.but the state expert ultimately discounted those test results because moore had no exposure to certain tasks the testing included,such as writing a check and using a microwave oven.at.instead,the expert emphasized moore adaptive strengths in school,at trial,and in prison,at.
the cca credited the state expert appraisal,at.the habeas court,the cca concluded,had erred by concentrating on moore adaptive weaknesses,at.moore had demonstrated adaptive strengths,the cca spelled out,by living on the streets,playing pool and mowing lawns for money,committing the crime in a sophisticated way and then fleeing,testifying and representing himself at trial,and developing skills in prison,at.those strengths,the court reasoned,undercut the significance of moore adaptive limitations,at.
the habeas court had further erred,the cca determined,by failing to consider whether any of moore adaptive deficits were related to causes other than his intellectualfunctioning deficits,at.among alternative causes for moore adaptive deficits,the cca suggested,were an childhood,undiagnosed learning disorders,multiple transfers,racially motivated harassment and violence at school,and a history of academic failure,drug abuse,and absenteeism.ibid.moore significant improvement in prison,in the cca view,confirmed that his academic and social difficulties were not related to deficits.ibid.the court then examined each of the seven briseno evidentiary factors,see supra,at,and,concluding that those factors weigh ed heavily against finding that moore had satisfied the relatedness requirement,at.
judge alcala dissented.atkins and hall,she would have held,require courts to consult current medical standards to determine intellectual disability,at.she criticized the majority for relying on manuals superseded in the medical community,at,and for disregarding the habeas court credibility determinations,at.judge alcala questioned the legitimacy of the seven briseno factors,recounting wide criticism of the factors and explaining how they deviate from the current medical consensus.see,at,and.most emphatically,she urged,the cca must consult the medical community current views and standards in determining whether a defendant is intellectually disabled reliance on standard s no longer employed by the medical community,she objected,is constitutionally unacceptable.at.
we granted certiorari to determine whether the cca adherence to superseded medical standards and its reliance on briseno comply with the eighth amendment and this court precedents.
the eighth amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishments,and reaffirms the duty of the government to respect the dignity of all persons,hall,at slip,at quoting roper simmons.to enforce the constitution protection of human dignity,we loo k to the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,recognizing that t he eighth amendment is not fastened to the obsolete.hall,at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in atkins virginia,we held that the constitution restrict s the state power to take the life of any intellectually disabled individual,at.see also hall,at slip,at roper,at.executing intellectually disabled individuals,we concluded in atkins,serves no penological purpose,see,at runs up against a national consensus against the practice,see,at and creates a risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty,at internal quotation marks omitted see,at.
in hall florida,we held that a state can not refuse to entertain other evidence of intellectual disability when a defendant has an iq score above,at slip,at.although atkins and hall left to the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the restriction on executing the intellectually disabled,at slip,at quoting atkins,at,states discretion,we cautioned,is not unfettered,at slip,at.even if the views of medical experts do not dictate a court determination,at slip,at,we clarified,the determination must be informed by the medical community diagnostic framework,at slip,at.we relied on the most recent and still current versions of the leading diagnostic manuals the and,at,slip,at.florida,we concluded,had violated the eighth amendment by disregard ing established medical practice.at slip,at.we further noted that florida had parted ways with practices and trends in other states,at slip,at.hall indicated that being informed by the medical community does not demand adherence to everything stated in the latest medical guide.but neither does our precedent license disregard of current medical standards.
the cca conclusion that moore iq scores established that he is not intellectually disabled is irreconcilable with hall.hall instructs that,where an iq score is close to,but above,courts must account for the test standard error of measurement.see,at,slip,at.see also brumfield cain,slip,at relying on hall to find unreasonable a state court conclusion that a score of precluded an finding.as we explained in hall,the standard error of measurement is a statistical fact,a reflection of the inherent imprecision of the test itself.at slip,at.for purposes of most iq tests,this imprecision in the testing instrument means that an individual score is best understood as a range of scores on either side of the recorded score within which one may say an individual true iq score lies.at slip,at.a test standard error of measurement reflects the reality that an individual intellectual functioning can not be reduced to a single numerical score.ibid.see also,at slip,at,at aaidd,user guide intellectual disability definition,classification,and systems of supports ed.hereinafter user guide.
moore score of,adjusted for the standard error of measurement,yields a range of to,see,at,as the state retained expert acknowledged,see brief for petitioner,app.because the lower end of moore score range falls at or below,the cca had to move on to consider moore adaptive functioning.see hall,at slip,at,at alcala,dissenting even if the majority correctly limited the scores it would consider,current medical standards would still require the cca to examine whether moore has adaptive deficits 
both texas and the dissent maintain that the cca properly considered factors unique to moore in disregarding the lower end of the range.post,at brief for respondent see supra,at,at.but the presence of other sources of imprecision in administering the test to a particular individual,see post,at,and,can not narrow the range 
in requiring the cca to move on to consider moore adaptive functioning in light of his iq evidence,we do not suggest that the eighth amendment turns on the slightest numerical difference in iq score,post,at.hall invalidated florida strict iq cutoff because the cutoff took an iq score as final and conclusive evidence of a defendant intellectual capacity,when experts in the field would consider other evidence.at slip,at.here,by contrast,we do not end the inquiry,one way or the other,based on moore iq score.rather,in line with hall,we require that courts continue the inquiry and consider other evidence of intellectual disability where an individual iq score,adjusted for the test standard error,falls within the clinically established range for deficits.
the cca consideration of moore adaptive functioning also deviated from prevailing clinical standards and from the older clinical standards the court claimed to apply.
in concluding that moore did not suffer significant adaptive deficits,the cca overemphasized moore perceived adaptive strengths.the cca recited the strengths it perceived,among them,moore lived on the streets,mowed lawns,and played pool for money.see,at.moore adaptive strengths,in the cca view,constituted evidence adequate to overcome the considerable objective evidence of moore adaptive deficits,see supra,at app.to pet.for cert.see,at.but the medical community focuses the inquiry on adaptive deficits,at significant limitations in conceptual,social,or practical adaptive skills are not outweighed by the potential strengths in some adaptive skills at,inquiry should focus on d eficits in adaptive functioning deficits in only one of the three domains suffice to show adaptive deficits see brumfield,at slip,at i ntellectually disabled persons may have strengths in social or physical capabilities,strengths in some adaptive skill areas,or strengths in one aspect of an adaptive skill in which they otherwise show an overall limitation.quoting aamr,mental retardation definition,classification,and systems of supports ed.
in addition,the cca stressed moore improved behavior in prison,at.clinicians,however,caution against reliance on adaptive strengths developed in a controlled setting,as a prison surely is,at adaptive functioning may be difficult to assess in a controlled setting,prisons,detention centers if possible,corroborative information reflecting functioning outside those settings should be obtained.see user guide counseling against reliance on behavior in jail or prison 
the cca furthermore concluded that moore record of academic failure,along with the childhood abuse and suffering he endured,detracted from a determination that his intellectual and adaptive deficits were related.see,at,supra,at.those traumatic experiences,however,count in the medical community as risk factors for intellectual disability,at emphasis added.clinicians rely on such factors as cause to explore the prospect of intellectual disability further,not to counter the case for a disability determination.see,at a t least one or more of the risk factors described in the manual will be found in every case of intellectual disability.
the cca also departed from clinical practice by requiring moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related to a personality disorder.at see,at moore problems in kindergarten were more likely cause d by emotional problems than by intellectual disability.as professionals recognize,however,many intellectually disabled people also have other mental or physical impairments,for example,disorder,depressive and bipolar disorders,and autism,at c mental,neurodevelopmental,medical,and physical conditions are frequent in intellectual disability,with rates of some conditions,mental disorders,cerebral palsy,and epilepsy three to four times higher than in the general population see,at.coexisting conditions frequently encountered in intellectually disabled individuals have been described in clinical literature as c omorbidit ies.at.see also brief for aaidd et as amici curiae,and.the existence of a personality disorder or issue,in short,is not evidence that a person does not also have intellectual disability.brief for american psychological association,apa,et as amici curiae.
the cca attachment to the seven briseno evidentiary factors further impeded its assessment of moore adaptive functioning.
by design and in operation,the briseno factors creat e an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed,hall,at slip,at.after observing that persons with mild intellectual disability might be treated differently under clinical standards than under texas capital system,the cca defined its objective as identifying the consensus of texas citizens on who should be exempted from the death penalty.briseno,at emphasis added.mild levels of intellectual disability,although they may fall outside texas citizens consensus,nevertheless remain intellectual disabilities,see hall,at slip,at atkins,at,and,at,and states may not execute anyone in the entire category of intellectually disabled offenders,roper,at emphasis added see supra,at.
skeptical of what it viewed as exceedingly subjective medical and clinical standards,the cca in briseno advanced lay perceptions of intellectual disability,at see supra,at,and.briseno asks,for example,did those who knew the person best during the developmental stage his family,friends,teachers,employers,authorities think he was mentally retarded at that time,and,if so,act in accordance with that determination at.addressing that question here,the cca referred to moore education in normal classrooms during his school career,his father reactions to his academic challenges,and his sister perceptions of moore intellectual abilities,at.but the medical profession has endeavored to counter lay stereotypes of the intellectually disabled.see user guide brief for aaidd et as amici cu riae,and nn.those stereotypes,much more than medical and clinical appraisals,should spark skepticism 
the briseno factors are an outlier,in comparison both to other states handling of pleas and to texas own practices in other contexts.see hall,at slip,at consensus in the states provides objective indicia of society standards in the context of the eighth amendment internal quotation marks omitted.no state legislature has approved the use of the briseno factors or anything similar.in the years since texas adopted the factors,only one other state high court and one state intermediate appellate court have authorized their use.see,commonwealth bracey,howell state,wl.crim,june.
indeed,texas itself does not follow briseno in contexts other than the death penalty.see brief for constitution project as amicus curiae.for example,the requirement texas defends here,see supra,at,is conspicuously absent from the standards the state uses to assess students for intellectual disabilities.see.admin.code c.and even within texas system,the state requires the diagnoses of juveniles to be based on the latest edition of the dsm.admin.code e.texas can not satisfactorily explain why it applies current medical standards for diagnosing intellectual disability in other contexts,yet clings to superseded standards when an individual life is at stake 
as noted supra,at,states have some flexibility,but not unfettered discretion,in enforcing atkins holding.hall,at slip,at.if the states were to have complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as they wished,we have observed,atkins could become a nullity,and the eighth amendment protection of human dignity would not become a reality.at slip,at.
the medical community current standards supply one constraint on states leeway in this area.reflecting improved understanding over time,see,at,at,current manuals offer the best available description of how mental disorders are expressed and can be recognized by trained clinicians,at xli.see also hall,at,slip,at,employing current clinical standards atkins,at,relying on standards.
in moore case,the habeas court applied current medical standards in concluding that moore is intellectually disabled and therefore ineligible for the death penalty.see,app.to pet.for cert.the cca,however,faulted the habeas court for disregarding the cca case law and employing the definition of intellectual disability presently used by the aaidd.at.the cca instead fastened its determination to the aamr definition of intellectual disability that it adopted in briseno for atkins claims presented in texas cases.ibid.by rejecting the habeas court application of medical guidance and clinging to the standard it laid out in briseno,including the wholly nonclinical briseno factors,the cca failed adequately to inform itself of the medical community diagnostic framework,hall,at slip,at.because briseno pervasively infected the cca analysis,the decision of that court can not stand.
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the texas court of criminal appeals is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
roberts,dissenting 
bobby james moore,petitioner texas 
on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas 
chief justice roberts,with whom justice thomas and justice alito join,dissenting.
the texas court of criminal appeals cca concluded that bobby james moore was not intellectually disabled so as to be exempt from the death penalty under atkins virginia.it reached that conclusion based on its findings that he had failed to establish either significantly subaverage intellectual functioning or related significant deficits in adaptive behavior.the latter conclusion was based,in part,on the cca analysis of a set of seven evidentiary factors from ex parte briseno.crim.app.i agree with the court today that those factors are an unacceptable method of enforcing the guarantee of atkins,and that the cca therefore erred in using them to analyze adaptive deficits.but i do not agree that the cca erred as to moore intellectual functioning.because the cca determination on that ground is an independent basis for its judgment,i would affirm the decision below.
my broader concern with today opinion,however,is that it abandons the usual mode of analysis this court has employed in eighth amendment cases.the court overturns the cca conclusion that moore failed to present sufficient evidence of both inadequate intellectual functioning and significant deficits in adaptive behavior without even considering objective indicia of society standards reflected in the practices among the states.hall florida,slip,at quoting roper simmons.the court instead crafts a constitutional holding based solely on what it deems to be medical consensus about intellectual disability.but clinicians,not judges,should determine clinical standards and judges,not clinicians,should determine the content of the eighth amendment.today opinion confuses those roles,and i respectfully dissent.
on april,moore and two others were throwing dice when they decided to commit a robbery to obtain money for car payments.moore provided the group with two firearms,and the three men began to drive around houston looking for a target.eventually they settled on the birdsall super market.after negotiating their respective shares of the money they intended to steal and donning disguises,the three went inside,heading straight to a courtesy booth staffed by james mccarble and edna scott.when scott realized a robbery was occurring and screamed,moore shot mccarble in the head,killing the instantly.
moore fled houston and remained on the run until his arrest in louisiana ten days after the murder.after giving a written statement admitting his participation in the robbery and killing,moore was charged with capital murder.a jury convicted him and sentenced him to death.
over the next three decades,moore case traversed the state and federal court systems,finally reaching the atkins hearing at issue today in.the state habeas court conducted a evidentiary hearing,during which it heard testimony from family members,a fellow inmate,a prison official,and four mental health professionals.the court concluded that moore had shown intellectual disability and recommended that he be granted relief.
but it was just that a recommendation.under texas law,the cca,not the habeas court,is the ultimate factfinder in habeas corpus proceedings.ex parte reed.crim.app.see also ex parte moore.crim.app.assuming that role,the cca declined to adopt the habeas court findings and conclusions,instead conducting its own review of the record to determine whether moore had shown he was intellectually disabled.
the cca began by considering the appropriate legal standard for assessing intellectual disability.following our instruction to the states to develop appropriate ways to enforce atkins,at internal quotation marks omitted,the cca had set out a legal definition for intellectual disability in its prior decision in ex parte briseno.rather than follow that test,the habeas court below crafted its own standards for intellectual disability.but t he decision to modify the legal standard for intellectual disability in the context,the cca explained,rests with this court unless and until the legislature acts.at.just as we have corrected lower courts for taking it upon themselves to dismiss our precedent as outdated,see,bosse okla homa,per curiam slip,at,so too the cca rebuked the habeas court for ignoring binding cca precedent.
the cca went on to explain why there was no reason to modify the legal standard it had previously set out.briseno had stated a rule that in order for an atkins claimant to demonstrate intellectual disability he must show significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning and related limitations in adaptive functioning,which had appeared prior to age.see,at.it also laid out a set of seven evidentiary factors the briseno factors designed to assist factfinders in weighing evidence of intellectual disability.briseno,at.
the definition of intellectual disability came directly from the ninth edition of the manual published by what is now the american association on intellectual and developmental disabilities aaidd,at see american association on mental retardation,mental retardation definition,classification,and systems of supports ed.by the time moore case reached the cca,the aaidd no longer included the requirement that adaptive deficits be related to intellectual functioning.but,as the cca noted,the most recent version of the other leading diagnostic manual,the,did include that requirement,at,american psychiatric association,diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed.hereinafter.so the cca was faced with a choice in moore keeping the relatedness requirement would be inconsistent with the aaidd current guidance dropping it would be out of step with the newest version of the dsm.the cca concluded that the legal test we established in briseno remains adequately informed by the medical community diagnostic framework,and went on to evaluate the case under that approach,at quoting hall,at slip,at.
starting with intellectual functioning,the cca conducted a painstaking analysis of the battery of tests moore had taken over the past years.the cca concluded that five of the tests the habeas court had considered were unreliable two of them were neuropsychological tests rather than formal iq measures two were tests,which moore own experts had criticized,app.mental abilities test not accepted as an instrument appropriate for the assessment of mental retardation or intellectual deficiency at slosson is not the greatest test and not the most reliable approach and the administrator of the fifth test concluded it was not a valid score because of evidence of suboptimal effort,at.
that left two scores for the cca to analyze a and a.significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is generally shown by an iq of or less.at.taking into account the standard error of measurement for the score yielded a range of to,a range that did not include an iq of or less,at.as for the,the cca again considered the standard error of measurement,which yielded a score range of to.the lower end of that range placed moore within the parameters for significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.the cca found,however,that moore score was unlikely to be in the lower end of the range because he was likely exerting poor effort and experiencing depression at the time the test was administered both factors that moore experts agreed could artificially deflate iq scores,at,app.the cca accordingly concluded that moore had failed to present sufficient evidence of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.
having failed one part of the cca test,moore could not be found intellectually disabled.the cca nonetheless went on to consider the second prong of the test,moore adaptive deficits.moore had taken a standardized test of adaptive functioning in which he scored more than two standard deviations below the mean.but kristi compton,the state expert who had administered that test,explained that it was not an accurate measure of moore abilities.she reached this conclusion not because of moore adaptive strengths but instead because she had to assign zeroes to questions asking about areas to which moore had no exposure,such as writing a check and using a microwave oven.at.compton further opined that her evaluation of moore and review of documentary evidence including school,trial,and prison records did not show adaptive deficits sufficient for an intellectual disability diagnosis.app.see,at.
the cca also considered and recounted the testimony of the other experts who,unlike compton,concluded that moore had shown significant adaptive deficits.as factfinders often do in confronting conflicting evidence,the cca made a credibility determination.the opinion of compton,the cca concluded,was far more credible and reliable than those of moore experts,given compton considerable experience,thorough and rigorous review of a great deal of material,and personal evaluation of moore,at.based on compton expert opinion,the cca concluded moore had failed to demonstrate significant adaptive deficits.
finally,the cca considered whether,even assuming that moore had made sufficient showings as to intellectual functioning and adaptive deficits,those two were related.again finding compton testimony the most credible,the cca concluded that the record overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that moore observed academic and social difficulties stemmed,not from low intellectual abilities,but instead from outside factors like the trauma and abuse he suffered as a child and his drug use at a young age,at.the cca explained that,in addition to compton expert testimony,consideration of the seven briseno factors reinforced that relatedness conclusion.
given that moore had failed to present sufficient evidence on intellectual functioning or related adaptive deficits,the cca conclude d that for eighth amendment purposes,moore had not shown he was intellectually disabled,at.accordingly,he was not exempt from execution under atkins.
this court precedents have emphasized the importance of state legislative judgments in giving content to the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.eighth amendment judgments should not be merely the subjective views of individual justices.coker georgia,plurality opinion.for that reason,we have emphasized that judgment should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent.ibid.the clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values comes from state legislative judgments.atkins,at internal quotation marks omitted.such legislative judgments are critical because in a democratic society legislatures,not courts,are constituted to respond to the will and consequently the moral values of the people.gregg georgia,joint opinion of stewart,powell,and stevens,jj.internal quotation marks omitted.and we have focused on state enactments in this realm because of the deference we owe to the decisions of the state legislatures under our federal system where the specification of punishments is concerned.at.for these reasons,we have described state legislative judgments as providing essential instruction in conducting the eighth amendment inquiry.roper,at.
our decisions addressing capital punishment for the intellectually disabled recognize the central significance of state consensus.in holding that the eighth amendment prohibits the execution of intellectually disabled individuals in atkins,the court first identified a national consensus against the practice and then,applying our own independent evaluation of the issue,concluded that there was no reason to disagree with that consensus,at.the scope of our holding guided as it was by the national consensus swept only as far as that consensus.we recognized that there remained the potential for serious disagreement in determining which offenders are in fact retarded.at.and we did not seek to provide definitive procedural or substantive guides for determining when a person who claims mental retardation will be so impaired as to fall within atkins compass.bobby bies,alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.instead,we left to the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.atkins,at quoting ford wainwright,alterations omitted.
twelve years after atkins,the court confronted one state attempt to enforce the holding of that case.hall florida considered florida rule requiring a prisoner to present an iq score of or below to make out an atkins claim.although the court thought it proper to consider the psychiatric and professional studies that elaborate on the purpose and meaning of iq scores,it emphasized that t he legal determination of intellectual disability is distinct from a medical diagnosis.at,slip,at.it was the court duty not that of medical experts to interpret the constitution.at slip,at.the court conclusion that florida rule was in direct opposition to the views of those who design,administer,and interpret the iq test was not enough to decide the case,at slip,at.instead,consistent with our settled approach,the court canvassed the legislative policies of various states,as well as the holdings of state courts,because it was state policies that provided essential instruction for determining the scope of the constitutional guarantee,at,slip,at,quoting roper,at.state policy,the court concluded,indicated a consensus that our society does not regard florida rule as proper or humane,and that consensus instruct ed us how to decide the specific issue presented.at,slip,at.the court was sharply divided on that conclusion,see,at slip,at alito,dissenting,but not on the fact that our precedent mandated such an inquiry.
today decision departs from this court precedents,followed in atkins and hall,establishing that the determination of what is cruel and unusual rests on a judicial judgment about societal standards of decency,not a medical assessment of clinical practice.the court rejects the cca conclusion that moore failed to make the requisite showings with respect to intellectual functioning and adaptive deficits,without any consideration of the state practices that were,three terms ago,essential to the eighth amendment question.hall,at slip,at.the court instead finds error in the cca analysis based solely on what the court views to be departure from typical clinical practice.
the clinical guides on which the court relies today are designed to assist clinicians in conducting clinical assessment,case formulation,and treatment planning.at.they do not seek to dictate or describe who is morally culpable indeed,the cautions its readers about the imperfect fit between the questions of ultimate concern to the law and the information contained within its pages.ibid.
the eighth amendment,under our precedent,is supposed to impose a moral backstop on punishment,prohibiting sentences that our society deems repugnant.the court,however,interprets that constitutional guarantee as turning on clinical guidelines that do not purport to reflect standards of decency.the court refusal even to address what we previously pinpointed as the clearest and most reliable objective evidence of such standards the practices among the states goes unexplained by the majority.atkins,at internal quotation marks omitted.
a second problem with the court approach is the lack of guidance it offers to states seeking to enforce the holding of atkins.recognizing that we have,in the very recent past,held that the views of medical experts do not dictate a court determination,the court assures us that it is not requiring adherence to everything stated in the latest medical guide,ante,at quoting hall,at slip,at states have some flexibility but can not disregard medical standards.ante,at.neither the court articulation of this standard nor its application sheds any light on what it means.
start with the court stated principle.disregard normally means to dismiss as unworthy of attention,and that is plainly not what the cca did here.for example,the court faults the cca for placing too much weight on moore adaptive strengths and functioning in prison,implying that this marked a dismissal of clinical standards.yet the cca was aware of and,in a prior decision,had addressed the fact that some clinicians would counsel against considering such information.see,at citing ex parte cathey.both because m ost courts consider all of the person functional abilities and because it seemed foolhardy to ignore strengths,the cca thought it proper to take note of them,at.as to prison conduct,the cca decided that the fundamental questions the atkins inquiry sought to answer were best considered and sound scientific principles best served by taking account of all possible data that sheds light on a person adaptive functioning,including his conduct in a prison society.at.the cca considered clinical standards and explained why it decided that departure from those standards was warranted.the court did not disregard medical standards.
nor do the court identified errors clarify the scope of the flexibility we are told states retain in this area.the court faults the cca for overemphasiz ing strengths and stress ing moore conduct in prison,ante,at,suggesting that some but not too much consideration of strengths and prison functioning is acceptable.the court only guidance on when some becomes too much citations to clinical guides.see ibid.but if courts do have flexibility in enforcing the guarantee of atkins and need not adhere to these guides in every instance or particular,ante,at,then clinical texts,standing alone,can not answer the question of why the cca placed too much weight on adaptive strengths and prison conduct.the line between the permissible consideration,maybe even emphasis and the forbidden overemphasis is not only thin,but totally undefined by today decision.it is not at all clear when a state deviation from medical co
