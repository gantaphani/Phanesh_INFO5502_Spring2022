these interlocutory appeals are from a district court order that,among other things,compels the law firm of mintz,levin,cohn,ferris,glovsky popeo,mintz levin to produce certain documents pertaining to a fraud allegedly committed by david gorski in his operation of legion construction,legion.gorski and legion appeal the district court order that privileged documents be produced under the exception.the prosecution the district court decision to exclude communications between gorski and his personal attorney,elizabeth schwartz,from the production order.we conclude that we have jurisdiction over legion appeal and the prosecution,but not over gorski appeal.we dismiss gorski appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.we affirm the production order as to mintz levin.we vacate the district court decision to exclude gorski communications with schwartz from the production order and remand that portion of its order.
the prosecution alleges that from about late to about november,gorski fraudulently represented to federal government agencies that legion was a service disabled veteran owned small business entity sdvosb in order to qualify for and obtain government contracts.
by statute,at least three percent of all government contracts must go to sdvosbs.g a ii.to qualify as an sdvosb,an entity must be at least percent owned by one or more veterans.the entity must also be controlled by one or more veterans,meaning that both and management are conducted by veterans.a a,c.before february,the veteran owners were not required to work full time but had to show sustained and significant time invested in the business.c.effective february,the regulations were amended to require that a veteran owner work in the business.c.the february,amendment also eliminated the procedure that had been in effect for sdvosbs,replacing it with a formal verification process.the essence of the criminal case against gorski is that gorski,a,made false statements about the ownership,operation,and control of legion to appear to be in compliance with the sdvosb eligibility requirements while retaining effective ownership and control of the company for himself.
the prosecution alleges the following facts.around late,gorski approached veteran a,a veteran,to start a construction business targeting sdvosb contracts.gorski told veteran a that he wanted veteran a involvement for his veteran status.gorski filed a certificate of incorporation for legion in january,with veteran a listed as president and himself as vice president.
from january to august,veteran a was nominally the percent owner of legion.in august,gorski caused legion to undergo a corporate restructuring in which gorski became a nominal percent owner,veteran a became a nominal eleven percent owner,and veteran b also a veteran became nominal owner of the remaining forty percent.however,veteran a received no compensation for the stock that he relinquished.meanwhile,gorski retained effective control of legion by having the veterans execute demand notes payable to gorski and secured by their shares of legion stock,as well as by having them sign employment agreements that allowed gorski to terminate their employment with legion for cause.gorski also placed his wife on legion payroll even though she had employment elsewhere,as a disguised method to pay himself more money than he was paying the veterans.throughout this time,legion was awarded government contracts based on representations that it qualified as an sdvosb.
in late,legion retained mintz levin in anticipation of the february,amendment in regulatory criteria for sdvosbs.mintz levin effected a corporate restructuring under which veteran b purchased veteran a remaining stock,resulting in veteran b nominally owning percent of legion shares and gorski nominally owning percent.although the purchase did not occur until march,the documents were dated as of february,before the date of the regulatory amendments.
at some point,gorski also engaged elizabeth schwartz,an attorney unaffiliated with mintz levin,for legal advice related to the restructuring.
on march,one of legion competitors filed a bid protest with the small business administration sba challenging legion sdvosb status.the protest related to a bid submitted by legion on january.on april,legion,with the assistance of mintz levin,filed a response to the sba.the response included new corporate documents prepared by mintz levin purporting to show that legion restructured on february.the record supports the district court finding that the new corporate documents were crafted so as to make it appear that they were signed before the date of the sba regulatory amendments,when they were not,and that an affidavit that flatly swore under penalty of perjury that veteran b purchased the stock on february,was false.further,it is plain that gorski likely knew that his lawyers handiwork could lead sba to believe that which was false.
between july,and november,gorski had discussions with legion accountant about circumventing the sdvosb regulations that require the veteran owner to be the company highest paid officer.gorski and legion accountant discussed a plan under which gorski would receive additional,hidden compensation in a special bank account.
on october,gorski was indicted for one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states and four counts of wire fraud,in violation of and.
on july,the prosecution issued subpoenas to legion and mintz levin under federal rule of criminal procedure c.the subpoenas required the production of documents from november to december concerning legion ownership and sdvosb eligibility negotiations and transfers of legion stock involving gorski,veteran a,and veteran b and the march bid protest filed against legion.mintz levin and legion withheld production of certain documents on the basis of privilege.
on august,the district court granted the prosecution motion that the court conduct an in camera examination to determine whether the exception to the privilege applied.mintz levin and legion submitted thousands of pages of documents for the district court review.on september,the district court held an ex parte hearing with defense counsel and,upon concluding that the exception to the privilege applied,ordered that all of the contested documents be produced.
on september,gorski filed an ex parte motion for reconsideration of the september order as overbroad with respect to seven categories of documents.also on september,legion,which is not a party to the criminal case,filed a motion to intervene and to stay the september order,along with a motion to conduct a de novo hearing on the exception.the district court granted legion motion and,on september,held an ex parte hearing with counsel for legion and gorski.
on september,the district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the motion for reconsideration.as an initial matter,the district court found that all of the documents at issue were relevant and facially privileged.the only issue was whether the exception applied.the district court began its analysis by stating that it considered the grand jury indictment of gorski to be conclusive evidence of probable cause to believe that gorski committed a crime or fraud.the district court then reasoned that there is a reasonable basis to believe that gorski intended to,and did,use the services of the lawyers in furtherance of that crime or fraud.the district court found that it was reasonable to believe that gorski intended to use mintz levin services to perpetuate an ongoing scheme in which he maintain ed effective ownership and control of legion,while maintaining its apparent status as a n sdvosb.
however,the district court granted the motion to reconsider as to category three of the documents,which consisted of communications between gorski and his personal attorney,schwartz,in relation to the restructuring.the district court found that although t he basic intent of those communications is arguably the same as his communications with mintz levin,schwartz apparently had no role in the submission to the sba.the district court concluded that under the circumstances,it would not make the necessary finding as to the applicability of the exception.the district court also determined,without explaining its reasoning on the record,that the exception did not apply to documents in categories one,two,five,and six of the motion for reconsideration.the district court ordered legion and mintz levin to produce all of the contested documents not encompassed by those categories.
legion and gorski filed separate notices of appeal.legion limited its appeal to the portion of the district court order requiring production of documents by mintz levin.the district court has stayed its production order as to mintz levin pending appeal.the district court has stayed and held in abeyance its independent production order as to legion,pending resolution of this appeal as to the mintz levin order.
ordinarily,litigants may not seek immediate appeal of discovery orders because they are not final decisions and orders of the district court.gill gulfstream park racing ass n,inc,cir see also fdic ogden,cir.a target of a discovery order can gain an immediate right of appeal by refusing to comply with a discovery order,being held in contempt by the district court,and then appealing the contempt order.gill,at.however,none of the parties to this appeal have been held in contempt.examining the alternative bases upon which the parties claim appellate jurisdiction to challenge the discovery order,we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction over gorski appeal but that we do have jurisdiction over legion appeal and the prosecution.
gorski relies solely on the collateral order doctrine as the basis for appellate jurisdiction the collateral order doctrine allows immediate appeal of a small class of decisions that do not end the litigation but are nonetheless considered final and thus immediately reviewable.cohen beneficial indus.loan.that small category includes only decisions that are conclusive,that resolve important questions separate from the merits,and that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.swint chambers cty.comm n,d see also united states quintana aguayo,cir per curiam.gorski argues that the collateral order doctrine gives us jurisdiction over his appeal because the district court discovery order will be effectively unreviewable in an appeal.
gorski argument is squarely at odds with the supreme court decision in mohawk industries,carpenter,d.in mohawk,the court held that collateral order appeals are not necessary to ensure effective review of orders adverse to the privilege,id.at,because postjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the rights of litigants and ensure the vitality of the privilege,id.at.the court reasoned that when disclosure orders are held to be erroneous on postjudgment appeal,a ppellate courts can remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings by vacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.id.moreover,the court noted,immediate review of serious errors is available through a writ of mandamus or by a contemptuous refusal to comply with the discovery order and an appeal of the subsequent contempt order.id.at.
gorski attempts to distinguish mohawk by pointing out that if we do not hear his appeal,our decision on legion appeal will become the law of the case and prevent gorski from relitigating the issue on appeal from final judgment.this,gorski claims,makes the discovery order effectively unreviewable on final judgment in a way that distinguishes mohawk.but even if gorski is correct about the applicability of the law of the case issue we do not court made it clear in mohawk that the availability of collateral order review is determined by examining the class of claims,taken as a whole.id.at.as such,mohawk held that parties are categorically barred from appealing disclosure orders under the collateral order doctrine,notwithstanding the fact t hat a fraction of orders adverse to the privilege may nevertheless harm individual litigants in ways that are only imperfectly reparable.id.at quoting dig.equip.desktop direct,d.we do not have jurisdiction over gorski appeal.
legion,a to the indictment,claims appellate jurisdiction under an exception to the final order doctrine deriving from perlman united states.under perlman,a discovery order addressed to a sometimes may be treated as an immediately appealable final order a party who claims to hold an applicable privilege.ogden,at.the rationale for perlman is that when the target of a discovery order is a,a party claiming the privilege can not gain the right of appeal by itself refusing to produce discovery and being held in contempt.see id.nor will the target of the discovery order allow itself to be held in contempt to obtain appellate review on behalf of the because the presumably lacks a sufficient stake in the proceeding to risk contempt by refusing compliance.id.quoting church of scientology united states,d.as such,c ourts frequently have invoked perlman when a client seeks to appeal an order compelling her attorney to produce allegedly privileged materials.id.
legion appeal presents a classic perlman situation.the district court has ordered mintz levin,a,to produce documents.legion asserts privilege over those documents,but it can not bring an immediate challenge to that order by allowing itself to be held in contempt because it is not the target of the subpoena at issue nor does it seem that mintz levin has any intention of refusing to comply and therefore risking contempt.see id.because legion is a,it can not ensure that there would be any traditional final judgment from which to appeal,either.legion is thus powerless to avert the mischief of the order,perlman,at,unless we apply the perlman exception and take appellate jurisdiction.
we have jurisdiction over the prosecution under,which provides that a n appeal by the united states shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order of a district court suppressing or excluding evidence.
in privilege cases,we review questions of law de novo,factual findings for clear error,and discretionary judgments for abuse of discretion.cavallaro united states,cir.
the privilege is a privilege of a client to refuse to testify or to have his counsel testify as to confidential communications between the two made in connection with the rendering of legal representation.in re grand jury proceedings,cir.the exception withdraws protection where the client sought or employed legal representation in order to commit or facilitate a crime or fraud.id.at.the party invoking the exception must make a prima facie showing that the client was engaged in or was planning criminal or fraudulent activity when the communications took place and that the communications were intended by the client to facilitate or conceal the criminal or fraudulent activity.in re grand jury proceedings gregory violette,cir see also united states albertelli,cir.by prima facie showing,we mean a reasonable basis to believe that the lawyer services were used by the client to foster a crime or fraud.in re grand jury proceedings,at.this standard may be met by something less than a mathematical more likely than not probability that the client intended to use the attorney in furtherance of a crime or fraud.id.at.however,it requires more than speculation or evidence that shows only a distant likelihood of corruption.id.
here,we are satisfied that the reasonable basis standard is met as to both parts of the exception test as to the first part,the district court correctly noted that the indictment provides a reasonable basis to believe that gorski legion was engaged in criminal or fraudulent activity.
as to the second part,we too have reviewed the numerous and varied documents and agree with the district court characterizations.there are many communications between gorski and his attorneys on the perceived need to revise legion corporate structure.the facts concerning the chronology of the events and the relevance of the dates to the regulatory structure are documented.there is considera
