working on a tip from a confidential informant,police searched richard graf home,turning up marijuana and an illegal gun.graf was subsequently indicted on drug and firearm charges.
he moved in a motion to suppress the seized evidence,arguing to a maine federal magistrate judge that to a state court justice of the peace into signing off on the search warrant application,a police detective sugarcoated the facts in his sworn statement accompanying it.as part of his motion to suppress,graf also requested an evidentiary hearing to challenge the credibility.
neither the magistrate judge nor the district court was convinced and denied the motion.graf now appeals the denial,arguing that he was entitled to a full hearing to challenge the detective veracity,and the magistrate judge improperly allowed the government to investigate itself before deciding his motion to suppress.
despite a valiant effort,we affirm the lower court.
background 
the controversial warrant affidavit 
in april,carl gottardi,a detective lieutenant for the somerset county sheriff department in maine,applied for a warrant to search graf home.the warrant application was supported by gottardi sworn statement,to which we refer from now on as the graf affidavit.
in the graf affidavit,gottardi attested he had probable cause to believe graf was hiding marijuana and other drug accoutrements in his home,based on information gottardi received from a confidential informant called.ha d been a very reliable informant for the past several years,and had helped obtain numerous drug search warrants,with numerous persons being charged and convicted of various drug offenses,gottardi swore.had also provided other law enforcement officials with reliable drug related information in the past.
specific to this case,gottardi also wrote in the affidavit that relayed his personal knowledge that for several years graf has continually sold large amounts of marijuana,describing the location of the camp type residence where graf sold his high grade,commercial type stuff relying on gottardi affidavit,a state justice of the peace signed off on the warrant and during the search of graf home,police found marijuana plants and an unregistered shotgun.not surprisingly,graf was indicted on federal firearms possession and drug charges.
graf franks motions 
in franks delaware,d,the supreme court held that a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to challenge the veracity of a sworn statement used by police to procure a search warrant,if the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally,or with reckless disregard for the truth,was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit,and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.in august,graf asked the federal trial court for one of these franks hearings,arguing that he should be able to test the veracity of the statements gottardi made in his warrant affidavit.graf maintained via a affidavit that at best,gottardi embellished reliability,but more likely,either gottardi or the informant was simply lying.in addition to a hearing,graf also asked that the evidence seized from his home be suppressed.other than his affidavit,graf supported his motion with nothing further.
a magistrate judge denied the motion because,as she put it,graf did not allege,or attempt to make a substantial preliminary showing,that gottardi knowingly and intentionally made false statements in the search warrant affidavit or included statements in reckless disregard of the truth.rather,the magistrate judge decided,graf relie d entirely on the theory that the confidential informant gave gottardi inaccurate information,which was not enough for a franks hearing.
graf team was undeterred,and his new lawyer decided to get to the bottom of things himself by digging up all the warrant applications filed by the somerset county sheriff department from april through april and searching for all references to.turns out,there were none,that is,no warrant applications filed prior to april which was when gottardi got the warrant to search graf home naming as an informant.did appear,however,in two of the warrant applications filed after graf,but in each of the three affidavits where was mentioned,the informant background and history as a tipster were described a little differently.
armed with this new information,graf marched back into court and filed a second motion to suppress and request for a franks hearing.this second,graf argued that he now had proof gottardi displayed a reckless disregard for the truth by exaggerating ci reliability and use in the past.
the government fired off an explanation,though,and in support of its opposition to the motion,submitted a supplemental affidavit from gottardi describing his practice to periodically change the identifying numbers assigned to confidential informants.gottardi also claimed that the person designated ci in the graf search warrant has been assigned four identifying numbers during the course of his work with gottardi.in addition,o ccasionally,identifying numbers will be for different persons,gottardi swore 
graf shot back,arguing that even if gottardi was telling the truth about these practices of his,b y assigning the same ci numbers to three different individuals on three different drug cases over a five month period,gottardi is misleading those officials who are tasked with reviewing affidavits in support of search warrants.gottardi unconventional practice,graf urged,is meant to enhance the credibility of the informant whose number repeatedly appeared before the same reviewing official,even though,according to gottardi,they are different people.
magistrate preliminary order 
in response,the magistrate judge issued a preliminary order noting that she was not persuaded that defendant ha d made a substantial preliminary showing that gottardi supplied false representations concerning the background of as described in his april warrant application.the judge explained t he mere fact that there is no earlier warrant application involving an informant identified as readily can be explained by a practice of changing an informant numerical identifier over time.
still,graf had raised a serious concern by expos ing an irregular practice of identifying confidential informants that raises some cause for concern about gottardi underlying affidavit.the court noted that assigning the same numerical identifier to three different confidential informants within a relatively brief timespan was a surprising revelation about what seems a highly irregular,and potentially misleading procedure.thus,the magistrate judge observed,gottardi second affidavit raises as many questions as it resolves.
given her lingering concerns,the judge ordered the government to investigate this matter to assure itself that not only existed,but also was whom gottardi claimed.specifically,the government was to file an in camera report addressing whether the described in the april warrant application is an ascertainable individual with the history and pedigree gottardi has attributed to him there were prior matters in which this same under whatever other identifier supplied information supporting drug search warrants and there were in fact three separate informants identified as between april and october of.the judge also ordered that the investigating individual be someone other than the prosecuting attorney assigned to this specific case and not be employed by the somerset county sheriff department or the bureau of alcohol,tobacco or firearms atf.the investigation would enable the court to determine whether a showing might be plausible if a franks hearing were convened.
amendments to the preliminary order 
shortly after the magistrate judge entered the preliminary order,the government filed a motion requesting that an atf agent be permitted to conduct the investigation.the judge held a telephone conference to hear the parties.she expressed her confusion about the government motion she had assumed the investigation would be akin to a paralegal from the attorney office simply reviewing paperwork as opposed to a lot of field work and interviews and so on.the government responded that it assumed the court wanted an agent actually going out and attempting to interview and interviewing gottardi and to gather those facts that the court asked that we investigate.despite the court clarification of its expectations,the government pressed that it was reluctant to have someone from its office investigate because that person could later be called as a witness to answer some additional questions that might not be apparent from the report.
graf objected,arguing that the court should assign a neutral third party to conduct the investigation,as opposed to someone from an agency that helped procure his prosecution.but over graf objection,the court allowed the government request in part and ordered that an atf agent could conduct the investigation subject to the limitation that the atf agent in charge of this case not be the one who conducts it.
the atf report 
on january,the government submitted its report to the court in camera.in the report,atf special agent christopher durkin stated that in addition to interviewing gottardi,other police officers,and the informant designated as in the graf affidavit,he also reviewed warrant applications from other cases to confirm gottardi statements in the affidavit.
satisfied after reviewing the report,the magistrate judge concluded that graf did not make a substantial preliminary showing that gottardi or any other law enforcement officer,made untruthful or deliberately misleading statements in the affidavit,and recommended that the trial judge deny graf request for a franks hearing.the district court judge adopted the magistrate judge recommendation,over graf objection,also denying graf motion to suppress.
graf ended up pleading guilty to possessing an unregistered shotgun and manufacturing marijuana,reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.the district court sentenced him to two years in prison,among other conditions.
this timely appeal followed.

discussion 
graf main argument on appeal is that the trial court erred by denying him the opportunity to challenge gottardi affidavit at a formal franks evidentiary hearing,where he would have had been able to gottardi.more specifically,graf relies on precedent to argue that the court should not give the government an opportunity to present its evidence on the validity of the warrant without holding a full evidentiary franks hearing.graf also offers the secondary argument that even if the lower court did not procedurally err in hearing out the government before making its franks ruling,the particular procedure chosen by the magistrate allow atf,a government entity,to investigate the truthfulness of graf affidavit statements was sufficient error such that we should vacate the denial of his motion to suppress and remand it.
we discuss each of these arguments in turn.
substantial preliminary showing under franks 
addressing graf primary argument requires us to unpack it.in so doing,we are left with two distinct issues.the first is a generally applicable legal proposition as a procedural matter,whose evidence is a trial judge allowed to consider in making the threshold determination that a defendant has not made a substantial preliminary franks showing in other words,is graf correct in arguing that a court is limited to reviewing only the materials a defendant submits,or is the court also permitted to consider additional evidence submitted by the government the second question is a one if graf carries the day on the first point and the magistrate judge was supposed to consider only his offer of proof,was the evidence graf submitted enough to make a substantial preliminary showing that gottardi lied in the affidavit in question 
unlike the mcmurtrey court,neither we nor the supreme court has explicitly addressed whether it constitutes legal error for a trial court to consider government evidence before deciding whether a franks hearing is warranted.we need not do so today.for purposes of our analysis,we can assume,without deciding,that graf take on the first question is the correct one because,as we discuss below,he still fails on the second question.
in sum,we find that the evidence graf submitted to the magistrate judge did not show that gottardi lied in the affidavit in question,and therefore,graf has not convinced us that the lower court clearly erred in denying him a franks hearing.
legal backdrop 
to frame our analysis,we first look at what it means to make a substantial preliminary showing in the franks context.
a search warrant affidavit must set forth particular facts and circumstances underlying the existence of probable cause to search.franks,at.sometimes,law enforcement agents seeking search warrants rely on tips from confidential informants to form the basis of probable cause.in those cases,the affidavit must recite some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that relevant evidence might be discovered,and some of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant was credible or his information reliable.id.citations and quotations omitted united states gifford,cir where the primary basis for a probable cause determination is information provided by a confidential informant,the affidavit must provide some information from which a magistrate can credit the informant credibility.
assuming such conditions are met,it has long been the case that a n affidavit submitted in support of a search warrant application is presumed valid.united states grant,cir citations omitted see franks,at.in franks,however,the supreme court was tasked with deciding whether this presumption of validity is absolute,or whether in certain circumstances,a challenge by a defendant to a warrant veracity must be permitted.franks,at.
