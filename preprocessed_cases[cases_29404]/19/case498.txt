defendant andy laracuent pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.his appeal seeks to vacate this plea on grounds of factual insufficiency.following careful consideration,we reject laracuent claim of error.
background 
on january,law enforcement officials observed a nissan armada,along with two other vehicles,driving into a bay area in santa isabel,puerto rico at the same time,a vessel was seen traveling into the bay.several individuals were observed offloading bales from the vessel into the vehicles,including laracuent.the vehicles then exited the bay area,where they were stopped by dea agents who conducted a traffic stop and arrested the individuals inside of the vehicles,including laracuent,who was inside the nissan armada.the substance in the bales was subsequently analyzed and confirmed to be cocaine.additionally,during the traffic stop,law enforcement found three firearms inside the nissan armada.
in connection with these events,a grand jury returned a indictment against laracuent and thirteen.laracuent was charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of a,b a ii,count possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine in violation of a,b a ii and count and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of c a count.

standard of review 
typically,we review the district court acceptance of a guilty plea for abuse of discretion.united states negrón narváez,cir.however,where,as here,a defendant is silent as to alleged errors in the district court proceedings,and seeks to withdraw his plea for the first time on appeal,we review his claim for plain error.united states ramos mejía,cir.plain error review puts a heavy burden on the defendant he must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.negrón narváez,at.
discussion 
laracuent posits that the proffer at the plea colloquy did not provide a sufficient factual basis for finding the requisite intent for aiding and abetting possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure guides our inquiry.it requires that,b efore entering judgment on a guilty plea,the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.b.in other words,the court must decide that the defendant conduct actually corresponds to the charges lodged against him.united states jiminez,cir.to satisfy the factual basis requirement,the necessary showing is fairly modest,that is,the government does not have to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,but instead must show a rational basis in fact for the defendant guilt.ramos mejía,at.it need not support every element of the charge with direct evidence.id.citing united states marrero rivera,cir.
laracuent quibble with the factual basis for his plea is circumscribed.his primary contention is that there was an insufficient showing that he had advance knowledge that one of his confederates would carry a gun.for support,laracuent cites the recently decided united states rosemond,d,which,in the context of a trial appeal,held that a n active participant in a drug transaction has the intent needed to aid and abet a c violation when he knows that one of his confederates will carry a gun.in a more cursory fashion,laracuent also suggests that there was a lack of proof as to who the principal was in this offense 
laracuent misses the mark.a s long as the government proffered facts,conceded by the defendant to be true,touch all the bases,there is a sufficient factual basis for the tendered plea.jiminez,at.here,during the plea colloquy,the following exchange took place.
the court now,i addressing,at this moment,laracuent as to count three.sir,your plea agreement also indicates that you pleading guilty to count three of the indictment.count three of the indictment alleges that on january,in the district of puerto rico,you,andy laracuent,and two others named as defendants,aiding and abetting each other,did knowingly and unlawfully possess a glock pistol,model,millimeter caliber,a smith wesson pistol,caliber,and one fnp pistol,caliber,in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime.that i just summarized to you in count one of the indictment all in violation of title,united states code,section c a and.laracuent,is this the other count to which you pleading guilty to 
laracuent yes,yes.
the court and,do you admit that you committed this offense knowingly,in other words,not by accident or by mistake,but rather were fully aware of what you were doing 
laracuent yes.
the government described the evidence it would have offered at trial.in relevant part,the prosecutor stated 
at the time of his participation in the drug offense,defendant andy laracuent knew that the bales he helped unload contained cocaine.for purposes of unintelligible,defendant is held responsible for at least fifteen kilograms,but less than fifty kilograms,of cocaine.inside the nissan armada,agents also found three firearms,one glock pistol,model,millimeter caliber,bearing serial mfn,one smith wesson pistol,caliber,bearing serial pen,and one fnp pistol,caliber,bearing serial dmr.defendant possessed these firearms in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime.at trial the united states would have established these facts proving defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to count three of the indictment by presenting the testimony of witnesses,including law enforcement officers,surveillance photographs,photographs of the vessel and the narcotics,the narcotics seized,the laboratory results,the firearms and ammunition,as well as any other pertinent documentation.
laracuent was then asked do you admit as true the summary of the evidence that has just been given by the prosecutor he twice answered yes.
in other words,laracuent does not contest these facts.at both the plea colloquy and in his signed plea agreement,laracuent agreed with the factual accounting namely that law enforcement officials observed laracuent loading bales of what was confirmed to be cocaine into three vehicles,including the nissan armada in which he was stopped at the time of his arrest.the officials found three firearms in the car with the drugs.at the plea hearing,laracuent agreed that he himself knowingly and unlawfully possessed these firearms,making his arguments as to advance knowledge and the identity of the principal seem particularly flimsy.
the component facts that form the rational basis for accepting a guilty plea may come either from the defendant admissions and concessions or from credible evidence proffered by the government and not contradicted by the defendant.negrón narváez,at.based on laracuent own concessions,the court below could conclude that the government proffered facts provided a rational basis from which to infer that laracuent had the requisite intent.laracuent sudden speculation that he may not have known about the firearms in advance is insufficient.as we have said,a mere possibility might constitute a plausible line of defense at trial,but such possibilities,without more,are not enough to dissipate an intact factual basis for a guilty plea.jiminez,at.
conclusion 
for the reasons explained,we see no clear or obvious error and are satisfied that the requirements of rule b have been met in this case.the record provides ample factual support for laracuent guilty plea.his conviction as to count three is affirmed.
when an appeal follows a guilty plea,the facts are drawn from some combination of the c
