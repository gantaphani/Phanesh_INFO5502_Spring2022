plaintiffs robert vallejo,moillis,and daniel fructuoso sued the city of san juan,puerto rico,its mayor,and others in december,alleging police brutality in violation of and and puerto rico law.plaintiffs appeal from the district court dismissal of their federal and claims,with prejudice,as a sanction for their persistent violations of scheduling orders and other discovery misconduct.see vallejo,civ.d.
plaintiffs appeal concedes to us their many violations but urges that the sanction of dismissal was unduly harsh and that the court should have given plaintiffs more explicit warning before imposing it.neither of plaintiffs arguments was timely presented to the district court and so they are waived.were we to look beyond that waiver,on these facts,the district court did not abuse its discretion,and we affirm.
in light of this case posture on appeal,we need not address the substance of the parties underlying dispute.we turn to the somewhat tangled procedural history,which prompted the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims.we also briefly outline various motions filed,which include plaintiffs sole,untimely opposition to the sanction before the district court.
procedural history 
this case was litigated for roughly twenty months before the district court dismissed it.that period was marked by the district court repeated efforts to accommodate plaintiffs by granting them a series of discovery extensions and the plaintiffs repeated violations of the resulting scheduling and discovery orders.
plaintiffs filed their complaint on december.on march,the district court issued a scheduling order,which set a variety of deadlines for discovery,including an april,deadline for the filing of initial disclosures,pursuant to.the order explicitly warned both parties,with emphasis,that the court would not allow deviations from this schedule.
plaintiffs did not meet the april,deadline for their initial disclosures.they instead served them on april.on april,defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,citing plaintiffs failure to comply with the scheduling order.defendants reported that plaintiffs initial disclosures were not only late but,significantly,were also incomplete,as they omitted numerous documents.defendants pointed out that plaintiffs disclosure explained only that the missing materials were to be supplied and did not include anything to support plaintiffs damages calculation,in violation of.a a iii.the district court denied defendants motion on may,and ordered the parties to collaborate on a mutually agreeable amended discovery schedule.
the parties jointly filed a revised discovery schedule on may.under the proposed schedule,both sides agreed,inter alia,that june,would be the deadline for plaintiffs expert disclosures and expert witness reports.the court approved the new schedule on june.
despite the court accommodation,plaintiffs again failed to comply with the revised scheduling order to which they had agreed.as of july,almost one month after the amended deadline,plaintiffs still had not made their mandatory expert disclosures.on that date,defendants filed a second motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims as a sanction for noncompliance,this time seeking dismissal with prejudice or,in the alternative,the exclusion of plaintiffs expert witnesses.
plaintiffs filed a response on july,in which they claimed,for the first time,that the discovery schedule to which they had previously agreed was overly ambitious and out of sequence.in particular,plaintiffs asserted that their expert witnesses would be unable to prepare reports until the conclusion of discovery and asked that the court grant them an extension on their expert reports until days after the conclusion of the deposition of fact witnesses.
on august,the court ordered plaintiffs to meet their discovery obligations under the previous scheduling orders and the federal rules of civil procedure by august.the court warned plaintiffs that failure to comply fully with its order would result in the exclusion of their experts testimony from trial.
the court warning notwithstanding,the august deadline passed without plaintiffs completing their required disclosures.on august,defendants filed a third motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint with prejudice or,in the alternative,to exclude plaintiffs expert witnesses.in response,plaintiffs again sought an amendment to the dates in the discovery order.
on september,the district court further accommodated plaintiffs by granting their request to revise the scheduling order.the amended order required plaintiffs to produce expert reports by may,thirty days after depositions were to be completed.
discovery proceeded over the next several months,albeit not always as planned.during a february,conference call,the court ordered all parties to provide to all other parties a transcript of any depositions they conducted the order was apparently triggered by plaintiffs taking the position that they were not required to do so.additionally,although plaintiffs had originally scheduled approximately fifty depositions between december,and march,they ultimately deposed a total of two witnesses during that period.in april,plaintiffs also failed to produce a fact witness for his scheduled deposition by defendants,in violation of an explicit court order the district court had ordered plaintiffs to produce the witness after he failed to appear for a previously scheduled deposition in november.in response,the district court barred the witness from testifying for plaintiffs.
on may,almost two weeks after the most recent amended deadline for the completion of depositions,plaintiffs filed a motion to further extend discovery,citing the death of one of their opponent attorney husband in march of that year as the cause of delays defendants responsive motion argued that plaintiffs delay was not caused by defense counsel but was of their own fault.defendants noted in part that t he personal situation of counsel for one of the defendants on one particular date does not constitute a sufficient reason for plaintiffs inability to conclude discovery in a timely fashion over the past seventeen and a half months.the district court denied plaintiffs motion to further revise the scheduling order on may,and denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of the denial on june.
in the meantime,plaintiffs failed to file their expert disclosures by may,as required by the amended scheduling order.
on july,defendants filed another motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims with prejudice.defendants noted the court earlier multiple amendments of the discovery schedule to accommodate plaintiffs and urged that the latest missed deadline was part of a consistent pattern by plaintiffs of blatantly ignoring the court orders and then belatedly requesting that such deadline s be extended after already having expired.in an informative motion filed that same day,defendants also notified the court that plaintiffs had failed to supply copies of deposition transcripts to all parties,as mandated by the court february order.two days later,defendants filed a supplemental motion,reporting that those deposition transcripts that plaintiffs had provided were missing key pages,as well as exhibits totaling several hundred more pages.defendants asked the court to order production of the missing documents.
plaintiffs did not respond to any of these motions.they filed no opposition to the defendants request that the case be dismissed with prejudice.
on august,the district court granted defendants july motion to dismiss.vallejo,slip op.at.the court noted that plaintiffs had repeatedly disobeyed its scheduling orders,beginning with their violation of the initial disclosure deadline and including their continued failure to make the required expert witness reports available,in contravention of both the original scheduling order and the new scheduling order explicitly agreed upon by the parties themselves.id.at.it also cited plaintiffs failure to provide all defendants with complete deposition transcripts,despite the court explicit order that they do so.id.the court described defendants repeated efforts to notify plaintiffs of various deficiencies
