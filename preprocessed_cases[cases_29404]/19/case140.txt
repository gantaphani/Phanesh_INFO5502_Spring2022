the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,imposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings and demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.felkner jackson,per curiam slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the court of appeals departed from this standard,and we therefore grant certiorari and reverse.
irving cross was tried for kidnaping and sexually assaulting at knifepoint.cross claimed that had consented to sex in exchange for money and drugs.despite her avowed fear of taking the stand,testified as the state primary witness at cross trial in november and was by cross attorney.according to the trial judge,testimony was halting.the jury found cross not guilty of kidnaping but was unable to reach a verdict on the sexual assault charges,and the trial judge declared a mistrial.the state decided to retry cross on those counts,and the retrial was scheduled for march.
on march,the prosecutor informed the trial judge that could not be located.a week later,on march,the state moved to have declared unavailable and to introduce her prior testimony at the second trial.

on march,the state learned from mother that had run away from home the day before and had not returned.exh.j,at.thereafter,efforts began by members of the cook county state attorney office and by law enforcement personnel to locate at.the state averred that its efforts included the following 
constant personal visits to the home of and her mother,at all hours of the day and night.this is where the victim has lived since the sexual assault occurred.

the state also inquired at the department of public health,the morgue,the cook county jail,the illinois department of corrections,the immigration department,and the post office.see exh.k,at to,app.to pet.for cert.the state investigator was assisted in the search by a police detective and a victim advocate.the detective visited father home once and went to mother home residence on numerous occasions,approximately once every three days,at different hours of the day and night.exh.k,at to.on one visit,mother told the victim advocate that could be staying with an in waukegan,illinois,miles away,at to.the police detective visited the waukegan address but was informed by the mother that she had not seen in several months and that was not staying with her or her son,at to.the efforts to find continued until march,the day of the hearing on the state motion,at.
on a final visit to mother on the morning of march,the mother informed the police detective that had called approximately two weeks earlier and had said that she did not want to testify and would not return to chicago.see,at.mother told the detective that she still did not know where was or how to contact her.exh.k,at.
the trial court granted the state motion and admitted earlier testimony.the trial court concluded that the state had expended efforts that go way beyond due diligence,at,and that ha d made it impossible for anybody to find where she is in spite of what i think are superhuman efforts to locate her,at.at cross retrial,a legal intern from the state attorney office read prior,testimony to the jury.according to the opinion below,the clerk reading of the prior testimony did not include the long pauses that occurred at the first trial,and the clerk read the transcript with a slight inflection.see,at.the jury acquitted cross of aggravated sexual assault but found him guilty of two counts of criminal sexual assault.
on appeal,the illinois court of appeals agreed that was unavailable because i t is clear from her telephone conversation with her mother that she was not in the city and also evident that she was in hiding and did not want to be located.at.the court found that the state had conducted a,diligent search to locate,and that the trial court had properly allowed the introduction of testimony from the first trial.the court,therefore,affirmed cross convictions and sentence.the supreme court of illinois denied cross petition for leave to appeal,and we denied cross petition for a writ of certiorari.
cross then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.cross argued,among other things,that the state court had unreasonably applied clearly established supreme court holding that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment precludes the admission of the prior testimony of an allegedly unavailable witness unless the prosecution made a effort to obtain the declarant presence at trial.the district court denied cross petition,but the seventh circuit reversed.according to the seventh circuit,the illinois court of appeals was unreasonable in holding that the state had made a sufficient effort to secure presence at the retrial.the seventh circuit stressed the importance of testimony and the manner of her testimony at the first trial.
in barber page,we held that a witness is not unavailable for purposes of the confrontation requirement unless the prosecutorial authorities have made a effort to obtain his presence at trial.at.in barber,we held that a witness had not been unavailable for confrontation clause purposes because the state,which could have brought the witness to court by seeking a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum,had made absolutely no effort to obtain his presence at trial apart from determining that he was serving a sentence in a federal prison,at see also,at.
we again addressed the question of witness unavailability in ohio roberts.in that case,we held,the state had discharged its duty of effort.at.we noted that the prosecutor had spoken to the witness mother,who reported that she had no knowledge of her daughter whereabouts and knew of no way to reach her even in an emergency.ibid.we also noted that the state had served five subpoenas in the witness name to her parents residence over a period prior to the trial.the lengths to which the prosecution must go to produce a witness,the court made clear,is a question of reasonableness.at quoting california green,harlan,concurring.we acknowledged that there were some additional steps that the prosecutor might have taken in an effort to find the witness,but we observed that o ne,in hindsight,may always think of other things.at.but the great improbability that such efforts would have resulted in locating the witness,and would have led to her production at trial,neutralizes any intimation that a concept of reasonableness required their execution.at.
in the present case,the holding of the illinois court of appeals that the state conducted the requisite search for did not represent an unreasonable application of our confrontation clause precedents.whether or not the state court went too far in characterizing the prosecution efforts as superhuman,the state court identified the correct s
