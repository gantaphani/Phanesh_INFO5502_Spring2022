the federal sex offender registration and notification act act requires convicted sex offenders to provide state governments with,and to update,information,names and current addresses,for state and federal sex offender registries.it is a crime if a person who is required to register under the act and who travels in interstate commerce knowingly fails to register or update a registration.a.the act defines sex offender to include offenders who were convicted before the act effective date,and says that the attorney general shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the registration requirements to offenders,d.the act,which seeks to make more uniform and effective a patchwork of federal and state registration systems,became law in july.in february,the attorney general promulgated an interim rule specifying that the act applies to all offenders.he has since promulgated further rules,regulations,and specifications.
petitioner reynolds,a offender,registered in missouri in but moved to pennsylvania in september without updating the missouri registration or registering in pennsylvania.he was indicted for failing to meet the act registration requirements between september and october.he moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the act was not applicable to offenders during that time,arguing that the attorney general february interim rule was invalid because it violated the constitution nondelegation doctrine and the administrative procedure act notice and comment requirements.the district court rejected on the merits of reynolds legal attack on the interim rule,but the third circuit rejected his argument without reaching the merits,concluding that the act registration requirements applied to offenders even in the absence of a rule by the attorney general.thus,it found,the interim rule validity made no legal difference in the outcome.
held the act does not require offenders to register before the attorney general validly specifies that the act registration provisions apply to them.
a this conclusion is supported by a natural reading of the act text,which consists of four statements.statement one says that a sex offender shall register,and keep the registration current.statement two says that,generally,the offender must initially register before completing his sentence of imprisonment.statement three says that the sex offender must update a registration within three business days of any change of name,residence,employment,or student status.statement four says that t he attorney general shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of the act.read naturally,the fourth statement modifies the first.it deals specifically with a subset offenders of the first statement broad general class all sex offenders and thus should control the act application to that subset.see united states.also,by giving the attorney general authority to specify the act applicability,not its nonapplicability,the fourth statement is more naturally read to confer authority to apply the act,not authority to make exceptions.this reading efficiently resolves what may have been congress concern about the practical problems of applying the new registration requirements to a large number of offenders,which could have been expensive and might not have proved feasible to do immediately.it might have thought that such concerns warranted different treatment for different categories of offenders.and it could have concluded that it was efficient and desirable to ask the justice department,charged with responsibility for implementation,to examine offender problems and to apply the new requirements accordingly.this reading also takes congress to have filled potential lacunae created by related act provisions in a manner consistent with basic criminal law principles.the second statement,requires a sex offender to register before completing his prison term,but says nothing about when a offender who has left prison is to register.an attorney general ruling could diminish such uncertainties,helping to eliminate the kind of vagueness and uncertainty that criminal law must seek to avoid.
b the government three principal contrary arguments that the court reading conflicts with the act purpose of establishing a national registration system that includes offenders that the court reading could lead to an absurdly long implementation delay and that the act should be read to apply the requirements immediately and on their own to all offenders to avoid the possibility that the attorney general,who has,but is not required to use,the authority to specify requirements,might take no action are unpersuasive.some lower courts have read the attorney general authority to apply only to sex offenders who are unable to comply with the statute initial registration requirements,but that is not what the act says.
c because the act registration requirements do not apply to offenders until the attorney general so specifies,the question whether the attorney general interim rule is a valid specification matters in this case.

justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the federal sex offender registration and notification act act,stat,et ed.and supp.iii,requires those convicted of certain sex crimes to provide state governments with and to update information,such as names and current addresses,for inclusion on state and federal sex offender registries.a,a ed.the act makes it a crime for a person who is required to register under the act and who travels in interstate or foreign commerce knowingly to fai l to register or update a registration a.the question before us concerns the date on which this federal registration requirement took effect with respect to sex offenders convicted before the act became law.
the act defines the term sex offender as including these offenders.see carr united states,slip,at.it says that a sex offender shall register.a.and it further says that t he attorney general shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the registration requirements to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter d emphasis added.in our view,these provisions,read together,mean that the act registration requirements do not apply to offenders until the attorney general specifies that they do apply.we reverse a court of appeals determination that,in effect,holds the contrary.
the new federal act reflects congress awareness that registration law consisted of a patchwork of federal and individual state registration systems.see fed.reg.the act seeks to make those systems more uniform and effective.it does so by repealing several earlier federal laws that also but less effectively sought uniformity by setting forth comprehensive standards by making federal funding contingent on states bringing their systems into compliance with those standards by requiring both state and federal sex offenders to register with relevant jurisdictions and to keep registration information current and by creating federal criminal sanctions applicable to those who violate the act registration requirements.a criminal provision,ed.and supp.iii registration requirements federal funding,stat.repeal of earlier laws.
the act criminal penalty applies to w ho m ever is required to register under the act.a.it says that such a person a federal sex offender or a nonfederal sex offender who travels in interstate commerce must not knowingly fail to register or update a registration as required by the act.ibid.emphasis added see appendix,infra,at.
the relevant registration requirements are set forth in an act provision that states 
registry requirements for sex offenders 
a in general 
a sex offender defined to include any offender who was convicted of a sex offense shall register,and keep the registration current,in each jurisdiction where the offender resides,where the offender is an employee,and where the offender is a student 
b initial registration 
the sex offender shall initially register either before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement or for those not sentenced to prison not later than business days after being sentenced 
c keeping the registration current 
a sex offender shall update his registration within business days after each change of name,residence,employment,or student status by appear ing in person in at least jurisdiction involved and inform ing that jurisdiction of all relevant changes 
d initial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection b 
the attorney general shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the registration requirements to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction,and to prescribe rules for the registration of any such sex offenders and for other categories of sex offenders who are unable to comply with subsection b.emphasis added.
the new act became law on july.
on february,the attorney general promulgated an interim rule specifying that t he requirements of the act apply to all sex offenders,including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of that act.fed.reg.codified at cfr.subsequently,the attorney general promulgated further rules,regulations,and specifications.see fed.reg.fed.reg.fed.reg.the present case focuses upon the applicability of the act registration requirements to offenders during the period between july,when the act took effect and the moment when the attorney general promulgated a valid rule specifying the registration requirements applicability,namely,february,or a later date if the february specification was invalid.
billy joe reynolds,the petitioner,is a offender.he was convicted of a missouri sex offense in october he served four years in prison he was released in july he then registered as a missouri sex offender but he moved to pennsylvania in september without updating his missouri registration information as missouri law required and without registering in pennsylvania.a federal grand jury indicted him,charging him with,between september and october,having knowingly failed to register and update a registration as required by the act.app.see a.in the government view,reynolds failure to update his address information when he moved to pennsylvania violated the requirement that a sex offender update registration information within business days after each change of residence.c.
reynolds moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that in september and october the act registration requirements had not yet become applicable to offenders.he conceded that the act had become law earlier namely,in july,and he conceded that the attorney general had already in february promulgated an interim rule specifying that the act registration requirements were applicable to offenders.but he claimed that the interim rule was invalid because it violated both the constitution nondelegation doctrine and the administrative procedure act apa requirement for good cause to promulgate a rule without notice and comment as the attorney general had done.see schechter poultry united states,nondelegation doctrine b b,d apa.because the interim rule is invalid,he added,the law must treat him like a offender who traveled interstate and violated the act registration requirements before the attorney general specified their applicability.
the district court rejected on the merits reynolds legal attack on the interim rule.but the court of appeals rejected reynolds argument without reaching those merits.fed.appx.that court thought that the act registration requirements apply to offenders such as reynolds who was subject to a registration requirement from the date of the new law enactment even in the absence of any rule or regulation by the attorney general specifying that the new registration requirements apply.that being so,the validity of the interim rule could make no legal difference,for the act required reynolds to follow the new federal registration requirements regardless of any rulemaking.
the courts of appeals have reached different conclusions about whether the act registration requirements apply to offenders prior to the time that the attorney general specifies their applicability,from july until at least february.six circuits have held that the act registration requirements do not apply to offenders unless and until the attorney general so specifies.united states johnson,united states valverde,united states cain,united states hatcher,united states dixon,united states madera,per curiam.five circuits have held that they apply from the date of the act enactment,and prior to any such specification,at least with respect to offenders who had already registered under state law.united states fuller,united states ditomasso,united states shenandoah,united states hinckley,united states may.in light of this split,we agreed to consider the question.
the question before us is whether the act requires offenders to register before the attorney general validly specifies that the act registration provisions apply to them.we believe that it does not.for one thing,a natural reading of the textual language supports our conclusion.the text consists of four statements.see supra,at.statement one says that a sex offender shall register,and keep the registration current.statement two says that a sex offender must initially register before completing his sentence of imprisonment or,if the sentence does not involve imprisonment,within three days of conviction.statement three says that the sex offender must update a registration within three business days of any change of name,residence,employment,or student status.statement four says that t he attorney general shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter.
read naturally,the fourth statement modifies the first.it specifically deals with a subset offenders of a broad general class all sex offenders to which the first statement applies.and it therefore should control the act application to that subset.see united states,specific statutory provision normally controls over one of more general application see also bloate united states,slip,at same.
at the same time,the fourth statement says that the attorney general has authority to specify the act applicability,not its nonapplicability.and it consequently is more naturally read as conferring the authority to apply the act,not the authority to make exceptions.that is how we normally understand a term such as authority to specify in the context of applying new rules to persons already governed by rules.if,for example,the major league baseball players association and the team owners agreed that the commissioner of baseball shall have the authority to specify the applicability to the major leagues of the more stringent minor league drug testing policy,we should think that the minor league policy would not apply unless and until the commissioner so specified.
for another thing,this reading of the act efficiently resolves what congress may well have thought were practical problems arising when the act sought to apply the new registration requirements to offenders.the problems arise out of the fact that the act seeks to make more uniform a patchwork of state systems.doing so could require newly registering or a large number of offenders.that effort could prove expensive.and it might not prove feasible to do so immediately.see fed.reg.recognizing these problems.congress concern about these problems is reflected in the act providing the states with three years to bring their systems into compliance with federal standards while permitting the attorney general to extend that grace period to five years.
these same considerations might have warranted different federal registration treatment of different categories of offenders.fed.reg,and final department of justice guidelines allowing states to meet act requirements without registering certain categories of offenders fed.reg.supplemental guidelines allowing the same.at least congress might well have so thought.and consequently,congress might well have looked for a solution.asking the department of justice,charged with responsibility for implementation,to examine these offender problems and to apply the new registration requirements accordingly could have represented one efficient and desirable solution though we express no view on reynolds related constitutional claim.b,a,b,granting the attorney general authority to administer various aspects of the act.and that is just the solution that the act language says that congress adopted.
finally,our reading of the act takes congress to have filled potential lacunae created by related act provisions in a manner consistent with basic background principles of criminal law.the second statement,for example,says that a sex offender must register before completing his prison term,but the provision says nothing about when a offender who completed his prison term must register.although a state offender could not be prosecuted until he traveled interstate,there is no interstate requirement for a federal offender.and to apply the act to either of these offenders from the date of enactment would require reading into the statute,silent on the point,some kind of unsaid equivalent,registering or updating within a reasonable time or within three days of first travel in interstate commerce or as preexisting state law requires 
offenders,aware of such complexities,lacunae,and difficulties,might,on their own,reach different conclusions about whether,or how,the new registration requirements applied to them.a ruling from the attorney general,however,could diminish or eliminate those uncertainties,thereby helping to eliminate the very kind of vagueness and uncertainty that criminal law must seek to avoid,united states lanier,noting that the canon of strict construction of criminal statutes,or rule of lenity,ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered 
the government makes three principal arguments to the contrary.first,it says that our interpretation of the act conflicts with one basic statutory purpose,namely,the establish ment of a comprehensive national system for the registration of sex offenders,that includes offenders who committed their offenses before the act became law.the act reflects that purpose when it defines sex offender broadly to include any individual who was convicted of a sex offense.and we have recognized that purpose in stating that,in general,the act criminal provisions apply to any offender required to register under the act who later travels interstate and fails to register.see carr,at slip,at.
the act history also reveals that many of its supporters placed considerable importance upon the registration of offenders.see,pt,twenty percent of sexual offenders are lost,and there is a strong public interest in finding them and having them register with current information to mitigate the risks of additional crimes against children cong.rec.statement of cantwell child sex offenders have exploited this stunning lack of uniformity,and the consequences have been tragic.twenty percent of the nation sex offenders are lost because state offender registry programs are not coordinated well enough at statement of kyl there currently are over sex offenders in this country who are required to register but are off the system.they are not registered.the penalties in this bill should be adequate to ensure that these individuals register at statement of frist there are currently registered sex offenders in the and at least of them are missing from the system.every day that we do have this national sex offender registry,these missing sex predators are out there somewhere 
the difficulty with the government argument,however,is that it overstates the need for instantaneous registration of offenders.our different reading,we concede,involves implementation delay.but that delay need not be long the attorney general issued his interim rule days after the effective date of the new law.and that delay can be justified by the need to accommodate other interests.see supra,at.
second,the government suggests that our reading leads to an absurd result.as it points out,the fourth statement grants the attorney general the authority to specify the registration requirements applicability not only to offenders but also to those convicted prior to the implementation of the new act in a particular jurisdiction.some jurisdictions might not implement the act for up to five years.see see also of justice,office of justice programs,justice department finds jurisdictions have substantially implemented sorna requirements july,stating that as of july,states had implemented the act requirements,all internet materials as visited,and available in clerk of court case file.yet,the government concludes,it is absurd to believe that congress would have desired so long a delay in the application of its new registration requirements.
the problem with this argument,however,is that reading the two categories similarly a matter which we need not decide would not require a long delay in applying the registration requirements to offenders who committed a crime in a jurisdiction that is slow to implement the new requirements.at most,that reading would require the attorney general to promulgate a rule applicable to all preimplementation offenders.that rule could specify that the act preregistration provisions apply to some or to all those offenders.and it could do so quickly,well before a jurisdiction implements the act requirements.indeed,the attorney general interim rule and the department of justice final guidelines,both issued before any jurisdiction implemented the act requirements,state that the act requirements apply to all sex offenders,including all preimplementation offenders.see fed.reg.codified at cfr fed.reg.of justice,office of justice programs,justice department announces first two jurisdictions to implement sex offender registration and notification act.
third,the government argues against our interpretation on the ground that the act says only that the attorney general shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the act registration requirements to offenders it does not say that he shall specify or otherwise require him to do so.the act language,the government continues,consequently gives the attorney general the power not to specify anything that power is inconsistent with congress intent to ensure the speedy registration of thousands of lost offenders,supra,at and we can avoid this result only by reading the act registration requirements as applying immediately and on their own to all offenders though the attorney general would have the power to make exceptions.
this argument bases too much upon too little.there is no reason to believe that congress feared that the attorney general would refuse to apply the new requirements to offenders.see,at protecting our nation children from sexual predators and violent criminals what needs to be done hearing before the subcommittee on crime,terrorism,and homeland security of the house committee on the judiciary,office of the press sec y,the white house,president signs,the adam walsh child protection and safety act of july.and there was no need for a mandatory requirement to avoid that unrealistic possibility.there is consequently no need to read the language unnaturally as giving the attorney general the authority only to make exceptions from an implicit unstated rule that would otherwise apply the new regi
