federal immigration law governs both the exclusion of aliens from admission to this country and the deportation of aliens previously admitted.before,these two kinds of action occurred in different procedural settings since then,the government has employed a unified removal proceeding for exclusions and deportations alike.but the immigration laws have always provided separate lists of substantive grounds for the two actions.one list specifies what crimes render an alien excludable,see a,while another sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent list specifies what crimes render an alien deportable,see a.
until repealed in,c of the immigration and nationality act permitted the attorney general to grant discretionary relief to an excludable alien,if the alien had lawfully resided in the united states for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the country and if the alien was not excludable on one of two specified grounds.by its terms,c applied only in exclusion proceedings,but the board of immigration appeals bia extended it decades ago to deportation proceedings as well.although congress substituted a narrower discretionary remedy for c in,see,c broader relief remains available to an alien whose removal is based on a guilty plea entered before c repeal,ins cyr.
in deciding whether to exclude such an alien,the bia first checks the statutory ground identified by the department of homeland security dhs as the basis for exclusion.unless that ground is one of the two falling outside c scope,the alien is eligible for discretionary relief.the bia then determines whether to grant relief based on such factors as the seriousness of the offense.
this case concerns the bia method for applying c in the deportation context.the bia approach,known as the rule,evaluates whether the charged deportation ground has a close analogue in the statute list of exclusion grounds.if the deportation ground consists of a set of crimes substantially equivalent to the set making up an exclusion ground,the alien can seek c relief.but if the deportation ground covers different or more or fewer offenses than any exclusion ground,the alien is ineligible for relief,even if the alien particular offense falls within an exclusion ground.

a while agencies have expertise and experience in administering their statutes that no court may properly ignore,courts retain a narrow but important role in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.thus,in reviewing the bia action,this court must assess,among other matters,whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.motor vehicle mfrs.of united states,state farm mut.automobile ins.that task involves examining the reasons for agency decisions,or the absence of such reasons.
the approach can not survive scrutiny under this standard.by hinging a deportable alien eligibility for discretionary relief on the chance correspondence between statutory categories a matter irrelevant to the alien fitness to reside in this country the bia has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner.
b even if the bia has legitimate reasons for limiting c scope in deportation cases,it must do so in some rational way.in other words,the bia must use an approach that is tied to the purposes of the immigration laws or the appropriate operation of the immigration system.the rule has no connection to these factors.instead,it makes c eligibility turn on an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions.whether the set of offenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with the set in an exclusion ground has nothing to do with whether a deportable alien whose prior conviction falls within both grounds merits the ability to stay in this country.here,judulang was found ineligible for c relief because the crime of violence deportation ground includes a few offenses simple assault,minor burglary,and unauthorized use of a vehicle not found in the similar moral turpitude exclusion ground.but the inclusion of simple assaults and minor burglaries in the deportation ground is irrelevant to the merits of judulang case.
the bia approach has other odd features.in applying the rule,the bia has denied relief to aliens whose deportation ground fits entirely within a much broader exclusion ground.yet providing relief in exclusion cases to a broad class of aliens hardly justifies denying relief in deportation cases to a subset of that group.in addition,the outcome of the analysis may itself rest on an arbitrary decision.an alien prior conviction could fall within a number of deportation grounds,only one of which corresponds to an exclusion ground.in such cases,an alien eligibility for relief would hinge on an individual official decision as to which deportation ground to charge.an alien appearing before one official may suffer deportation,while an identically situated alien appearing before another may gain the right to stay in this country.
in short,the approach does not rest on any factors relevant to whether an alien should be deported.instead,it turns deportation decisions into a sport of chance.rosenberg fleuti.that is what the apa arbitrary and capricious standard is designed to prevent.
c the government arguments in defense of the rule are not persuasive.first,c text does not support the rule.that section can not provide a textual anchor for any method of providing discretionary relief in deportation cases because it addresses only exclusion.second,the history of the rule does not work in the government favor.the bia repeatedly vacillated in its method for applying c to deportable aliens,settling on the current rule only in.third,the government claim that the rule saves time and money falls short.cost may be an important factor for agencies to consider in many contexts,but cheapness alone can not save an arbitrary agency policy.in any event,it is unclear that the rule saves money when compared with alternative approaches.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns the board of immigration appeals bia or board policy for deciding when resident aliens may apply to the attorney general for relief from deportation under a provision of the immigration laws.we hold that the bia approach is arbitrary and capricious.
the legal background of this case is complex,but the principle guiding our decision is anything but.when an administrative agency sets policy,it must provide a reasoned explanation for its action.that is not a high bar,but it is an unwavering one.here,the bia has failed to meet it.
federal immigration law governs both the exclusion of aliens from admission to this country and the deportation of aliens previously admitted.before,these two kinds of action occurred in different procedural settings,with an alien seeking entry whether for the first time or upon return from a trip abroad placed in an exclusion proceeding and an alien already here channeled to a deportation proceeding.see landon plasencia,comparing the two.since that time,the government has used a unified procedure,known as a removal proceeding,for exclusions and deportations alike.see.but the statutory bases for excluding and deporting aliens have always varied.now,as before,the immigration laws provide two separate lists of substantive grounds,principally involving criminal offenses,for these two actions.one list specifies what kinds of crime render an alien excludable or in the term the statute now uses,inadmissible see a,supp.iv,while another sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent list specifies what kinds of crime render an alien deportable from the country,see a.
an additional,historic difference between exclusion and deportation cases involved the ability of the attorney general to grant an alien discretionary relief.until repealed in,c of the immigration and nationality act,stat,c ed,authorized the attorney general to admit certain excludable aliens.see also p ed.predecessor provision to c.the attorney general could order this relief when the alien had lawfully resided in the united states for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the country,unless the alien was excludable on one of two specified grounds.see c ed.but by its terms,c did not apply when an alien was being deported.
this discrepancy threatened to produce an odd result in a case called matter of l,leading to the grant of discretionary relief in a deportation case.l was a permanent resident of the united states who had been convicted of larceny.although l crime made him inadmissible,he traveled abroad and then returned to the united states without any immigration official preventing his entry.a few months later,the government caught up with l and initiated a deportation action based on his larceny conviction.had the government apprehended l at the border a short while earlier,he would have been placed in an exclusion proceeding where he could have applied for discretionary relief.but because l was instead in a deportation proceeding,no such relief was available.responding to this apparent anomaly,attorney general robert jackson on referral of the case from the bia determined that l could receive a waiver l,jackson said,should be permitted to make the same appeal to discretion that he could have made if denied admission when returning from his recent trip,at.in accord with this decision,the bia adopted a policy of allowing aliens in deportation proceedings to apply for discretionary relief under c whenever they had left and reentered the country after becoming deportable.see matter of s.
but this approach created another peculiar asymmetry deportable aliens who had traveled abroad and returned could receive c relief,while those who had never left could not.in francis ins,the court of appeals for the second circuit concluded that this disparity violated equal protection,at a n alien whose ties with this country are so strong that he has never departed after his initial entry should receive at least as much consideration as an individual who may leave and return from time to time the bia acquiesced in the second circuit decision,see matter of silva,thus applying c in deportation proceedings regardless of an alien travel history.
all this might have become academic when congress repealed c in and substituted a new discretionary remedy,known as cancellation of removal,which is available in a narrow range of circumstances to excludable and deportable aliens alike.see.but in ins cyr,this court concluded that the broader relief afforded by c must remain available,on the same terms as before,to an alien whose removal is based on a guilty plea entered before c repeal.we reasoned that aliens had agreed to those pleas with the possibility of discretionary relief in mind and that eliminating this prospect would ill comport with familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.at quoting landgraf usi film products.accordingly,c has had an afterlife for resident aliens with old criminal convictions.
when the bia is deciding whether to exclude such an alien,applying c is an easy matter.the board first checks the statutory ground that the department of homeland security dhs has identified as the basis for exclusion the board may note,for example,that dhs has charged the alien with previously committing a crime involving moral turpitude,see a a i i.unless the charged ground is one of the pair falling outside c scope,see,supra,the alien is eligible for discretionary relief.the board then determines whether to grant that relief based on such factors as the seriousness of the offense,evidence of either rehabilitation or recidivism,the duration of the alien residence,the impact of deportation on the family,the number of citizens in the family,and the character of any service in the armed forces.cyr,at.
by contrast,when the bia is deciding whether to deport an alien,applying c becomes a tricky business.recall that c applies on its face only to exclusion decisions.so the question arises how is the bia to determine when an alien should receive c relief in the deportation context 
one approach that the bia formerly used considered how the alien would fare in an exclusion proceeding.to perform this analysis,the board would first determine whether the criminal conviction making the alien deportable fell within a statutory ground for exclusion.almost all convictions did so,largely because the crime involving moral turpitude ground encompasses so many offenses assuming that threshold inquiry were met,the board would mimic its approach in exclusion cases first making sure the statutory ground at issue was not excepted from c and then conducting the analysis.see matter of tanori,in re manzueta,no,wl bia.
a second approach is the one challenged here definitively adopted in after decades of occasional use,it often is called the rule.see,de la rosa attorney general.that approach evaluates whether the ground for deportation charged in a case has a close analogue in the statute list of exclusion grounds.see in re blake,in re,if the deportation ground consists of a set of crimes substantially equivalent to the set of offenses making up an exclusion ground,then the alien can seek c relief.blake,at.but if the deportation ground charged covers significantly different or more or fewer offenses than any exclusion ground,the alien is not eligible for a waiver.such a divergence makes c inapplicable even if the particular offense committed by the alien falls within an exclusion ground.
two contrasting examples from the bia cases may help to illustrate this approach.take first an alien convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine,whom dhs seeks to deport on the ground that he has committed an aggravated felony involving illicit trafficking in a controlled substance.a b,a a iii.under the rule,the immigration judge would look to see if that deportation ground covers substantially the same offenses as an exclusion ground.and according to the bia in matter of meza,the judge would find an adequate match the exclusion ground applicable to aliens who have committed offenses relating to a controlled substance,a a i ii and a c.
now consider an alien convicted of sexual abuse of a child,whom dhs wishes to deport on the ground that he has committed an aggravated felony involving sexual abuse of a minor.a a,a a iii.may this alien seek c relief according to the bia,he may not do so not because his crime is too serious that is irrelevant to the analysis,but instead because no statutory ground of exclusion covers substantially the same offenses.to be sure,the alien own offense is a crime involving moral turpitude,a a i i,and so fits within an exclusion ground.indeed,that will be true of most or all offenses included in this deportation category.see supra,at.but on the bia view,the moral turpitude exclusion ground addresses a distinctly different and much broader category of offenses than the aggravated felony sexual abuse of a minor charge.blake,at.and the much greater sweep of the exclusion ground prevents the alien from seeking discretionary relief from deportation 
those mathematically inclined might think of the approach as employing venn diagrams.within one circle are all the criminal offenses composing the particular ground of deportation charged.within other circles are the offenses composing the various exclusion grounds.when,but only when,the deportation circle sufficiently corresponds to one of the exclusion circles may an alien apply for c relief.

we granted certiorari,to resolve a circuit split on the approach validity we now reverse.
this case requires us to decide whether the bia policy for applying c in deportation cases is arbitrary or capricious under the administrative procedure act apa,a the scope of our review under this standard is narrow as we have often recognized,a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.motor vehicle mfrs.of united states,state farm mut.automobile ins,see citizens to preserve overton park,volpe.agencies,the bia among them,have expertise and experience in administering their statutes that no court can properly ignore.but courts retain a role,and an important one,in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.when reviewing an agency action,we must assess,among other matters,whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.state farm,at quoting bowman,freight system.that task involves examining the reasons for agency decisions or,as the case may be,the absence of such reasons.see fcc fox television stations,noting the requirement that an agency provide reasoned explanation for its action 
the bia has flunked that test here.by hinging a deportable alien eligibility for discretionary relief on the chance correspondence between statutory categories a matter irrelevant to the alien fitness to reside in this country the bia has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner.
the parties here spend much time disputing whether the bia must make discretionary relief available to deportable and excludable aliens on identical terms.as this case illustrates,the approach does not do so.if judulang were seeking entry to this country,he would be eligible for c relief voluntary manslaughter is a crime involving moral turpitude,and so his conviction falls within an exclusion ground.but judulang can not apply for relief from deportation because the crime of violence ground charged in his case does not match any exclusion ground including the one for turpitudinous crimes.see infra,at.judulang argues that this disparity is impermissible because any disparity between excludable and deportable aliens is impermissible if an alien may seek c relief in an exclusion case,he also must be able to seek such relief in a deportation case.see brief for petitioner but the government notes that the immigration laws have always drawn distinctions between exclusion and deportation.see brief for respondent.and the government presses a policy reason for making c relief more readily available in exclusion cases.doing so,it argues,will provide an incentive for some resident aliens,those eligible for a waiver from exclusion,but not deportation to report themselves to immigration officials,by applying for advance permission to exit and reenter the country.in contrast,applying c uniformly might lead all aliens to try to evade immigration officials for as long as possible,because they could in any event seek discretionary relief if caught.at.
in the end,we think this dispute beside the point,and we do not resolve it.the bia may well have legitimate reasons for limiting c scope in deportation cases.but still,it must do so in some rational way.if the bia proposed to narrow the class of deportable aliens eligible to seek c relief by flipping a coin heads an alien may apply for relief,tails he may not we would reverse the policy in an instant.that is because agency action must be based on,relevant factors,state farm,at quoting bowman,at,which here means that the bia approach must be tied,even if loosely,to the purposes of the immigration laws or the appropriate operation of the immigration system.a method for disfavoring deportable aliens that bears no relation to these matters that neither focuses on nor relates to an alien fitness to remain in the country is arbitrary and capricious.and that is true regardless whether the bia might have acted to limit the class of deportable aliens eligible for c relief on other,more rational bases.
the problem with the policy is that it does not impose such a reasonable limitation.rather than considering factors that might be thought germane to the deportation decision,that policy hinges c eligibility on an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions.recall that the bia asks whether the set of offenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with the set in an exclusion ground.but so what if it does does an alien charged with a particular deportation ground become more worthy of relief because that ground happens to match up with another or less worthy of relief because the ground does not the comparison in no way changes the alien prior offense or his other attributes and circumstances.so it is difficult to see why that comparison should matter.each of these statutory grounds contains a slew of offenses.whether each contains the same slew has nothing to do with whether a deportable alien whose prior conviction falls within both grounds merits the ability to seek a waiver 
this case well illustrates the point.in commencing judulang deportation proceeding,the government charged him with an aggravated felony involving a crime of violence based on his prior manslaughter conviction.see app.to pet.for cert.that made him ineligible for c relief because the crime of violence deportation ground does not sufficiently overlap with the most similar exclusion ground,for crime s involving moral turpitude.the problem,according to the bia,is that the crime of violence ground includes a few offenses simple assault,minor burglary,and unauthorized use of a vehicle that the moral turpitude ground does not.see,at tr.of oral arg.but this statutory difference in no way relates to judulang or to most other aliens charged with committing a crime of violence.perhaps aliens like judulang should be eligible for c relief,or perhaps they should not.but that determination is not sensibly made by establishing that simple assaults and minor burglaries fall outside a ground for exclusion.that fact is as extraneous to the merits of the case as a coin flip would be.it makes judulang no less deserving of the opportunity to seek discretionary relief just as its converse the inclusion of simple assaults and burglaries in the moral turpitude exclusion ground would make him no more so.
or consider a different headscratching oddity of the approach that it may deny c eligibility to aliens whose deportation ground fits entirely inside an exclusion ground.the bia blake decision,noted earlier,provides an example.see supra,at.the deportation ground charged was aggravated felony involving sexual abuse of a minor the closest exclusion ground was,once again,a crime of moral turpitude.at.here,the bia problem was not that the deportation ground covered too many offenses all or virtually all the crimes within that ground also are crimes of moral turpitude.rather,the bia objected that the deportation ground covered too few crimes or put oppositely,that the moral turpitude ground of exclusion addresses a much broader category of offenses.at.but providing relief in exclusion cases to a broad class of aliens hardly justifies denying relief in deportation cases to a subset of that group the better argument would surely be the reverse that giving relief in the one context supports doing so in the other.again,we do not say today that the bia must give all deportable aliens meeting c requirements the chance to apply for a waiver.see supra,at.the point is instead that the bia can not make that opportunity turn on the meaningless matching of statutory grounds.
and underneath this layer of arbitrariness lies yet another,because the outcome of the board analysis itself may rest on the happenstance of an immigration official charging decision.this problem arises because an alien prior conviction may fall within a number of deportation grounds,only one of which corresponds to an exclusion ground.consider,for example,an alien who entered the country in and committed voluntary manslaughter in.that person could be charged as judulang was with an aggravated felony involving a crime of violence,see a f,a a iii.if so,the alien could not seek a waiver because of the absence of a comparable exclusion ground.but the alien also could be charged with a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after the date of admission,see a a i i.and if that were the deportation charge,the alien could apply for relief,because the ground corresponds to the moral turpitude ground used in exclusion cases.see in re salmon.so everything hangs on the charge.and the government has provided no reason to think that immigration officials must adhere to any set scheme in deciding what charges to bring,or that those officials are exercising their charging discretion with c in mind.see tr.of oral arg.so at base everything hangs on the fortuity of an individual official decision.an alien appearing before one official may suffer deportation an identically situated alien appearing before another may gain the right to stay in this country.
in a foundational deportation case,this court recognized the high stakes for an alien who has long resided in this country,and reversed an agency decision that would make his right to remain here dependent on circumstances so fortuitous and capricious.delgadillo carmichael.we think the policy before us similarly flawed.the approach does not rest on any factors relevant to whether an alien or any group of aliens should be deported.it instead distinguishes among aliens decides who should be eligible for discretionary relief and who should not solely by comparing the metes and bounds of diverse statutory categories into which an alien falls.the resulting venn diagrams have no connection to the goals of the deportation process or the rational operation of the immigration laws.judge learned hand wrote in another early immigration case that deportation decisions can not be made a sport of chance.see di pasquale karnuth,quoted in rosenberg fleuti.that is what the rule brings about,and that is what the apa arbitrary and capricious standard is designed to thwart.
the government makes three arguments in defense of the rule the first based on statutory text,the next on history,the last on cost.we find none of them persuasive.
the government initially contends that the approach is more faithful to the statute language,brief for respondent or otherwise said,that lifting that limit would take immigration practice even further from the statutory text,at quoting matter of.in the government view,c is phrased in terms of waiving statutorily specified grounds of exclusion that phrasing,says the government,counsels a comparative analysis of grounds when applying c in the deportation context.brief for respondent see tr.of oral arg.t he reason the approach makes sense is because the statute only provides for relief from grounds of exclusion 
the first difficulty with this argument is that it is based on an inaccurate description of the statute.section c instructs that certain resident aliens may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general notwithstanding any of the provisions of subsection a other than paragraphs and c.c ed.subsection a contains the full list of exclusion grounds paragraphs and c which deal with national security and international child abduction are two among these.what c actually says,then,is that the attorney general may admit any excludable alien,except if the alien is charged with two specified grounds.and that means that once the attorney general determines that the alien is not being excluded for those two reasons,the ground of exclusion no longer matters.at that point,the alien is eligible for relief,and the thing the attorney general waives is not a particular exclusion ground,but the simple denial of entry.so the premise of the government argument is wrong.and if the premise,so too the conclusion that is,because c text is not phrased in terms of waiving statutorily specified grounds of exclusion,brief for respondent,it can not counsel a search for corresponding grounds of deportation.
more fundamentally,the approach would not follow from c even were the government right about the section phrasing.that is because c simply has nothing to do with deportation the provision was not meant to interact with the statutory grounds for deportation,any more than those grounds were designed to interact with the provision.rather,c refers solely to exclusion decisions its extension to deportation cases arose from the agency view that some similar relief should be available in that context to avoid unreasonable distinctions,matter of l,at see also supra,at accordingly,the text of c,whether or not phrased in terms of waiving grounds of exclusion,can not support the bia use of the rule or,for that matter,any other method for extending discretionary relief to deportation cases.we well understand the difficulties of operating in such a zone indeed,we appreciate the government yearning for a textual anchor.but c,no matter how many times read or parsed,does not provide one.
in disputing judulang contentions,the government also emphasizes the rule vintage.see brief for respondent.as an initial matter,we think this a slender reed to support a significant government policy.arbitrary agency action becomes no less so by simple dint of repetition.to use a prior analogy,flipping coins to determine c eligibility would remain as arbitrary on the thousandth try as on the first.and longstanding capriciousness receives no special exemption from the apa.in any event,we can not detect the consistency that the bia claims has marked its approach to this issue.to the contrary,the bia has repeatedly vacillated in its method for applying c to deportable aliens.
prior to,the bia endorsed a variety of approaches.in matter of t,for example,the bia held that an alien was not eligible for c relief because her ground of deportation did not appear in the exclusion statute.that decision anticipated the approach that the bia today uses.but in tanori,the bia pronounced that a deportable alien could apply for a waiver because the same facts in that case,a marijuana conviction would have allowed him to seek c relief in an exclusion proceeding,at.that approach is more nearly similar to the one judulang urges here.and then,in matter of granados,the bia tried to have it both ways it denied c eligibility both because the deportati
