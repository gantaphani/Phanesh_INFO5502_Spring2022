district attorney office for third judicial dist.osborne,left unresolved the question whether a convicted state prisoner seeking dna testing of evidence may assert that claim in a civil rights action under or may assert the claim in federal court only in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.
a texas jury convicted petitioner skinner and sentenced him to death for murdering his girlfriend and her sons.he claimed that a potent alcohol and drug mix rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal murders,and he identified his girlfriend uncle as the likely perpetrator.in preparation for trial,the state tested some of the physical evidence,but left untested several items,including knives found on the premises,an axe handle,vaginal swabs,fingernail clippings,and certain hair samples.more than six years later,texas enacted article,which allows prisoners to gain postconviction dna testing in limited circumstances.invoking article,skinner twice moved in state court for dna testing of the untested biological evidence.both motions were denied.the texas court of criminal appeals cca affirmed the first denial of relief on the ground that skinner had not shown,as required by article a,that he would not have been convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through dna testing.the cca affirmed the second denial of relief on the ground that skinner had not shown,as required by article b b,that the evidence was not previously tested through no fault on his part.
skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief under,naming as defendant respondent switzer,the district attorney who has custody of the evidence that skinner would like to have tested.skinner alleged that texas violated his fourteenth amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for the dna testing he requested.the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim,reasoning that postconviction requests for dna evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus,not under.adopting that recommendation,the district court dismissed skinner suit.the fifth circuit affirmed.
held there is jurisdiction over skinner complaint,and the claim he presses is cognizable under.
a federal rule of civil procedure a generally requires only a plausible short and plain statement of the plaintiff claim,not an exposition of his legal argument.skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph alleging that the state refusal to release the biological evidence for testing deprived him of his liberty interests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of his conviction to obtain a pardon or reduction of his sentence.his counsel has clarified that skinner does not challenge the prosecutor conduct or the cca decisions instead,he challenges texas postconviction dna statute as construed by the texas courts.
b the doctrine does not bar skinner suit.this court has applied the doctrine only in the two cases from which it takes its name,rooker fidelity trust,district of columbia court of appeals feldman.see exxon mobil saudi basic industries.given the narrow ground the doctrine occupies,at,the court has confined to cases brought by losers inviting district court review and rejection of a state court judgments.ibid.skinner complaint encounters no shoal.if a federal plaintiff present s an independent claim,it is not an impediment to the exercise of federal jurisdiction that the same or a related question was earlier aired between the parties in state court,at.a decision is not reviewable by lower federal courts,but a statute or rule governing the decision may be challenged in a federal action.see,feldman,at.because skinner federal case which challenges not the adverse decisions but the texas statute they authoritatively construed falls within the latter category,there was no lack of jurisdiction over his federal suit.
c measured against this court prior holdings,skinner has properly invoked.this court has several times considered when a state prisoner,complaining of unconstitutional state action,may pursue a civil rights claim under,and when habeas corpus is the prisoner sole remedy.the pathmarking decision,heck humphrey,concerned a state prisoner who brought a action for damages,alleging that he had been unlawfully investigated,arrested,tried,and convicted.this court held that was not an available remedy because any award in the plaintiff favor would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.see,at.in contrast,in wilkinson dotson,the court held that prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of administrative decisions denying them parole eligibility,could proceed under,for they sought no injunction ordering immediate or speedier release into the community,at,and a favorable judgment would not necessarily imply the invalidity of their conviction s or sentence s,ibid.here,success in skinner suit for dna testing would not necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.test results might prove exculpatory,but that outcome is hardly inevitable,for those results could also prove inconclusive or incriminating.switzer argues that,although skinner immediate aim is dna testing,his ultimate aim is to use the test results as a platform for attacking his conviction.but she has found no case in which the court has recognized habeas as the sole remedy where the relief sought would not terminate custody,accelerate the date of release,or reduce the custody level.contrary to the fears of switzer and her amici,in the circuits that currently allow claims for dna testing,there has been no flood of litigation seeking postconviction discovery of evidence associated with the questions of guilt or punishment.the projected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding dna testing claims,for osborne has rejected substantive due process as a basis for such claims.more generally,in the prison litigation reform act of,congress has placed constraints on prisoner suits in order to prevent sportive filings.nor is there cause for concern that the instant ruling will spill over to claims relying on brady maryland.brady,which announced a constitutional requirement addressed to the prosecution conduct pretrial,proscribes withholding evidence favorable to an accused and material to his guilt or to punishment.cone bell.unlike dna testing,which may yield exculpatory,incriminating,or inconclusive results,a successful brady claim necessarily yields evidence undermining a conviction brady claims therefore rank within the traditional core of habeas corpus and outside the province of.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
we granted review in this case to decide a question presented,but left unresolved,in district attorney office for third judicial dist.osborne,slip,at may a convicted state prisoner seeking dna testing of evidence assert that claim in a civil rights action under,or is such a claim cognizable in federal court only when asserted in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under the courts of appeals have returned diverse responses.compare mckithen brown,claim seeking dna testing is cognizable under savory lyons,same bradley pryor,same,with harvey horan,claim is not cognizable under and kutzner montgomery county,per curiam same.
in wilkinson dotson,we comprehensively surveyed this court decisions on the respective provinces of civil rights actions and federal habeas petitions.habeas is the exclusive remedy,we reaffirmed,for the prisoner who seeks immediate or speedier release from confinement,at.where the prisoner claim would not necessarily spell speedier release,however,suit may be brought under.ibid.adhering to our opinion in dotson,we hold that a postconviction claim for dna testing is properly pursued in a action.success in the suit gains for the prisoner only access to the dna evidence,which may prove exculpatory,inculpatory,or inconclusive.in no event will a judgment that simply orders dna tests necessarily impl y the unlawfulness of the state custody.at.we note,however,that the court decision in osborne severely limits the federal action a state prisoner may bring for dna testing.osborne rejected the extension of substantive due process to this area,at slip,at,and left slim room for the prisoner to show that the governing state law denies him procedural due process,see,at slip,at.
in,a texas jury convicted petitioner henry skinner and sentenced him to death for murdering his girlfriend,twila busby,and her two sons.busby was bludgeoned and choked with an axe handle and her sons were stabbed to death the murders were committed in the house busby shared with skinner.
skinner never denied his presence in the house when the killings occurred.he claimed,however,that he was incapacitated by large quantities of alcohol and codeine.the potent alcohol and drug mix,skinner maintained at trial,rendered him physically unable to commit the brutal murders charged against him.skinner identified,as a likely perpetrator,busby uncle,robert donnell now deceased,an with a history of physical and sexual abuse on direct appeal,the texas court of criminal appeals cca affirmed skinner conviction and sentence.skinner state.the cca opinion described the evidence in detail 
as they approached the house,the police noticed a trail of blood spots on the ground running from the front porch to the fence line.there was a blood smear on the glass storm door and a knife on the front porch.upon entering the residence,the police found twila dead body on the living room floor.an ax handle stained with blood and hair was leaning against the couch near her body and a black plastic trash bag containing a knife and a towel with wet brownish stains on it was laying between the couch and the coffee table.one officer proceeded to the bedroom where busby two sons usually slept in bunk beds.the officer found one dead body laying face down on the upper bunk,covered by a blood spotted blanket.a door leading out of the bedroom and into a utility room yielded further evidence.he noticed a bloody handprint located about inches off the floor on the frame of this door.he also noted a bloody handprint on the door knob of the door leading from the kitchen to the utility room and a handprint on the knob of the door exiting from the utility room into the backyard.when police arrested skinner t hey found him standing in a closet wearing socks and blue jeans.at.
investigators also retained vaginal swabs taken from busby.
in preparation for trial,the state tested the blood on skinner clothing,blood and hair from a blanket that partially covered one of the victims,and hairs on one of the victim back and cheeks.skinner state.crim.app.the state also tested fingerprint evidence.some of this evidence including bloody palm prints in the room where one victim was killed implicated skinner,but fingerprints on a bag containing one of the knives did not.ibid.items left untested included the knives found on the premises,the axe handle,vaginal swabs,fingernail clippings,and additional hair samples.see ibid 
in the decade following his conviction,skinner unsuccessfully sought state and federal postconviction relief.see skinner quarterman,cert.denied.he also pursued informal efforts to gain access to untested biological evidence the police had collected at the scene of the crime 
in,more than six years after skinner conviction,texas enacted article,a statute allowing prisoners to gain postconviction dna testing in limited circumstances.code crim.proc,a vernon supp.to obtain dna testing under article,a prisoner must meet one of two threshold criteria.he may show that,at trial,testing either was not available or was available,but not technologically capable of providing probative results.b a.alternatively,he may show that the evidence was not previously tested through no fault on his part,and that the interests of justice require a postconviction order for testing.b b.to grant a motion for postconviction testing,a court must make further findings,prime among them,the movant would not have been convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through dna testing,and the article request was not made to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or administration of justice.a.
invoking article,skinner twice moved in state court,first in and again in,for dna testing of yet untested biological evidence.see supra,at.both motions were denied.affirming the denial of skinner first motion,the cca held that he had failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would not have been convicted if the dna test results were exculpatory.skinner state,at.
skinner second motion was bolstered by discovery he had obtained in the interim the cca again affirmed the denial of relief under article,this time on the ground that skinner failed to meet the no fault requirement.see skinner state,during postconviction proceedings,the cca noted,trial counsel testified that he had not ask ed for testing because he was afraid the dna would turn out to be skinner.at.that decision,the cca concluded,constituted a reasonable trial strategy that the court had no cause to,at.
skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief under,naming as defendant respondent lynn switzer,the district attorney whose office prosecuted skinner and has custody of the evidence skinner would like to have dna tested.skinner complaint alleged that texas violated his fourteenth amendment right to due process by refusing to provide for the dna testing he requested.complaint,app.the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.app.under the governing circuit precedent,kutzner montgomery county,the magistrate judge observed,postconviction requests for dna evidence are cognizable only in habeas corpus,not under.app.adopting the magistrate judge recommendation,the district court dismissed skinner suit,at.
on appeal,the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed,fed.appx.per curiam,reiterating that an action by a prisoner for dna testing is not cognizable under and must instead be brought as a petition for writ of habeas corpus,at.on skinner petition we granted certiorari,and now reverse the fifth circuit judgment.
because this case was resolved on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,the question below was not whether skinner will ultimately prevail on his procedural due process claim,see scheuer rhodes,but whether his complaint was sufficient to cross the federal court threshold,see swierkiewicz sorema.skinner complaint is not a model of the careful drafter art,but under the federal rules of civil procedure,a complaint need not pin plaintiff claim for relief to a precise legal theory.rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure generally requires only a plausible short and plain statement of the plaintiff claim,not an exposition of his legal argument.see wright miller,federal practice procedure,ed.and supp.
skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph alleging that the state refusal to release the biological evidence for testing has deprived him of his liberty interests in utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of his conviction to obtain a pardon or reduction of his sentence.complaint,app.as earlier recounted,see supra,at,skinner had twice requested and failed to obtain dna testing under the only procedure then available to him.see complaint,app.at oral argument in this court,skinner counsel clarified the gist of skinner due process claim he does not challenge the prosecutor conduct or the decisions reached by the cca in applying article to his motions instead,he challenges,as denying him procedural due process,texas postconviction dna statute as construed by the texas courts.tr.of oral arg.see also,at texas courts,skinner counsel argued,have construed the statute to completely foreclose any prisoner who could have sought dna testing prior to trial,but did not,from seeking testing postconviction 
the merits of skinner complaint assailing the texas statute as authoritatively construed,and particularly the vitality of his claim in light of osborne,see supra,at unaddressed by the district court or the fifth circuit are not ripe for review.we take up here only the questions whether there is jurisdiction over skinner complaint,and whether the claim he presses is cognizable under.
respondent switzer asserts that skinner challenge is j urisdictionally b arred by what has come to be known as the doctrine.brief for respondent boldface deleted.in line with the courts below,we conclude that does not bar skinner suit.
as we explained in exxon mobil saudi basic industries,the doctrine has been applied by this court only twice,only in the two cases from which the doctrine takes its name first,rooker fidelity trust,then years later,district of columbia court of appeals feldman.both cases fit this pattern the losing party in state filed suit in a district court after the state proceedings ended,complaining of an injury caused by the judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.alleging jurisdiction,the plaintiffs in rooker and feldman asked the district court to overturn the injurious judgment.we held,in both cases,that the district courts lacked jurisdiction over such claims,for vests authority to review a state court judgment solely in this court.see exxon,at.
we observed in exxon that the doctrine had been construed by some federal courts to extend far beyond the contours of the rooker and feldman cases.at.emphasizing the narrow ground occupied by the doctrine,at,we clarified in exxon that is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by losers inviting district court review and rejection of the state court judgments.ibid.
skinner litigation,in light of exxon,encounters no shoal.if a federal plaintiff present s an independent claim,it is not an impediment to the exercise of federal jurisdiction that the same or a related question was earlier aired between the parties in state court,at quoting gash assocs.rosemont,first alteration in original see in re smith,fed.appx,sutton,concurring in part and dissenting in part a defendant federal challenge to the adequacy of procedures for postconviction dna testing is not within the limited grasp of.
as earlier noted,see supra,at,skinner does not challenge the adverse cca decisions themselves instead,he targets as unconstitutional the texas statute they authoritatively construed.as the court explained in feldman,at,and reiterated in exxon,at,a decision is not reviewable by lower federal courts,but a statute or rule governing the decision may be challenged in a federal action skinner federal case falls within the latter category.there was,therefore,no lack of jurisdiction over skinner federal suit 
when may a state prisoner,complaining of unconstitutional state action,pursue a civil rights claim under,and when is habeas corpus the prisoner sole remedy this court has several times considered that question.pathmarking here is heck humphrey.plaintiff in that litigation was a state prisoner serving time for manslaughter.he brought a action for damages,alleging that he had been unlawfully investigated,arrested,tried,and convicted.although the complaint in heck sought monetary damages only,not release from confinement,we ruled that the plaintiff could not proceed under.any award in his favor,we observed,would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.see,at.when a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,the court held,is not an available remedy.ibid.but if the plaintiff action,even if successful,will not demonstrate the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,the action should be allowed to proceed.ibid.
we summarized the relevant case law most recently in wilkinson dotson.that case involved prisoners who challenged the constitutionality of administrative decisions denying them parole eligibility.they could proceed under,the court held,for they sought no injunction ordering immediate or speedier release into the community,at,and a favorable judgment would not necessarily imply the invalidity of their conviction s or sentence s,ibid.quoting heck,at first alteration added.
measured against our prior holdings,skinner has properly invoked.success in his suit for dna testing would not necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.while test results might prove exculpatory,that outcome is hardly inevitable as earlier observed,see supra,at,results might prove inconclusive or they might further incriminate skinner.see nelson campbell,w e were careful in heck to stress the importance of the term necessarily.
respondent switzer nevertheless argues,in line with fifth circuit precedent,see kutzner,at,that skinner request for dna testing must be pursued,if at all,in an application for habeas corpus,not in a action.the dissent echoes switzer argument.see post,at.although skinner immediate plea is simply for an order requiring dna testing,his ultimate aim,switzer urges,is to use the test results as a platform for attacking his conviction.it suffices to point out that switzer has found no case,nor has the dissent,in which the court has recognized habeas as the sole remedy,or even an available one,where the relief sought would neither terminat e custody,accelerat e the future date of release from custody,nor reduc e the level of custody.dotson,at scalia,concurring.
respondent switzer and her amici forecast that a vast expansion of federal jurisdiction would ensue were we to hold that skinner complaint can be initiated under.see brief for national district attorneys association as amicus curiae.in particular,they predict a proliferation of federal civil actions seeking postconviction discovery of evidence and other relief inescapably associated with the central questions of guilt or punishment.at.these fears,shared by the dissent,post,at,are unwarranted 
in the circuits that currently allow claims for dna testing,see supra,at,no evidence tendered by switzer shows any litigation flood or even rainfall.the projected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding dna testing claims,for osborne has rejected substantive due process as a basis for such claims.see supra,at.
more generally,in the prison litigation reform act of plra,stat,congress has placed a series of controls on prisoner suits,constraints designed to prevent sportive filings in federal court.see,plra d adding to create new procedures and penalties for prisoner lawsuits under plra a adding b to require any prisoner proceeding in forma pauperis to pay the full filing fee out of a percentage of his prison trust account plra c adding f to require prisoners to pay the full amount of any cost assessed against them out of their prison trust account plra d adding g to revoke,with limited exception,in forma pauperis privileges for any prisoner who has filed three or more lawsuits that fail to state a claim,or are malicious or frivolous.see also britton,plra aims to discourage prisoners from filing claims that are unlikely to succeed,and statistics suggest that the act is having its intended effect 
nor do we see any cause for concern that today ruling will spill over to claims relying on brady maryland,indeed,switzer makes no such assertion.brady announced a constitutional requirement addressed first and foremost to the prosecution conduct pretrial.brady proscribes withholding evidence favorable to an accused and material to his guilt or to punishment.cone bell,slip,at.to establish that a brady violation undermines a conviction,a convicted defendant must make each of three showings the evidence at issue is favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching the state suppressed the evidence,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice ensued.strickler greene,see banks dretke.
unlike dna testing,which may yield exculpatory,incriminating,or inconclusive results,a brady claim,when successful postconviction,necessarily yields evidence undermining a conviction brady evidence is,by definition,always favorable to the defendant and material to his guilt or punishment.see strickler,at.and parties asserting brady violations postconviction generally do seek a judgment qualifying them for immediate or speedier release from imprisonment.see dotson,at.accordingly,brady claims have ranked within the traditional core of habeas corpus and outside the province of.see heck,at,claim that prosecutors and an investigator had knowingly destroyed evidence which was exculpatory in nature and could have proved petitioner innocence can not be maintained under amaker weiner,claim that sounds under brady maryland does indeed call into question the validity of the conviction beck muskogee police,same.
finally,switzer presents several reasons why skinner complaint should fail for lack of merit.those arguments,unaddressed by the courts below,are ripe for consideration on remand.m indful that we are a court of review,not of first view,cutter wilkinson,we confine this opinion to the matter on which we granted certiorari and express no opinion on the ultimate disposition of skinner federal action.
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the court of appeals for the fifth circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
henry skinner,petitioner lynn switzer,district attorney for the judicial district of texas 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice thomas,with whom justice kennedy and justice alito join,dissenting.
the court holds that skinner may bring under his procedural due process claim challenging texas postconviction dna statute.ante,at.i disagree i accept the majority characterization of the issue here as the question left open in district attorney office for third judicial dist.osborne,ante,at,where a prisoner challenged the constitutional adequacy of the access to dna evidence provided by alaska general postconviction relief statute,at slip,at.like osborne,skinner seeks to challenge state collateral review procedures i would now hold that these claims are not cognizable under.
the court has recognized that does not reach to the full extent of its broad language.preiser rodriguez,see,heck humphrey,should not expand opportunities for collateral attack but this court has never purported to fully circumscribe the boundaries of,at.rather,we have evaluated each claim as it has come before us,reasoning from first principles and our prior decisions.
in preiser rodriguez,the court began with the undisputed proposition that a state prisoner may not use to challeng e his underlying conviction and sentence on federal constitutional grounds.at.this included attacks on the trial procedures.see,at den ial of constitutional rights at trial from there,the court reasoned that immediate release from physical confinement or the shortening of its duration also can not be sought under,at see also wolff mcdonnell,refusing to allow a suit for restoration of credits edwards balisok,refusing to allow a procedural challenge to the process used to revoke credits.then,in heck humphrey,we addressed actions seeking damages,at.determining that such actions were not covered by preiser,we returned to the hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments,at,and concluded that a complaint must be dismissed where a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,at.most recently,in wilkinson dotson,we applied the principles from these prior decisions and found cognizable under a claim that sought to render invalid the state procedures used to deny parole eligibility and parole suitability.
we have not previously addressed whether due process challenges to state collateral review procedures may be brought under,and i would hold that they may not.challenges to all state procedures for reviewing the validity of a conviction should be treated the same as challenges to state trial procedures,which we have already recognized may not be brought under.moreover,allowing such challenges under would undermine congress strict limitations on federal review of state habeas decisions.if cognizable at all,skinner claim sounds in habeas corpus.
first,for the purposes of the due process clause,the process of law for the deprivation of liberty comprises all procedures including collateral review procedures that establish and review the validity of a conviction.this has long been recognized for direct appellate review 
and while the fourteenth amendment does not require that a state shall provide for an appellate review in criminal cases,it is perfectly obvious that where such an appeal is provided for,and the prisoner has had the benefit of it,the proceedings in the appellate tribunal are to be regarded as part of the process of law under which he is held in custody by the state,and to be considered in determining any question of alleged deprivation of his life or liberty contrary to the fourteenth amendment.frank mangum,citations omitted.
similarly,although a state is not required to provide procedures for postconviction review,it seems clear that when state collateral review procedures are provided for,they too are part of the process of law under which a prisoner is held in custody by the state.ibid.as this court has explained,when considering whether the state has provided all the process that is due in depriving an individual of life,liberty,or property,we must look at both pre and process.see cleveland bd.of ed.loudermill,t he existence of procedures is relevant to the necessary scope of pretermination procedures see also national private truck council,oklahoma tax comm n,mathews eldridge.there is no principled reason this court should refuse to allow suits to challenge part of this process the trial proceedings but bless the use of to challenge other parts.
collateral review procedures are,of course,not part of the criminal proceeding itself.pennsylvania finley.but like trial and direct appellate procedures,they concern the validity of the conviction.trial procedures are used to initially convict a prisoner appellate procedures review the validity of that conviction before it becomes final and collateral review procedures permit challenge to the conviction after it is final.for purposes of deciding which claims fall within the bounds of,i think it makes sense to treat similarly all constitutional challenges to procedures concerning the validity of a conviction.see heck,supra,at thomas,concurring i t is proper for the court to devise limitations aimed at ameliorating the conflict between habeas and,provided that it does so in a principled fashion 
second,principles of federalism and comity are at stake when federal courts review state collateral review procedures,just as when they review state trial procedures.osborne,at alito,concurring slip,at.an attack in federal court on any state judicial action concerning a state conviction must proceed with proper respect for state functions,because the federal courts are being asked to tr y the regularity of proceedings had in courts of coordinate jurisdiction.preiser,at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.
because of these concerns for comity,congress has strictly limited the procedures for federal habeas challenges to state convictions and state habeas decisions.congress requires that before a state prisoner may seek relief in federal court,he must exhaus t the remedies available in the courts of the state.b a.and state habeas determinations receive significant deference in subsequent federal habeas proceedings.d.these requirements ensure that the state courts have the first opportunity to correct any error with a state conviction and that their rulings receive due respect in subsequent federal challenges.
by bringing a procedural challenge under,skinner undermines these restrictions.for example,skinner has never presented
