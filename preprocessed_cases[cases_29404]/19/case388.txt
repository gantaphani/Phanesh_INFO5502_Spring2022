anthony bucci is a convicted drug trafficker,now incarcerated and serving a sentence of more than eighteen years.he appeals the district court october,denial of his petition,which claimed ineffective assistance of counsel by his trial counsel because the petition does not meet the requirements that congress set out for a second or successive petition to be heard,we affirm the denial.
the facts underlying bucci conviction are detailed in previous published opinions.see bucci united states,cir united states bucci,cir.
on april,bucci was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to distribute,and to possess with intent to distribute,cocaine possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.bucci was sentenced to months in prison,of which months were for the drug charges and a consecutive term of months was for the firearm charge this court affirmed on direct appeal.bucci,at.
on may,bucci filed a first petition,arguing that there had been an improper courtroom closure in violation of the sixth amendment,prosecutorial misconduct,and ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to produce a promised witness at trial and for failure to object to the consecutive sentence.the district court denied his petition.bucci united states,d.this court affirmed the denial of bucci petition.bucci,at.
on june,bucci filed a second motion captioned as a petition,arguing that new testimony elicited from his trial counsel during his habeas proceedings showed that bucci first petition had been improperly denied.the district court denied the motion.the district court suggested that the filing should actually have been a motion for relief from judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b because it attacked the outcome of the prior proceeding rather than the validity of the conviction.it held that the motion did not meet the standards required of either a rule b motion or a second or successive petition.we summarily affirmed.bucci united states,cir.
the petition at issue in this appeal was filed on october.bucci bases his petition on what he claims is newly discovered evidence that his trial counsel failed to pursue a plea bargain despite bucci request that he do so 
the precise facts alleged in support of the claim are not necessary to this opinion.it suffices that bucci claims to have asked his trial counsel multiple times to engage in plea negotiations and that trial counsel reported to him that he did so but without success.years later,in,trial counsel allegedly admitted that he did not actually attempt plea negotiations because he felt the effort not worthwhile.bucci claims that this constituted a violation of his sixth amendment right to counsel.
on october,the day after the petition was filed,the district court sua sponte denied the petition on various grounds,including untimeliness.the district court also issued a certificate of appealability on bucci claims.this appeal followed.
a federal prisoner seeking to file a second or successive petition must first obtain authorization from the court of appeals to do so.b a,h see also felker turpin,d trenkler united states,cir.such authorization is available only when the second or successive petition is based either on newly discovered evidence that would establish innocence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive on collateral review by the supreme court.h.
we have interpreted this provision as stripping the district court of jurisdiction over a second or successive habeas petition unless and until the court of appeals has decreed that it may go forward.trenkler,at quoting pratt united states,cir.when faced with a second or successive petition that has not been authorized by the court of appeals,a district court must either dismiss the petition or transfer it to the court of appeals.id.at.
the petition here is plainly a second or successive petition.it was the third motion filed by bucci that was captioned as a petition.even if the second motion had been in substance a rule b motion rather than a petition,the current petition would still be bucci second petition.because bucci never received authorization from the court of appeals to file the petition,the district court did not have jurisdiction,and the district court was required to deny or transfer the petition 
we have discretion to construe an appeal of a district court denial of an unauthorized petition as an application to us for authorization to file.united states barrett,cir pratt,at.construing this appeal as an application for authorization to file a second or successive petition,we find that neither h requirement is met and the attempt fails.
there is no claim made,nor could one be honestly made,that the new evidence would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense.h.bucci only offers evidence to show,at most,ineffective assistance of counsel as to an effort at plea bargaining.he does not make a claim of innocence.
nor does bucci claim involve the retroactive application of a new rule of constitutional law.id.h.bucci cites a number of supreme court cases to support the point that plea negotiation is a critical phase of a criminal proceeding that falls under the sixth amendment right to counsel.missouri frye,d lafler cooper,d padilla kentucky,d.but the notion that plea bargaining falls within the scope of the sixth amendment right to counsel was not a new rule in those cases.see,hill lockhart,d recognizing right to effective assistance of counsel during plea process white maryland,d per curiam same p√°gan san miguel united states,cir per curiam holding that frye and lafler did not establish new rules of constitutional law.this appeal,even if understood as an application for authorization to file a second or successive petition,must be denied.
bucci attempts to avoid the gatekeeping provisions in h by claiming that this is not a second or successive petition at all,but rather one that should be considered an initial petition.he relies on the notion that n ot every literally second or successive petition is second or successive for purposes of aedpa the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of.sustache rivera united states,cir see also slack mcdaniel,describing the phrase second or successive petition as a term of art.to be sure,courts have identified a number of situations in which a petition is considered a first petition,not a second or successive one.see,slack,at when prior petition was not adjudicated on its merits and dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies stewart martinez villareal,d when claim was previously dismissed for being premature raineri united states,cir when a district court,acting sua sponte,converts a motion filed under some other statute or rule into a section petition without notice and an opportunity to be heard.
bucci argues that similarly,we should forgo a literal reading of second or successive whenever a petitioner arguably raises a claim that could not have been raised in a prior habeas petition.we have already rejected such reasoning.
such a narrow reading of second or successive would run counter to the clear intent of congress that stricter standards apply under aedpa and that the process be streamlined.sustache rivera,at quoting barrett,at.through,as amended by aedpa,congress recognized that cases might arise where,through no fault of the defendant,a ground for collateral attack was unavailable at the time of the first motion.jamison united states,cir.congress provided a second opportunity for collateral relief for two kinds of petitions those that bring forth new evidence proving innocence and those that rely on new and retroactively applicable constitutional rules.id.citing h.it is implicit in this scheme that collateral attack claims not within the two categories are meant to be barred.id.
to expand second or successive petitions beyond that,as bucci requests,would undercut congressional intent.felker,at recognizing that judgments about the proper scope of the writ are normally for congress to make quoting lonchar thomas,
