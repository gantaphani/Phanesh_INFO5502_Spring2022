michael crooker was indicted,tried and convicted for transporting a firearm in interstate commerce as a convicted felon,g,and sentenced to months imprisonment.the firearm was a device designed to muffle the sound of an airgun.the decisive issue on this appeal is whether such a silencer could,on the facts of this case,qualify as a firearm within the meaning of the statutory definition.id.a c.the raw facts are essentially undisputed.
in april,had previously been convicted of a engaged in offering chemicals for sale,and a potential buyer in wisconsin notified the postal inspection service of a suspicious statement sent to the buyer by crooker.the buyer had asked for a list of chemicals and inquired how they would be packaged.crooker responded by stating 
most are repackaged.in fact,most come that way to me.of course i combine shipping costs and i do fart around with regulations either.i usually just send them parcel post even things like nitric acid that i just sold.
an investigation led authorities to inspect a package deposited by crooker at a massachusetts post office for interstate shipment on june.the package proved to contain a large caliber airgun and a cylinder made of black metal with a hole running through it,threading that allowed attachment to the muzzle of the airgun and baffles inside further inquiry revealed that the device had been made for crooker by another individual.
the government arranged a controlled delivery of the package to its recipient in ohio,and that day crooker was arrested and his apartment searched.the search revealed explosives and chemicals which resulted in a separate indictment of crooker.also seized were books and other materials evidencing crooker interest in firearms and airguns and a laptop containing relevant messages.
a separate search of crooker brother residence resulted in the seizure of a number of firearms and an article titled federal law definition of a silencer that bore a name mgmike used by crooker.the article noted that it might be argued that an airgun silencer,if it could be put to use on a powder burning firearm might be a silencer under federal law the article argued that such a device would not be a silencer because not intended for firearm use even though it could probably be adapted for use as a silencer on a powder burner.
in proceedings,crooker sought to suppress the airgun and airgun silencer as products of an unlawful search,but the district court denied the several motions addressed to the searches.although the lawfulness of the searches,as well as crooker request for suppression of letters he sent while in detention,are extensively briefed on this appeal,we need not describe these issues in detail,or certain other claims made by crooker as to the admission of evidence and the length of his sentence,because a more fundamental flaw exists in the government case.
at trial,the government offered evidence as to the seizure of the airgun device,evidence of crooker knowledge of firearms and technical skill,the above quoted article referring to the possibility of adaptation of the airgun silencer for use on a powder bearing firearm,special of a government expert who had tested the cylindrical device seized from the package.there was other evidence of crooker interest in silencers and their lawfulness,but nothing that alters the thrust of the government case.
the government expert testified that the seized device could be used to muffle the sound of an ordinary firearm in various ways,including the holding of the device against the barrel of the firearm with one hand so that the bullet would pass through the device but the witness admitted that this would be quite dangerous,and his own test was conducted only by threading an adapter onto both the barrel of an ordinary gun and the silencer to connect the two implements,because the silencer did not fit directly to the testing pistol.
the adapter was described as one of a collection taken from the witness office in the bureau of alcohol,tobacco and firearms in the department of the treasury.with the adapter,the sound of the weapon was significantly reduced.the witness suggested a makeshift adapter could be assembled from hardware store materials,but did not say he had ever tried it or seen it done.the government does not press on appeal any suggestion that the device could realistically be used to silence a firearm unless an adapter were used.
the federal statute under which crooker was charged defines firearm in pertinent part as a weapon that expels a projectile by the action of an explosive,a a,and this does not include an air rifle such as that in crooker package which operates by compressed air.see atf paintball gun,which uses compressed air to expel a projectile,is not a firearm under the statute.but under the statute firearm includes any firearm muffler or firearm silencer,a c,defined as follows 
the terms firearm silencer and firearm muffler mean any device for silencing,muffling,or diminishing the report of a portable firearm,including any combination of parts,designed or redesigned,and intended for use in assembling or fabricating a firearm silencer or firearm muffler,and any part intended only for use in such assembly or fabrication.
in the course of developing jury instructions and considering crooker motion for judgment of acquittal,the construction of this provision was a central issue and the court ultimately rejected crooker argument that the statute included only a device designed or intended to be used with a firearm,concluding instead that the word for in the statute meant capable of silencing a firearm.in fact,the judge instruction effectively ruled out crooker reading of the statute 
you may consider evidence of intent in determining whether the government has proved knowledge.keep in mind,however,that the government need not prove crooker or anyone else actually ever used exhibit as a firearm silencer or ever intended it to be used as a firearm silencer.
in the ordinary criminal case,the device charged as a silencer is one manufactured for use with a firearm and is easily connected,by threading one onto the other and the possessor knows perfectly well the intended function of the device,united states hall,cir,cert.denied.but where,as here,the device was created for a different silence an requires some modification or adaptation to fit a firearm,problems arise in two different dimensions its capability for use as a silencer and,separately,the defendant knowledge,purpose or both with respect to the device.
if the statute said that a device capable of being used as a silencer was a firearm prohibited to a felon,there would be problems at least of degree in determining what capable meant as to a device usable only with an adapter apparently,a potato or a soda bottle may,with varying efficacy and varying risk,be used to muffle a firearm shot.but taking the word capable in the abstract,a jury could rationally conclude from the evidence admitted at trial,including the government expert testimony,that crooker device fitted with an adapter would be objectively capable of functioning as a silencer for a firearm.
and,given crooker demonstrated expertise and also documents showing that he knew that airgun silencers could in some instances be so adapted,the jury could rationally infer that he knew that an more than a properly constructed cylinder adjusted for size and with threading at each be built that would allow this device to muffle or silence a firearm.
we conclude,however,that the statute by its terms requires something more than a potential for adaptation and knowledge of it.the statute does not refer either to capability or adaptation it speaks of a device for silencing or muffling.the ordinary connotation of the word is one of purpose.see the random house dictionary of the english language ed.unabr providing a first definition of for as with the object or purpose of.the government does not argue that the evidence proved that either crooker or the maker of the airgun silencer intended that it be used to silence a firearm,but rather that for does not entail purpose but only knowledge of capability.
to this end,the gove
