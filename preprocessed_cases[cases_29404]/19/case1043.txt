before us are appeals by four defendants who were found guilty on firearms charges and,in one case,a drug charge,all of which stemmed from an undercover investigation into a weapons ring in puerto rico.the four defendants are pedro molina,natanael de la de la paz,victor sanjurjo,and waldemar torres.each defendant challenges his conviction on several grounds.because several defendants challenge the sufficiency of evidence,we recite the facts as a reasonable jury could have found them.see united states baltas,cir,cert.denied.
in august,officer julio ginés of the puerto rico police department was engaged in an undercover investigation of a organization in arecibo,puerto rico.sanjurjo,who was a municipal police officer,told ginés during their second meeting that he knew some policemen who were engaged in illegal business.later,sanjurjo introduced ginés to molina,who was also a municipal police officer,and told molina that ginés was interested in acquiring firearms.a number of arms transactions then followed.
on october,ginés met with molina,de la paz,and molina wife in a shopping mall parking lot in san juan,where ginés paid to them for a caliber pistol with an obliterated serial number and two magazines loaded with bullets.on october,ginés again met molina in a parking lot seeking to purchase an rifle from another supplier named nelson font ginés brought sanjurjo along with him and paid sanjurjo for protection.font then called to say that he did not have the,but offered to sell three pistols instead,and sent defendant torres with the guns.ginés bought one pistol from torres for.
thereafter,font arranged for many further firearms transactions with ginés.between november and march,ginés bought two rifles,an rifle,an h k rifle,an sks rifle,several pistols including a glock pistol with a laser sight,and ammunition in various forms.in a final transaction on march,font arranged to sell ginés an automatic pistol and cocaine ginés testified that font told him that both items belonged to torres.at font house,font sent another man to pick up the gun and drugs from torres,and ginés then paid for the automatic glock pistol and of a kilogram of cocaine.
the defendants,font,and several other individuals allegedly involved in the including molina wife were indicted based on these transactions.the four defendants who now appeal went to trial,and the jury returned guilty verdicts against all four

the district court sentenced sanjurjo to months de la paz to months molina to months and torres to months,comprising months on the count of carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime and concurrent terms of months on the other counts running consecutive to the sentence.the defendants now appeal,raising a variety of different challenges.
sanjurjo.sanjurjo first argues the district court should have granted his rule requests to sever his trial.we review a district court denial of a motion to sever for manifest abuse of discretion,united states deluca,cir,cert.denied,and the presumption and common practice favor trying together defendants who are charged with crimes arising out of a common core of facts,united states,cir.
sanjurjo main argument is that he was charged with only a minor role in the october transaction and that the jury assessment of whether he participated would be contaminated by the extensive other evidence about the other defendants and the conspiracy.such a threat can be ground for severance,zafiro united states,but it has to be based on a serious risk of prejudice,united states deleon,cir,cert.denied.
sanjurjo played an intermediary role prior to the forming of the conspiracy,and was on an aiding and abetting serving as a bodyguard in the second transaction.although the subsequent gun dealings were substantial and sanjurjo seemingly played no further role beyond his initial involvement,there was no reason for the jury to be confused about his role.nor were the subsequent transactions likely to inflame or to confuse a jury.
the district court not only instructed the jury generally that it had to consider the charges and evidence against each defendant separately,but also emphasized that sanjurjo himself was not charged with conspiracy and that the jury therefore must carefully evaluate the evidence as to this defendant a partial safeguard against possible spillover.deleon,at.the jury,we note,acquitted molina wife on two of the three charges against her.see united states boylan,cir,cert.denied,
sanjurjo also argues that his motions for acquittal based on lack of sufficient evidence should have been granted.we review sufficiency claims de novo,united states,cir,but we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution along with all plausible inferences drawn therefrom,and ask if no rational jury applying a reasonable doubt standard could have found the defendant guilty,baltas,at.
the aiding and abetting conviction was based on ginés testimony that at the october transaction sanjurjo had been paid to serve as a bodyguard and that sanjurjo stayed inside ginés car throughout this transaction.sanjurjo says that this amounts to a conviction for mere presence,but a bodyguard presence can by itself facilitate a transaction,united states martinez,cir the mere presence concept aims to protect innocent bystanders,see united states ortiz,cir,cert.denied.sanjurjo also denies knowing that guns were to be sold,but the jury was free to credit ginés testimony that he had discussed with sanjurjo in advance the plan to buy an.
de la paz.de la paz first claims that his case should have been severed given his limited connection to the succession of sales,but ginés testified that de la paz was the one who actually sold ginés the gun on october.others were also charged in the october transaction,and it made sense to try de la paz with them,absent a significant risk of prejudice which has not been demonstrated.de la paz hints that joinder prejudiced him by depriving him of testimony from molina and molina wife,see note,above,but the argument was not made in the district court and is not seriously developed on appeal.
de la paz also argues that jury selection violated the sixth amendment because,by statute,individuals must understand and be literate in english to serve on a federal jury and many puerto ricans can not meet that requirement.see b.apart from de la paz failure to preserve the claim,this court has repeatedly rejected this challenge to the english proficiency requirement,united states,cir,cert.denied,decisions which control here,united states,cir.
finally,de la paz says that the evidence was insufficient because the only evidence against him was the testimony of ginés,who met de la paz only once,in a interaction in the late afternoon,inside a vehicle.but testimony from one witness can support conviction,united states,f d,cir,and de la paz gives us no serious reason to doubt ginés testimony.furthermore,phone records show calls between de la paz and molina that corroborate ginés account of de la paz involvement.
molina.molina,in the stronger of two challenges,argues that certain remarks the prosecutor made during the government rebuttal closing arguments were improper and were so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial.specifically,molina complains about the following five statements the prosecutor made listed in the order in which they were said 
this is a heckler koch assault rifle.look at the size of that barrel.
victor sanjurjo sold his badge out.he sold it out.he put a tape over protect and serve and he decided he was going to serve his only sic interest for a hundred bucks.he sold himself out.he compromised the very principles he was hired to represent for a hundred bucks.
it a fully automatic glock,ladies and gentlemen.this will shoot in automatic capacity.the evidence presented in court had been that you pull the trigger once and it will empty the,or faster.
first of all,ask yourselves what are two morovis police officers doing in the first place at marshalls they were protecting and serving society.they were protecting and serving themselves.and who protects citizens from them 
your chance today right now is to do justice,and justice is nothing more than on the highway there comes an intersection between the truth and the ability to do something about it.
objections timely made to a prosecutor comments are reviewed de novo,united states,cir,under accepted standards unpreserved objections are reviewed for plain error,united states king,cir,cert.denied,requiring clear error,a reasonable likelihood of a different result,and something akin to a miscarriage of justice,united states olano.
here,the objections came not from molina counsel,but rather from counsel for his wife.but the government does not raise this point,possibly because sometimes a trial judge allows an objection by one defendant to apply to all defendants.see united states,cir,cert.denied sub nom.united states.defense counsel lodged immediate objections to the first and last comments quoted above,but not the others,and our review reflects the standards described above.
it is improper to needlessly arouse the emotions of the jury,and that misconduct occurs when a prosecutor interject s issues having no bearing on the defendant guilt or innocence and improperly appeal s to the jury to act in ways other than as dispassionate arbiters of the facts,at internal quotation marks omitted.by this test,the first comment was improper the fearsomeness of the weapon had nothing to do with molina guilt or innocence and,by contrast,had some capacity to frighten the jury and to that fear as anger against the defendant.
further,the prosecutor apparently accentuated the impression.molina says that during the challenged remark about the size of that barrel,the prosecutor threw the gun against the table and pointed the gun at the jury,and the transcript of the relevant bench conference supports this account.the transcript also confirms that the judge told the prosecutor not to repeat this conduct and that the prosecutor promised to refrain.so we conclude that the prosecutor conduct was improper,and the question is whether it was harmful.
here,it was the manner of presenting the evidence and not the evidence that was improper.the rifle itself was an exhibit and could be shown to the jury even though the jury might react negatively to it.amid the array of weaponry discussed and offered in evidence at the trial,a reference to the size of the barrel of one of them,even a vivid and improper demonstration of its size,can not have created any significant risk of altering the outcome in this case,united states,cir,because the case against molina was comparatively strong and the defense was almost.
although the prosecution case rested primarily on the testimony of ginés,he was a police officer,not a whose testimony was purchased in a plea bargain,and molina gives no reason why the jury should have distrusted ginés detailed testimony.molina had more than one encounter with ginés,so mistaken identity was hardly likely.the government also offered corroborative evidence,such as the firearms,phone records of calls to and from molina at the critical times,and a videotape of the october transaction in which ginés identified molina when it was played for the jury.
molina defense offered little beyond a naked denial through presented no he had engaged in gun dealing.the case is in sharp contrast to where more menacing comments about weaponry were found to be improper and,in addition,the likelihood of a different outcome absent the prejudicial remarks was greatly heightened by the quite unusual presence of a forceful and well developed defense supported by a number of witnesses.at boudin,concurring.
the fifth statement,to which objection is also taken,is troubling,but less so.the do your duty rhetoric,depending on wording and context,can be used to convey the idea to the jury that their job is to convict,united states,cir exhortation to do your duty as jurors improper.the government does not defend the improper remark,but it was brief,entirely abstract,and by no means the worst of its genre.even by preserved error standards,see note,above,the error was harmless.
all three of the comments that were not objected to are also improper.the third comment,about the glock automatic,is improper for the same reason as the first and the image offered by language,along with the prosecutor juvenile sound effects,was at least as bad.but under olano,plain error requires a reasonable likelihood that the result would have been different without the challenged comments,and comparing the government case with molina defense,no such probability is even arguably established.
the same considerations dispose of the second and fourth comments,which were not the subject of objections.both focused on the treachery of a renegade police officer who betrays his oath to protect the public but the defendants were not on trial for dereliction of duty and the prosecutor had no business inviting the jury to focus on this aspect of their wrongdoing.yet the more vivid remark was directed at another defendant and neither,even in combination with the other remarks,meets the plain error standard for reversal.
the puerto rico attorney office has developed an unenviable reputation for the excesses of its prosecutors in closing arguments,at,at.this case is by no means the worst,but,given that the prosecutor continued his improprieties after a warning from the judge at sidebar,we think this prosecutor behavior was especially deplorable.the failure of his office properly to train and to discipline its prosecutors is even more troubling.the matter will be raised by appropriate means with the department of justice.united states hasting.
molina also asks for a new trial because the government allegedly failed to disclose impeachment evidence.see,giglio united states,brady maryland.molina complains that the government failed to disclose that one of ginés supervisors was the target of a federal grand jury investigation the supervisor was apparently indicted for fabricating evidence and that several administrative complaints had been made against another of ginés supervisors.
whether any information was suppressed is far from clear.the first supervisor was indicted four months after molina trial,and it is uncertain whether he was under investigation at the time of trial.information about the other supervisor was submitted by the government for in camera review,and the district court then determined that these files did not need to be disclosed.
in any case,the information has not been not shown to be material.it had nothing to do with ginés or any aspect of his testimony,and could not be used to impeach ginés credibility.in fact,there is no indication that either supervisor played a significant role in this investigation.thus,there was no abuse of discretion in denying the motion for a new trial,the applicable standard in this case.see united states brandao,cir.
