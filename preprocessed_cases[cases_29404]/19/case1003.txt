james bunchan was convicted by a jury for use of a facility of interstate commerce in the commission of and solicitation to commit a crime of violence.the case arose from bunchan efforts to hire someone to kill the people whom he expected to testify against him in a pending federal fraud prosecution.he now appeals his convictions and sentence,arguing that the district court constructively amended the indictment when it instructed the jury as to the solicitation offense,improperly instructed the jury on nullification,and imposed an unreasonable sentence of months.we reject bunchan claims and affirm the district court.
facts and background 
this appeal follows a conviction,and thus we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states mercado,cir.
on november,bunchan was arrested for and later charged with forty counts of conspiracy,mail fraud,and money laundering for his part in a pyramid scheme that stole nearly million from more than five hundred people,mostly of cambodian descent the fraud case.in may,while detained at the plymouth county correctional facility awaiting trial,bunchan asked david augustin,a fellow inmate,whether he knew of anyone whom bunchan could hire to murder one of the primary witnesses who was to testify for the government.augustin advised the fbi of bunchan overture and subsequently became a cooperating witness.at the behest of the fbi,augustin continued to discuss with bunchan the plot.during their conversations,two of which were audio and video recorded,bunchan wrote out various lists of the people he sought to have killed.he also discussed the possibility of having assistant attorney jack pirozzolo,the prosecutor in bunchan fraud case,murdered.the fbi provided augustin with the name,phone number,and address of an undercover police officer,jamal,who posed as a hit man for the operation,and augustin relayed jamal contact information to bunchan.
in july,bunchan wrote a letter to jamal listing the twelve individuals to be murdered.the letter included the victims names,their priority,their places of residence,and the amount of money bunchan was willing to pay for the murder of each bunchan sealed the envelope and placed it in the prison outgoing mail.the fbi received the letter and conducted dna and handwriting analysis that positively identified bunchan as the author.it later alerted bunchan that it was aware of the scheme and warned him to stop pursuing further action.
in march,a grand jury returned an indictment against bunchan for use of a facility of interstate commerce in commission of in violation of,and solicitation of a crime of violence in violation of.
thereafter,bunchan was tried on the forty charges in his fraud case.he was convicted of most of the offenses and sentenced to a term of months imprisonment.in arriving at the sentence,the district court considered bunchan conduct as it related to the charges then pending.this court upheld the convictions and sentence on appeal.united states bunchan,cir.
trial on the charges commenced on april,and the jury found bunchan guilty on both counts.the district court sentenced bunchan to months imprisonment,applying an upward departure of seven months pursuant to united states sentencing guideline.the district court ordered the sentence to run consecutively to the fraud sentence,except that its first sixty months would run concurrently,to reflect the fraud sentence accounting for the conduct.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
bunchan argues for a reversal of his convictions because the district court improperly instructed the jury as to the elements of the solicitation offense,thereby constructively amending the indictment and the district court improperly instructed the jury as to its power to nullify.he also asserts that even if his convictions are upheld,the court should remand for resentencing because his sentence is unreasonable.we review each of these arguments in turn.
constructive amendment claim 
a constructive amendment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered,either literally or in effect,by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them.united states celestin,cir quotations and citations omitted.a primary objective of the rule against constructive amendments is to ensure that the defendant has notice of the charges against him.united states,cir.plain error review applies to an unpreserved claim such as this,requiring an error that is plain that affected the defendant substantial rights and that also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states brandao,cir see also united states olano.
bunchan argues that the district court constructively amended the indictment when it instructed the jury on the charge of solicitation to commit a crime of violence.he claims that the district court improperly instructed the jury that he was charged with obstruction of justice,which was not within the indictment nor an element of the solicitation offense.further,because there are many obstruction of justice offenses,not all of which include an element of physical force,the instruction lowered the government burden and created jury confusion.
the district court detailed the two elements of the 
solicitation offense to the jury,as follows 
first,that bunchan solicited,commanded,induced,or otherwise tried to persuade another person to commit,what called,a federal felony.
now,what involved here is a little bit more complex,in the sense that the federal felony here is essentially obstruction of justice,and the means of obstruction of justice that the government says were involved here was to kill witnesses.
it not directly murder.it obstruction of justice,but the means that are undertaken are to commit murder of those witnesses,so that they would be able to testify in the federal federal bunchan was then facing.
the second element the government must prove is that the defendant actions strongly indicated that he intended the other person to commit the crime of obstruction of justice by murder 
well,i tell you,as a matter of law,that obstruction of justice by murder has,as part of its use or attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of the witnesses in this case or the victims in this case.
these instructions did not charge bunchan with obstruction of justice.rather,they reviewed correctly the two elements of the charged solicitation offense that the defendant had the intent for another to commit a felony that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against a person or property and that under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent,the defendant solicited,commanded,induced,or otherwise endeavored to persuade the other person to commit the felony.see.to state the obvious,both elements necessarily include reference to an underlying violent felony.here,that felony was obstruction of justice by means of killing witnesses who were to testify in bunchan fraud case.
the district court description of the underlying murdering of consistent with that alleged in the indictment,demonstrating that bunchan had notice.the indictment specifically charged bunchan with solicitation of another to kill victims and witnesses to prevent their attendance or testimony in an official proceeding,here a pending federal trial on fraud charges against the defendant,in violation of a a.
bunchan is correct that the indictment did not use the term obstruction of justice.the indictment did,however,both reference and incorporate,the crime of tampering with a witness,victim,or an informant.that section of the united states code is part of the obstruction of justice chapter and criminalizes the murder or attempted murder of another with intent to prevent the attendance or testimony of any person in an official proceeding.a a.the district court reference to obstruction of justice by means of killing witnesses,then,did not amend the elucidated it.see united states hernandez,cir.
further,the district court instructions did not lower the government burden or create jury confusion as to which obstruction of ju
