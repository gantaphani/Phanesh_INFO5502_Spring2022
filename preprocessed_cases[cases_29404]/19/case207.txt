in jackson virginia,we held that a state prisoner is entitled to habeas corpus relief if a federal judge finds that upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.at.a nevada jury convicted respondent of rape the evidence presented included dna evidence matching respondent dna profile.nevertheless,relying upon a report prepared by a dna expert over years after the trial,the federal district court applied the jackson standard and granted the writ.a divided court of appeals affirmed.brown farwell.we granted certiorari to consider whether those courts misapplied jackson.because the trial record includes both the dna evidence and other convincing evidence of guilt,we conclude that they clearly did.
around on january,jane doe was brutally raped in the bedroom of her trailer.respondent troy brown was convicted of the crime.during and since his trial,respondent has steadfastly maintained his innocence he was,however,admittedly intoxicated when the crime occurred,and after he awoke on the following morning he told a friend he wished that he could remember what did go on or what went on.app.
troy and his brother travis resided near jane doe in the same trailer park.their brother trent and his wife raquel lived in the park as well,in a trailer across the street from jane doe.both troy and trent were acquainted with jane doe family troy had visited jane doe trailer several times.jane did not know travis.the evening of the attack,jane mother,pam,took jane to raquel and trent trailer to babysit while the three adults went out for about an hour.raquel and trent returned at about and took jane home at about pam stayed out and ended up drinking and playing pool with troy at a nearby bar called the peacock lounge.troy knew that jane and her sister were home alone because he answered the phone at the bar when jane called for her mother earlier that evening.
troy consumed at least shots of vodka followed by beer chasers,and was so drunk that he vomited on himself while he was walking home after leaving the peacock at about jane called her mother to report the rape at approximately although it would have taken a sober man less than minutes to walk home,troy did not arrive at his trailer until about.he was wearing dark jeans,a cowboy hat,a black satin jacket,and boots.two witnesses saw a man dressed in dark jeans,a cowboy hat,and a black satin jacket stumbling in the road between the two trailers shortly after 
the bedroom where the rape occurred was dark,and jane was unable to conclusively identify her assailant.when asked whom he reminded her of,she mentioned both troy and his brother trent.several days after the rape,she identified a man she saw on television troy as her assailant but then stated that the man who had sent flowers attacked her.it was trent and raquel who had sent her flowers,not troy.she was unable to identify troy as her assailant out of a photo lineup,and she could not identify her assailant at trial.the night of the rape,however,she said her attacker was wearing dark jeans,a black jacket with a zipper,boots,and a watch.she also vividly remembered that the man stunk real,real bad of cologne,or some beer or puke or something.at.
some evidence besides jane inconsistent identification did not inculpate troy.jane testified that she thought she had bitten her assailant,but troy did not have any bite marks on his hands when examined by a police officer approximately four hours after the attack.jane stated that her assailant jacket had a zipper troy did not and that he wore a watch troy claimed he did not.additionally,there was conflicting testimony as to when troy left the peacock and when pam received jane call reporting the rape.the witnesses who saw a man stumbling between the two trailers reported a bright green logo on the back of the jacket,but troy jacket had a yellow and orange logo.finally,because jane thought she had left a night light on when she went to bed,the police suspected the assailant had turned off the light.the only usable fingerprint taken from the light did not match troy and the police did not find troy fingerprints in the trailer.
other physical evidence,however,pointed to troy.the police recovered semen from jane underwear and from the rape kit.the state expert,renee romero,tested the former and determined that the dna matched troy and that the probability another person from the general population would share the same dna the random match probability was only in.troy counsel did not call his own dna expert at trial,although he consulted with an expert in advance who found no problems with romero test procedures.at some time before sentencing,troy family had additional dna testing done.that testing showed semen taken from the rape kit matched troy dna,with a random match probability of in.
the jury found troy guilty of sexual assault and sentenced him to life with the possibility of parole after years on direct appeal,the nevada supreme court considered troy claim that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence,analyzing whether the jury,acting reasonably,could have been convinced of troy guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.brown nevada,per curiam.the court rejected the claim,summarizing the evidence of guilt as follows 
testimony indicated that troy left the bar around,that troy lived relatively close to the bar,and that troy lived very close to jane doe.troy had enough time to get from the bar to jane doe house and to assault jane doe before she made the telephone call to her mother at approximately.while jane doe could not identify her assailant,her description of his clothing was similar to what troy was wearing she also said that her assailant smelled like beer or vomit and testimony indicated that troy had been drinking beer and had vomited several times that night.furthermore,testimony indicated that troy got home at approximately,which gave him enough time to assault jane doe.additionally,witnesses testified that they saw someone resembling troy in a black jacket and black hat stumbling in the road near jane doe house at troy also washed his pants and shirt when he got home,arguably to remove the blood evidence from his clothes.finally,the dna evidence indicated that semen collected from jane doe underwear matched troy and that only in other people had matching dna the second dna test indicated that in people had matching dna.at.
respondent also argued on appeal that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a pretrial hearing to determine whether the dna evidence was reliable.the court found respondent had not raised this issue in the trial court and concluded there was no plain error in the trial court failure to conduct a hearing,at,at.
in,respondent sought state postconviction relief,claiming,inter alia,that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the admission of the dna evidence.he argued that there were a number of foundational problems with the dna evidence,and that if trial counsel had objected,the evidence would have been excluded or at least its importance diminished.he noted that because trial counsel totally failed to challenge the dna evidence in the case,counsel failed to preserve valid issues for appeal.app.the state postconviction court denied relief,at,and the nevada supreme court affirmed,at.
respondent thereafter filed this federal habeas petition,claiming there was insufficient evidence to convict him on the sexual assault charges and that the nevada supreme court rejection of his claim was both contrary to,and an unreasonable application of,jackson.he did not bring a typical jackson claim,however.rather than argue that the totality of the evidence admitted against him at trial was constitutionally insufficient,he argued that some of the evidence should be excluded from the jackson analysis.in particular,he argued that romero testimony related to the dna evidence was inaccurate and unreliable in two primary respects romero mischaracterized the random match probability and misstated the probability of a dna match among his brothers.absent that testimony,he contended,there was insufficient evidence to convict him.
in support of his claim regarding the accuracy of romero testimony,respondent submitted a report prepared by laurence mueller,a professor in ecology and evolutionary biology mueller report.the district court supplemented the record with the mueller report,even though it was not presented to any state court,because the thesis of the report was argued during.brown farwell,wl.
relying upon the mueller report,the district court set aside the unreliable dna testimony and held that without the dna evidence a reasonable doubt would exist in the mind of any rational trier of fact.at.the court granted respondent habeas relief on his jackson claim 
the ninth circuit affirmed.the court held the nevada supreme court had unreasonably applied jackson,at see d.the court of appeals first reasoned the admission of romero unreliable and misleading testimony violated troy due process rights,so the district court was correct to exclude it,at.it then weighed the sufficiency of the remaining evidence,including the district court catalogu e of the numerous inconsistencies that would raise a reasonable doubt as to troy guilt in the mind of any rational juror.ibid.in light of the stark conflicts in the evidence and the state concession that there was insufficient evidence absent the dna evidence,the court held it was objectively unreasonable for the nevada supreme court to reject respondent claim,at.
we granted certiorari,to consider two questions the proper standard of review for a jackson claim on federal habeas,and whether such a claim may rely upon evidence outside the trial record that goes to the reliability of trial evidence.
respondent claim has now crystallized into a claim about the import of two specific inaccuracies in the testimony related to the dna evidence,as indicated by the mueller report.the mueller report does not challenge romero qualifications as an expert or the validity of any of the tests that she performed.mueller instead contends that romero committed the prosecutor fallacy and that she underestimated the probability of a dna match between respondent and one of his brothers.
the prosecutor fallacy is the assumption that the random match probability is the same as the probability that the defendant was not the source of the dna sample.see nat.research council,comm.on dna forensic science,the evaluation of forensic dna evidence let p equal the probability of a match,given the evidence genotype.the fallacy is to say that p is also the probability that the dna at the crime scene came from someone other than the defendant in other words,if a juror is told the probability a member of the general population would share the same dna is in random match probability,and he takes that to mean there is only a in chance that someone other than the defendant is the source of the dna found at the crime scene source probability,then he has succumbed to the prosecutor fallacy.it is further error to equate source probability with probability of guilt,unless there is no explanation other than guilt for a person to be the source of dna.this faulty reasoning may result in an erroneous statement that,based on a random match probability of in,there is a chance the defendant is innocent or a chance the defendant is guilty.
the mueller report does not dispute romero opinion that only in people would have the same dna profile as the rapist.mueller correctly points out,however,that some of romero testimony as well as the prosecutor argument suggested that the evidence also established that there was only a chance that respondent was innocent.the state concedes as much.brief for petitioners.for example,the prosecutor argued at closing the jury could be percent sure in this case.app.and when the prosecutor asked romero,in a classic example of erroneously equating source probability with random match probability,whether it would be fair to say that the chances that the dna found in the panties the semen in the panties and the blood sample,the likelihood that it is not troy brown would be,at,romero ultimately agreed that it was not inaccurate to state it that way,at.
looking at romero testimony as a whole,though,she also indicated that she was merely accepting the mathematical equivalence between in and the percentage figure.at the end of the colloquy about percentages,she answered affirmatively the court question whether the percentage was the same math just expressed differently.at.she pointed out that the probability a brother would match was greater than the random match probability,which also indicated to the jury that the random match probability is not the same as the likelihood that someone other than troy was the source of the dna.
the mueller report identifies a second error in romero testimony her estimate of the probability that one or more of troy brothers dna would match.romero testified there was a in or probability that one brother would share the same dna with another,at.when asked whether that change s at all with two brothers,she answered no,at.according to mueller,romero analysis was misleading in two respects.first,she used an assumption regarding the parents under which siblings have the lowest chance of matching that is biologically possible,but even under this stingy assumption she reported the chance of two brothers matching in as much lower than it is in under her assumption.second,using the assumptions mueller finds more appropriate,the probability of a single sibling matching respondent is in,the probability that among two brothers one or more would match is in,and among four brothers it is in,at.
in sum,the two inaccuracies upon which this case turns are testimony equating random match probability with source probability,and an underestimate of the likelihood that one of troy brothers would also match the dna left at the scene.
although we granted certiorari to review respondent jackson claim,the parties now agree that the court of appeals resolution of his claim under jackson was in error.see brief for respondent reply brief for petitioners.indeed,respondent argues the court of appeals did not decide his case under jackson at all,but instead resolved the question whether admission of romero inaccurate testimony rendered his trial fundamentally unfair and then applied jackson to determine whether that error was harmless.
although both petitioners and respondent are now aligned on the same side of the questions presented for our review,the case is not moot because the parties continue to seek different relief from this court.pacific bell telephone linkline communications,slip,at.respondent primarily argues that we affirm on his proposed alternative ground or remand to the ninth circuit for analysis of his due process claim under the standard for harmless error of brecht abrahamson.the state,on the other hand,asks us to reverse.respondent and one amicus have also suggested that we dismiss the case as improvidently granted,brief for national association of criminal defense lawyers as amicus curiae,but we think prudential concerns favor our review of the court of appeals application of jackson.pacific bell,supra,at slip,at.
respondent no longer argues it was proper for the district court to admit the mueller report for the purpose of evaluating his jackson claim,brief for respondent,and concedes the purpose of a jackson analysis is to determine whether the jury acted in a rational manner in returning a guilty verdict based on the evidence before it,not whether improper evidence violated due process,at.there has been no suggestion that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to convict unless some of it was excluded.respondent concession thus disposes of his jackson claim.the concession is also clearly correct.an appellate court reversal for insufficiency of the evidence is in effect a determination that the government case against the defendant was so lacking that the trial court should have entered a judgment of acquittal.lockhart nelson.because reversal for insufficiency of the evidence is equivalent to a judgment of acquittal,such a reversal bars a retrial.see burks u
