rub√©n,represented by counsel,attempts to reinvent his case on appeal.his appellate briefing is long on rhetoric and short on facts,and none of the issues that he advances was raised below.discerning no plain error,we affirm the challenged conviction and sentence.
background 
we briefly rehearse the background and travel of the case,drawing the facts from the colloquy,the uncontested portions of the presentence investigation report psi report,and the sentencing transcript.see united states,cir.united states dietz,cir.
for about eight years,beginning around,the appellant participated in a conspiracy run out of a public housing project in carolina,puerto rico.the drug ring dealt in a cornucopia of controlled substances,including crack cocaine,powder cocaine,heroin,marijuana,and assorted prescription medications.the appellant functioned mostly as a retail seller,peddling drugs throughout the project and its environs.at other times,he served as a lookout,standing watch while his confederates completed sales.
in may of,a federal grand jury returned a indictment charging persons including the appellant with a laundry list of offenses.as relevant here,count one charged the appellant and others with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute a panoply of controlled substances within a protected location.see a.other counts charged the appellant with aiding and abetting the distribution of heroin,cocaine,and marijuana within feet of a public housing project and with conspiring to possess a firearm and ammunition during and in relation to the commission of crimes.
the appellant was not arrested until june of.roughly four months later,he entered into a written plea agreement the agreement,agreeing to plead guilty to count one.as part of the bargain,the government agreed to dismiss the other charges against him.
in the agreement,the parties stipulated that the appellant possessed at least grams,but less than grams,of cocaine,notwithstanding that the drug ring was alleged to have distributed multiple kilograms of several different kinds of drugs.as a result,the appellant faced a statutory maximum sentence of eighty years in prison.see b b,a.
the agreement included a number of provisions bearing upon the appellant prospective sentence acknowledging,though,that the sentencing court was neither bound nor constrained by any of these provisions.of particular pertinence for present purposes,the parties suggested a total offense level of,but they did not stipulate to any criminal history category chc.instead,they agreed that if the appellant chc proved to be i or ii,he could argue for a sentence as low as sixty months and the government could argue for a sentence as high as seventy months.if,however,the appellant chc equaled or exceeded iii,both parties would recommend a sentence at the low end of whatever guideline sentencing range gsr resulted.regardless of what his chc turned out to be,the appellant promised not to ask for a sentence of less than sixty months.
at the hearing,the court began by offering to read the charges.the appellant declined the offer,indicating that he knew the nature of the charges against him.the court nonetheless proceeded to describe the relevant charges in detail and also described the manner and means by which the appellant and his coconspirators had allegedly carried out their illicit activities.the appellant acknowledged that he had acted in the manner that the court portrayed and confirmed that he wished to plead guilty to the conspiracy count.
the court reminded the appellant that it was not bound by the agreement but,rather,was obliged to make its own guideline calculations and could impose any sentence provided by the law.the appellant confirmed that he understood the court position.in due course,the court accepted the appellant guilty plea and ordered the preparation of the psi report.
when the final version of the psi report emerged,it identified four clusters of convictions aggregating to more than ten individual convictions,two of which the probation officer thought sufficient to serve as predicates for a career offender enhancement under the sentencing guidelines.with this in mind,the report recommended that the court set the appellant total offense level at and place him in chc vi.these recommendations yielded a gsr of months.
at the disposition hearing,the government urged the court to impose a term of immurement by contrast,the appellant sought a sharply variant sentence and urged the court to impose a term of immurement.the court,after adopting the guideline calculations adumbrated in the psi report,sentenced the appellant to a incarcerative term a sentence that was within,but at the top of,the gsr.in fashioning this sentence,the court considered,inter alia,the appellant personal characteristics,health,criminal history,and the nature of his participation in the offense of conviction.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the appellant challenges both his conviction and his sentence.we discuss only those claims that show some slight promise and summarily reject the remainder of his asseverational array.
conviction.
the appellant principal plaint with respect to his conviction is that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary.we start our examination of this plaint with first principles before accepting a defendant guilty plea,a court must inform the defendant of,and determine that he understands,the nature of each charge.fed.crim.b g see united states jones,cir.this obligation extends to the charges against the defendant and the spectrum of possible penalties to which an admission of guilt will expose him.united states jimenez,cir.
seizing upon this requirement,the appellant insists that the district court twice erred at the hearing when it failed to read count one of the indictment verbatim and when it failed to inform him properly about the consequences of his plea.because he did not raise either of these claims below,our review is for plain error.see united states vonn.plain error review imposes a heavy burden.under that daunting standard,the appellant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.
the appellant first claim does not withstand even cursory inquiry the sentencing court simply was not obliged to read the indictment verbatim.as we have noted,rule does not require a district court either to spout a fixed catechism or to use a set of magic words.jones,at.by the same token,it does not require that the court explore in minute detail every nook and cranny of the charging document.see united states,cir.reading an indictment may be sufficient to inform a defendant of the charges against him,see jones,at,but it is by no means the only avenue through which a sentencing court can achieve that end,see united states,cir.
the appellant more weighty claim is that the court failure to read count one verbatim rendered him unable to understand the scope of the offense to which he plead ed guilty.at bottom,though,this claim rests on revisionist history at the hearing,the appellant affirmed several times that he understood the charges and intended to plead guilty.a defendant admission that the allegations against him are true is ordinarily sufficient proof that he understands the charges.see united states dunfee,cir.noting that declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity quoting united states santiago miranda,cir.united states smith,cir.similar.
this case falls within that general rule,not within the exception to it.the relevant inquiry on appeal focuses on the totality of the circumstances,including the attributes of the particular defendant,the nature of the specific offense,and the complexity of the attendant circumstances.jones,at quoting united states,cir.in this instance,the court informed the appellant that he was charged with conspiring to knowingly and intentionally possess with intent to distribute controlled substances.it then described the offense conduct in some detail including particular methods and locations and identified the appellant role within the conspiracy.the appellant confirmed his understanding of those charges.no more was exigible to render the appellant plea knowing and voluntary.
the appellant next contends that because neither the agreement nor the district court mentioned in haec verba that he might be subject to the career offender enhancement he did not appreciate the consequences of his guilty plea.but this contention mixes plums with pomegranates the fact that the appellant was not explicitly informed of the possibility of a career offender enhancement does not mean that he was not appropriately informed of the consequences of his plea.see jimenez,at.after all,the agreement specifically contemplated that the appellant chc might be elevated and established a sentencing framework that took account of that possibility.the colloquy alluded to this framework and,echoing the agreement,warned the appellant that the court would make its own guideline calculations and could impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction.these warnings were adequate.at this relatively early stage in the process that is,at the stage,the court was not obligated to predict the future and inform the defendant of the exact manner in which his future guideline calculations may evolve.jones,at citing fed.crim.advisory committee note amendment discussing same.any other rule would put the cart before the horse,requiring the court to get the functional equivalent of a full psi report before it could accept a guilty plea.id.
the appellant final claim has a patina of plausibility.he points out that the court recited an incorrect statutory maximum at the hearing.see fed.crim.b h requiring court to notify defendant of any maximum possible penalty that he faces.the error itself is patent at the hearing,the court told the appellant that he faced a maximum possible sentence of forty years when,in fact,he faced a maximum possible sentence of eighty years.see b b,a.
although this error satisfies the first two elements of the plain error test,it nonetheless falters at the third step the appellant has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights.to make such a showing in this context,a defendant must identify a reasonable probability that but for some error,he would not have pleaded guilty.united states,cir.citing,inter alia,united states davila.the appellant makes no such argument,much less the requisite showing.at any rate,the agreement accurately stated the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the appellant who was negotiating with the government for a sentence well below the statutory maximum was influenced unfairly by the district court slip of the tongue see united states,cir.applying similar logic to hold that misstatement of term of supervised release did not affect validity of defendant plea.
to say more about the appellant challenges to his conviction would be to paint the lily.after examining all of the appellant arguments in this regard,it is readily apparent that plain error is plainly absent.
the appellant arguments are no more substantial.his briefing is muddled,and it is often unclear whether he attempts to tie his claims to alleged procedural bevues underlying his sentence or to its purported lack of substantive reasonableness.in an abundance of caution,we address both aspects.
in general,sentencing claims are addressed under a pavane.see united states martin,cir.first,we address those claims that affect the procedural integrity of the sentence.see id.second,we address any residual question as to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.see id.
in this case,the appellant accuses the district court of neglecting to give proper consideration to the factors enumerated in a.specifically,he contends that the court did not mull the nature and circumstances of the offense of conviction,his history and characteristics,and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity.these contentions lack any semblance of force.
as a threshold matter,the standard of review looms as a formidable obstacle.the appellant did not raise any such claims below and,thus,appellate review is for plain error.see jimenez,at duarte,at.
here,moreover,the court stated at the disposition hearing that it had taken into consideration all of the factors.this statement itself is entitled to some weight,see,at,and the appellant points to nothing in the record that serves to suggest the contrary.
in any event,a sentencing court has broad discretion to weigh and balance the section a factors.see united states,cir.the court may treat those factors as a whole it is not required to address those factors,one by one,in some sort of rote incantation when explicating its sentencing decision.united states dixon,cir.
against this backdrop,we turn to the appellant more particularized plaints.to begin,his suggestion that the sentencing court misperceived the nature and circumstances of the crime is woven out of whole cloth.while he claims that the court did not understand the exact nature of his participation in the conspiracy and,therefore,could not tailor a sentence to his role in the offense,the record belies this claim.at sentencing,the court recounted many pertinent details of the offense,including the appellant service as a seller,and his admission that he had handled between and grams of crack cocaine in the course of the enterprise.seen in this light,the suggestion that the court did not understand the nature and circumstances of the offense appears groundless.
relatedly,the appellant claims that the court misconstrued statements in the psi report regarding his history and characteristics,causing the court to give his difficult family circumstances and struggles with addiction short shrift.this claim,too,strains credulity.the record reflects that the court,before pronouncing sentence,paid specific heed to the appellant family circumstances,history of substance abuse,and health,and factored those considerations into its sentencing calculus.the appellant remonstrance,then,boils down to nothing more than a contention that the court did not give potentially mitigating factors,such as the appellant history and characteristics,the weight that the appellant would have liked.we have stated,with a regularity bordering on the monotonous,that such qualitative judgments fall comfortably within a sentencing court purview.see,united states,cir,at.accordingly,the appellant quarrel with this aspect of the sentencing court rationale falls short of a showing of error plain or otherwise.the appellant claim of sentencing disparity is equally unpersuasive.refined to bare essence,his argument is that the court failed to consider that many of his codefendants received lesser sentences.this oversight,he says,transgressed the congressional directive to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.a.this claim is doubly flawed.
for one thing,when congress enacted section a,it was concerned mainly with minimization of disparities among defendants nationally rather than with disparities among codefendants engaged in a common conspiracy.united states floyd,cir.quoting united states vargas,cir.
for another thing,the appellant has not shown that any of his proposed comparators an undefined subset of his coconspirators were similarly situated to him.although his brief contains a barebones list of the various coconspirators and their sentences,the appellant comments upon only one particular coconspirator a coconspirator who allegedly played a more significant role in the conspiracy but received a lesser sentence.however,he presents no information about this coconspirator specific criminal involvement,his criminal history,his career offender status,or his cooperation if any with the government.
a credible claim of sentencing disparity requires that the proponent furnish the court with enough relevant information to permit a determination that he and his proposed comparators are similarly situated.see united states,c
