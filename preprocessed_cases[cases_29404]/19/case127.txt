the state of arkansas charged petitioner alex blueford with capital murder for the death of a child.that charge included the lesser offenses of murder,manslaughter,and negligent homicide.before the start of deliberations,the trial court instructed the jury to consider the offenses as follows if you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant guilt on the charge of capital murder,you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree.if you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant guilt on the charge of murder in the first degree,you will then consider the charge of manslaughter.if you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant guilt on the charge of manslaughter,you will then consider the charge of negligent homicide.the court also presented the jury with a set of verdict forms,which allowed the jury either to convict blueford of one of the charged offenses,or to acquit him of all of them.acquitting on some but not others was not an option.
after deliberating for a few hours,the jury reported that it could not reach a verdict.the court inquired about the jury progress on each offense.the foreperson disclosed that the jury was unanimous against guilt on the charges of capital murder and murder,was deadlocked on manslaughter,and had not voted on negligent homicide.the court told the jury to continue to deliberate.the jury did so but still could not reach a verdict,and the court declared a mistrial.when the state subsequently sought to retry blueford,he moved to dismiss the capital and murder charges on double jeopardy grounds.the trial court denied the motion,and the supreme court of arkansas affirmed on interlocutory appeal.
held the double jeopardy clause does not bar retrying blueford on charges of capital murder and murder.
a the jury did not acquit blueford of capital or murder.blueford contends that the foreperson report that the jury was unanimous against guilt on the murder offenses represented a resolution of some or all of the elements of those offenses in his favor.but the report was not a final resolution of anything.when the foreperson told the court how the jury had voted on each offense,the jury deliberations had not yet concluded.the jurors in fact went back to the jury room to deliberate further,and nothing in the court instructions prohibited them from reconsidering their votes on capital and murder as deliberations continued.the foreperson report prior to the end of deliberations therefore lacked the finality necessary to amount to an acquittal on those offenses.that same lack of finality undermines blueford reliance on green united states,and price georgia.in both of those cases,the verdict of the jury was a final decision here,the report of the foreperson was not.
b the trial court declaration of a mistrial was not improper.a trial can be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for the same offense when particular circumstances manifest a necessity to declare a mistrial.wade hunter.blueford contends that there was no necessity for a mistrial on capital and murder,given the foreperson report that the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on those charges.according to blueford,the court at that time should have taken some action,whether through new partial verdict forms or other means,to allow the jury to give effect to those votes,and then considered a mistrial only as to the remaining charges.blueford acknowledges,however,that the trial court reason for declaring a mistrial here that the jury was unable to reach a verdict has long been considered the classic basis establishing necessity for doing so.arizona washington.and this court has never required a trial court,before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury,to consider any particular means of breaking the impasse let alone to consider giving the jury new options for a verdict.see renico lett.as permitted under arkansas law,the jury options in this case were limited to two either convict on one of the offenses,or acquit on all.the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to add another option that of acquitting on some offenses but not others.

on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of arkansas 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
the double jeopardy clause protects against being tried twice for the same offense.the clause does not,however,bar a second trial if the first ended in a mistrial.before the jury concluded deliberations in this case,it reported that it was unanimous against guilt on charges of capital murder and murder,was deadlocked on manslaughter,and had not voted on negligent homicide.the court told the jury to continue to deliberate.the jury did so but still could not reach a verdict,and the court declared a mistrial.all agree that the defendant may be retried on charges of manslaughter and negligent homicide.the question is whether he may also be retried on charges of capital and murder.
matthew mcfadden,suffered a severe head injury on november,while home with his mother boyfriend,alex blueford.despite treatment at a hospital,mcfadden died a few days later.
the state of arkansas charged blueford with capital murder,but waived the death penalty.the state theory at trial was that blueford had injured mcfadden intentionally,causing the boy death u nder circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.code ann.a a supp.the defense,in contrast,portrayed the death as the result of blueford accidentally knocking mcfadden onto the ground.
the trial court instructed the jury that the charge of capital murder included three lesser offenses murder,manslaughter,and negligent homicide.in addition to describing these offenses,the court addressed the order in which the jury was to consider them if you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant guilt on the charge of capital murder,you will consider the charge of murder in the first degree.if you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant guilt on the charge of murder in the first degree,you will then consider the charge of manslaughter.if you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant guilt on the charge of manslaughter,you will then consider the charge of negligent homicide.app.
the prosecution commented on these instructions in its closing argument.it told the jury,for example,that before you can consider a lesser included of capital murder,you must first,all,vote that this man is not guilty of capital murder.at.the prosecution explained that this was not a situation where you just lay everything out here and say,well,we have four choices.which one does it fit the most at.rather,the prosecution emphasized,unless all of you agree that this man actions were not consistent with capital murder,then and only then would you go down to murder in the first degree.ibid.
after the parties concluded their arguments,the court presented the jury with a set of five verdict forms,each representing a possible verdict.there were four separate forms allowing the jury to convict on each of the charged offenses capital murder,murder,manslaughter,and negligent homicide.a fifth form allowed the jury to return a verdict of acquittal,if the jury found blueford not guilty of any offense.there was no form allowing the jury to acquit on some offenses but not others.as stated in the court instructions,the jury could either find the defendant guilty of one of these offenses or acquit him outright.at.any verdict whether to convict on one or to acquit on all had to be unanimous.
a few hours after beginning its deliberations,the jury sent the court a note asking what happens if we can not agree on a charge at all.at.the court called the jury back into the courtroom and issued a allen instruction,emphasizing the importance of reaching a verdict.see allen united states.the jury then deliberated for a half hour more before sending out a second note,stating that it can not agree on any one charge in this case.app.when the court summoned the jury again,the jury foreperson reported that the jury was hopelessly deadlocked.ibid.the court asked the foreperson to disclose the jury votes on each offense 
the court all right.if you have your numbers together,and i do want names,but if you have your numbers i would like to know what your count was on capital murder.
juror number one that was unanimous against that.no.
the court okay,on murder in the first degree 
juror number one that was unanimous against that.
the court okay.manslaughter 
juror number one nine for,three against.
the court okay.and negligent homicide 
juror number one we did not vote on that,sir.
the court did not vote on that.
juror number one no,sir.we could get past the manslaughter.were we supposed to go past that i thought we were supposed to go one at a time.at.
following this exchange,the court gave another allen instruction and sent the jurors back to the jury room.after deliberations resumed,blueford counsel asked the court to submit new verdict forms to the jurors,to be completed for those counts that they have reached a verdict on.at.the prosecution objected on the grounds that the jury was still deliberating and that a verdict of acquittal had to be all or nothing.at.the court denied blueford request.to allow for a partial verdict,the court explained,would be like changing horses in the middle of the stream,given that the jury had already received instructions and verdict forms.ibid.the court informed counsel that it would declare a mistrial if the jury does make a decision.at.
when the jury returned a half hour later,the foreperson stated that they had not reached a verdict.the court declared a mistrial and discharged the jury.
the state subsequently sought to retry blueford.he moved to dismiss the capital and murder charges on double jeopardy grounds,citing the foreperson report that the jurors had voted unanimously against guilt on those offenses.the trial court denied the motion,and the supreme court of arkansas affirmed on interlocutory appeal.according to the state supreme court,the foreperson report had no effect on the state ability to retry blueford,because the foreperson was not making a formal announcement of acquittal when she disclosed the jury votes.this was not a case,the court observed,where a formal verdict was announced or entered of record.ibid.the court added that the trial court did not err in denying blueford request for new verdict forms that would have allowed the jury to render a partial verdict on the charges of capital and murder.
blueford sought review in this court,and we granted certiorari.
the double jeopardy clause provides that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.amdt.the clause guarantees that the state shall not be permitted to make repeated attempts to convict the accused,thereby subjecting him to embarrassment,expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity,as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.united states martin linen supply,internal quotation marks omitted.
blueford contends that the foreperson report means that he can not be tried again on charges of capital and murder.according to blueford,the double jeopardy clause prohibits a second trial on those charges,for two reasons.
blueford primary submission is that he can not be retried for capital and murder because the jury actually acquitted him of those offenses.see green united states.the arkansas supreme court noted and blueford acknowledges that no formal judgment of acquittal was entered in his case.but none was necessary,blueford maintains,because an acquittal is a matter of substance,not form.quoting from our decision in martin linen,supra,at,blueford contends that despite the absence of a formal verdict,a jury announcement constitutes an acquittal if it actually represents a resolution of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.brief for petitioner.here,according to blueford,the foreperson announcement of the jury unanimous votes on capital and murder represented just that a resolution of some or all of the elements of those offenses in blueford favor.
we disagree.the foreperson report was not a final resolution of anything.when the foreperson told the court how the jury had voted on each offense,the jury deliberations had not yet concluded.the jurors in fact went back to the jury room to deliberate further,even after the foreperson had delivered her report.when they emerged a half hour later,the foreperson stated only that they were unable to reach a verdict.she gave no indication whether it was still the case that all jurors believed blueford was not guilty of capital or murder,that of them believed he was guilty of manslaughter,or that a vote had not been taken on negligent homicide.the fact that deliberations continued after the report deprives that report of the finality necessary to constitute an acquittal on the murder offenses.
blueford maintains,however,that any possibility that the jurors revisited the murder offenses was foreclosed by the instructions given to the jury.those instructions,he contends,not only required the jury to consider the offenses in order,from greater to lesser,but also prevented it from transitioning from one offense to the next without unanimously and definitively resolving the greater offense in his favor.a jury is presumed to follow its instructions.weeks angelone.so,blueford says,the foreperson report that the jury was deadlocked on manslaughter necessarily establishes that the jury had acquitted blueford of the greater offenses of capital and murder.
but even if we assume that the instructions required a unanimous vote before the jury could consider a lesser offense as the state assumes for purposes of this case,see brief for respondent,nothing in the instructions prohibited the jury from reconsidering such a vote.the instructions said simply,if you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant guilt on the charge of the greater offense,you will then consider the charge of the lesser offense.app.the jurors were never told that once they had a reasonable doubt,they could not rethink the issue.the jury was free to reconsider a greater offense,even after considering a lesser one 
a simple example illustrates the point.a jury enters the jury room,having just been given these instructions.the foreperson decides that it would make sense to determine the extent of the jurors agreement before discussions begin.accordingly,she conducts a vote on capital murder,and everyone votes against guilt.she does the same for murder,and again,everyone votes against guilt.she then calls for a vote on manslaughter,and there is disagreement.only then do the jurors engage in a discussion about the circumstances of the crime.while considering the arguments of the other jurors on how the death was caused,one of the jurors starts rethinking his own stance on a greater offense.after reflecting on the evidence,he comes to believe that the defendant did knowingly cause the death satisfying the definition of murder.at that point,nothing in the instructions prohibits the jury from doing what juries often do revisit a prior vote.the very object of the jury system,after all,is to secure unanimity by a comparison of views,and by arguments among the jurors themselves.allen,at.a single juror change of mind is all it takes to require the jury to reconsider a greater offense.
it was therefore possible for blueford jury to revisit the offenses of capital and murder,notwithstanding its earlier votes.and because of that possibility,the foreperson report prior to the end of deliberations lacked the finality necessary to amount to an acquittal on those offenses,quite apart from any requirement that a formal verdict be returned or judgment entered.
that same lack of finality undermines blueford reliance on green united states,and price georgia.in those cases,we held that the double jeopardy clause is violated when a defendant,tried for a greater offense and convicted of a lesser included offense,is later retried for the greater offense.see green,supra,at price,supra,at.blueford argues that the only fact distinguishing his case from green and price is that his case involves a deadlock on the lesser included offense,as opposed to a conviction.in his view,that distinction only favors him,because the double jeopardy clause should,if anything,afford greater protection to a defendant who is not found guilty of the lesser included offense.
blueford argument assumes,however,that the votes reported by the foreperson did not change,even though the jury deliberated further after that report.that assumption is unjustified,because the reported votes were,for the reasons noted,not final.blueford thus overlooks the real distinction between the cases in green and price,the verdict of the jury was a final decision here,the report of the foreperson was not.
blueford maintains that even if the jury did not acquit him of capital and murder,a second trial on those offenses would nonetheless violate the double jeopardy clause,because the trial court declaration of a mistrial was improper.blueford acknowledges that a trial can be discontinued without barring a subsequent one for the same offense when particular circumstances manifest a necessity to declare a mistrial.wade hunter,see also united states perez,wheat.he also acknowledges that the trial court reason for declaring a mistrial here that the jury was unable to reach a verdict has long been considered the classic basis establishing such a necessity.arizona washington.blueford therefore accepts that a second trial on manslaughter and negligent homicide would pose no double jeopardy problem.he contends,however,that there was no necessity for a mistrial on capital and murder,given the foreperson report that the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on those charges.according to blueford,the court at that time should have taken some action,whether through partial verdict forms or other means,to allow the jury to give effect to those votes,and then considered a mistrial only as to the remaining charges.reply brief for petitioner.
we reject that suggestion.we have never required a trial court,before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury,to consider any particular means of breaking the impasse let alone to consider giving the jury new options for a verdict.see renico lett,slip,at as permitted under arkansas law,the jury options in this case were limited to two either convict on one of the offenses,or acquit on all.the instructions explained those options in plain terms,and the verdict forms likewise contemplated no other outcome.there were separate forms to convict on each of the possible offenses,but there was only one form to acquit,and it was to acquit on all of them.when the foreperson disclosed the jury votes on capital and murder,the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to add another option that of acquitting on some offenses but not others.that,however,is precisely the relief blueford seeks relief the double jeopardy clause does not afford him.
the jury in this case did not convict blueford of any offense,but it did not acquit him of any either.when the jury was unable to return a verdict,the trial court properly declared a mistrial and discharged the jury.as a consequence,the double jeopardy clause does not stand in the way of a second trial on the same offenses.

i respectfully dissent.
the bar on retrials following acquittals is the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence.martin linen,at see,united states ball,blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england.this prohibition stops the state,with all its resources and power,from mounting abusive,harassing reprosecutions,green united states,which subject a defendant to embarrassment,expense,anxiety,and insecurity,and the possibility that he may be found guilty even though innocent,united states difrancesco.
in ascertaining whether an acquittal has occurred,form is not to be exalted over substance.sanabria united states.rather,we ask whether the factfinder has made a substantive determination that the prosecution has failed to carry its burden.smith massachusetts.have different procedures respecting the announcement of verdicts and the entry of judgments,but that diversity has no constitutional significance.jeopardy terminates upon a determination,however characterized,that the evidence is insufficient to prove a defendant factual guilt.smalis pennsylvania.thus,we have treated as acquittals a trial judge directed verdict of not guilty,smith,at an appellate reversal of a conviction for insufficiency of the evidence,burks,at and,most pertinent here,a jury announcement of a not guilty verdict that was not followed by any judgment,ball,at.
a straightforward application of that principle suffices to decide this case.arkansas is a classic or jurisdiction.see generally people richardson.arkansas model jury instructions require a jury to complete its deliberations on a greater offense before it may consider a lesser.model jury,ed.as a matter of arkansas law,b efore it may consider any offense,the jury must first determine that the proof is insufficient to convict on the greater offense.thus,the jury must,in essence,acquit the defendant of the greater offense before considering his or her guilt on the offense.hughes state,
here,the trial judge instructed blueford jury to consider the offenses in order,from the charged offense of capital murder to the lesser included offenses of murder,manslaughter,and negligent homicide.the judge told the jury to proceed past capital murder only upon a unanimous finding of a reasonable doubt as to that offense that is,upon an acquittal.see in re winship.the state closing arguments repeated this directive b efore you can consider a lesser included of capital murder,you must first,all,vote that this man is not guilty of capital murder.app.and the forewoman colloquy with the judge leaves no doubt that the jury understood the instructions to mandate unanimous acquittal on a greater offense as a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser the forewoman reported that the jury had not voted on negligent homicide because the jurors could get past the manslaughter count on which they were deadlocked,at.
in this context,the forewoman announcement in open court that the jury was unanimous against conviction on capital and murder,at,was an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes per arkansas law,the jury determination of reasonable doubt as to those offenses was an acquittal in essence.hughes,at,at.by deciding that the state had failed to come forward with sufficient proof,the jury resolved the charges of capital and murder adversely to the state.burks,at.that acquittal can not be reconsidered without putting blueford twice in jeopardy.
green and price georgia,bolster that conclusion.in green,the jury convicted the defendant on the lesser included offense of murder without returning a verdict on the charged offense of murder.this court concluded that this result was an implicit acquittal on the greater offense of murder,barring retrial,at.the defendant was forced to run the gantlet once on that charge and the jury refused to convict him.when given the choice between finding him guilty of either first or second degree murder it chose the latter.see also price,at t his court has consistently refused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after an acquittal,whether that acquittal is express or implied by a conviction on a lesser included offense when the jury was given a full opportunity to return a verdict on the greater charge footnote omitted.notably,green acknowledged that its finding of an implicit acquittal was an assumption,because the jury had made no express statement with respect to the greater offense,at.
blueford position is even stronger because his jury was not silent on the murder counts,but announced that it was unanimous against conviction.and the trial judge specifically instructed the jury to consider manslaughter only after acquitting blueford of the murder counts.courts in several jurisdictions have held that a jury deadlock on a lesser included offense justifies the assumption that the jury acquitted on any greater offenses.see state tate,stone superior of san diego,cal.that assumption is not even necessary here because the jury unmistakably announced acquittal.
the majority holds that the forewoman announcement was not an acquittal because it was not a final resolution of anything.ante,at.in the majority view,the jury might have revisited its decisions on the murder counts during the minutes of deliberations that followed the forewoman announcement.we can not know whether the jury did so,the majority reasons,because the jury was discharged without confirming that it remained unanimous against convicting blueford of capital and murder.ante,at 
putting to one side the lack of record evidence to support this speculation by far the more plausible inference is that the jurors spent those minutes attempting to resolve their deadlock on manslaughter i do not agree that the jury was free to reconsider its decisions when its deliberations resumed.a verdict of acquittal on the issue of guilt or innocence is,of course,absolutely final.bullington missouri.the jury heard instructions and argument that it was required unanimously to acquit on capital and murder before it could reach manslaughter.and as the forewoman colloquy makes plain,the jury followed those instructions scrupulously.there is no reason to believe that the jury vote was anything other than a verdict in substance that is,a final collective decision reached after full deliberation,consideration,and compromise among the individual jurors.harrison gillespie,en banc.and when that decision was announced in open court,it became entitled to full double jeopardy protection.see,commonwealth roth,declining to give effect to the verdict received from the lips of the foreman in open court would elevate form over substance stone,cal,at,at i n determining what verdict,if any,a jury intended to return,the oral declaration of the jurors endorsing the result is the true return of the verdict internal quotation marks omitted see also,dixon state,technical defect in verdict is of no consequence whatever,for the verdict need not be in writing,but may be announced by the foreman of the jury orally state mills,the verdict was of no validity until delivered,by the jury,in court 
the majority example of a jury that takes a preliminary vote on greater offenses,advances to the consideration of a lesser,and then returns to a greater,is inapposite.see ante,at.in the majority example,the jury has not announced its vote in open court.moreover,the instructions in this case did not contemplate that the jury deliberations could take the course that the majority imagines.arkansas model instruction requires acquittal as a prerequisite to consideration of a lesser offense,and the double jeopardy clause entitles an acquittal to.indeed,the purpose of an instruction is to ensure careful and conclusive deliberation on a greater offense.see united states tsanas,friendly,instruction avoids the danger that the jury will not adequately discharge its duties with respect to the greater offense,and instead will move too quickly to the lesser true,arkansas instruction does not expressly forbid reconsideration,but it does not expressly permit reconsideration either.in any event,nothing indicates that the jury announced decisions were tentative,compromises,or mere steps en route to a final verdict,and the double jeopardy clause demands that ambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant.see downum united states.
the fact that the jury was not given the express option of acquitting on individual offenses is irrelevant.see ante,at.arkansas law ascribes no significance to the presence of such options on a verdict form.see rowland state,the jury may prepare and present its own form of verdict the lack of a state procedural vehicle for the entry of a judgment of acquittal does not prevent the recognition of an acquittal for constitutional purposes.see hudson louisiana.
finally,the majority distinction of green and price is unavailing.the majority observes that green and price,unlike this case,involved final decisions.ante,at.as i have explained,i view the forewoman announcements of acquittal in this case as similarly final.in any event,green clarified that the defendant claim of former jeopardy was not based on his previous conviction for second degree murder but instead on the original jury refusal to convict him of first degree murder.at,accord,at.that is,the jury silence on the greater offense spoke with sufficient clarity to justify the assumption of acquittal and to invoke the double jeopardy clause,at see also price,at.in light of the forewoman announcement,this is an a fortiori case.
in short,the double jeopardy clause demands an inquiry into the substance of the jury actions.blueford jury had the option to convict him of capital and murder,but expressly declined to do so.that ought to be the end of the matter.
even if the majority were correct that the jury might have reconsidered an acquitted count a doubtful assumption for the reasons just explained that would not defeat blueford double jeopardy claim.it has been long established as an integral part of double jeopardy jurisprudence that a defendant could be put in jeopardy even in a prosecution that did not culminate in a conviction or an acquittal.crist bretz.this rule evolved in response to the abhorrent practice under the stuart monarchs of terminating prosecutions,and thereby evading the bar on retrials,when it appeared that the crown proof might be insufficient.washington,at see,ireland case,how.tr.accordingly,retrial is barred if a jury is discharged before returning a verdict unless the defendant consents or there is a manifest necessity for the discharge.perez,at see also king perkins,eng.
in perez,this court explained that manifest necessity is a high bar t he power ought to be used with the greatest caution,under urgent circumstances,and for very plain and obvious causes.at.since perez,this court has not relaxed the showing required.see,washington,at requiring a high degree of necessity downum,at imperious necessity see also,united states coolidge,cas,cc story,extraordinary and striking circumstances before a mistrial,therefore,a trial judge must weigh heavily a defendant valued right to have his trial completed by a particular
