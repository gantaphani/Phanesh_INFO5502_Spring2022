background 
on the afternoon of july,junta took his old son and two friends to the burbank ice arena in reading,massachusetts for stick practice,an informal hockey practice.commonwealth junta.during the practice,junta watched from the stands.junta,after watching the game for a period of time,believed the game had become too rough and went down to to complain to michael costin costin,an adult who was participating in the practice with his three sons.id.costin responded,that hockey.id.the men exchanged words,but no physical altercation took place at that time.
the practice ended shortly thereafter,and the players returned to the locker room.while the players were changing out of their hockey gear,junta and costin again confronted one another,first verbally and then physically.other nearby adults broke up the fight.junta departed the arena,leaving his son to finish changing in the locker room,only to return a few minutes later.id.at.upon his return,nancy blanchard blanchard,a rink employee,noted that junta appeared angry.id.junta found costin,and the two men immediately began throwing punches at one another.id.
there was conflicting trial testimony as to which of the two men was the first aggressor.id.junta claimed that costin attacked him first,while witnesses for the commonwealth alleged that it was junta who first grabbed costin.id.costin,who weighed approximately pounds,wound up on the ground with junta,who weighed approximately pounds,straddled on top of him.id.costin was punched numerous times in the face and elsewhere.
also at issue at the trial was the number of blows junta struck.blanchard and other witnesses testified that junta punched costin many,many times,while junta and his witnesses claimed that only two or three punches had been inflicted.id.blanchard and another witness asked junta to stop,screaming,you going to kill him.id.
costin did not succumb immediately to junta blows.according to several witnesses,there was a period during that punching that costin was moving,fighting,kicking,or flailing.id.by the time that bystanders pulled junta away from costin,costin was motionless.emergency medical technicians and an advanced life support team treated costin while en route to the hospital,but costin died the next day.
the number and nature of the blows inflicted were viewed as crucial.the law of the commonwealth of massachusetts recognizes manslaughter only if the unlawful act is a battery not amounting to a felony,when the defendant knew or should have known that the battery he was committing endangered human life.id.quoting commonwealth sires,mass.as a result,if junta inflicted only a single punch or minor blows,it would tend to negate his knowledge or imputed knowledge.
the expert testimony at trial differed as to the number of blows.stanton kessler of the commonwealth office of the chief medical examiner,the expert for the prosecution,had performed the autopsy.kessler testified that,in addition to the numerous injuries on costin body,there were two areas of severe trauma the base of the neck where the vertebral artery ruptured,cutting off percent of the blood supply to the brain,and internal trauma to the left side of the head above the ear.junta,at.the latter injury,unrelated to the former,resulted in severe and serious bleeding of the brain.id.the cause of death,in his opinion,was blunt head and neck trauma,contributory factor of bronchopneumonia,fluid in the lungs.id.at.although he acknowledged on several occasions that the injury to the vertebral artery could have been sustained by one blow,he testified that the tearing of the ligaments,almost tearing the head from the neck,indicated multiple blows.id.at.
ira kanfer,the defense expert,testified that the cause of death was rupture of the vertebral artery,a rare injury caused by minimal force,due to a single blow.id.
procedural history 
on january,a massachusetts superior court jury convicted junta of involuntary manslaughter on the theory of unlawful killing by the commission of a battery.id.at see.laws ch.junta was sentenced to serve six to ten years at the massachusetts correction junction.junta,at.
on february,junta filed a motion for new trial.in support of his motion for a new trial,junta submitted the affidavit of melissa christie christie,who worked at the office of the chief medical examiner.she alleged that she had attended an american academy of forensic science aafs conference in seattle,washington,where kessler had given a presentation on the technique for evaluating vertebral artery trauma at autopsy during his presentation,kessler identified the case for the audience as being the famous hockey dad case in massachusetts,and showed slides of costin injuries.id.at.he identified the rupture of the vertebral artery as the fatal injury and indicated that the injury can easily occur during a chiropractor visit.id.according to christie,t here was nothing in his talk about substantial force or multiple blows having caused the rupture of costin vertebral artery.id.following a hearing,the trial judge denied junta motion.junta filed a notice of appeal,and his two first from his conviction and the second from the denial of his motion for new consolidated.on september,the massachusetts appeals court affirmed junta conviction and denied his motion for new trial.see id.at.junta subsequently filed with the massachusetts supreme court an application for leave to obtain further appellate review,which the court denied.
having exhausted his state court remedies,on february,junta filed a petition under for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.in his petition,junta set forth a single claim based on the prosecution alleged failure to disclose exculpatory evidence in violation of brady,at.specifically,junta alleged that the prosecution effectively suppressed the fact that kessler had presented his findings in this case at an aafs conference,and that the findings presented at the conference contradicted his trial testimony,thus depriving junta of valuable impeachment evidence.the district court denied the petition.junta thompson,d.junta thereafter requested,and the district court granted,a certificate of appealability on the brady issue.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court denial of habeas relief de novo.aspen bissonnette,cir.
as a threshold matter,we must determine the proper standard of review with which to review the state court disposition of junta appeal.under aedpa,the level of deference owed to a state court decision on federal habeas review hinges on whether the state court ever adjudicated the relevant claim on the merits or not.clements clarke,cir citing u.d.if the state court has adjudicated the claim on the merits,a federal habeas court must defer to the state court adjudication unless it 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.in contrast,a state court decision that does not address the federal claim on the merits falls beyond the ambit of aedpa,clements,at,and the habeas co
