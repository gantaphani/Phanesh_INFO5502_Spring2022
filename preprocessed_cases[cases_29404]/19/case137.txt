an immigration judge ordered the removal of resident aliens akio and fusako kawashima,determining that kawashima conviction for willfully making and subscribing a false tax return,and kawashima conviction for aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return,qualified as crimes involving fraud or deceit under a m i clause i and thus were aggravated felonies for which they could be deported under a a iii.the board of immigration appeals affirmed.holding that convictions under and in which the government revenue loss exceeds constitute aggravated felonies under clause i,the ninth circuit affirmed,but remanded for the board to determine whether kawashima conviction had caused a government loss in excess of.
held convictions under and in which the government revenue loss exceeds qualify as aggravated felonies pursuant to clause i.
a the kawashimas argument that they can not be deported for the commission of an aggravated felony because crimes under and do not involve the fraud or deceit required by clause i is rejected.this court looks to the statute defining the crime of conviction,rather than the specific facts underlying the crime,see gonzales,to determine whether the kawashimas offenses involve fraud or deceit within the meaning of clause i.section provides that any person who willfully makes and subscribes any return which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury,and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter,shall be guilty of a felony.although the words fraud and deceit are absent from and are not themselves formal elements of the crime,it does not follow that kawashima offense falls outside clause i.clause i is not limited to offenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.rather,it refers more broadly to offenses involving fraud or deceit meaning offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct.kawashima conviction under involved deceitful conduct in that he knowingly and willfully submitted a tax return that was false as to a material matter.kawashima was convicted of violating,which declares that any person who w illfully aids or assists in the preparation or presentation of a return which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter has committed a felony.she committed a felony involving deceit by knowingly and willfully assisting her husband filing of a materially false tax return.
b the kawashimas argument that clause i,when considered in light of a m ii clause ii,must be interpreted as being inapplicable to tax crimes is also rejected.clause i defines aggravated felony to mean an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.clause ii defines aggravated felony as an offense that is described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds.contrary to the kawashimas claim,the difference in the clauses language revenue loss to the government in clause ii compared to loss to the victim in clause i does not establish congress intent to remove tax crimes from the scope of clause i.by its plain language,clause i covers a broad class of offenses that involve fraud or deceit,and congress decision to tailor clause ii language to match the sole type of offense it covers does not demonstrate that congress intended to implicitly circumscribe clause i broad scope.furthermore,interpreting clause i to include tax crimes does not violate the presumption against superfluities.the specific inclusion of tax evasion in clause ii does not make it redundant to clause i because the inclusion was intended to ensure that tax evasion pursuant to was a deportable offense.
c the united states sentencing guidelines separate treatment of tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit does not support the kawashimas contention that congress did not intend to include tax crimes within clause i.no evidence suggests that congress considered the guidelines when drafting a m.moreover,the differences between a m and the guidelines undercut any inference that congress was incorporating the distinction drawn by the guidelines into a m.
d construing a m in the kawashimas favor under the rule of lenity is not warranted in light of the statute clear application.

akio kawashima,et,petitioners eric holder,attorney general 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns whether aliens who commit certain federal tax crimes are subject to deportation as aliens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony.we hold that violations of and are crimes involv ing fraud or deceit under a m i and are therefore aggravated felonies as that term is defined in the immigration and nationality act,et,when the loss to the government exceeds.
petitioners,akio and fusako kawashima,are natives and citizens of japan who have been lawful permanent residents of the united states since june.in,kawashima pleaded guilty to one count of willfully making and subscribing a false tax return in violation of.kawashima pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return in violation of.
following their convictions,the immigration and naturalization service charged the kawashimas with being deportable from the united states as aliens who had been convicted of an aggravated felony see a a iii any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable in the immigration and nationality act,congress listed categories of offenses that qualify as aggravated felonies for the purpose of deportation.see a.here,the government charged the kawashimas with being deportable for committing offenses under subparagraph m of a.that subparagraph classifies as an aggravated felony an offense that either i involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds or ii is described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds.hereinafter,we refer to a m i as clause i and to a m ii as clause ii.
at their deportation hearing,the kawashimas argued that their convictions under did not qualify as aggravated felonies under subparagraph m.the immigration judge disagreed and ordered removal,concluding that the kawashimas convictions qualified as aggravated felonies under clause i.the kawashimas appealed the removal order to the board of immigration appeals board,which affirmed the immigration judge decision.after unsuccessfully petitioning the board to reopen its decision,the kawashimas filed petitions for review of the board decision in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.
the ninth circuit held that convictions for violating and in which the tax loss to the government exceeds constitute aggravated felonies under subsection m i.the court concluded that kawashima conviction under qualified as an aggravated felony within clause i definition because it involved fraud or deceit and because his offense resulted in a loss to the government in excess of.at.the ninth circuit also determined that kawashima conviction under necessarily involve d fraud or deceit.at.but because kawashima plea agreement was not in the administrative record,the ninth circuit remanded to the board to determine whether kawashima conviction had caused a loss to the government in excess of,at.
we granted the kawashimas petition for a writ of certiorari to determine whether their convictions for violations of and respectively qualify as aggravated felonies under a m i.we now affirm.
the kawashimas argue that they can not be deported for commission of an aggravated felony because crimes under and do not involv e fraud or deceit as required by clause i.the kawashimas also assert that their convictions under are not aggravated felonies because tax crimes are not included within clause i at all.we address each argument in turn.
the kawashimas contend that their offenses of conviction do not fall within the scope of clause i because neither fraud nor deceit is a formal element of a conviction under or.the government responds that the kawashimas convictions necessarily involved deceit because they required a showing that the kawashimas willfully made materially false statements.to determine whether the kawashimas offenses involv e fraud or deceit within the meaning of clause i,we employ a categorical approach by looking to the statute defining the crime of conviction,rather than to the specific facts underlying the crime.see gonzales,applying the approach set forth in taylor united states.if the elements of the offenses establish that the kawashimas committed crimes involving fraud or deceit,then the first requirement of clause i is satisfied 
kawashima was convicted of violating,which provides that any person who w illfully makes and subscribes any return,statement,or other document,which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury,and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter,shall be guilty of a felony.kawashima does not dispute that the elements of a violation of include,inter alia,that the document in question was false as to a material matter,that the defendant did not believe the document to be true and correct as to every material matter,and that he acted willfully with the specific intent to violate the law.see,united states aramony,united states kaiser,united states marabelles,united states whyte.although the words fraud and deceit are absent from the text of and are not themselves formal elements of the crime,it does not follow that his offense falls outside of clause i.the scope of that clause is not limited to offenses that include fraud or deceit as formal elements.rather,clause i refers more broadly to offenses that involv e fraud or deceit meaning offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct.
when subparagraph m was enacted,the term deceit meant a the act or process of deceiving as by falsification,concealment,or cheating.webster third new international dictionary.kawashima conviction under establishes that he knowingly and willfully submitted a tax return that was false as to a material matter.he therefore committed a felony that involved deceit.
turning to kawashima,our analysis follows a similar path.kawashima was convicted of violating,which declares that any person who w illfully aids or assists in the preparation or presentation under,or in connection with any matter arising under,the internal revenue laws,of a return,affidavit,claim,or other document,which is fraudulent or is false as to any material matter,has committed a felony.kawashima does not dispute that the elements of a violation of include,inter alia,that the document in question was false as to a material matter and that the defendant acted willfully.see aramony,supra,at united states sassak,united states hooks,united states dahlstrom.we conclude that kawashima conviction establishes that,by knowingly and willfully assisting her husband filing of a materially false tax return,kawashima also committed a felony that involved deceit.
the language of clause i is clear.anyone who is convicted of an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds has committed an aggravated felony and is subject to deportation pursuant to a a iii.the elements of willfully making and subscribing a false corporate tax return,in violation of,and of aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return,in violation of,establish that those crimes are deportable offenses because they necessarily entail deceit.
the kawashimas second argument is based on inferences drawn from the interaction of clause i and clause ii.the full text of subparagraph m reads as follows 
the term aggravated felony means 
m an offense that 
i involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds or 
ii is described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds.
the kawashimas argue that when clause i is read together with clause ii,clause i must be interpreted as being inapplicable to tax crimes.in their view,subparagraph m,when considered in its entirety,demonstrates that congress was addressing two mutually exclusive categories of crimes in subparagraph m two clauses general,crimes involving fraud or deceit that cause actual losses to real victims in clause i,and tax crimes involving revenue losses to the government in clause ii.for the reasons discussed below,this argument can not overcome the plain language of clause i,which encompasses the kawashimas offenses of conviction.
the kawashimas contend that textual differences between clauses i and ii indicate that congress intended to exclude tax crimes from clause i.specifically,they note that clause i addresses loss to the victim,whereas clause ii addresses revenue loss to the government.
this difference in language does not establish congress intent to remove tax crimes from the scope of clause i.clause i covers a broad class of offenses that involve fraud or deceit.clause i thus uses correspondingly broad language to refer to the wide range of potential losses and victims.clause ii,on the other hand,is limited to the single type of offense described in section of title relating to tax evasion,which,by definition,can only cause one type of loss revenue loss to one type of victim the government.congress decision to tailor clause ii language to match the sole type of offense covered by clause ii does not demonstrate that congress also intended to implicitly circumscribe the broad scope of clause i plain language.
next,the kawashimas argue that interpreting clause i to include tax crimes violates the presumption against superfluities by rendering clause ii completely redundant to clause i.clause ii explicitly states that convictions for tax evasion pursuant to that cause a revenue loss of at least to the government are aggravated felonies.the kawashimas assert that,if clause i applies to tax crimes,then qualifying convictions for tax evasion under clause ii would also qualify as aggravated felonies under clause i,because tax evasion is a crime involving fraud or deceit.to buttress this argument,the kawashimas point to a body of law providing that a conviction for tax evasion under collaterally estops the convicted taxpayer from contesting a civil penalty under b for underpayment attributable to fraud.see,gray commissioner,numerous federal courts have held that a conviction for federal income tax evasion,either upon a plea of guilty,or upon a jury verdict of guilt,conclusively establishes fraud in a subsequent civil tax fraud proceeding through application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel therefore,according to the kawashimas,if clause i covers tax offenses,then clause ii is mere surplusage.
we disagree with the kawashimas contention that the specific mention of one type of tax crime in clause ii impliedly limits the scope of clause i plain language,which extends to any offense that involves fraud or deceit.we think it more likely that congress specifically included tax evasion offenses under in clause ii to remove any doubt that tax evasion qualifies as an aggravated felony.
several considerations support this conclusion.like and,does not,on its face,mention fraud or deceit.instead,simply provides that a ny person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by the internal revenue code or the payment thereof shall,in addition to other penalties provided by law,be guilty of a felony.accordingly,neither fraud nor deceit is among the elements of a conviction under,which include willfulness the existence of a tax deficiency and an affirmative act constituting an evasion or an attempted evasion of the tax.boulware united states.a conviction under,therefore,only qualifies as an aggravated felony under clause i if a willful,affirmative attempt to evade a tax necessarily entails fraud or deceit.
this court decision in united states scharton,gave congress good reason to doubt that a conviction under satisfies that condition.in scharton,the defendant was indicted for attempting to evade income taxes by falsely understating his taxable income.the question before the court was whether the crime was subject to the statute of limitations generally applicable to tax crimes,or whether it was instead subject to the statute of limitations applicable to offenses involving the defrauding or attempting to defraud the united states or any agency thereof,whether by conspiracy or not,and in any manner.at,quoting,supp.v.the government argued that the statute of limitations applied because fraud is implicit in the concept of evading or defeating and because any effort to evade a tax is tantamount to an attempt to defraud the taxing body,at.the court rejected that argument,noting that,in an indictment for evasion,an averment of intent to defraud would be surplusage,for it would be sufficient to plead and prove a willful attempt to evade or defeat.at.
moreover,includes two offenses the offense of willfully attempting to evade or defeat the assessment of a tax as well as the offense of willfully attempting to evade or defeat the payment of a tax.sansone united states,emphasis in original.as the government notes,it is possible to willfully evade or defeat payment of a tax under without making any misrepresentation.for example,can be violated by a taxpayer who files a truthful tax return,but who also takes affirmative steps to evade payment by moving his assets beyond the reach of the internal revenue service.although the government concedes that cases will almost invariably involve some affirmative acts of fraud or deceit,it is still true that the elements of tax evasion pursuant to do not necessarily involve fraud or deceit.thus,we conclude that the specific inclusion of tax evasion in clause ii was intended to ensure that tax evasion pursuant to was a deportable offense.clause ii does not implicitly remove all other tax offenses from the scope of clause i plain language.
the kawashimas also assert that the separate treatment of tax crimes and crimes involving fraud and deceit in the united state sentencing guidelines supports their contention that congress did not intend to include tax crimes within clause i.they point to the fact that,in,the united states sentencing commission included within the guidelines a category of offenses involving fraud or deceit.ussg to deleted effective.the commission simultaneously included offenses involving taxation as a separate category.et.although the kawashimas acknowledge that they have found no evidence that congress actually considered the guidelines,they contend that it is likely that the language of clause i and clause ii was taken from the sentencing guidelines by the sponsors of the bill that expanded the definition of aggravated felony to include subparagraph m.brief for petitioners.therefore,the theory goes,we can infer from the similar language in the guidelines that congress did not intend clause i to include tax crimes.
we reject the kawashimas reliance on the guidelines.the kawashimas argument is at odds with the fact that,unlike the guideline that the kawashimas cite,clause ii does not refer to all offenses involving taxation.rather,clause ii is expressly limited to tax evasion offenses under.that textual difference undercuts any inference that congress was considering,much less incorporating,the distinction drawn by the guidelines.
finally,the kawashimas argue that subparagraph m treatment of tax crimes other than tax evasion is ambiguous,and that we should therefore construe the statute in their favor.it is true that we have,in the past,construed ambiguities in deportation statutes in the alien favor.see ins cyr.we think the application of the present statute clear enough that resort to the rule of lenity is not warranted.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that convictions under and in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds qualify as aggravated felonies pursuant to a m i.because the kawashimas are subject to deportation as aliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies pursuant to a a iii,the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

justice ginsburg,with whom justice breyer and justice kagan join,dissenting.
petitioner akio kawashima was convicted of preparing a false corporate tax return in violation of.his wife,petitioner fusako kawashima,was convicted under of assisting her husband in preparing the false return.the question presented is whether a conviction under is an aggravated felony that renders the kawashimas deportable from the united states.see a a iii.
congress has defined aggravated felony to include,inter alia,offenses that i involv e fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds or ii are described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds.a m.the kawashimas argue that tax offenses triggering deportation are delineated exclusively in a m ii or clause ii,and that a m i or clause i does not encompass tax crimes.the court rejects this argument,and holds that any tax offense involv ing fraud or deceit,if the loss to the fisc exceeds,ranks as an aggravated.see ante,at.because the kawashimas tax offense involved deceit and meets the monetary threshold,the court concludes,they have committed an aggravated felony and are therefore deportable.
the court construction of the statute is dubious,as i see it.for one thing,it effectively renders clause ii superfluous.further,the court reading sweeps a wide variety of federal,state,and local tax offenses including misdemeanors into the aggravated felony category.in addition,today decision may discourage aliens from pleading guilty to tax offenses less grave than tax evasion,thereby complicating and delaying enforcement of the internal revenue laws.i conclude that clause i does not address tax offenses,and would therefore hold that making a false statement on a tax return in violation of is not an aggravated felony.
any alien convicted of an aggravated felony after admission to the united states is deportable.a a iii.subparagraph m of a includes as an aggravated felony 
an offense that 
i involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds or 
ii is described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds.
notably,clause i speaks of loss to the victim,clause ii of revenue loss to the government.the kawashimas contend that clause i covers crimes of fraud or deceit causing losses unrelated to tax revenue.tax crimes,they argue,are addressed exclusively in clause ii,and that clause designates only tax evasion proscribed by as an aggravated felony.willfully submitting a false statement proscribed by,the kawashimas maintain,is not an aggravated felony that would render them deportable under a a iii.
the government contends that clause i covers all tax offenses involving fraud or deceit,and that congress included clause ii out of caution,to make certain that persons convicted of tax evasion would be subject to deportation.under the government construction,because the crime of making a false statement on a tax return involves fraud or deceit,the kawashimas committed an aggravated felony.see ante,at the words fraud and deceit are absent from the text of and are not themselves formal elements of the crime,nonetheless,the elements of a crime necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct 
the court task is to determine which r
