following a brutal home invasion in puerto rico,luis garcía pagán was convicted,after a jury trial,of carjacking and of carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.the district court sentenced garcía to months imprisonment.garcía now challenges his conviction and sentence.we affirm.
the following evidence of the crime was presented at trial.at approximately on february,three men broke into the home of noel de león roig in puerto nuevo,puerto rico.all three intruders wore masks and carried firearms.de león awoke to one of the men straddling his head and hitting him in the face.when the lights in the room came on,de león saw his son with the other two assailants.one was pushing a revolver into the boy mouth.the other held a gun to the back of the boy head.at that point,one of the assailants said,doctor,lower your eyes.lower your arms.this is a robbery,you son of a bitch.
over the next hour and a half,the three assailants terrorized de león and his son.they took tens of thousands of dollars from de león safe,along with ipods,computers,watches,and a plasma tv.the intruders tied up the doctor and his son,hit them with guns,and threatened to execute them.around,the assailants left in de león car,and de león called the police.
for a stretch of time during the invasion,the robbers did remove their masks in order to eat pizza and drink soda that they had found in de león kitchen.and so de león saw their faces.de león later identified garcía as one of the assailants from a group of nine people in a photo array within one minute of being shown the photographs.de león made that identification very soon after the,at approximately the same day.de león identified garcía again in the courtroom at trial.de león described garcía as the focused one of the three assailants,and he described one of the other assailants,ricardo urbina robles,as the leader of the group.
garcía argued at trial that he had been misidentified.he introduced the alibi testimony of his wife,his mother,and a friend.together,these three people testified that garcía saw a film with his family on the evening of february,and then,sometime in the early hours of february,returned with his family to the housing complex where garcía lived.garcía wife testified that,after their return from the film,garcía was in bed the entire night.
after the close of the evidence and before closing arguments,defense counsel requested a continuance in order to move for a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum for urbina,to enable urbina,who was then incarcerated and awaiting sentencing following his guilty plea for his involvement in this same crime,to be present and testify in person on garcía behalf see c providing for such a writ.the district court denied the request.
the jury returned convictions as to both counts with which garcía had been charged carjacking,and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,c a ii.the district court sentenced garcía to months in prison a sentence five years longer than the sentence the same judge imposed on urbina.garcía appeals.
garcía challenges his conviction on the basis of the district court supposed error in denying defense counsel request for a continuance to file a motion for a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum for urbina.garcía argues that this denial deprived him of his sixth amendment right to compel the attendance and testimony of a favorable witness 
we review the district court refusal to grant a continuance for an abuse of discretion,even if the movant contends that the denial implicated his sixth amendment rights.united states decologero,cir.and where,as here,the defendant requests a continuance after the parties have rested,the defendant must show that the proffered evidence was of such importance to the achievement of a just result that the need for admitting it overrides the presumption favoring enforcement of the court usual trial procedures.blaikie callahan,cir.but garcía has not made that showing.
the district court had good reason to decide that a continuance would be unnecessarily disruptive to the trial proceedings,especially given the late date at which the request for more time was made.even assuming garcía made a proffer that urbina would provide helpful testimony a premise the government disputes,the district court found and the record shows that it was not at all clear that urbina would waive his fifth amendment right and testify if compelled to appear.
if urbina did testify,the district court explained,he would have to identify his accomplices and he does want to be called a squealer.and the district court also noted that it had spoken to urbina attorney and that the attorney had advised his client as to what problems he could get into,he has other matters pending and his client said i do want to go through a possibility of getting further charges or perjury or obstruction of justice or whatever and that his advice to his client,urbina,was that he would not testify.
moreover,urbina testimony would have been up against the testimony of the victim,de león,who testified that he was with the assailants for approximately an hour and a half and that he saw the assailants with their masks off,and who identified garcía within a minute of seeing a photograph lineup.thus,given the very late stage at which garcía counsel requested a continuance,the district court decision to follow its usual trial procedures was not an abuse of discretion,notwithstanding garcía sixth amendment right to compulsory process.see blaikie,at concluding that the district court refusal to reopen trial to permit an expert witness to testify was not an abuse of discretion where the proposed witness testimony was of limited value to the defendant case see also decologero,at finding no abuse of discretion where the district court refused a request,two days before the prosecution rested,that the court either provide funds to expedite a witness transport or grant a continuance until the witness presence could be secured where there was no good reason for the delay,and where the proffered testimony of the witness was tangential and potentially cumulative watkins callahan,cir holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to delay the trial for three months to await a witness who in all likelihood would exercise his fifth amendment privilege and refuse to testify.
garcía also contends that his prison sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because it is five years longer than urbina sentence,and because the district court did not explain the reason for that disparity.the parties agree that we should review garcía sentence for an abuse of discretion rather than for plain error,and we proceed on this same understanding,as garcía contentions fail under even that more forgiving standard.
we begin with garcía argument that his sentence of months imprisonment is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to explain why that sentence is five years longer than urbina sentence of months imprisonment.the problem for garcía is that the district court did offer an explanation for this difference.
in response to garcía motion to amend his sentence,in which garcía raised only the disparity argument,the district court entered an electronic docket entry denying the motion and referring garcía to our decision in united states ayala vázquez,cir.in ayala,we held that a defendant life sentence,though longer than the sentences received by that the defendant claimed were more culpable than he,was not unreasonable because the defendant was not similarly situated to his in a crucial respect the defendant had gone to trial,while his had pleaded guilty.id.at.thus,in citing to ayala,the district court was clearly relying on this same distinction between the defendant,garcía,who did not plead guilty,and his,urbina,who did.and we have relied on this very distinction in cases involving similar disparities in sentencing lengths to the one in this case.see united states alejandro montañez,cir t he district court did supply a sufficient reason for the more than dis
