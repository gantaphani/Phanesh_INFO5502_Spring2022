appellant fernando díaz rodríguez,convicted at trial of one count of aiding and abetting interference with commerce by threats of violence and one count of using a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence,argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion when it did not allow his counsel to withdraw,and further argues that this decision resulted in a denial of the effective assistance of trial counsel,all in violation of the sixth amendment.díaz rodríguez also argues that his sentence of months imprisonment was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.
we conclude that the district court violated díaz rodríguez sixth amendment right to counsel when it forbade him from retaining new counsel without conducting any inquiry into his conflict with present counsel.accordingly,we vacate the conviction.we need not reach the ineffective assistance or sentencing issues.
the crime in this case was vicious díaz rodríguez was one of four individuals charged with the armed robbery of an armored truck in september.his compatriots fired multiple gunshots during the course of the robbery,seriously wounding an armed guard and,inadvertently,díaz rodríguez,whose injuries required medical treatment.one of díaz rodríguez compatriots likely would have killed the armed guard if his firearm had not malfunctioned.
díaz rodríguez was arrested and indicted shortly after the robbery,and his trial was scheduled to begin on may.in april,the government learned that díaz rodríguez was having difficulties with his counsel,carlos noriega,and consequently might be seeking substitute counsel fearful that such a change in representation would delay the trial the government filed a motion on april informing the court of the possibility that díaz rodríguez might retain new counsel and requesting an order establishing a deadline for doing so or,in the alternative,a pretrial conference with the defendant present to discuss the matter.on april,before díaz rodríguez could respond to the government motion,the district court entered a summary electronic order decreeing that a t this late date defendant will not be allowed to retain new counsel.
subsequently,as díaz rodríguez medical condition from his gunshot wound worsened,he had to undergo numerous surgeries,and the trial was repeatedly continued to an april,start date.on march,attorney noriega filed a motion to withdraw,citing irreconcilable differences that prevent him to further assist the defendant as counsel in this case.he also noted that the essential aspect of the relationship must rest in the trust the defendant has on his attorney.it is destroyed when the client places his trust on another source.the government responded later that same day,arguing that the motion was untimely.on april,the district court summarily denied the motion by electronic order.
on april,attorney noriega filed a motion for a continuance that again mentioned the breakdown in the relationship.on april,following the government response,the district court denied the motion for a continuance calling it an untimely and speculative request.on april,noriega filed a supplemental motion requesting reconsideration of his motion for continuation of trial.among other things,the motion reasserted the breakdown in his relationship with díaz rodríguez 
in relation to the relationship i have stated that it has been affected the six sic amendment right is unique and profound in its meaning.it relies in sic the one and only element.it depends on trust.a defendant must trust his attorney.and when that requirement is affected the attorney client privileges sic disappear for good.
on april,the district court noted the motion and ordered that trial nonetheless continue as scheduled.
the jury trial was conducted from april to april.the government introduced physical evidence,including dna,and called multiple witnesses,including a dna expert.attorney noriega chose to rely solely on the of government witnesses and introduced no evidence.the jury found díaz rodríguez guilty of both charges.
the district court sentenced díaz rodríguez to months on the robbery count and months on the firearm count,to be served consecutively.this appeal followed.
díaz rodríguez argues that the district court refusal to allow him to retain new counsel violated his sixth amendment right to counsel of choice because the court initially forbade him from hiring substitute counsel without giving him an opportunity to be heard on the issue.he further asserts that noriega was operating under a conflict of interest due to the loss of trust in their relationship.
the sixth amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to counsel.an essential component of that right is the accused opportunity to obtain counsel of his own choice.united states panzardi alvarez,cir citing powell alabama.however,a defendant right to his choice of counsel is not absolute there are limits to the time and manner of its exercise.see united states richardson,cir.a defendant can not exercise this right in a manner that will unduly hinder the fair,efficient and orderly administration of justice.panzardi alvarez,at see also united states poulack,cir t he right of an accused to choose his own counsel can not be insisted upon in a manner that will obstruct reasonable and orderly court procedure.thus,when a defendant seeks to substitute counsel as trial is approaching,the court must balance his interest in retaining counsel of his choice against the public interest in the prompt,fair and ethical administration of justice.united states woodard,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we review a trial court decision on a defendant request to substitute counsel for abuse of discretion woodard,f d at.however,we have also held that the trial court must conduct an appropriate inquiry into the source of the defendant dissatisfaction with his counsel.united states prochilo,cir see also united states allen,cir where the accused voices objections to appointed counsel,the trial court should inquire into the reasons for the dissatisfaction.although we have held that there is no invariable model for a trial court inquiry into an allegedly embattled relationship,we have consistently required some probe into the nature and duration of the asserted conflict.united states myers,cir see also woodard,at noting that t he extent and nature of the inquiry may vary in each case it need not amount to a formal hearing prochilo,at noting that,at times,a chambers conference,a telephone conference,or even simply the submission of affidavits might suffice.
these duty to inquire cases primarily dealt with motions concerning appointed counsel,whereas here noriega was still retained counsel at the time the motions at issue were filed nonetheless,in woodard,a sixth amendment right to counsel case involving retained counsel,we drew on allen,one of our counsel precedents,for the proposition that w hen a defendant voices objections to counsel,the trial court should inquire into the reasons for the dissatisfaction.woodard,at citing allen,at.although the woodard panel expressed some question about the applicability of the allen factors to motions concerning retained counsel,see supra note,it expressed no reservation about the duty of the court to inquire about the nature of the conflict when faced with a motion seeking substitution of retained counsel.hence,this duty to inquire applies with equal force whether the counsel at issue is appointed or retained 
the situation presented here is unusual in that the possibility of substituting defense counsel was first brought to the court attention by the government motion of april.the court then ruled on that motion the day after it was filed without giving díaz rodríguez an opportunity to respond either by written submission or court appearance.although we acknowledge the heavy demands of the district court docket in puerto rico,the court failure to inquire in any fashion about the alleged breakdown in the relationship is incompatible with the precedent already noted requiring such inquiry.it is telling that the government motion did not even seek the relief the cou
