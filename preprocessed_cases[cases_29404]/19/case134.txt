juan smith,petitioner burl cain,warden 
on writ of certiorari to the orleans parish criminal district court of louisiana 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
the state of louisiana charged petitioner juan smith with killing five people during an armed robbery.at smith trial a single witness,larry boatner,linked smith to the crime.boatner testified that he was socializing at a friend house when smith and two other gunmen entered the home,demanded money and drugs,and shortly thereafter began shooting,resulting in the death of five of boatner friends.in court boatner identified smith as the first gunman to come through the door.he claimed that he had been face to face with smith during the initial moments of the robbery.no other witnesses and no physical evidence implicated smith in the crime.
the jury convicted smith of five counts of murder.the louisiana court of appeal affirmed smith conviction.state smith,so.the louisiana supreme court denied review,as did this court,so.
smith then sought postconviction relief in the state courts.as part of his effort,smith obtained files from the police investigation of his case,including those of the lead investigator,detective john ronquillo.ronquillo notes contain statements by boatner that conflict with his testimony identifying smith as a perpetrator.the notes from the night of the murder state that boatner could not supply a description of the perpetrators other then sic they were black males.app.ronquillo also made a handwritten account of a conversation he had with boatner five days after the crime,in which boatner said he could not id anyone because he could see faces and would not know them if he saw them.at.and ronquillo typewritten report of that conversation states that boatner told ronquillo he could not identify any of the perpetrators of the murder.at.
smith requested that his conviction be vacated,arguing,inter alia,that the prosecution failure to disclose ronquillo notes violated this court decision in brady maryland.the state trial court rejected smith brady claim,and the louisiana court of appeal and louisiana supreme court denied review.we granted certiorari,and now reverse.
under brady,the state violates a defendant right to due process if it withholds evidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the defendant guilt or punishment.see,at.the state does not dispute that boatner statements in ronquillo notes were favorable to smith and that those statements were not disclosed to him.the sole question before us is thus whether boatner statements were material to the determination of smith guilt.we have explained that evidence is material within the meaning of brady when there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed,the result of the proceeding would have been different.cone bell.a reasonable probability does not mean that the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,only that the likelihood of a different result is great enough to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.kyles whitley,internal quotation marks omitted.
we have observed that evidence impeaching an eyewitness may not be material if the state other evidence is strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict.see united states agurs,and.that is not the case here.boatner testimony was the only evidence linking smith to the crime.and boatner undisclosed statements directly contradict his testimony boatner told the jury that he had n o doubt that smith was the gunman he stood face to face with on the night of the crime,but ronquillo notes show boatner saying that he could not id anyone because he could see faces and would not know them if he saw them.app.boatner undisclosed statements were plainly material.
the state and the dissent advance various reasons why the jury might have discounted boatner undisclosed statements.they stress,for example,that boatner made other remarks on the night of the murder indicating that he could identify the first gunman to enter the house,but not the others.that merely leaves us to speculate about which of boatner contradictory declarations the jury would have believed.the state also contends that boatner statements made five days after the crime can be explained by fear of retaliation.smith responds that the record contains no evidence of any such fear.again,the state argument offers a reason that the jury could have disbelieved boatner undisclosed statements,but gives us no confidence that it would have done so.
the police files that smith obtained in state postconviction proceedings contain other evidence that smith contends is both favorable to him and material to the verdict.because we hold that boatner undisclosed statements alone suffice to undermine confidence in smith conviction,we have no need to consider his arguments that the other undisclosed evidence also requires reversal under brady.
the judgment of the orleans parish criminal district court of louisiana is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the orleans parish criminal district court of louisiana 
justice thomas,dissenting.
the court holds that juan smith is entitled to a new murder trial because the state,in violation of brady maryland,did not disclose that the eyewitness who identified smith at trial stated shortly after the murders that he could not identify any of the perpetrators.i respectfully dissent.in my view,smith has not shown a reasonable probability that the jury would have been persuaded by the undisclosed evidence.united states bagley,opinion of blackmun.that materiality determination must be made in the context of the entire record,united states agurs,and turns on the cumulative effect of all such evidence suppressed by the government,kyles whitley.applying these principles,i would affirm the judgment of the louisiana trial court.
the evidence presented at trial showed the following facts.on march,larry boatner and several friends gathered at rebe espadron home in new orleans.boatner and others were drinking and talking in the kitchen when boatner heard the loud sound of a car without a muffler outside.as boatner opened the kitchen outside door to investigate the noise,armed men pushed their way through the door,demanding drugs and money.tr.the first man though the door put a gun in boatner face and pushed him backwards,at.the men initially ordered boatner and his friends to the floor,but then ordered boatner to stand up.at that time,the man who had been the first one through the door placed his gun under boatner chin,at.when boatner asked what the men wanted him to do,the first man struck boatner on the back of the head with his gun,knocking boatner back to the ground,at.
after hearing the commotion,espadron emerged from a back bedroom,where she had been when the men entered the house.as espadron opened an inside door leading to the kitchen,a man with a covering over his mouth pointed his gun at her face and ordered her to the floor,at.disregarding his command,espadron ran back toward the bedroom,at which point the intruders opened fire,at.
when the shooting was over,four people lay dead.a fifth person,shelita russell,was mortally wounded and died later at the hospital.of those originally gathered in the house,the only survivors were boatner,who suffered a severe laceration to his head from the first man blow but was otherwise uninjured espadron,who escaped unharmed and reginald harbor,who had remained in a back bedroom during the shooting.the police also found a man named phillip young at the scene.young was alive but had suffered a gunshot wound to the head.because boatner,espadron,and harbor had never seen young before,the police surmised that young had been one of the perpetrators 
new orleans police officer joseph narcisse was a first responder to the scene of the shooting.he testified at trial that he encountered boatner in the bathroom of espadron home,where boatner was attempting to care for the laceration to his head.according to narcisse,boatner had let inside the perpetrators and did see them.at.narcisse further explained that boatner had a description of the person that he saw,the details of which narcisse could not recall,at.
detective john ronquillo,the lead investigator of the shootings,testified that boatner had described the first man through the kitchen door as having a haircut,a lot of golds in his teeth,and n.at.ronquillo further testified that boatner could describe no other perpetrator,but that boatner had viewed the first man twice once when the man initially came through the door and again when boatner was ordered to stand up and the man held a gun to his chin,at.
ronquillo also testified that,during the four months following the shootings,boatner viewed photograph arrays of potential suspects only one of which contained a picture of smith,at.three weeks after the crime,ronquillo presented boatner with one of the arrays that did not include a picture of smith.ronquillo recalled that boatner noted that one man in the array had a similar haircut and a similar expression on his face as the gentleman that came into the house initially with the gun that boatner confronted,but that boatner was positive this was the individual.at see also record.a few months later,ronquillo presented boatner with the array that included a photograph of smith.tr.ronquillo testified that boatner identified smith immediately,stating,this is it.i never forget that face.at.of the photographs that boatner viewed,smith photograph was the only one that boatner identified.
boatner identified smith again when he was called to the stand during smith trial.boatner testified that smith face was the s ame face,at,and that smith mouth was the s ame mouth full of gold,as that of the first man who came through the kitchen door on the night of the attack.boatner also testified that smith hair at trial was shaved on the sides as it was during the crime,but that the top was a little bit lower at the time of the murders,at.boatner explained that,during the attack,he had focused on the first man through the door who was unmasked but that he did notice the faces of any of the other assailants or whether they were masked,at.on,boatner testified that he had described the first man build,haircut,and gold teeth jewelry to the police,at.
based on this evidence,the jury convicted smith of murder.following the conclusion of direct review,smith petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief.smith argued that the state had failed to disclose various police notes revealing favorable evidence material to smith guilt.as relevant here,those items include pretrial statements by boatner statements by victim shelita russell and espadron neighbor,dale mims a pretrial statement by firearms examiner kenneth leary statements by cosuspect robert trackling and trackling fellow inmate,eric rogers and a statement by cosuspect phillip young.after holding a evidentiary hearing,the postconviction judge who had also presided over smith trial denied smith brady claims.
like the postconviction court below,i conclude that smith is not entitled to a new trial under brady.in my view,smith has not established a reasonable probability that the cumulative effect of this evidence would have caused the jury to change its verdict.
smith first identifies two undisclosed statements by boatner,which the court concludes are plainly material.ante,at.first,a note by ronquillo,documenting a conversation he had with boatner at the scene,states that boatner could not supply a description of the perpetrators other th a n they were black males.record.second,a handwritten note by ronquillo,documenting a phone conversation he had with boatner on march,five days after the murders,states that boatner could not id anyone because could see faces glanced at one saw man through door ca tell if had faces covered did see anyone could not id would not know them if i saw them.at.ronquillo typed summary of this note states that boatner advised him that he could not identify any perpetrators of the murder.at.
smith is correct that these undisclosed statements could have been used to impeach boatner and ronquillo during.but the statements are not material for purposes of brady because they can not reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.kyles,at.when weighed against the substantial evidence that boatner had opportunities to view the first perpetrator,offered consistent descriptions of him on multiple occasions,and even identified him as smith,the undisclosed statements do not warrant a new trial.
the evidence showed that,notwithstanding ronquillo note,boatner offered a description of the perpetrator at the scene.officer narcisse testified that boatner provided him with a description of the perpetrator that boatner saw.narcisse testimony thus corroborated boatner trial testimony that he saw the first man and described him to police narcisse testimony also mitigated the impeachment value of ronquillo note by indicating that,although boatner may have provided no detailed description to ronquillo at the scene,boatner had described the first man to another officer 
in any event,ronquillo notes reflect that boatner provided a description of the first perpetrator at the police station only a few hours after the shootings occurred.tr.boatner was asked if he could describe the subjects wh o shot the people in the house.record.he responded i can tell you about one,the one who put the pistol in my face,he was a black male with a low cut,gold s in his mouth about my complexion,brown skinned.ibid.when asked,y ou say you ca describe any of the other shooters besides the one who put the gun in your face after you opened the door,boatner replied,no,i ca.ibid.in his brief,smith cites this station house statement as an example of favorable,undisclosed evidence.but this statement actually corroborates boatner trial testimony that he saw and described the first perpetrator to police and that he did not get a good look at the other assailants.moreover,the description boatner provided was consistent with smith appearance.the court completely ignores boatner station house statement,but our cases instruct us to evaluate the net effect of the evidence withheld by the state in assessing materiality.see kyles,supra,at.
the evidence not only shows that boatner described the first perpetrator twice in the immediate aftermath of the crime,but also that boatner described him again three weeks later when he viewed a photograph array and eliminated a individual.the evidence before the jury further indicated that,several months after the crime,boatner confidently identified smith in an array,after evincing a discriminating,careful eye over a investigative period.what is more,the reliability of boatner identification was extensively tested during at smith trial.in particular,boatner was asked whether the fact that he saw smith picture in a newspaper article naming smith as a suspect had tainted his identification.boatner did not waiver,responding,i picked out the person i seen come in that house that held a gun to my head and under my chin and the person that was there when all my friends died.tr.that boatner credibly rejected defense counsel suggestion theory is supported by the fact that boatner did not identify cosuspect robert trackling whose photograph was included in a separate array shown to boatner on the same day that boatner identified smith even though trackling picture was next to smith in the same newspaper article.record.
when weighed against boatner repeated and consistent descriptions and confident and identifications,boatner march statement is also immaterial.as an initial matter,ronquillo note of his march conversation with boatner contains an internal contradiction that undercuts its impeachment value.although the note states that boatner did see anyone,it also states that boatner glanced at one saw man through door.at.the latter part is consistent with boatner repeated statements that he only saw the first man through the door.moreover,the jury would have evaluated any equivocation in boatner statement in light of the fact that he made it a mere five days after a traumatic shooting,when the perpetrators were still at large.the jury would have considered boatner trial testimony that,following the murders of his friends,he began having nightmares,had difficulty sleeping,quit his job,and began drinking heavily so much so that he checked into a hospital for substance abuse treatment and grief counseling.tr.any impeachment value in the march note would have been further mitigated by the fact that,as ronquillo explained,on the night of the incident boatner said that he could identify someone and he gave a description that was very close to smith description.at.and,following his march conversation with ronquillo,boatner viewed numerous photograph arrays,described the first perpetrator,and ultimately identified him as smith.
of course,had the jury been presented with ronquillo notes of boatner and march statements,it might have believed that boatner could not identify any of the perpetrators,but a possibility of a different verdict is insufficient to establish a brady violation.see strickler greene,see also agurs,at the mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense,or might have affected the outcome of the trial,does not establish materiality in the constitutional sense.rather,a petitioner burden is to establish a reasonable prob ability of a different result.strickler,supra,at.
instead of requiring smith to show a reasonable probability that boatner undisclosed statements would have caused the jury to acquit,the court improperly requires the state to show that the jury would have given boatner undisclosed statements no weight.see ante,at t he state argument offers a reason that the jury could have disbelieved boatner undisclosed statements,but gives us no confidence that it would have done so but smith is not entitled to a new trial simply because the jury could have accorded some weight to boatner undisclosed statements.smith burden is to show a reasonable probability that the jury would have accorded those statements sufficient weight to alter its verdict.in light of the record as a whole which the court declines to consider smith has not carried that burden.
smith also argues that statements by shelita russell and dale mims documented in ronquillo handwritten notes could have been used to impeach boatner identification of smith because the statements indicate that the perpetrators were masked.one undated note,which contains several entries about various aspects of the investigation,states,female face down against cabinets conscious.on the next line,the note continues,said in kitchen saw people barge in one black cloth across face first one through door no further statement.record.when during the postconviction hearing about whether this note documented the statement of russell,ronquillo confirmed that the note was in his handwriting,but he testified that he never talked to russell,that he did not know when the note was made,and that someone else could have relayed the information to him.tr,i will assume arguendo that,had this note been disclosed,it would have been admissible at smith trial as a dying declaration of russell but the note would have had minimal impeachment value because,contrary to smith assertions,it is ambiguous in light of the context in which the statement was made.officer narcisse testified that russell was conscious and able to talk,but that she was in bad condition.at.similarly,reginald harbor testified that,as russell lay wounded,she was whining and he did catch nothing t hat she said.at.and,although smith contends that the note says exactly that the first person through the door had a black cloth across his face,that is not how the note reads.reply brief for petitioner emphasis deleted internal quotation marks omitted hereinafter reply brief.the note first states that the declarant saw people barge in,then states one black cloth across face first one through door no further statement.record emphasis added.it is at least as logical to read this statement as indicating only that one of the people had a black cloth across his face.russell,suffering from fatal wounds,said nothing further after first one through door,and it is impossible to know whether the first one was also the one with a black cloth across his face.
the second statement smith identifies is that of dale mims,who lived down the street from espadron home and who heard the shooting.a note by ronquillo states that mims saw four males fleeing espadron home,all wearing mask s.at.like russell purported statement,this statement has minimal impeachment value in light of the record.mims undisclosed statement does not address whether some or all of the perpetrators were masked inside espadron home moreover,had mims been called as a witness at trial,he presumably would have testified,as he did at the postconviction hearing,that he was positive that he only saw three perpetrators fleeing,and that,of those three,only two were masked.tr.
both russell purported statement and mims testimony are consistent with boatner testimony that he did not know whether any of the other perpetrators were masked,at,and with officer narcisse and espadron testimony that the single perpetrator whom espadron observed was wearing some sort of face cover ing,at,at.thus,the totality of the evidence indicates that some,but not all,of the perpetrators were masked,a conclusion that in no way undermines boatner consistent assertions that the only perpetrator he saw was unmasked.
smith also contends that ronquillo undisclosed note documenting a pretrial statement by firearms examiner kenneth leary is material for purposes of brady.the note states that leary advised ronquillo that the ammunition confiscated from the scene of the murders was typed to have been fired from a n intratec,mac model type,semi automatic weapon.record.according to smith,this statement conflicts with leary trial testimony that the ammunition found at the scene was fired by on
