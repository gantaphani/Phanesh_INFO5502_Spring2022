kormahyah karmue appeals his convictions on three federal counts conspiracy to commit arson,wire fraud,and mail fraud.he also challenges his sentence.the convictions and sentence relate to karmue alleged participation in a scheme to burn down a tenement house that karmue owned so that he could collect the insurance proceeds.we affirm.
on may,following the fire at the tenement house,karmue was indicted for conspiracy to commit arson,n arson,i and wire fraud,mail fraud,and theft of government funds.on april,karmue pled guilty to theft of government funds.he then proceeded to trial on the other counts.after a jury trial,he was convicted on all counts except arson,i and.karmue now challenges his conviction on three different grounds.we consider each in turn.
karmue first seeks the reversal of his convictions on the ground that the district court erred by conducting a portion of what is known as a daubert hearing in his absence.see daubert merrell dow.the hearing was held to determine whether to permit an arson investigator,sean reddy,to testify at trial not only as a fact witness as the officer who investigated the fire,but also as an expert for the government regarding the cause of the fire.
karmue attorney at the time,george west,was present for the first day of the daubert hearing,and so,too,was karmue.but karmue did not attend the second day of the daubert hearing,and west objected that,given karmue absence,the holding of the hearing would violate karmue sixth amendment rights.nonetheless,the district court proceeded with the second day of the hearing.on appeal,karmue reasserts his sixth amendment challenge,and also contends that the decision to proceed with the daubert hearing in his absence violated both his due process rights and federal rule of criminal procedure a.
karmue raised the sixth amendment challenge below,and so our review is de novo.united states liriano,cir.we have previously stated that the confrontation clause has historically applied to testimony elicited at,and evidence produced for,trial,and we have noted that the confrontation right has never been extended beyond the context of a trial.united states,cir.but,we have not completely foreclosed the possibility that the confrontation clause might apply to a pretrial hearing of some sort,see id.at,and we also have not previously considered the specific issue of whether a pretrial daubert hearing might qualify as a hearing to which the right guaranteed by the confrontation clause could attach.
in this case,however,karmue challenge fails even if we were to assume that the confrontation clause does apply,as any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states,cir.the record fully supports the daubert ruling that the district court made.karmue neither argues that the district court ruling was erroneous nor explains how his presence at the second day of the hearing could conceivably have revealed any error.in addition,at trial,karmue counsel objected to reddy providing expert testimony only as to the portion of reddy testimony that concerned his opinion that the fire was deliberately set.yet there was overwhelming independent evidence that the fire was deliberately set see united states godfrey,cir.holding that overwhelming evidence of the fact for which the challenged testimony was entered suffices to show that an error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
karmue separately contends that he had a due process right to be present at the daubert hearing and that this right was infringed.specifically,he contends that there was a due process violation because his presence at the daubert hearing would have ha d a relation,reasonably substantial,to the fulness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.kentucky stincer.
karmue did not raise this issue below,however,and so our review is only for plain error.karmue thus must show,among other things,both that any error was clear or obvious and that it affected his substantial rights.united states savarese,cir.he has done neither.
even assuming that this pretrial hearing is the type to which the due process right to be present described in stincer applies,the right is infringed only if the defendant presence would have contribute d to the fairness of the procedure.stincer,at.it is not clear or obvious,however,what the benefit of karmue presence at the hearing would have been.while karmue does contend in his briefing to us that he would have been able to assist counsel at the daubert hearing,he does not explain what assistance he could have rendered in a hearing about reddy credentials as an expert.nor does karmue make any concrete argument about how his absence on that second day of the daubert hearing impeded his ability to effectively assist his lawyer in preparing for reddy at trial.
moreover,karmue due process challenge fails on plain error review because even assuming a clear or obvious error karmue can not demonstrate that the district court decision to proceed with the hearing in karmue absence affected his substantial rights,which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.united states,cir.as we have already explained,there was overwhelming independent evidence that the fire was deliberately set,and karmue conclusory allegations do not establish the required showing of prejudice to prevail under the plain error standard.united states hayes,cir.
finally,karmue contends that the decision to proceed with the hearing in his absence violated rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure.because karmue raises this challenge,too,for the first time on appeal,our review is,again,only for plain error.and again,karmue fails to show either that any error was clear or obvious or that it affected his substantial rights.
the text of rule a provides that the defendant must be present at every trial stage.fed.crim.a emphasis added.the advisory committee notes then explain that this rule,which set s forth the necessity of the defendant presence at arraignment and trial,is a restatement of existing law.this principle does not apply to hearings on motions made prior to or after trial.fed.crim.advisory committee notes to adoption emphasis added citations omitted.
karmue identifies no precedent holding that the rule despite its text and the advisory committee notes somehow does apply to the pretrial hearing at issue here,and two circuits have held that it does not apply to other kinds of pretrial hearings.see united states burke,cir.no right to be present at a pretrial suppression hearing taylor united states,cir.per curiam no right to be present for a hearing on motions in limine.karmue thus can not show that,in this case,there was a clear or obvious violation of rule a.see savarese,at.
nor can karmue meet the prong of the plain error standard that requires him to show that any clear or obvious violation of rule a prejudiced his substantial rights.see,at.as we have explained,there was,wholly apart from reddy expert testimony,overwhelming independent evidence that the fire was deliberately set.
karmue next challenge concerns a correction that the government was allowed to make,to a statutory citation that was contained in count i of the superseding indictment.karmue contends that this change was impermissible,and that,had he been aware of the correct statutory citation prior to trial,his decision not to plead guilty and to proceed to trial would have been affected though he does not say precisely how.
the relevant facts as to this aspect of karmue challenge are as follows.prior to the correction of the citation,the caption to count i of the superseding indictment,for conspiracy to commit arson,cited to m.on june,the government moved to correct the citation pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure c.the government contended that the caption to the count should have cited to n,rather than to m.
karmue attorney at the time,edward pepe,did not oppose the government motion.on june,the magistrate judge assigned to the case granted the motion in a text order.the order was entered on karmue docket sheet.but that order for some reason made the correction only as to the indictment for
