joseph martinez was charged with two counts of carjacking,one count of using,carrying,and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence,and four counts of illegal possession of firearms seen in photographs on martinez cell phone.he pled guilty to the carjacking counts and not guilty to the others.after a jury trial,martinez was convicted on all five remaining counts and sentenced to months in prison.he appeals his convictions and sentence,arguing that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find that he brandished a real gun during the carjacking,that the trial judge erred in admitting testimony from the government firearms expert related to the illegal possession counts,and that his sentence was unreasonable following a careful review of his claims,we affirm.
because martinez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him on the brandishing count,we state the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states,cir.
on september,at approximately,zuleyka arroyo drove her niece,stephanie ramirez,to the martinez nadal train station in puerto rico.ramirez had left her own suv in the train station parking lot earlier in the day and had asked her aunt to drive her there after work so she could pick it up.arroyo parked next to her niece suv,and ramirez switched cars.ramirez had turned her car on and was preparing to back out of her parking space when a white toyota pulled up in the parking lot behind the two women.two men,aged between and years old,also appeared behind them.one of the men,later identified as martinez,approached ramirez suv holding what the women described as a small,black pistol.he yelled at ramirez to get out of her car and held the pistol to her head.ramirez complied.martinez got into ramirez suv and,after heeding her pleas to throw her bag of college books to her,drove away.
meanwhile,the second man approached arroyo and stood approximately two feet away from her,pointing at her what was described as a second black pistol.after martinez left,the second man got into arroyo suv but,finding himself unable to turn off the emergency brake,called arroyo over to the car.pushing the muzzle of his pistol against her abdomen,he demanded that she lower the emergency brake handle.arroyo later described the pistol as feeling hard and a bit cold.she complied,but pleaded with him not to take the car and leave her stranded in the parking lot with her niece.he responded by saying that he needed the car,but he agreed to give arroyo her house keys.he then drove away in arroyo suv.
arroyo later recognized martinez and his accomplice in a photo she saw posted on facebook and identified the two men to the police.when martinez was taken into custody the police seized a cell phone from him,which was later found to contain at least four photos of martinez with guns.
in july,a grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging martinez with two counts of carjacking and one count of brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.martinez was also indicted on four counts of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon based on the photos discovered on his phone.as noted,he pled guilty to the two counts of carjacking but elected to go to trial on the other five counts.he was found guilty on all counts.
martinez was subsequently sentenced to months for each of the carjacking and illegal possession offenses,to be served concurrently.the district court also imposed a consecutive sentence of months for brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence,which included a variance over the sentence.this appeal followed.
sufficiency of the evidence for brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence 
martinez argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient for the jury to find that he brandished a firearm during the carjacking.a conviction under c requires proof that the defendant wielded a firearm,which is defined as 
a any weapon including a starter gun which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive b the frame or receiver of any such weapon c any firearm muffler or firearm silencer or d any destructive device.such term does not include an antique firearm.
a.the firearm must be real,rather than a toy or replica,but it need not be prove d to be loaded or operable.united states taylor,cir.quoting united states kirvan,cir.

at trial,both arroyo and ramirez testified about martinez use of a gun during the carjacking.martinez argues that because neither woman actually stated that the gun was real,their testimony about the gun was not specific enough to support a jury finding to that effect.he also attempts to cast doubt on their ability to adequately see the object in his hand,asserting that the parking lot was not well lit and that ramirez could see only part of the gun.
martinez attempt to discredit the evidence before the jury is unavailing.both women described the object as a black pistol.arroyo also testified that she knew the difference between a pistol and a revolver,permitting the jury to infer that she had some familiarity with firearms neither woman referred to the gun in martinez hand in any way that would indicate that it was not real.see united states,cir.finding that the totality of evidence,including the lack of an indication in the witness testimony that the pistol described by the witnesses was fake,supported an inference by the jury that the defendant used a real gun.moreover,the two witnesses reactions to the gun provide further circumstantial evidence that they believed it to be real both women gave up their cars and keys in response to the threats of martinez and his accomplice,and arroyo testified that she thought martinez was going to kill her niece.see de,at finding sufficient evidence for a c conviction based,in part,upon evidence of the victims reaction indicating that they believed the defendant gun was real.
nor is there any reason to doubt the witnesses testimony that they could see the gun.both arroyo and ramirez pointed out that the parking lot was lit,and arroyo noted that she had parked her suv directly next to a lamp post.ramirez also testified that she could see clearly during the episode.moreover,arroyo,who observed the gun from only to feet away while martinez pointed it at her niece,testified that she was paying close attention because i thought he was going to kill her.
martinez also attempts a more general challenge to arroyo and ramirez testimony,arguing that the testimony of a lay witness who lacks experience with guns is categorically insufficient to prove that an object is a real gun.instead,he argues,the testimony of an expert witness is required,or,as in roberson,at least the testimony of a witness who handled the object at issue and has some familiarity with firearms.see at.along with other circuits,we have squarely rejected the argument that such expert testimony is necessary.see taylor,at lay opinion testimony may be employed to propel a finding that an object is in fact a real gun see also,united states lawson,cir.united states stenger,cir.furthermore,a witness need not be familiar with firearms,nor have held the weapon to testify that it was real.see united states jones,cir.finding testimony of eyewitnesses who were not familiar with weapons sufficient to sustain conviction under c parker united states,cir.rejecting the contention that eyewitness testimony will not suffice to establish that an object is a gun unless it was given by persons knowledgeable about firearms who had an opportunity to examine the weapon closely.
martinez argues that these precedents should be reevaluated in light of the amendments to rule of the federal rules of evidence,which he claims were intended to mak e it much more difficult for laypersons to testify as to issues better left for experts.that argument,which was limited to one sentence of appellant brief,was raised in such a perfunctory manner that we deem it waived.see united states zannino,cir.i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly,or else forever hold its peace.quoting de castro,cir.even so,this circuit decisions clearly reaffirm that the testimony of a person with specialized knowledge is not required to sustain a jury finding that a gun was real.see,at affirming conviction based on the testimony of four bank employees,none of whom held the gun or had specialized expertise de,at affirming conviction based on the testimony of three bank employees,none of whom held the gun or had specialized expertise.
we therefore reject martinez contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence.
admission of expert testimony 
at trial the government called agent douglas halepaska,a firearms and tool marks examiner for the laboratory division of the federal bureau of investigation fbi,to testify in support of the charges of illegal possession of a firearm.halepaska analyzed photos found on martinez phone showing martinez in possession of guns,which served as the basis for the illegal possession charges.
the government presented halepaska conclusions as expert testimony.pursuant to federal rule of evidence,halepaska first testified about his qualifications and methods.he described in detail the lengthy and extensive training program he had undergone at the fbi before being certified as a firearms and tool mark examiner.he then explained the various kinds of forensic analyses he performs on firearms evidence.for photographs such as those on martinez phone,he performs an association examination,or more specifically a photograph analysis,in which he examines specific physical characteristics of the gun in a photo and determines which manufacturers and models of guns are consistent with those features.after making an initial assessment,he obtains firearms from the fbi collection of over reference firearms to compare directly with the photos.he then creates an illustration that mimics the photo by placing the reference firearm in a similar position to that of the unknown gun.this positioning allows him to make a direct comparison of features so that he can narrow the subset of potential firearms that are consistent with the pictured gun.
upon questioning by defense counsel,halepaska admitted that his examination in this case was only the third association analysis he had conducted since being certified,and that this was the first time he had testified in court about an association examination.at that point defense counsel objected to his qualification as an expert.the judge overruled the objection and declared halepaska an expert in determining whether an object in a photograph is consistent with a specific brand or model of gun.
halepaska then testified that he had conducted a photograph analysis of three of the photos found on martinez phone,each of which featured martinez with an object that appeared to be a gun halepaska concluded that the item in each of the three photos was consistent with a pistol manufactured by glock.on cross examination,however,he admitted that he could not determine whether the guns in the photos were functional firearms,replica firearms,or toy firearms.he explained that,in order to determine whether a gun was real,he would need to examine it in person.
martinez claims that halepaska testimony failed to meet the requirements of federal rule of evidence.that rule imposes a role on the trial judge to ensure that an expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.united states vargas,cir.quoting daubert merrell dow.it states 
a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if 
a the expert scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue 
b the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data 
c the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and 
d the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting halepaska testimony,alleging defects relating to all but the last of the rule requirements.he contends that halepaska was unqualified to offer expert testimony to the jury because he had not been trained to distinguish replica and toy guns from real guns,that halepaska testimony was not helpful to the jury,that it was not based on sufficient data,and that the government did not establish that halepaska had used reliable principles and methods to reach his conclusions.
although martinez objected generally to halepaska qualification as an expert witness at trial,none of these specific critiques of halepaska qualifications as an expert was raised before the district court.consequently,none of these arguments was preserved for appeal,suggesting the applicability of plain error review.see united states mercado,cir.it is well established that an objection on one ground does not preserve appellate review of a different ground.quoting negron caleb brett,cir.united states diaz,cir.applying plain error review after concluding that an objection to an expert qualifications was insufficient to preserve a challenge to the reliability of the expert methods.
oddly,the government ignores the plain error issue and asserts that the trial judge ruling should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.see joiner,stating that a district court decision to admit or exclude expert testimony is generally reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.because of the government failure to request plain error review,we will apply the standard of review applicable to a properly preserved claim.united states,cir.w hen the government fails to request plain error review,we may review the claim under the standard of review that is applied when the issue is properly preserved below.alteration in original quoting united states,cir.accordingly,we review the district court decision to admit halepaska testimony for abuse of discretion,keeping in mind that trial judges are afforded substantial latitude in the admission or exclusion of opinion evidence.first marblehead house,cir.quoting crowe marchand,cir.
turning to martinez arguments,we note that two of them miss the mark because they are based on the same false premise.first,martinez argues that halepaska was unqualified to offer expert testimony to the jury because he had not been trained to distinguish replica and toy guns from real guns.second,he asserts that halepaska did not have a sufficient factual basis to determine whether the guns in the photos were real or replicas because he was unable to examine the actual firearms pictured in the photos.both arguments are based on the incorrect assertion that halepaska offered testimony that the guns in the photos were real.
instead,halepaska testimony was limited to opining on the consistency of features he observed on the pictured guns with features of pistols.indeed,halepaska himself stated that he would need to physically examine the gun to determine whether it was real,a replica,or a toy.recognizing that he lacked such a factual basis,halepaska declined to offer any opinion on whether the pictured guns were real.moreover,the district judge qualification of halepaska as an expert was limited in scope to the comparison of features of the pictured and reference guns.specifically,the judge stated i believe that from preliminary questions submitted by counsel to halepaska,that he is qualified as an expert to testify concerning t
