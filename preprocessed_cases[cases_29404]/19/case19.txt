in this case,a jury convicted petitioners juan bravo and hector martínez of bribery in violation of.simultaneously,the jury acquitted them of conspiring to violate and traveling in interstate commerce to violate.because the only contested issue at trial was whether bravo and martínez had violated the other elements of the acquitted charges agreement and travel were undisputed,the jury verdicts were irreconcilably inconsistent.unlike the guilty verdicts in powell,however,petitioners convictions were later vacated on appeal because of error in the judge instructions unrelated to the verdicts inconsistency.in the first circuit view,proscribes only quid pro quo bribery,yet the charge had permitted the jury to find petitioners guilty on a gratuity theory.on remand,bravo and martínez moved for judgments of acquittal on the standalone charges.they argued that the component of the double jeopardy clause barred the government from retrying them on those charges because the jury necessarily determined that they were not guilty of violating when it acquitted them of the related conspiracy and travel act offenses.the district court denied the motions,and the first circuit affirmed,holding that the eventual invalidation of petitioners convictions did not undermine powell instruction that issue preclusion does not apply when the same jury returns logically inconsistent verdicts.
held the component of the double jeopardy clause does not bar the government from retrying defendants,like petitioners,after a jury has returned irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts of conviction and acquittal and the convictions are later vacated for legal error unrelated to the inconsistency.
a because petitioners trial yielded incompatible jury verdicts,petitioners can not establish that the jury necessarily resolved in their favor the question whether they violated.in view of the government inability to obtain review of the acquittals,powell,at,the inconsistent jury findings weigh heavily against according those acquittals effect.the subsequent vacatur of petitioners bribery convictions does not alter this analysis.the critical inquiry is whether the jury actually decided that petitioners did not violate.ashe instructs courts to approach that task with realism and rationality,at,in particular,to examine the trial record with an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings,ibid.the jury verdicts convicting petitioners of violating remain relevant to this practical inquiry,even if the convictions are later vacated on appeal for unrelated trial error.
petitioners could not be retried if the court of appeals had vacated their bribery convictions because of insufficient evidence,see burks united states,or if the trial error could resolve the apparent inconsistency in the jury verdicts.but the evidence here was sufficient to convict petitioners on the quid pro quo bribery theory the first circuit approved.and the instructional error can not account for the jury inconsistent determinations,for the error applied equally to every count.
b petitioners argue that vacated judgments should be excluded from the ashe inquiry because vacated convictions,like the hung counts in yeager,are legal nullities that have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history.yeager,at.that argument misapprehends the ashe inquiry.bravo and martínez bear the burden of showing that the issue whether they violated has been determined by a valid and final judgment of acquittal.at internal quotation marks omitted.to judge whether they carried that burden,a court must realistically examine the record to identify the ground for the acquittals.ashe,at.a conviction that contradicts those acquittals is plainly relevant to that determination,no less so simply because it is later overturned on appeal for unrelated legal error.see powell,at.
petitioners further contend that,under yeager,the convictions are meaningless because the jury was allowed to convict on the basis of conduct not criminal in the first circuit payment of a gratuity.but yeager did not rest on a court inability to detect the basis for a decision the jury in fact rendered.rather,when a jury hangs,there is no decision,hence no inconsistency,at.by contrast,a verdict of guilt is a jury decision,even if subsequently vacated,and therefore can evince jury inconsistency.that is the case here.petitioners gained a second trial on the standalone bribery charges,but they are not entitled to more.issue preclusion is not a doctrine they can commandeer when inconsistent verdicts shroud in mystery what the jury necessarily decided.

justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns the component of the double jeopardy clause in criminal prosecutions,as in civil litigation,the principle means that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment,that issue can not again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.ashe swenson.
does issue preclusion apply when a jury returns inconsistent verdicts,convicting on one count and acquitting on another count,where both counts turn on the very same issue of ultimate fact in such a case,this court has held,both verdicts stand.the government is barred by the double jeopardy clause from challenging the acquittal,see green united states,but because the verdicts are rationally irreconcilable,the acquittal gains no preclusive effect,united states powell.
does issue preclusion attend a jury acquittal verdict if the same jury in the same proceeding fails to reach a verdict on a different count turning on the same critical issue this court has answered yes,in those circumstances,the acquittal has preclusive force.yeager united states.as there is no way to decipher what a hung count represents,we reasoned,a jury failure to decide has no place in the analysis.see,at t he fact that a jury hangs is evidence of nothing other than,of course,that it has failed to decide anything.
in the case before us,the jury returned irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts of conviction and acquittal.without more,powell would control.there could be no retrial of charges that yielded acquittals but,in view of the inconsistent verdicts,the acquittals would have no effect on charges that yielded convictions.in this case,however,unlike powell,the guilty verdicts were vacated on appeal because of error in the judge instructions unrelated to the verdicts inconsistency.petitioners urge that,just as a jury failure to decide has no place in analysis,so vacated guilty verdicts should not figure in that analysis.
we hold otherwise.one can not know from the jury report why it returned no verdict.a host of reasons could account for a jury failure to decide sharp,confusion about the issues,exhaustion after a long trial,to name but a few.yeager,at.but actual inconsistency in a jury verdicts is a reality vacatur of a conviction for unrelated legal error does not reconcile the jury inconsistent returns.we therefore bracket this case with powell,not yeager,and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals,which held that issue preclusion does not apply when verdict inconsistency renders unanswerable what the jury necessarily decided.
the doctrine of claim preclusion instructs that a final judgment on the merits foreclos es successive litigation of the very same claim.new hampshire maine,see restatement second of judgments,hereinafter restatement.so instructing,the doctrine serves to avoid multiple suits on identical entitlements or obligations between the same parties.wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure,ed.wright miller.long operative in civil litigation,restatement,at,claim preclusion is also essential to the constitution prohibition against successive criminal prosecutions.no person,the double jeopardy clause states,shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.amdt.the clause protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction as well,i t protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.north carolina pearce.a verdict of acquittal in our justice system is final,the last word on a criminal charge,and therefore operates as a bar to a subsequent prosecution for the same offense.green united states.
the allied doctrine of issue preclusion ordinarily bars relitigation of an issue of fact or law raised and necessarily resolved by a prior judgment.see restatement,at,wright miller,at.it applies in both civil and criminal proceedings,with an important distinction.in civil litigation,where issue preclusion and its ramifications first developed,the availability of appellate review is a key factor.restatement,comment a,at see,reporter note,at noting the pervasive importance of reviewability in the application of preclusion doctrine in significant part,preclusion doctrine is premised on an underlying confidence that the result achieved in the initial litigation was substantially correct.standefer united states,see restatement,comment f,at.in the absence of appellate review,we have observed,such confidence is often unwarranted.standefer,at.
in civil suits,inability to obtain review is exceptional it occurs typically when the controversy has become moot.in criminal cases,however,only one side the defendant has recourse to an appeal from an adverse judgment on the merits.the government can not secure appellate review of an acquittal,at,even one based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,arizona washington.juries enjoy an unreviewable power to return a verdict of not guilty for impermissible reasons,for the government is precluded from appealing or otherwise upsetting such an acquittal by the constitution double jeopardy clause.united states powell.the absence of appellate review of acquittals,we have cautioned,calls for guarded application of preclusion doctrine in criminal cases.see standefer,at,and.particularly where it appears that a jury verdict is the result of compromise,compassion,lenity,or misunderstanding of the governing law,the government inability to gain review strongly militates against giving an acquittal issue preclusive effect.at.see also restatement,comment g,at where circumstances suggest that an issue was resolved on erroneous considerations,taking the prior determination at face value for purposes of the second action would impermissibly extend the imperfections in the adjudicative process.comment j,at issue preclusion may be denied where it is evident from the jury verdict that the verdict was the result of compromise.wright miller,at same.
this case requires us to determine whether an appellate court vacatur of a conviction alters analysis under the double jeopardy clause.three prior decisions guide our disposition.
this court first interpreted the double jeopardy clause to incorporate the principle of issue preclusion in ashe swenson,ashe involved a robbery of six poker players by a group of masked men.ashe was charged with robbing one of the players,but a jury acquitted him due to insufficient evidence.at.the state then tried ashe again,this time for robbing another of the poker players.aided by substantially stronger testimony from witnesses who were for the most part the same,at,the state secured a conviction.we held that the second prosecution violated the double jeopardy clause.because the sole issue in dispute in the first trial was whether ashe had been one of the robbers,the jury acquittal verdict precluded the state from trying to convince a different jury of that very same fact in a second trial,at.
our decision in ashe explained that issue preclusion in criminal cases must be applied with realism and rationality.at.to identify what a jury in a previous trial necessarily decided,we instructed,a court must examine the record of a prior proceeding,taking into account the pleadings,evidence,charge,and other relevant matter.ibid.quoting mayers yarbrough,bis vexari new trials and successive prosecutions,harv.this inquiry,we explained,must be set in a practical frame and viewed with an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings.at quoting sealfon united states.we have also made clear that t he burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the issue whose relitigation he seeks to foreclose was actually decided by a prior jury verdict of acquittal.schiro farley,internal quotation marks omitted accord dowling united states.
in united states powell,we held that a defendant can not meet this burden when the same jury returns irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts on the question she seeks to shield from reconsideration.powell starting point was our holding in dunn united states,that a criminal defendant may not attack a jury finding of guilt on one count as inconsistent with the jury verdict of acquittal on another count.powell,at.the court opinion in dunn stated no exceptions to this rule,and after dunn the court had several times alluded to the rule as an established principle,at.nevertheless,several courts of appeals had recogniz ed exceptions to the rule,at,and powell sought an exception for the verdicts of guilt she faced.
at trial,a jury had acquitted powell of various substantive drug charges but convicted her of using a telephone in causing and facilitating those same offenses,at.she appealed,arguing that the verdicts were inconsistent,and that she therefore was entitled to reversal of the telephone facilitation convictions.at.issue preclusion,she maintained,barred acceptance of the guilty verdict s on the auxiliary offenses because the same jury had acquitted her of the predicate felonies,at.
rejecting powell argument,we noted that issue preclusion is predicated on the assumption that the jury acted rationally.at.when a jury returns irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts,we said,one can glean no more than that either in the acquittal or the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions.at quoting dunn,at.although it is to discern which verdict the jurors arrived at rationally,we observed,that does not show that they were not convinced of the defendant guilt.powell,at quoting dunn,at.in the event of inconsistent verdicts,we pointed out,it is just as likely that the jury,convinced of guilt,properly reached its conclusion on one count,and then through mistake,compromise,or lenity,arrived at an inconsistent conclusion on the related offense.powell,at.because a court would be at a loss to know which verdict the jury really meant,we reasoned,principles of issue preclusion are not useful,for they are predicated on the assumption that the jury acted rationally and found certain facts in reaching its verdict.at.holding that the acquittals had no preclusive effect on the counts of conviction,we reaffirmed dunn rule,under which both powell convictions and her acquittals,albeit inconsistent,remained undisturbed,at.
finally,in yeager united states,we clarified that powell holding on inconsistent verdicts does not extend to an apparent inconsistency between a jury verdict of acquittal on one count and its inability to reach a verdict on another count.see,at i nconsistent verdicts present an entirely different context than one involving both verdicts and seemingly inconsistent hung counts.yeager was tried on charges of fraud and insider trading,at.the jury acquitted him of the fraud offenses,which the court of appeals concluded must have reflected a finding that he did not have any insider information that contradicted what was presented to the public.at.yet the jury failed to reach a verdict on the charges,as to which the possession of insider information was likewise a critical issue of ultimate fact.at.arguing that the jury had therefore acted inconsistently,the government sought to retry yeager on the hung counts.we ruled that retrial was barred by the double jeopardy clause.
a jury speaks only through its verdict,we noted,at.any number of reasons including confusion about the issues and sheer exhaustion,we observed could cause a jury to hang.ibid.accordingly,we said,only a jury decisions,not its failures to decide,identify what a jury necessarily determined at trial.at.because a hung count reveals nothing more than a jury failure to reach a decision,we further reasoned,it supplies no evidence of the jury irrationality,at.hung counts,we therefore held,ha ve no place in the analysis,at when a jury acquits on one count while failing to reach a verdict on another count concerning the same issue of ultimate fact,the acquittal,and only the acquittal,counts for preclusion purposes.given the preclusive effect of the acquittal,the court concluded,yeager could not be retried on the hung count,at.
with our controlling precedent in view,we turn to the inconsistent verdicts rendered in this case.the prosecution stemmed from an alleged bribe paid by petitioner juan bravo,an entrepreneur,to petitioner hector martínez,then a senator serving the commonwealth of puerto rico.the alleged bribe took the form of an trip to las vegas,including a seat at a professional boxing match featuring a popular puerto rican contender.united states fernandez.according to the government,bravo intended the bribe to secure martínez help in shepherding legislation through the puerto rico senate that,if enacted,would provid e substantial financial benefits to bravo enterprise.ibid.in the leadup to the las vegas trip,martínez submitted the legislation for the senate consideration and issued a committee report supporting it within a week of returning from las vegas,martínez issued another favorable report and voted to enact the legislation,at.
based on these events,a federal grand jury in puerto rico indicted petitioners for,inter alia,bribery,in violation of conspiracy to violate,in violation of and traveling in interstate commerce to further violations of,in violation of the travel act,a a following a trial,a jury convicted bravo and martínez of the standalone bribery offense,but acquitted them of the related conspiracy and travel act charges.fernandez,at.each received a sentence of months in prison,at.
the court of appeals for the first circuit vacated the convictions for instructional error,at.in the first circuit view,the jury had been erroneously charged on what constitutes criminal conduct under that statute,at.the charge permitted the jury to find bravo and martínez guilty of offering and receiving a gratuity,at,but,the appeals court held,proscribes only quid pro quo bribes,and not gratuities,at,true,the court acknowledged,the jury was instructed on both theories of bribery,and the evidence at trial sufficed to support a guilty verdict on either theory,at.but the court of appeals could not say with confidence that the erroneous charge was harmless,so it vacated the convictions and remanded for further proceedings,at.
on remand,relying on the component of the double jeopardy clause,bravo and martínez moved for judgments of acquittal on the standalone charges.supp.pr.they could not be retried on the bribery offense,they insisted,because the jury necessarily determined that they were not guilty of violating when it acquitted them of conspiring to violate and traveling in interstate commerce to further violations of,at.that was so,petitioners maintained,because the only contested issue at trial was whether bravo had offered,and martínez had accepted,a bribe within the meaning of,at see tr.of oral arg.there was no dispute that they agreed to go to a boxing match together nor was there any dispute that to get to las vegas from puerto rico,you have to travel across state lines.the district court denied the motions for acquittal.supp,at.if the sole issue disputed at trial was whether bravo and martínez had violated,the court explained,then the jury had acted irrationally.at.because the same jury had simultaneously convicted bravo and martínez on the standalone charges,the verdict simply was inconsistent.ibid.
the first circuit affirmed the denial of petitioners motions for acquittal,agreeing that the jury inconsistent returns were fatal to petitioners plea.the jury received the same bribery instructions for each count involving,the court noted,so the verdicts convicting on the standalone bribery charges but acquitting on the related travel act and conspiracy counts could not be reconciled,at 
the court of appeals rejected petitioners argument that the eventual invalidation of the bribery convictions rendered powell rule inapplicable.ashe,the court reminded,calls for a practical appraisal based on the complete record of the prior proceeding the bribery convictions,like the acquittals,were part of that record.see,at.nor are vacated convictions like hung counts for purposes,the court continued.informed by our decision in yeager,the first circuit recognized that a hung count reveals only a jury failure to decide,and therefore can not evidence actual inconsistency with a jury decision,at.in contrast,the court said,vacated convictions are jury decisions,through which the jury has spoken.at.the later upset of a conviction on an unrelated ground,the court reasoned,does not undermine powell recognition that inconsistent verdicts make it impossible to determine what a jury necessarily decided.at.the first circuit therefore concluded that vacated convictions,unlike hung counts,are relevant to the ashe inquiry.ibid.
we granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among courts on this question does the component of the double jeopardy clause bar the government from retrying defendants,like bravo and martínez,after a jury has returned irreconcilably inconsistent verdicts of conviction and acquittal,and the convictions are later vacated for legal error unrelated to the inconsistency.holding that the double jeopardy clause does not bar retrial in these circumstances,we affirm the first circuit judgment.
when a conviction is overturned on appeal,t he general rule is that the double jeopardy clause does not bar reprosecution.justices of boston municipal court lydon.the ordinary consequence of vacatur,if the government so elects,is a new trial shorn of the error that infected the first trial.this continuing jeopardy rule neither gives effect to the vacated judgment nor offends double jeopardy principles.rather,it reflects the reality that the criminal proceedings against an accused have not run their full course.ibid.and by permitting a new trial post vacatur,the rule serves both society and criminal defendants interests in the fair administration of justice.it would be a high price indeed for society to pay,we have recognized,were every accused granted immunity from punishment because of any defect sufficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction.united states tateo.and the rights of criminal defendants would suffer too,for it is at least doubtful that appellate courts would be as zealous as they now are in protecting against the effects of improprieties at the trial or pretrial stage if they knew that reversal of a conviction would put the accused irrevocably beyond the reach of further prosecution.ibid.
bravo and martínez ask us to deviate from the general rule that,post vacatur of a conviction,a new trial is in order.when a conviction is vacated on appeal,they maintain,an acquittal verdict simultaneously returned should preclude the government from retrying the defendant on the vacated count.our precedent,harmonious with doctrine,opposes the foreclosure petitioners seek.
bravo and martínez bear the burden of demonstrating that the jury necessarily resolved in their favor the question whether they violated.schiro,at.but,as we have explained,see supra,at,a defendant can not meet that burden where the trial yielded incompatible jury verdicts on the issue the defendant seeks to insulate from relitigation.here,the jury convicted bravo and martínez of violating but acquitted them of conspiring,and traveling with the intent,to violate.the convictions and acquittals are irreconcilable because other elements of the travel act and conspiracy counts were not disputed.see supra,at,and.it is unknowable which of the inconsistent verdicts the acquittal s or the conviction s the jury really meant.at quoting powell,at see restatement,comment f,at where a determination relied on as preclusive is itself inconsistent with some other adjudication of the same issue,confidence in that determination is generally unwarranted.in view of the government inability to obtain review of the acquittals,powell,at,the inconsistent jury findings weigh heavily against according those acquittals effect.see standefer,at.
that petitioners bribery convictions were later vacated for trial error does not alter our analysis.the critical inquiry is whether the jury actually decided that bravo and martínez did not violate.ashe counsels us to approach that task with realism and rationality,at,in particular,to examine the trial record with an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings,ibid.as the court of appeals explained,the fact that the jury convicted bravo and martínez of violating would seem to be of quite obvious relevance to this practical inquiry,even though the convictions were later vacated.at.because issue preclusion depends on the jury assessment of the facts in light of the charges as presented at trial,a conviction overturned on appeal is appropriately considered in our assessment of an acquittal verdict preclusive effect.united states citron.indeed,the jurors in this case might not have acquitted on the travel act and conspiracy counts absent their belief that the bribery convictions would stand.see ibid.
bravo and martínez could not be retried on the bribery counts,of course,if the court of appeals had vacated their convictions because there was insufficient evidence to support those convictions.for double jeopardy purposes,a court evaluation of the evidence as insufficient to convict is equivalent to an acquittal and therefore bars a second prosecution for the same offense.see burks united states,powell,at noting that defendants are afforded protection against jury irrationality or error by courts independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence but this is scarcely a case in which the prosecution failed to muster sufficient evidence in the first proceeding.burks,at.quite the opposite.the evidence presented at petitioners trial,the court of appeals determined,supported a guilty verdict on the gratuity theory which the first circuit ruled impermissible as well as the quid pro quo theory which the first circuit approved,at.vacatur was compelled for the sole reason that the first circuit found the jury charge erroneous to the extent that it encompassed gratuities.see supra,at,and.therefore,the general rule of allowing a new trial to rectify trial error applied.burks,at emphasis deleted.
nor,as the government acknowledges,would retrial be tolerable if the trial error could resolve the apparent inconsistency in the jury verdicts.see brief for united states if,for example,a jury receives an erroneous instruction on the count of conviction but the correct instruction on the charge on which it acquits,the instructional error may reconcile the verdicts.but the instructional error here can not account for the jury contradictory determinations because the error applied equally to every count.see supra,at.
as in powell,so in this case,t he problem is that the same jury reached inconsistent results.at.the convictions later invalidation on an unrelated ground does not erase or reconcile that inconsistency it does not bear on the factual determinations actually and necessarily made by the jury,nor does it serv e to turn the jury otherwise inconsistent and irrational verdict into a consistent and rational verdict.people wilson,markman,dissenting.bravo and martínez,therefore,can not establish the factual predicate necessary to preclude the government from retrying them on the standalone charges namely,that the jury in the first proceeding actually decided that they did not violate the federal bribery statute.
to support their argument for issue preclusion,bravo and martínez highlight our decision in yeager.in yeager,they point out,we recognized that hung counts have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history.at.that is also true of vacated convictions,they urge,so vacated convictions,like hung counts,should be excluded from the ashe inquiry into what the jury necessarily determined.brief for petitioners.asserting that we have never held an invalid conviction relevant to or evidence of anything,tr.of oral arg,bravo and martínez argue that taking account of a vacated conviction in our analysis would give effect to a legal nullity,brief for petitioners see wilson,at,at majority opinion considering a vacated count would impermissibly bring that legally vacated conviction back to life 
this argument misapprehends the ashe inquiry.it is undisputed that petitioners convictions are invalid judgments that may not be used to establish their guilt.the question is whether issue preclusion stops the government from prosecuting them anew.on that question,bravo and martínez bear the burden of showing that the issue whether they violated has been determined by a valid and final judgment of acquittal.yeager,at internal quotation marks omitted.to judge whether they carried that burden,a court must examine the record to identify the ground for the acquittals.ashe,at.a conviction that contradicts those acquittals is plainly relevant to that determination,no less so simply because it is later overturned on appeal for unrelated legal error the split verdict finding violated on the standalone counts,but not violated on the related travel act and conspiracy counts tells us that,on one count or the other,the jury did not follo w the court instructions,whether because of mistake,compromise,or lenity.powell,at see supra,at.petitioners acquittals therefore do not support the application of issue preclusion here 
further relying on yeager,bravo and martínez contend that their vacated convictions should be ignored because,as with hung counts,there is no way to decipher what they represent.brief for petitioners quoting yeager,at.the convictions are meaningless,they maintain,because the jury was allowed to convict on the basis of conduct not criminal in the first circuit payment of a gratuity.brief for petitioners.
this argument trips on yeager reasoning.yeager did not rest on a court inability to detect the basis for a jury decision.rather,this court reasoned that,when a jury hangs,there is no decision,hence no evidence of irrationality,at.a verdict of guilt,by contrast,is a jury decision,even if subsequently vacated on appeal.it therefore can evince irrationality.
that is the case here.petitioners do not dispute that the government evidence at trial supported a guilty verdict on the quid pro quo theory,or that the gratuity instruction held erroneous by the court of appeals applied to every offense.because no rational jury could have reached conflicting verdicts on those counts,petitioners convictions reveal the jury which is the relevant issue here even if they do not reveal which theory of liability jurors relied upon in reaching those inconsistent verdicts.brief for united states.in other words,because we do not know what the jury would have concluded had there been n
