officer jamie pietroski suffered a lapse in judgment and forcibly removed a compliant matthew raiche from his stopped motorcycle in order to arrest raiche for,ironically,failure to stop.a jury saw the irony and,after a trial on a number of related civil rights claims,awarded raiche damages for injuries sustained as a result of pietroski use of excessive force.pietroski filed motions for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that he was entitled to qualified immunity because he had acted reasonably,and for a new trial on the ground that the jury verdict was not supported by the evidence.the district court denied pietroski motions and entered judgment for raiche.
pietroski now appeals the district court denial of his motions and challenges the validity of the jury verdict on the basis that the evidence does not support a finding of excessive force.after careful review of the record,we agree with the district court that the evidence supports a finding that pietroski acted unreasonably and may not avail himself of qualified immunity protection.we affirm.
background 
the parties present very different versions of the events that culminated in the arrest of raiche at on saturday,august.
according to boston police officers pietroski and james coyne,they were inside their marked police cruiser parked on brigham circle,in roxbury,ma,when they spotted raiche driving his motorcycle without a helmet in violation of.laws ch.the officers testified that they pursued raiche in their cruiser and signaled for him to stop,using the cruiser overhead lights.they then testified that,rather than pulling over,raiche led them on a chase,speeding and going the wrong way down streets.under the officers version of events,raiche only stopped when he negotiated a turn poorly and his motorcycle got stuck between a parked vehicle and the curb of the sidewalk.
raiche testified that no pursuit occurred as far as he could tell,and as soon as he had the opportunity to stop safely after he saw the cruiser flashing lights,he pulled over in the belief that the police wanted to pass him.according to raiche,he pulled over behind a parked vehicle,shut off his motorcycle engine,and bounced the motorcycle between his legs as he waited seconds for the police to pass.instead of passing him,however,the cruiser skidded to a stop at an angle behind him.the next thing he knew,he was being tackled off his bike.
pietroski testified that he exited the cruiser and ran at raiche,shouting that he was a boston police officer and instructing raiche to get down on the ground and show his hands.however,both raiche and coyne testified that they did not hear pietroski identify himself or give raiche any instructions.in any event,pietroski reached raiche within seconds,grabbed him by his shoulders,and either physically lift ed him off his bike and tr ied to pull him as far away from that bike as possible under pietroski version or launched himself in the air and tackled raiche,to the ground under raiche version.raiche forehead struck the sidewalk,and the motorcycle landed on top of his right leg.the force of pietroski takedown also caused the motorcycle handlebars and forks to bend and suffer irreparable damage.
pietroski then pulled up on raiche left arm to apply handcuffs,twisting raiche,who was still tangled up with the motorcycle.according to raiche,he asked,please,can you ease up on my left arm it comes out of socket.raiche testified that his left shoulder was partially dislocated during the handcuffing process.also while handcuffing raiche,pietroski put his knee on the small of raiche back,which caused raiche head to hit the pavement a second time.
as a result of the force used to make the arrest,raiche motorcycle was rendered a total loss.in addition to the temporarily dislocated shoulder,raiche received cuts and abrasions that did not require medical attention.raiche submitted photographs showing cuts on his face,on his right arm,on his right knee,and on the back of his left leg.
raiche was charged with the criminal offense of failure to stop for police officer in violation of.laws ch.
procedural history 
on may,raiche filed suit against officers pietroski and coyne in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.raiche asserted civil rights claims under and the massachusetts civil rights act.laws ch,i mcra,alleging that his arrest had been effected without probable cause and by means of excessive force.raiche also asserted common law claims alleging false imprisonment and assault and battery.
a jury trial began on january.at the close of raiche evidence,the officers filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law based on,inter alia,qualified immunity,and the officers renewed the motion at the close of all evidence pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court denied both motions without written findings or opinion.
on january,the jury returned verdicts in favor of coyne on all claims against him,pietroski on the claims asserting arrest without probable cause,mcra,and false imprisonment,and raiche on claims alleging that pietroski used excessive force to make the arrest,mcra,and assault and battery.the jury awarded raiche in compensatory damages but did not award punitive damages.on may,the district court entered judgment in accordance with the verdicts.
on june,pietroski renewed his motion for judgment as a matter of law based on qualified immunity or,in the alternative,insufficient evidence of excessive force he also moved in the alternative for a new trial on june,the district court denied his motions.pietroski timely filed his notice of appeal on june.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.qualified immunity 
we will first address pietroski argument that he is entitled to qualified immunity.a district court denial of qualified immunity is a legal determination that we review de novo.iacobucci boulter,cir.when reviewing a question of qualified immunity originally resolved after a jury verdict,we must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed at trial,giving deference to the jury discernible resolution of disputed factual issues.id.at.here,the jury returned a verdict in raiche favor on his excessive force claims thus,we construe the facts in a manner supportive of that verdict.see see also jennings jones,cir w here the jury has issued a general verdict we view the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.internal quotation marks and brackets removed.in the end,t he availability of qualified immunity after a trial is a legal question informed by the jury findings of fact,but ultimately committed to the court judgment.monroig,cir.
qualified immunity affords limited protection to public officials faced with liability under,insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.pearson callahan,quoting harlow fitzgerald.thus,to determine whether qualified immunity applies in a given case,we must determine whether a public official has violated a plaintiff constitutionally protected right and whether the particular right that the official has violated was clearly established at the time of the violation.estrada rhode island,cir.these two prongs of the analysis need not be considered in any particular order,and both prongs must be satisfied for a plaintiff to overcome a qualified immunity defense.see maldonado fontanes,cir.additionally,in applying the second prong,we must consider two subsidiary issues a the clarity of the law in general at the time of the alleged violation and b the clarity of the law as applied to the other words,whether a reasonable person in the defendant shoes would have understood that his conduct violated the plaintiff constitutional rights.id.at.in conducting the whole analysis,we must take care to avoid the chilling effect of where the officer,acting in the heat of events,made a defensible albeit imperfect judgment.statchen palmer,cir wl,at citing roy inhabitants of lewiston,cir.
although we do not need to follow the rigid structure that we once did,we will proceed to conduct each step of the analysis in the traditional order.this exercise reveals that,given the jury resolution of the facts,pietroski use of force was not defensible and,therefore,that qualified immunity affords him no refuge.
qualified immunity applied to claim 
pietroski argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity against raiche excessive force claim.we will therefore examine both prongs of qualified immunity analysis as applied to this claim.
prong one the constitutional violation 
excessive force claims are founded on the fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures of the person.see const.amend.iv graham connor.the fourth amendment is implicated where an officer exceeds the bounds of reasonable force in effecting an arrest or investigatory stop.see graham,at.we analyze excessive force claims according to the constitutional touchstone of objective reasonableness,so we do not consider an officer subjective intent or motivation.id.at see also saucier katz,abrogated on other grounds by pearson.instead,we determine whether the defendant officer employed force that was unreasonable under the circumstances.jennings,at see also graham,at.this determination requires us to balance the individual interest against the government,weighing three factors the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,and whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.graham,at see also morelli webster,f d,cir.finally,because our analysis comes after a jury verdict in raiche favor,we must consider the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a finding of excessive force.see jennings,at.this evidence may be in the form of expert testimony,lay testimony,or other evidence,as long as the jury could evaluate the reasonableness of pietroski conduct.id.at.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to raiche,as we must,we conclude that there is ample evidence to support the jury finding that pietroski conduct was unreasonable under the circumstances and,therefore,that a constitutional violation occurred.
first,we consider each of the graham factors in turn to assess the reasonableness of pietroski conduct under the circumstances that he faced.as to the severity of the crimes involved,the police initiated their pursuit because raiche was committing a civil motor vehicle violation by failing to wear a helmet while driving a motorcycle.see.laws ch.the police then arrested raiche for failing to stop when signaled by police.see.laws ch.absent some other heated circumstances,these relatively minor infractions do not justify an officer in the violent act of physically removing a person from a parked motorcycle and slamming him into the pavement,let alone the additional force pietroski applied when raiche was on the ground offering no resistance.as to the threat raiche posed,he remained on his motorcycle behind a parked car and never displayed any weapons or made any verbal threats.and as to whether raiche was attempting to flee or resisting arrest,he was sitting on a stopped motorcycle.moreover,he was not charged with resisting arrest.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to raiche,therefore,the force employed by pietroski was unnecessary to prevent raiche from fleeing.consequently,all of the graham factors indicate that pietroski use of force was wholly unreasonable.
looking beyond the graham factors to the sufficiency of the evidence,we find that the record contains ample evidence to support a determination that pietroski conduct was unreasonable,even under the boston police department own standards.coyne candid testimony is particularly useful here.according to coyne,the boston police academy instructs officers to follow the use of force continuum in determining the proper amount of force to use when conducting a stop.the continuum provides five levels of intensity the presence of a uniformed police officer verbal command,which includes a police car overhead lights or siren command,which entails physically taking control of a person incapacitating devices,such as pepper spray and lethal force.officers are to conduct a traffic stop using the least amount of force necessary and to end the use of force outright when a person has pulled over and stopped.coyne testimony provided a clear framework for the jury to assess pietroski use of force applying this framework,a reasonable jury could easily conclude that the use of force should have ceased when raiche stopped and pulled over in response to the cruiser overhead lights.such a conclusion would compel a finding that pietroski acted unreasonably when he slammed raiche and his motorcycle to the pavement 
notwithstanding our analysis of the graham factors and the sufficiency of the evidence,pietroski contends that the district court failed to account for the jury verdict in his favor on the issue of probable cause.pietroski argues that his limited success means that we should construe the facts in his favor,not raiche.however,we may construe the facts relevant to probable cause in pietroski favor and those relevant to excessive force in raiche favor without any inconsistency.see,gallick baltimore,providing that it is the duty of the courts to attempt to harmonize a jury findings if it is possible under a fair reading of them.indeed,a finding of excessive force may be consistent with a finding of probable cause because the reasonableness of an arrest depends not only on when it is made,after probable cause has accrued but also on how it is carried out.graham,at.
probable cause to make an arrest is satisfied where an officer has reason to believe that a crime has been committed,and this seems to be what the jury found.see iacobucci,at see also logue dore,cir holding that probable cause exists only if the facts within the arresting officer knowledge are sufficient to lead an ordinarily prudent officer to conclude that an offense has been,is being,or is about to be committed.according to the jury verdict form,when pietroski arrested raiche,he had probable cause to believe that raiche had committed the crime of failing to stop for a police officer emphasis added.guided by coyne testimony that the use of a police cruiser overhead lights signals a driver to pull over and stop,the jury could have concluded that the police had probable cause to believe raiche failed to submit when he did not immediately pull over in response to the cruiser overhead lights.under the same set of facts,the jury reasonably could have concluded that raiche pulled over and stopped after he became aware of the cruiser overhead lights and that no use of force was required thereafter.thus,the jury was free to it the arrest was made at a reasonable time after probable cause had accrued,but in an unreasonable manner by the exercise of excessive force.
in all,both the law and the evidence support the jury and the district court determination that pietroski violated raiche fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures by employing excessive force against him.we now turn our attention to the question of whether this right was clearly established at the time pietroski committed the violation.
prong two the right was clearly established 
pietroski may still mount a successful qualified immunity defense if raiche fourth amendment right was not clearly established at the time pietroski committed the violation.as set forth above,to determine whether the right was clearly established,we must consider two subsidiary issues a the clarity of the law in general at the time of the alleged violation and b the clarity of the law as applied to the other words,whether a reasonable person in the defendant shoes would have understood that his conduct violated the plaintiff constitutional rights.maldonado,at.
a.the clarity of the law in general 
to determine whether the law is clear in general,we must define the right allegedly violated at the appropriate level of specificity.wilson layne.once we have defined the right,we often consider whether the violation itself is clearly established a violation is clear either if courts have previously
