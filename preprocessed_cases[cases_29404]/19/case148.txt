in,increasing public concern over the dangers of illicit drugs in particular,the new phenomenon of crack cocaine prompted congress to revise the penalties for criminal offenses involving substances.following several hearings,congress enacted the abuse act of adaa.the statute provides a mandatory minimum sentence for certain drug offenses involving ii kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of ii cocaine,its salts,optical and geometric isomers,and salts of isomers,or iii grams or more of a mixture or substance described in clause ii which contains cocaine base.b a.the statute similarly provides a sentence for offenses involving grams of a substance enumerated in clause ii or grams of one outlined in clause iii.b b.
in,petitioner depierre was indicted for distribution of grams or more of cocaine base under a and b a iii.the district court declined depierre request that the jury be instructed that,in order to find depierre guilty of distribution of cocaine base,it must find that his offense involved crack cocaine.depierre was convicted,and the court sentenced him to the months in prison mandated by the statute.the first circuit affirmed,rejecting depierre argument that b a iii should be read only to apply to offenses involving crack cocaine.instead,it adhered to its precedent holding that cocaine base refers to all forms of cocaine base.
held c ocaine base,as used in b,means not just crack cocaine,but cocaine in its chemically basic form.
a the most natural reading of cocaine base in clause iii is cocaine in its chemically basic form,the molecule found in crack cocaine,freebase,and coca paste.on its plain terms,then,cocaine base reaches more broadly than just crack cocaine.in arguing to the contrary,depierre urges the court to stray far from the statute text,which nowhere contains the term crack cocaine.the government reading,on the other hand,follows the words congress chose to use.depierre is correct that cocaine base is technically redundant chemically speaking,cocaine is a base.but congress had good reason to use cocaine base to make clear that clause iii does not apply to offenses involving cocaine hydrochloride,powder cocaine or other nonbasic substances.at the time the statute was enacted,cocaine was commonly used to refer to powder cocaine,and the scientific and medical literature often uses cocaine to refer to all substances,including ones that are not chemically basic.
b this reading of cocaine base is also consistent with b somewhat confusing structure.subsection b a ii ii lists cocaine,along with its salts,optical and geometric isomers,and salts of isomers,as elements subject to clause ii higher quantity threshold.depierre is correct that,because cocaine and cocaine base both refer to chemically basic cocaine,offenses involving a substance containing such cocaine will always be penalized according to the lower quantity threshold of clause iii,and never the higher threshold clause ii establishes for mixtures and substances containing cocaine.but the court does not agree that the term cocaine in clause ii is therefore superfluous in light of the structure of subclause ii,cocaine is needed as the reference point for salts and isomers,which would otherwise be meaningless.
the term cocaine in clause ii also performs another critical function.clause iii penalizes offenses involving a mixture or substance described in clause ii which contains cocaine base.thus,clause ii imposes a penalty for offenses involving substances generally,and clause iii imposes a higher penalty for a subset of those substances the ones that contai n cocaine base.for this structure to work,however,b must describ e in clause ii substances containing chemically basic cocaine,which then comprise the subset described in clause iii.congress thus had good reason to include the term cocaine in clause ii,and the slight inconsistency created by its use of cocaine base in clause iii is insufficient reason to adopt depierre interpretation.
c depierre additional arguments are unpersuasive.first,the records of the congressional hearings do not support his contention that congress was exclusively concerned with offenses involving crack cocaine.second,reading cocaine base to mean chemically basic cocaine,rather than crack cocaine,does not lead to an absurd result.third,the fact that cocaine base in the federal sentencing guidelines is defined as crack does not require that the statutory term be interpreted the same way.fourth,the statute is sufficiently clear that the rule of lenity does not apply in depierre favor.

frantz depierre,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
at the time of petitioner conviction and sentence,federal law mandated a minimum sentence for persons convicted of certain drug offenses,a,including those involving grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base,b a iii,and a minimum sentence for offenses involving grams or more of the same,b b iii.this case requires us to decide whether the term cocaine base as used in this statute refers generally to cocaine in its chemically basic form or exclusively to what is colloquially known as crack cocaine.we conclude that cocaine base means the former.
as a matter of chemistry,cocaine is an alkaloid with the molecular formula.webster third new international dictionary.an alkaloid is a base that is,a compound capable of reacting with an acid to form a salt,at,see also brief for individual physicians and scientists as amici curiae physicians brief.cocaine is derived from the coca plant native to south america.the leaves of the coca plant can be processed with water,kerosene,sodium,and sulphuric acid to produce a substance.weiss,mirin,bartel,cocaine ed.when dried,the resulting coca paste can be vaporized through the application of heat and inhaled,smoked.see united states sentencing commission,special report to the congress cocaine and federal sentencing policy hereinafter commission report.coca paste contains that is,cocaine in its base form.
dissolving coca paste in water and hydrochloric acid produces after several intermediate steps cocaine hydrochloride,which is a salt with the molecular formula cl,at physicians brief.cocaine hydrochloride,therefore,is not a base.it generally comes in powder form,which we will refer to as powder cocaine.it is usually insufflated breathed in through the nose,though it can also be ingested or diluted in water and injected.because cocaine hydrochloride vaporizes at a much higher temperature than chemically basic cocaine at which point the cocaine molecule tends to decompose,it is generally not smoked.see commission report.
cocaine hydrochloride can be converted into cocaine in its base form by combining powder cocaine with water and a base,like sodium bicarbonate also known as baking soda,at.the chemical reaction changes the cocaine hydrochloride molecule into a chemically basic cocaine molecule,physicians brief,and the resulting solid substance can be cooled and broken into small pieces and then smoked,commission report.this substance is commonly known as crack or crack cocaine.alternatively,powder cocaine can be dissolved in water and ammonia also a base with the addition of ether,a solid substance known as freebase separates from the,and can be smoked,at.as with crack cocaine,freebase contains cocaine in its chemically basic form.ibid.
chemically,therefore,there is no difference between the cocaine in coca paste,crack cocaine,and freebase all are cocaine in its base form.on the other hand,cocaine in its base form and in its salt form,cocaine hydrochloride are chemically different,though they have the same active ingredient and produce the same physiological and psychotropic effects.see,at.the key difference between them is the method by which they generally enter the body smoking cocaine in its base form whether as coca paste,freebase,or crack cocaine allows the body to absorb the active ingredient quickly,thereby producing a shorter,more intense high than obtained from insufflating cocaine hydrochloride.see generally kimbrough united states.
in,increasing public concern over the dangers associated with illicit drugs and the new phenomenon of crack cocaine in particular prompted congress to the penalties for criminal offenses involving substances.see,at.at the time,federal law generally tied the penalties for drug offenses to both the type of drug and the quantity involved,with no for mandatory minimum sentences.see,b,supp.iii.after holding several hearings specifically addressing the emergence of crack cocaine,congress enacted the abuse act of adaa,stat,which provided mandatory minimum sentences for offenses specific quantities of drugs.
as relevant here,the adaa provided a mandatory sentence for certain drug offenses involving kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of various elements,including coca leaves,cocaine,and cocaine salts it also called for the same sentence for offenses involving only grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base.adaa,stat.amending b a ii iii emphasis added.the adaa also stipulated a mandatory sentence for offenses involving grams of a mixture or substance containing coca leaves,cocaine,and cocaine salts,or grams of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base.at amending b b ii iii.
thus,the adaa established a ratio for the threshold quantities of substances that triggered the statute mandatory minimum penalties.that is,grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base was penalized as severely as times that amount of the other elements enumerated in the statute.these provisions were still in effect at the time of petitioner conviction and sentence see b a b ed.and supp.v.
the united states sentencing commission subsequently promulgated sentencing guidelines for offenses.under the guidelines,the offense levels for drug crimes are tied to the drug type and quantity involved.see united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual c ussg.the commission originally adopted the adaa ratio for offenses involving cocaine and cocaine base,though instead of setting only two quantity thresholds,as the adaa did,the guidelines set sentences for the full range of possible drug quantities.commission report see generally kimbrough,at 
the original version of c did not define cocaine base as used in that provision,but in the commission issued an amendment to explain that c ocaine base,for the purposes of this guideline,means crack,that is,the street name for a form of cocaine base,usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate,and usually appearing in a lumpy,rocklike form.ussg app.c,amdt.effective,see also ussg c,d.the commission noted that forms of cocaine base other than crack,coca paste will be treated as cocaine.ussg app.c,amdt.
in april,petitioner frantz depierre sold two bags of drugs to a government informant.depierre was subsequently indicted on a charge of distributing grams or more of cocaine base under a and b a iii at trial,a government chemist testified that the substance in the bags,which weighed grams,was cocaine base.tr.she was not able to identify any sodium bicarbonate,at.a police officer testified that the substance in question was and chunky.at.
depierre asked the district court to instruct the jury that,in order to find him guilty of distribution of cocaine base,it must find that his offense involved the form of cocaine base known as crack cocaine.app.in.his proposed jury instruction defined crack identically to the guidelines definition.see,at see also ussg c,d.in addition,asked the court to instruct the jury that c analysis can not establish a substance as crack because crack is chemically identical to other forms of cocaine base,although it can reveal the presence of sodium bicarbonate,which is usually used in the processing of crack.app.in,at.
the court,however,instructed the jury that the statute that relevant asks about cocaine base.crack cocaine is a form of cocaine base,so you tell us whether or not what was involved is cocaine base.tr.paragraph break omitted.the jury form asked whether the offense involved over grams of cocaine base.app.to pet.for cert.the jury found depierre guilty of distributing grams or more of cocaine base,and the court sentenced depierre to months in prison as required by the statute.
the united states court of appeals for the first affirmed,rejecting depierre argument that b a iii should be read only to apply to offenses involving crack cocaine.while noting the division on this question among the courts of appeals,at,and nn,the first circuit adhered to its own precedent and read the statute according to its terms,holding that cocaine base refers to all forms of cocaine base,including but not limited to crack cocaine.at quoting united states anderson.we granted certiorari to resolve the longstanding division in authority among the courts of appeals on this question.
we begin with the statutory text.see united states ron pair enterprises.section b a provides a mandatory minimum sentence for certain drug offenses involving 
ii kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of i coca leaves,except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves from which cocaine,ecgonine,and derivatives of ecgonine or their salts have been removed ii cocaine,its salts,optical and geometric isomers,and salts of isomers iii ecgonine,its derivatives,their salts,isomers,and salts of isomers or iv any compound,mixture,or preparation which contains any quantity of any of the substances referred to in subclauses i through iii or iii grams or more of a mixture or substance described in clause ii which contains cocaine base.
we agree with the government that the most natural reading of the term cocaine base is cocaine in its base form the molecule found in crack cocaine,freebase,and coca paste.on its plain terms,then,cocaine base reaches more broadly than just crack cocaine.in arguing to the contrary,depierre asks us to stray far from the statute text,as the term crack cocaine appears nowhere in the adaa or the united states code,for that matter.while the government reading is not without its problems that reading follows from the words congress chose to include in the text.see united states rodriquez,eschewing an interpretation that was not faithful to the statutory text in short,the term cocaine base is more plausibly read to mean the chemically basic form of cocaine,brief for united states,than it is crack cocaine,brief for petitioner,
we agree with depierre that using the term cocaine base to refer to is technically redundant as noted earlier,chemically speaking cocaine is a base.if congress meant in clause iii to penalize more severely offenses involving a mixture or substance which contains cocaine in its base form it could have simply and more correctly used the word cocaine instead.but congress had good reason to use cocaine base in the adaa to distinguish the substances covered by clause iii from other substances.for example,at the time congress enacted the statute,the word cocaine was commonly used to refer to cocaine hydrochloride,powder cocaine.see,united states de hernandez,repeatedly referring to cocaine hydrochloride as cocaine crack cocaine,hearing before the permanent subcommittee on investigations of the senate committee on governmental affairs,hereinafter crack cocaine hearing prepared statement of david westrate,assistant administrator,drug enforcement,of justice discussing production of a white,crystalline powder,cocaine hydrochloride,otherwise known simply as cocaine 
to make things more confusing,in the scientific and medical literature the word cocaine is often used to refer to all substances,including powder cocaine.see,fay,the abuse dictionary and encyclopedia weiss et,cocaine,at lewis,hawley condensed chemical dictionary ed.accordingly,congress choice to use the admittedly redundant term cocaine base to refer to chemically basic cocaine is best understood as an effort to make clear that clause iii does not apply to offenses involving powder cocaine or other nonbasic substances.
notwithstanding depierre arguments to the contrary,reading cocaine base to mean chemically basic cocaine is also consistent with b somewhat confounding structure.depierre is correct that the interpretation we adopt today raises the question why congress included the word cocaine in subclause ii of clause ii.that subclause lists cocaine,its salts,optical and geometric isomers,and salts of isomers as elements subject to clause ii higher quantity threshold.b a ii ii,b ii ii emphasis added.if,as we conclude,the terms cocaine and cocaine base both mean chemically basic cocaine,offenses involving a mixture or substance which contains such cocaine will always be penalized according to the lower quantity thresholds of clause iii,and never the higher quantity thresholds clause ii establishes for mixtures and substances containing cocaine.
while this much is true,we do not agree with depierre that the word cocaine in subclause ii is therefore superfluous.for without the word cocaine subclause ii makes no sense it would provide a minimum sentence for offenses involving a specified quantity of simply its salts,optical and geometric isomers,and salts of isomers.in light of the structure of the subclause,the word cocaine is needed as the reference point for salts and isomers.
the word cocaine in subclause ii also performs another critical function.clause iii penalizes offenses involving a mixture or substance described in clause ii which contains cocaine base.b a iii,b iii emphasis added.in other words,clause ii imposes a penalty for offenses involving substances generally,and clause iii imposes a higher penalty for a subset of those substances the ones that contai n cocaine base.for this structure to work,however,b must describ e in clause ii substances containing chemically basic cocaine,which then comprise the subset described in clause iii.if such substances were not present in clause ii,clause iii would only apply to substances that contain both chemically basic cocaine and one of the other elements enumerated in clause ii.presumably,the result would be that clause iii would not apply to crack cocaine,freebase,or coca paste offenses,as there is no indication that,in addition to cocaine base those substances contain cocaine salts cocaine hydrochloride,ecgonine,or any of the other elements enumerated in clause ii.in short,the exclusion of cocaine from clause ii would result in clause iii effectively describing a null set,which obviously was not congress intent.
of course,this redundancy could have been avoided by simply drafting clause iii to penalize offenses involving a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base,without reference to clause ii that is,congress could have drafted clause iii to specify a separate set of substances,not a subset of those in clause ii.that we may rue inartful legislative drafting,however,does not excuse us from the responsibility of construing a statute as faithfully as possible to its actual text and as noted earlier,there is no textual support for depierre interpretation of cocaine base to mean crack cocaine.
we also recognize that our reading of cocaine in subclause ii and cocaine base in clause iii to both refer to chemically basic cocaine is in tension with the usual rule that when the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another,the court assumes different meanings were intended.sosa,internal quotation marks omitted.however,because congress sometimes uses slightly different language to convey the same message,deal united states,internal quotation marks omitted,we must be careful not to place too much emphasis on the marginal semantic divergence between the terms cocaine and cocaine base.as we have already explained,congress had good reason to employ the latter term in clause iii,and the slight inconsistency in nomenclature is insufficient reason to adopt depierre interpretation.public lands council babbitt,suggesting that a statute basic purpose might support the conclusion that two sets of different words mean the same thing 
depierre offers four additional arguments in support of his view that the term cocaine base in clause iii is best read to mean crack cocaine.we do not find them convincing.
depierre first argues that we should read cocaine base to mean crack cocaine because,in passing the adaa,congress in intended to penalize crack cocaine offenses more severely than those involving other substances containing.as is evident from the discussion,this position is not supported by the statutory text.to be sure,the records of the contemporaneous congressional hearings suggest that congress was most concerned with the particular dangers posed by the advent of crack cocaine.see,crack cocaine hearing statement of chairman roth we mee t today to examine a frightening and dangerous new twist in the drug abuse problem the growing availability and use of a cheap,highly addictive,and deadly form of cocaine known on the streets as crack see generally commission report kimbrough,at.
it does not necessarily follow,however,that in passing the adaa congress meant for clause iii lower quantity thresholds to apply exclusively to crack cocaine offenses.numerous witnesses at the hearings testified that the primary reason crack cocaine was so dangerous was because contrary to powder cocaine cocaine in its base form is smoked,which was understood to produce a faster,more intense,and more addictive high than powder cocaine.see,crack cocaine hearing statement of robert byck,yale university school of medicine stating that the ability to inhale vapor is the reason why crack,or cocaine,is so dangerous this is not,however,a feature unique to crack cocaine,and freebase and coca paste were also acknowledged as dangerous,smokeable forms of cocaine.see,at prepared statement of charles schuster,director,national institute on drug abuse reporting on the shift from snorting powder cocaine to newer more dangerous routes of administration,such as freebase smoking at statement of byck describing the damaging effects of cocaine smoking on people in peru.
moreover,the testimony of witnesses before congress did not clearly distinguish between these base forms of cocaine witnesses repeatedly used terms like cocaine base,freebase,or cocaine freebase in a manner that grouped crack cocaine with other substances containing chemically basic forms of cocaine.see,trafficking and abuse of crack in new york city,house select committee on narcotics abuse and control,statement of robert stutman,special agent in charge,drug enforcement,of justice c ocaine in its alkaloid form is commonly known on the street as crack,rock,base,or freebase crack cocaine hearing statement of schuster in other words,crack is a street name for cocaine freebase in fact,prior to passage of the adaa,multiple bills were introduced in congress that imposed enhanced penalties on those who trafficked in cocaine base,as well as cocaine freebase,a.
given crack cocaine sudden emergence and the similarities it shared with other forms of cocaine,this lack of clarity is understandable,as is congress desire to adopt a statutory term that would encompass all forms.congress faced what it perceived to be a new threat of massive scope.see,crack cocaine hearing statement of nunn c ocaine use,particularly in the more pure form known as crack,is at near epidemic proportions at statement of byck we are dealing with a worse drug than we have ever dealt with,or that anybody has ever dealt with in history accordingly,chose statutory language broad enough to meet that threat.as we have noted,statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils.oncale sundowner offshore services.in the absence of any indication in the statutory text that congress intended only to subject crack cocaine offenses to enhanced penalties,we can not adopt depierre narrow construction.see lewis chicago,slip,at it is not for us to rewrite a statute so that it covers on
