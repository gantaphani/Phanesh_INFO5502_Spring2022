background 
the law requires us to accept the state court findings of fact because barbosa makes no showing that any of those facts are clearly and convincingly in error.mccambridge hall,cir en banc citing e.we therefore begin with a summary of those findings as set forth by the sjc in its opinion.
at approximately pm on october,geraldo carbuccia and edward serret encountered barbosa as they were walking in the roxbury section of boston.barbosa,at.carbuccia had seen barbosa only twice before,whereas serret and barbosa were better acquainted.id.the three men walked to robey street,where barbosa left carbuccia and serret to wait for him in an alleyway.id.returning five to ten minutes later,barbosa pulled out a gun and shot carbuccia in the shoulder from ten to fifteen feet away.id.after falling to the ground,carbuccia heard three or four more gunshots and then heard serret say,dammit,you going to kill me.id.at.
luis sanches,an eyewitness,testified that he heard three or four shots on robey street and then saw barbosa and serret running from robey street onto marshfield street while punching each other.id.at.after another gunshot,serret fell to the ground while barbosa continued to punch him before barbosa ran away and turned the corner onto norfolk avenue.id.
between and pm,police officers william hubbard and charles mackinnon received a radio call to respond to the scene at marshfield street.id.approximately one minute after receiving the call,they saw barbosa walking toward them on burrell street,which is approximately one block from marshfield.id.the officers observed that barbosa was walking at a brisk pace,and that he appeared to be short of breath,and that his face was glistening with sweat.id.when hubbard rolled down the car window to ask barbosa whether he had heard gunshots,barbosa pointed to the intersection of burrell and bachelder streets,making excited gestures and stating,over there,i heard shots,they are crazy,i had to run.id.when hubbard opened his door to exit his vehicle,barbosa immediately began to run away.id.hubbard followed him on foot and ordered barbosa to stop,but barbosa did not comply.id.after a brief chase,hubbard tackled barbosa to the ground.id.when hubbard ordered barbosa to show his hands,barbosa refused,crawling toward the sidewalk.id.during the ensuing struggle,hubbard heard a loud splash and saw barbosa hand emerge from a catch basin.id.barbosa then ceased struggling and showed hubbard his hands,which were empty.id.hubbard handcuffed barbosa and placed him in a police car.id.
a short while later,the boston water and sewer commission brought a clam truck at hubbard request to scoop out the contents of the catch basin.id.the first scoop produced a nine millimeter bryco pistol.id.at.at trial,a ballistics expert testified that this pistol matched the shell casings and bullet fragments found at the scene of the shooting.id.at.
during an interview with detective dennis harris and sergeant detective thomas at the police station,barbosa claimed he fled from officer hubbard because he thought there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest based on a motor vehicle infraction.id.at.a record check revealed no such warrant.id.at.barbosa also denied any involvement in the shooting and denied throwing anything into the catch basin.id.at.after detective harris informed barbosa that a firearm had been found in the basin,barbosa demeanor changed and he dropped his head to his knees.id.
during interviews on october and october,carbuccia initially stated that he did not get a good look at the shooter.id.on october,carbuccia changed his tune.he contacted sergeant detective richard daley and gave a statement that barbosa had shot him,and he also selected barbosa photograph from an array of eight photographs.id.two years later,in preparation for trial,carbuccia then further informed the district attorney that he and serret had witnessed barbosa shoot another man on september,two weeks before barbosa shot carbuccia and serret.id.
shortly after the shooting,cheryl delatore a dna analyst no longer employed by boston police department at the time of trial performed dna testing on four samples taken from a red stain on barbosa left boot a red stain on barbosa left pant leg a bloodstain from serret and an oral swab from barbosa.id.at.at trial,julie lynch,a senior criminalist in the dna unit of the boston police department,explained the process of dna testing and analysis,id.at,and testified that,in her opinion,the results of delatore tests indicated that serret was a possible source of the dna extracted from the bloodstains on barbosa boot and pant leg,while barbosa was excluded as a possible source of the dna from both,id.at.without any objection from barbosa,a table prepared by delatore was introduced into evidence showing the results of the dna tests and lynch orally conveyed some of the table information to the jury.id.at.
lynch admitted on that she had not done the tests herself.id.rather,she had supervised and trained delatore,reviewed the worksheets and reports delatore had generated during the testing,and signed delatore final report.id.she agreed that because she did not stand over delatore shoulders during the testing,she had no idea whether delatore made any mistakes.id.alteration in original.the only way to be certain would be to retest all of the samples,which she had not done.id.
a suffolk county jury convicted barbosa of murder with premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty,armed assault with intent to murder,assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,and the unlicensed possession of a firearm.id.at.in his appeal to the sjc,barbosa argued,inter alia,that both lynch testimony about the results of dna testing she did not perform and the introduction into evidence of the table created by delatore violated his sixth amendment right of confrontation.id.at.
the sjc affirmed barbosa convictions,holding that even though lynch own opinion was based in part on dna testing she did not perform,barbosa right of confrontation was not violated because he had a fair opportunity to confront lynch as to the reasonable basis for her opinion s.id.at.the sjc also held,however,and the state conceded,that barbosa confrontation rights were violated by the admission of delatore results table and lynch testimony reciting some of the information in the table.id.nevertheless,because barbosa did not object to the admission of this testimony or otherwise preserve his claim of error,the sjc reviewed the error under the miscarriage of justice standard and concluded that in light of lynch properly admitted testimony and the other overwhelming evidence against the defendant no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice resulted from the improper admission of delatore results table,or lynch testimony regarding delatore results and opinion.id.at.the supreme court denied barbosa petition for certiorari.barbosa mitchell,d.
on april,barbosa filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the united states district court for the district of massachusetts based on the admission of lynch testimony and delatore results table.barbosa petition relies on the supreme court decisions in melendez diaz massachusetts,d,and bullcoming new mexico,d.the district court denied the petition,holding that admission of lynch own expert opinion did not violate clearly established law even though she relied on delatore work product in forming her opinio
