under the abuse act drug act,the and mandatory minimum prison terms for federal drug crimes reflected a disparity between the amounts of crack cocaine and powder cocaine needed to trigger the minimums.thus,the minimum was triggered by a conviction for possessing with intent to distribute grams of crack cocaine but grams of powder,and the minimum was triggered by a conviction for possessing with intent to distribute grams of crack but grams of powder.the united states sentencing commission which is charged under the sentencing reform act of with writing the federal sentencing guidelines incorporated the drug act disparity into the guidelines because it believed that doing so was the best way to keep similar sentences proportional,thereby satisfying the sentencing reform act basic proportionality objective.the fair sentencing act,which took effect on august,reduced the disparity to,lowering the mandatory minimums applicable to many crack offenders,by increasing the amount of crack needed to trigger the minimum from to grams and the amount for the minimum from to grams,while leaving the powder cocaine amounts intact.it also directed the sentencing commission to make conforming amendments to the guidelines as soon as practicable but no later than days after the fair sentencing act effective date.the new amendments became effective on november.
in,petitioner hill unlawfully sold grams of crack in,but was not sentenced until december.sentencing him to the minimum mandated by the drug act,the district judge ruled that the fair sentencing act minimum for selling that amount of crack did not apply to those whose offenses were committed before the act effective date.in,petitioner dorsey unlawfully sold grams of crack in.in september,the district judge sentenced him to the drug act minimum,finding that it applied because dorsey had a prior drug conviction and declining to apply the fair sentencing act,under which there would be no mandated minimum term for an amount less than grams,because dorsey offense predated that act effective date.the seventh circuit affirmed in both cases.
held the fair sentencing act new,lower mandatory minimums apply to the sentencing of offenders.
a language in different statutes argues in opposite directions.the general federal saving statute act provides that a new criminal statute that repeal s an older criminal statute shall not change the penalties incurred under that older statute unless the repealing act shall so expressly provide.the word repeal applies when a new statute simply diminishes the penalties that the older statute set forth,see warden marrero,and penalties are incurred under the older statute when an offender becomes subject to them,commits the underlying conduct that makes the offender liable,see united states reisinger.in contrast,the sentencing reform act says that,regardless of when the offender conduct occurs,the applicable sentencing guidelines are the ones in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.a a ii.
six considerations,taken together,show that congress intended the fair sentencing act more lenient penalties to apply to offenders who committed crimes before august,but were sentenced after that date.first,the saving statute permits congress to apply a new act more lenient penalties to offenders without expressly saying so in the new act.the act creates what is in effect a less demanding interpretive requirement because the statute can not justify a disregard of the will of congress as manifested,either expressly or by necessary implication,in a subsequent enactment.great northern united states.hence,this court has treated the act as setting forth an important background principle of interpretation that requires courts,before interpreting a new criminal statute to apply its new penalties to a set of offenders,to assure themselves by the plain import or fair implication of the new statute that ordinary interpretive considerations point clearly in that direction.second,the sentencing reform act sets forth a special and different background principle in a a ii,which applies unless ex post facto concerns are present.thus,new,lower guidelines amendments apply to offenders who committed an offense before the adoption of the amendments but are sentenced thereafter.third,language in the fair sentencing act implies that congress intended to follow the sentencing reform act special background principle here.section of the fair sentencing act requires the commission to promulgate conforming amendments to the guidelines that achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law.read most naturally,applicable law refers to the law as changed by the fair sentencing act,including the provision reducing the crack mandatory minimums.and consistency with other guideline provisions and with prior commission practice would require application of the new guidelines amendments to offenders who committed their offense before the new amendments effective date but were sentenced thereafter.fourth,applying the drug act old mandatory minimums to the sentencing of offenders would create sentencing disparities of a kind that congress enacted the sentencing reform act and the fair sentencing act to prevent.fifth,not to apply the fair sentencing act would do more than preserve a disproportionate status quo it would make matters worse by creating new anomalies new sets of disproportionate sentences not previously present.that is because sentencing courts must apply the new guidelines consistent with the fair sentencing act new minimums to offenders,and the drug act old minimums would trump those new guidelines for some offenders but not for all of them.application of the drug act minimums to offenders sentenced after the new guidelines take effect would therefore produce a set of sentences at odds with congress basic efforts to create more uniform,more proportionate sentences.sixth,this court has found no strong countervailing considerations that would make a critical difference.
b the new act lower minimums also apply to those who committed an offense prior to august and were sentenced between that date and november,the effective date of the new guidelines.the act simply instructs the commission to promulgate new guidelines as soon as practicable but no later than days after the act took effect,and thus as far as congress was concerned,the commission might have promulgated those guidelines to be effective as early as august.in any event,courts,treating the guidelines as,possess authority to sentence in accordance with the new minimums.finally,applying the new minimums to all who are sentenced after august makes it possible to foresee a reasonably smooth transition,and this court has no reason to believe congress would have wanted to impose an unforeseeable,potentially complex application date.

justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
federal statutes impose mandatory minimum prison sentences upon those convicted of federal drug crimes.these statutes typically base the length of a minimum prison term upon the kind and amount of the drug involved.until,the relevant statute imposed upon an offender who dealt in powder cocaine the same sentence it imposed upon an offender who dealt in one that amount of crack cocaine.it imposed,for example,the same minimum term upon an offender convicted of possessing with intent to distribute grams of powder cocaine as upon an offender convicted of possessing with intent to distribute grams of crack.
in,congress enacted a new statute reducing the cocaine disparity from to.fair sentencing act,stat.the new statute took effect on august.the question here is whether the act more lenient penalty provisions apply to offenders who committed a crack cocaine crime before august,but were not sentenced until after august.we hold that the new,more lenient mandatory minimum provisions do apply to those offenders.
the underlying question before us is one of intent as revealed in the fair sentencing act,structure,and basic objectives.did congress intend the act more lenient penalties to apply to offenders sentenced after the act took effect 
we recognize that,because of important background principles of interpretation,we must assume that congress did not intend those penalties to apply unless it clearly indicated to the contrary.see infra,at.but we find that clear indication here.we rest our conclusion primarily upon the fact that a contrary determination would seriously undermine basic federal sentencing guidelines objectives such as uniformity and proportionality in sentencing.indeed,seen from that perspective,a contrary determination would in respect to relevant groups of drug offenders produce sentences less uniform and more disproportionate than if congress had not enacted the fair sentencing act at all.see infra,at.
because our conclusion rests upon an analysis of the sentencing system congress has established,we describe that system at the outset and include an explanation of how the guidelines interact with federal statutes setting forth specific terms of imprisonment.
the guidelines originate in the sentencing reform act of,stat.that statute created a federal sentencing commission instructed to write guidelines that judges would use to determine sentences imposed upon offenders convicted of committing federal crimes.congress thereby sought to increase transparency,uniformity,and proportionality in sentencing.united states sentencing commission ussc or commission,guidelines manual,ussg see b,f.
the sentencing reform act directed the commission to create in the guidelines categories of offense behavior,bank with a gun taken and offender characteristics,one prior conviction ussg,at see a e.a sentencing judge determines a guidelines range by finding the applicable offense level and offender category and then consulting a table that lists proportionate sentencing ranges,to months of imprisonment at the intersections of rows marking offense levels and columns marking offender categories.ussg ch,pt.a,table,see also h,at.the guidelines,after telling the judge how to determine the applicable offense level and offender category,instruct the judge to apply the intersection range in an ordinary case,but they leave the judge free to depart from that range in an unusual case.see b ussg,at,b,at.this court has held that the guidelines are now advisory.united states booker,see kimbrough united states.
the guidelines determine most offense in a special way.they set forth a drug quantity table or table that lists amounts of various drugs and associates different amounts with different base offense levels to which a judge may add or subtract levels depending upon the specific characteristics of the offender behavior.see ussg.the table,for example,associates to grams of powder cocaine with a base offense level of,a level that would mean for a offender a prison term of to months.c.
in,congress enacted a more specific,sentencing statute,the abuse act drug act,stat.that statute sets forth mandatory minimum penalties of and years applicable to a drug offender depending primarily upon the kind and amount of drugs involved in the offense.see b a c ed.and supp.iv.the minimum applicable to an offender convicted of possessing with intent to distribute grams or more of powder cocaine is years,and for grams or more of powder the minimum is years.b a ii,b ii.the drug act,however,treated crack cocaine crimes as far more serious.it applied its minimum to an offender convicted of possessing with intent to distribute only grams of crack as compared to grams of powder and its minimum to one convicted of possessing with intent to distribute only grams of crack as compared to grams of powder,thus producing a ratio.b a iii,b iii ed.
the drug act,like other federal sentencing statutes,interacts with the guidelines in an important way.like other sentencing statutes,it trumps the guidelines.thus,ordinarily no matter what the guidelines provide,a judge can not sentence an offender to a sentence beyond the maximum contained in the federal statute setting forth the crime of conviction.similarly,ordinarily no matter what range the guidelines set forth,a sentencing judge must sentence an offender to at least the minimum prison term set forth in a statutory mandatory minimum.see a,b ussg neal united states.
not surprisingly,the sentencing commission incorporated the drug act mandatory minimums into the first version of the guidelines themselves.kimbrough,supra,at.it did so by setting a base offense level for a drug offender that corresponded to the lowest guidelines range above the applicable mandatory minimum.ussc,report to the congress mandatory minimum penalties in the federal criminal justice system report.thus,the first guidelines drug quantity table associated grams of powder cocaine with an offense level of,which for a offender meant a sentencing range of to months just above the minimum,and it associated grams of powder cocaine with an offense level of,which for a offender meant a sentencing range of to months just above the minimum.ussg.further reflecting the drug act ratio,the table associated an offense level of with grams of crack and an offense level of with grams of crack.ibid.
in addition,the drug quantity table set offense levels for small drug amounts that did not trigger the drug act mandatory minimums so that the resulting guidelines sentences would remain proportionate to the sentences for amounts that did trigger these minimums.report.thus,the table associated grams of powder cocaine an amount that fell just below the amount triggering the drug act minimum with an offense level of,which for a offender meant a sentencing range of to months the range just below the minimum.ussg.following the ratio,the table associated four grams of crack an amount that also fell just below the amount triggering the drug act minimum with an offense level of.ibid.
the commission did this not because it necessarily thought that those levels were most in keeping with past sentencing practice or would independently have reflected a fair set of sentences,but rather because the commission believed that doing so was the best way to keep similar sentences proportional,thereby satisfying the sentencing reform act basic proportionality objective.see kimbrough,at ussg report,and.for this reason,the commission derived the drug quantity table entire set of crack and powder cocaine offense levels by using the drug act two and minimum amounts as reference points and then extrapolating from those two amounts upward and downward to set proportional offense levels for other drug amounts.ibid.
during the next two decades,the commission and others in the law enforcement community strongly criticized congress decision to set the mandatory minimum ratio at.the commission issued four separate reports telling congress that the ratio was too high and unjustified because,for example,research showed the relative harm between crack and powder cocaine less severe than,because sentences embodying that ratio could not achieve the sentencing reform act uniformity goal of treating like offenders alike,because they could not achieve the proportionality goal of treating different offenders,major drug traffickers and dealers differently,and because the public had come to understand sentences embodying the ratio as reflecting unjustified differences.kimbrough,supra,at see,ussc,special report to the congress cocaine and federal policy report ussc,special report to congress cocaine and federal sentencing policy report ussc,report to congress cocaine and federal sentencing policy,may report ussc,report to congress cocaine and federal sentencing policy may report.the commission also asked congress for new legislation embodying a lower ratio.report report report report.and the commission recommended that the legislation include an emergency amendment allowing the commission to incorporate the statutory changes in the guidelines while minimiz ing the lag between any statutory and guideline modifications for cocaine offenders.at.
in,congress accepted the commission recommendations,see report report,and,and enacted the fair sentencing act into law.the act increased the drug amounts triggering mandatory minimums for crack trafficking offenses from grams to grams in respect to the minimum and from grams to grams in respect to the minimum while leaving powder at grams and grams respectively.a,stat.the change had the effect of lowering the ratio to.the act also eliminated the mandatory minimum for simple possession of crack,stat.
further,the fair sentencing act instructed the commission to make such conforming amendments to the federal sentencing guidelines as the commission determines necessary to achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law.at.and it directed the commission to promulgate the guidelines,policy statements,or amendments provided for in this act as soon as practicable,and in any event not later than days after the new act took effect,ibid.
the fair sentencing act took effect on august.the commission promulgated conforming emergency guidelines amendments that became effective on november.fed.reg.a permanent version of those guidelines amendments took effect on november.see,at.
with this background in mind,we turn to the relevant facts of the cases before us.corey hill,one of the petitioners,unlawfully sold grams of crack in march,before the fair sentencing act became law.app.in,hereinafter hill app.under the drug act,an offender who sold grams of crack was subject to a mandatory minimum.b a iii ed.hill was not sentenced,however,until december,after the fair sentencing act became law and after the new guidelines amendments had become effective.hill app.under the fair sentencing act,an offender who sold grams of crack was subject to a,not a,minimum.b b iii,supp.iv.the sentencing judge stated that,if he thought that the fair sentencing act applied,he would have sentenced hill to that act minimum,at.but he concluded that the fair sentencing act lower minimums apply only to those who committed a drug crime after august,the act effective date,at.that is to say,he concluded that the new act more lenient sentences did not apply to those who committed a crime before august,even if they were sentenced after that date.hence,the judge hill to years of imprisonment,at.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit affirmed.fed.appx.
the second petitioner,edward dorsey who had previously been convicted of a drug felony,unlawfully sold grams of crack in august,before the fair sentencing act took effect.app.in,hereinafter dorsey app.under the drug act,an offender such as dorsey with a prior drug felony who sold grams of crack was subject to a minimum.b b iii ed.dorsey was not sentenced,however,until september,after the new fair sentencing act took effect,at.under the fair sentencing act,such an offender who sold grams of crack was not subject to a mandatory minimum at all,for grams is less than the grams that triggers the new act mandatory minimum provisions.b b iii,supp.iv.dorsey asked the judge to apply the fair sentencing act more lenient statutory penalties,at.
moreover,as of dorsey sentencing in september,the unrevised guidelines reflecting the drug act old minimums were still in effect.the commission had not yet finished revising the guidelines to reflect the new,lower statutory minimums.and the basic sentencing statute,the sentencing reform act,provides that a judge shall apply the guidelines that are in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.a a ii.
the sentencing judge,however,had the legal authority not to apply the guidelines at all for they are advisory.but he also knew that he could not ignore a minimum sentence contained in the applicable statute.dorsey app.the judge noted that,even though he was sentencing dorsey after the effective date of the fair sentencing act,dorsey had committed the underlying crime prior to that date,at.and he concluded that the drug act old minimums,not the new fair sentencing act,applied in those circumstances.ibid.he consequently sentenced dorsey to the drug act minimum term,at.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit affirmed,united states fisher,and denied rehearing en banc,per curiam see also united states holcomb.
the courts of appeals have come to different conclusions as to whether the fair sentencing act more lenient mandatory minimums apply to offenders whose unlawful conduct took place before,but whose sentencing took place after,the date that act took effect,namely,august.compare united states douglas,act applies,and united states dixon,same,with,at act does not apply,united states sidney,same,and united states tickles,per curiam same.in light of that disagreement,we granted hill and dorsey petitions for certiorari.since petitioners and the government both take the position that the fair sentencing act new minimums do apply in these circumstances,we appointed as amicus curiae miguel estrada to argue the contrary position.he has ably discharged his responsibilities.
the timing issue before us is difficult in part because relevant language in different statutes argues in opposite directions.see appendix a,infra.on the one hand,a federal saving statute,act of,act,stat,phrased in general terms,provides that a new criminal statute that repeal s an older criminal statute shall not change the penalties incurred under that older statute unless the repealing act shall so expressly provide.case law makes clear that the word repeal applies when a new statute simply diminishes the penalties that the older statute set forth.see warden marrero,see also united states tynen,wall.case law also makes clear that penalties are incurred under the older statute when an offender becomes subject to them,commits the underlying conduct that makes the offender liable.see united states reisinger,great northern united states.
on the other hand,the sentencing reform act says that,regardless of when the offender conduct occurs,the applicable guidelines are the ones in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.a a ii.and the fair sentencing act requires the commission to change the guidelines in the wake of the act new minimums,making them consistent with other guideline provisions and applicable law.stat.
courts that have held that they must apply the old,higher drug act minimums to all offenders,including those sentenced after the fair sentencing act took effect,have emphasized that the act requires that result unless the fair sentencing act either expressly says or at least by fair implication implies the contrary.see,at sidney,supra,at tickles,supra,at see also holcomb,supra,at opinion of easterbrook.courts that have concluded that the fair sentencing act more lenient penalties apply have found in that act,together with the sentencing reform act and other related circumstances,indicia of a clear congressional intent to apply the new act minimums.see douglas,supra,at dixon,supra,at see also holcomb,at williams,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc,at posner,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.we too take the latter view.six considerations,taken together,convince us that congress intended the fair sentencing act more lenient penalties to apply to those offenders whose crimes preceded august,but who are sentenced after that date.
first,the saving statute permits congress to apply a new act more lenient penalties to offenders without expressly saying so in the new act.it is true that the act uses the words expressly provide.but the court has long recognized that this saving statute creates what is in effect a less demanding interpretive requirement.that is because statutes enacted by one congress can not bind a later congress,which remains free to repeal the earlier statute,to exempt the current statute from the earlier statute,to modify the earlier statute,or to apply the earlier statute but as modified.see,fletcher peck,cranch,reichelderfer quinn.and congress remains free to express any such intention either expressly or by implication as it chooses.
thus,the court has said that the act can not justify a disregard of the will of congress as manifested either expressly or by necessary implication in a subsequent enactment.great northern,supra,at emphasis added.and in a comparable context the court has emphasized that the administrative procedure act use of the word expressly does not require congress to use any magical passwords to exempt a later statute from the provision.marcello bonds.without requiring an express statement,the court has described the necessary indicia of congressional intent by the terms necessary implication,clear implication,and fair implication,phrases it has used interchangeably.great northern,supra,at,hertz woodman,marrero,supra,at.one member of the court has said we should determine whether the plain import of a later statute directly conflicts with an earlier statute,and,if so,the later enactment governs,regardless of its compliance with any requirement of an express reference or other magical password.lockhart united states,scalia,concurring.
hence,the court has treated the act as setting forth an important background principle of interpretation.the court has also assumed congress is well aware of the background principle when it enacts new criminal statutes,great northern,supra,at hertz,supra,at marcello,supra,at.and the requires courts,before interpreting a new criminal statute to apply its new penalties to a set of offenders,to assure themselves that ordinary interpretive considerations point clearly in that direction.words such as plain import,fair implication,or the like reflect the need for that assurance.and it is that assurance,which we shall assume is conveyed by the phrases plain import or fair implication,that we must look for here.
second,the sentencing reform act sets forth a special and different background principle.that statute says that when determining the particular sentence to be imposed in an initial sentencing,the sentencing court shall consider,among other things,the sentencing range established by the guidelines that are in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.a a ii emphasis added.although the constitution ex post facto clause,art.i,cl,prohibits applying a new act higher penalties to conduct,it does not prohibit applying lower penalties.see calder bull,dall,collins youngblood.the sentencing commission has consequently instructed sentencing judges to use the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced,regardless of when the defendant committed the offense,unless doing so would violate the ex post facto clause.ussg.and therefore when the commission adopts new,lower guidelines amendments,those amendments become effective to offenders who committed an offense prior to the adoption of the new amendments but are sentenced thereafter.just as we assume congress was aware of the act background norm,so we assume that congress was aware of this different background sentencing principle.
third,language in the fair sentencing act implies that congress intended to follow the sentencing reform act background principle here.a section of the fair sentencing act entitled emergency authority for united states sentencing commission requires the commission to as soon as practicable and not later than days after august,conforming amendments to the guidelines that achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law.stat.read most naturally,applicable law refers to the law as changed by the fair sentencing act,including the provision reducing the crack mandatory minimums.a,at.as the commission understood this provision,achieving consistency with other guideline provisions means reducing the base offense levels for all crack amounts proportionally using the new ratio,the offense levels governing small amounts of crack that did not fall within the scope of the mandatory minimum provisions.fed.reg.and with other guideline provisions and with prior practice would require application of the new guidelines amendments to offenders who committed their offense prior to the new amendments effective date but were sentenced thereafter.see ussg a,ussg app.c,amdts,supp.see also memorandum from schmitt,reed,cohen,ussc,to chair hinojosa et,subject analysis of the impact of the crack cocaine amendment if made retroactive.ussg app.c,amdt.amendment increasing restitution,which may present ex post facto and concerns,would apply only to defendants sentenced for offenses,discussed post,at scalia,dissenting.
fourth,applying the drug act old mandatory minimums to the sentencing of offenders would create disparities of a kind that congress enacted the sentencing reform act and the fair sentencing act to prevent.two individuals with the same number of prior offenses who each engaged in the same criminal conduct involving the same amount of crack and were sentenced at the same time would receive radically different sentences.for example,a offender with five grams of crack,subject to a guidelines range of to months,could receive two years of imprisonment,while an otherwise identical offender would have to receive the mandatory minimum.compare ussg c with b b ed.a offender would be subject to a guidelines range of less than six years of imprisonment,while his otherwise identical counterpart would have to receive the mandatory minimum.compare ussg c with b a ed.
moreover,unlike many discrepancies,the imposition of these disparate sentences involves roughly contemporaneous sentencing,the same time,the same place,and even the same judge,thereby highlighting a kind of unfairness that modern sentencing statutes typically seek to combat.see,b b purposes of sentencing include avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct explaining rationale for using same,current guidelines for all roughly contemporaneous sentencings.further,it would involve imposing upon the offender a sentence at a time after congress had specifically found in the fair sentencing act that such a sentence was unfairly long.
finally,one can not treat such problems as if they were minor ones.given the statute of limitations for federal drug offenses,the median time between indictment and sentencing for those offenses,and the approximately federal crack offenders convicted each year,many offenders were not and will not be sentenced until after august,when the new,more lenient mandatory minimums took effect.see a administrative office of united states courts,judicial business of the united states courts,table report.
fifth,not to apply the fair sentencing act would do more than preserve a disproportionate status quo it would make matters worse.it would create new anomalies new sets of disproportionate sentences not previously present.that is because sentencing courts must apply new guidelines consistent with the fair sentencing act new minimums to offenders,see supra,at,and the drug act old minimums would trump those new guidelines for some offenders but not for all of them say,offenders who possessed crack in small amounts not directly the subject of mandatory minimums.
consider,for example,a offender convicted of possessing with intent to distribute four grams of crack.no mandatory sentence,under the drug act or the fair sentencing act,applies to an offender possessing so small an amount.yet under the old law,the commission,charged with creating proportionate sentences,had created a guidelines range of to months for such an,a sentence proportional to the months that the drug act required for one who trafficked five grams of crack.see supra,at ussg c.
the fair sentencing act,however,requires the commission to write new guidelines consistent with the new law.the commission therefore wrote new guidelines that provide a sentencing range of to months about two years for the,offender.see ussg c.and the sentencing reform act requires application of those new guidelines to all offenders including offenders who are sentenced once those new guidelines take effect.see a a ii.those new guidelines must take effect and apply to a offender,for such an offender was never subject to a trumping statutory drug act mandatory minimum.however,unless the fair sentencing act new,more lenient mandatory minimums apply to offenders,an otherwise identical who possessed five grams would have to receive a sentence.see b b,supp.iv.
for example,imagine that on july,both smith and jones commit a crack crime identical but for the fact that smith possesses with intent to distribute four grams of crack and jones five grams.both are sentenced on december,after the fair sentencing act and the new guidelines take effect.smith guidelines sentence would be two years,but unless the fair sentencing act applies,jones sentence would have to be five years.the difference of one gram would make a difference,not of only one year as it did before enactment of the fair sentencing act,but instead of three years.passage of the new act,designed to have brought about fairer sentences,would here have created a new disparate sentencing cliff.
nor can one say that the new act would produce disproportionalities like this in only a few cases.in fiscal year,percent of all crack offenders were convicted of offenses not subject to the drug act minimums.report.and since those minimums apply only to some drug offenders and they apply in different ways,one can find many similar examples of disproportionalities.see appendix b,infra.thus,application of the drug act minimums to offenders sentenced after the new guidelines take effect would produce a crazy quilt of sentences,at odds with congress basic efforts to achieve more uniform,more proportionate sentences.congress,when enacting the fair sentencing act,could not have intended any such result.
sixth,we have found no strong countervailing consideration.amicus and the dissent argue that one might read much of the statutory language we have discussed as embodying exceptions,permitting the old drug act minimums to apply to offenders sentenced after august,when the fair sentencing act took effect.the words applicable law in the new act,for example,could,linguistically speaking,encompass the drug act minimums applied to those sentenced after august.post,at scalia,dissenting.moreover,congress could have insisted that the commission write new guidelines with special speed to assure itself that new,offenders but not old,offenders would receive the benefit of the new act.post,at.further,amicus and the dissent note that to apply the new act minimums to the old,offenders will create a new disparity one between offenders sentenced before august and those sentenced after that date.post,at.
we do not believe that these arguments make a critical difference.even if the relevant statutory language can be read as amicus and the dissent suggest and even if congress might have wanted guidelines written speedily simply in order to apply them quickly to new offenders,there is scant indication that this is what congress did mean by the language in question nor that such was in fact congress motivation.the considerations we have set forth,supra,at and this page,strongly suggest the contrary.
we also recognize that application of the new minimums to offenders sentenced after august will create a new set of disparities.but those disparities,reflecting a effort,will exist whenever congress enacts a new law changing sentences unless congress intends sentencing proceedings concluded prior to a new law effective date.we have explained how in federal sentencing the ordinary practice is to apply new penalties to defendants not yet sentenced,while withholding that change from defendants already sentenced.supra,at compare a a ii with c.and we have explained how,here,continued application of the old drug act minimums to those offenders sentenced after august would make matters worse.supra,at.we consequently conclude that this particular new disparity between those offenders already sentenced and those not yet sentenced as of august can not make a critical difference.
for these reasons considered as a whole,we conclude that congress intended the fair sentencing act new,lower mandatory minimums to apply to the sentencing of offenders.that is the act plain import or fair implication.
we add one final point.several arguments we have discussed involve the language of statutes that determine how new guidelines take effect.supra,at.what about those who committed an offense prior to august and were sentenced after august but before november,a period after the new act effective date but before the new guidelines first took effect do the fair sentencing act new mandatory minimums apply to them 
in our view,the new act lower minimums apply to them as well.our reason is that the statute simply instructs the commission to promulgate new guidelines as soon as practicable but no later than days after the act took effect,stat.as far as congress was concerned,the commission might have having prepared new guidelines in advance promulgated those guidelines within a few days perhaps on august itself.at the same time,the commission possesses ample authority to permit appropriate adjustments to be made in the guidelines sentences of those sentenced after august but prior to the new guidelines promulgation.see u power to make guidelines reductions retroactive fed.reg.amended guidelines made retroactive.in any event,courts,treating the guidelines as advisory,possess authority to sentence in accordance with the new minimums.
for these reasons,if the fair sentencing act new minimums apply to all of those sentenced after august,even if the new guidelines were not yet ready,it is possible to foresee a reasonably smooth transition.on the other hand,it is difficult to foresee such a transition if the new act application is keyed to a later date,thereby leaving the courts unable to take the new act fully into account,particularly when that circumstance might create additional disparities and uncertainties that courts and the commission may be helpless to correct.we have no reason to believe congress would have wanted to impose an unforeseeable,potentially complex application date.
we vacate the court of appeals judgments and remand these cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

the chart illustrates the disproportionate sentences that such a scheme would create.see supra,at.for one thing,it would create sentencing cliffs at the act old triggering amounts of grams and grams where the old minimums would entirely trump the new guidelines,resulting in radically different guidelines sentences for small differences in quantity.for another,because of those cliffs,the scheme would create similar guidelines sentences for offenders who dealt in radically different amounts of crack,grams versus grams.
to be sure,as amicus points out,congress has provided two mechanisms through which an offender may escape an otherwise applicable mandatory minimum,diminishing this problem for some offenders.first,an offender may escape a minimum by providing substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person.e fed.rule crim.proc.b see also n ussg.second,under f,drug offenders who have little or no criminal history and who satisfy other requirements in the provision may obtain safety valve relief.see also ussg.and because of these mechanisms a substantial portion of offenders are relieved of application of a minimum.however,offenders with a criminal category of ii or higher are ineligible for safety valve relief they escape application of a minimum at a much lower percentage.see report table.

yet similar sentencing anomalies would result for repeat offenders if the drug act minimums remain in effect after the fair sentencing act guidelines became effective.take,for example,category ii offenders.

as the chart illustrates,for category ii offenders accountable for to grams of crack or for to grams,the minimums would entirely trump the guidelines,producing the same anomalies dissimilar for similar quantities and similar sentences for quantities described above.
in contrast,a scheme with the fair sentencing act minimums and new guidelines produces the proportionality in sentencing that congress intended in enacting the sentencing reform act and the fair sentencing act.

scalia,dissenting 
on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice scalia,with whom the chief justice,justice thomas,and justice alito join,dissenting.
in the fair sentencing act of,stat,congress increased the threshold quantities of crack cocaine required to trigger the and mandatory minimum penalties associated with offenses involving the manufacture,distribution,or dispensation of the drug,and eliminated the mandatory minimum previously associated with simple possession of it.the act is silent as to whether these changes apply to defendants who committed their offenses before,but whose sentencing proceedings occurred after,its august,effective date.in my view,the general saving statute,dictates that the new,more lenient mandatory minimum provisions do not apply to such offenders.
the court starts off on the right foot by acknowledging,ante,at,that the ameliorative amendments at issue here trigger application of the general saving statute.enacted in to reverse the rule that the repeal or amendment of a criminal statute would abate all nonfinal convictions under the repealed or amended statute,see warden marrero,the saving statute provides in relevant part 
the repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty,forfeiture,or liability incurred under such statute,unless the repealing act shall so expressly provide,and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty,forfeiture,or liability.
by reducing the statutory penalties for crack cocaine offenses,the fair sentencing act repeal ed the former penalties for defendants who committed their offenses and hence incurred the penalties while the prior law was in force,directs that the prior law shall be treated as still remaining in force.
although purports to require that subsequent legislation opting out of its default rule must do so expressly,the court correctly observes,ante,at,that requirements of this sort are ineffective.see lockhart united states,scalia,concurring.because one can not abridge the powers of a succeeding legislature,fletcher peck,cranch,a statute is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it,marbury madison,cranch.consequently,the requirement of is itself subject to repeal on the same terms as any other statute,which is to say that a repeal may be accomplished by implication.see,marrero,supra,at,great northern united states.
understanding the interpretive problem posed by these cases as one of implied repeal helps to explain the court observation,ante,at,that what is required to override default rule is a clear demonstration of congressional intent to do so.admittedly,our cases have not spoken with the utmost clarity on this point.in marrero,for example,we suggested that a fair implication from a subsequently enacted statute would suffice,at,while in hertz woodman,we used the phrase clear implication,at emphasis added see also ibid.plain implication in great northern,we split the difference,stating at one point that controls unless congress expresses a contrary intention either expressly or by necessary implication in a subsequent enactment,at emphasis added,but suggesting at another point that a fair implication,at,would do.in my view,the fair implication formulation understates the burden properly imposed on a defendant who would claim an implicit exception from terms.because the effect of such an exception is to work a pro tanto repeal of application to the defendant case,the implication from the subsequently enacted statute must be clear enough to overcome our strong presumption against implied repeals.see,matsushita industrial epstein,posadas national city bank.thus,we should conclude that congress has deviated from or any similar statute establishing a background interpretive principle only when the plain import of a later statute directly conflicts with it.lockhart,supra,at scalia,concurring emphasis added.
the considerations relied upon by the court do not come close to satisfying the demanding standard for repeal by implication.as an initial matter,there is no persuasive force whatever to the court observation that continuing to apply the prior mandatory minimums to offenders would involve imposing upon the offender a sentence at a time after congress had specifically found in the fair sentencing act that such a sentence was unfairly long.ante,at.that is true whenever congress reduces a criminal penalty,and so is a consequence that congress affirmatively embraced when it said in that ameliorative amendments to criminal statutes do not apply to conduct.nor does it matter that congress has instructed district courts,when applying the federal sentencing guidelines,to the version in force on the date of sentencing,with the object of reducing disparities in sentences between similar defendants who are sentenced for the same conduct at the same time.see a a ii.the presumption against implied repeals requires us to give effect,if possible,to both a a ii and.the courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments,and when two statutes are of,it is the duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the,to regard each as effective.morton mancari.we may readily do so here by holding that a a ii applies to guidelines amendments,
