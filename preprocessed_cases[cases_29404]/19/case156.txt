police officers in lexington,kentucky,followed a suspected drug dealer to an apartment complex.they smelled marijuana outside an apartment door,knocked loudly,and announced their presence.as soon as the officers began knocking,they heard noises coming from the apartment the officers believed that these noises were consistent with the destruction of evidence.the officers announced their intent to enter the apartment,kicked in the door,and found respondent and others.they saw drugs in plain view during a protective sweep of the apartment and found additional evidence during a subsequent search.the circuit court denied respondent motion to suppress the evidence,holding that exigent circumstances the need to prevent destruction of evidence justified the warrantless entry.respondent entered a conditional guilty plea,reserving his right to appeal the suppression ruling,and the kentucky court of appeals affirmed.the supreme court of kentucky reversed.the court assumed that exigent circumstances existed,but it nonetheless invalidated the search.the exigent circumstances rule did not apply,the court held,because the police should have foreseen that their conduct would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.
the exigent circumstances rule applies when the police do not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the fourth amendment.
a the fourth amendment expressly imposes two requirements all searches and seizures must be reasonable and a warrant may not be issued unless probable cause is properly established and the scope of the authorized search is set out with particularity.although searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable,brigham city stuart,this presumption may be overcome when the exigencies of the situation make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that a warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the fourth amendment,mincey arizona.one such exigency is the need to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.brigham city,supra,at.
b under the exigency doctrine,which lower courts have developed as an exception to the exigent circumstances rule,exigent circumstances do not justify a warrantless search when the exigency was created or manufactured by the conduct of the police.the lower courts have not agreed,however,on the test for determining when police impermissibly create an exigency.
c the proper test follows from the principle that permits warrantless searches warrantless searches are allowed when the circumstances make it reasonable,within the meaning of the fourth amendment,to dispense with the warrant requirement.thus,a warrantless entry based on exigent circumstances is reasonable when the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct violating the fourth amendment.a similar approach has been taken in other cases involving warrantless searches.for example,officers may seize evidence in plain view if they have not violated the fourth amendment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of the evidence is made,see horton california,and they may seek encounters if they are lawfully present in the place where the consensual encounter occurs,see ins delgado.
d some courts,including the kentucky supreme court,have imposed additional requirements asking whether officers deliberately created the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement,case below reasoning that police may not rely on an exigency if it was reasonably foreseeable that their investigative tactics would create the exigent circumstances,faulting officers for knocking on a door when they had sufficient evidence to seek a warrant but did not do so and finding that officers created or manufactured an exigency when their investigation was contrary to standard or good law enforcement practices.such requirements are unsound and are thus rejected.
e respondent contends that an exigency is impermissibly created when officers engage in conduct that would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry was imminent and inevitable,but that approach is also flawed.the ability of officers to respond to an exigency can not turn on such subtleties as the officers tone of voice in announcing their presence and the forcefulness of their knocks.a forceful knock may be necessary to alert the occupants that someone is at the door,and unless officers identify themselves loudly enough,occupants may not know who is at their doorstep.respondent test would make it extremely difficult for officers to know how loudly they may announce their presence or how forcefully they may knock without running afoul of the exigency rule.and in most cases,it would be nearly impossible for a court to determine whether that threshold had been passed.
assuming that an exigency existed here,there is no evidence that the officers either violated the fourth amendment or threatened to do so prior to the point when they entered the apartment.
a any question about whether an exigency existed here is better addressed by the kentucky supreme court on remand.
b assuming an exigency did exist,the officers conduct banging on the door and announcing their presence was entirely consistent with the fourth amendment.respondent has pointed to no evidence supporting his argument that the officers made any sort of demand to enter the apartment,much less a demand that amounts to a threat to violate the fourth amendment.if there is contradictory evidence that has not been brought to this court attention,the state court may elect to address that matter on remand.finally,the record makes clear that the officers announcement that they were going to enter the apartment was made after the exigency arose.

on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of kentucky 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
it is well established that exigent circumstances,including the need to prevent the destruction of evidence,permit police officers to conduct an otherwise permissible search without first obtaining a warrant.in this case,we consider whether this rule applies when police,by knocking on the door of a residence and announcing their presence,cause the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.the kentucky supreme court held that the exigent circumstances rule does not apply in the case at hand because the police should have foreseen that their conduct would prompt the occupants to attempt to destroy evidence.we reject this interpretation of the exigent circumstances rule.the conduct of the police prior to their entry into the apartment was entirely lawful.they did not violate the fourth amendment or threaten to do so.in such a situation,the exigent circumstances rule applies.
this case concerns the search of an apartment in lexington,kentucky.police officers set up a controlled buy of crack cocaine outside an apartment complex.undercover officer gibbons watched the deal take place from an unmarked car in a nearby parking lot.after the deal occurred,gibbons radioed uniformed officers to move in on the suspect.he told the officers that the suspect was moving quickly toward the breezeway of an apartment building,and he urged them to hurry up and get there before the suspect entered an apartment.app.
in response to the radio alert,the uniformed officers drove into the nearby parking lot,left their vehicles,and ran to the breezeway.just as they entered the breezeway,they heard a door shut and detected a very strong odor of burnt marijuana.at the end of the breezeway,the officers saw two apartments,one on the left and one on the right,and they did not know which apartment the suspect had entered.gibbons had radioed that the suspect was running into the apartment on the right,but the officers did not hear this statement because they had already left their vehicles.because they smelled marijuana smoke emanating from the apartment on the left,they approached the door of that apartment.
officer steven cobb,one of the uniformed officers who approached the door,testified that the officers banged on the left apartment door as loud as they could and announced,this is the police or police,police,police.at.cobb said that a s soon as the officers started banging on the door,they could hear people inside moving,and i t sounded as though things were being moved inside the apartment.at.these noises,cobb testified,led the officers to believe that evidence was about to be destroyed.
at that point,the officers announced that they were going to make entry inside the apartment.ibid.cobb then kicked in the door,the officers entered the apartment,and they found three people in the front room respondent hollis king,respondent girlfriend,and a guest who was smoking marijuana the officers performed a protective sweep of the apartment during which they saw marijuana and powder cocaine in plain view.in a subsequent search,they also discovered crack cocaine,cash,and drug paraphernalia.
police eventually entered the apartment on the right.inside,they found the suspected drug dealer who was the initial target of their investigation.
in the fayette county circuit court,a grand jury charged respondent with trafficking in marijuana,trafficking in a controlled substance,and persistent felony offender status.respondent filed a motion to suppress the evidence from the warrantless search,but the circuit court denied the motion.the circuit court concluded that the officers had probable cause to investigate the marijuana odor and that the officers properly conducted the investigation by initially knocking on the door of the apartment unit and awaiting the response or consensual entry.app.to pet.for cert.exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry,the court held,because there was no response at all to the knocking,and because officer cobb heard movement in the apartment which he reasonably concluded were persons in the act of destroying evidence,particularly narcotics because of the smell.ibid.respondent then entered a conditional guilty plea,reserving his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.the court sentenced respondent to years imprisonment.
the kentucky court of appeals affirmed.it held that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry because the police reasonably believed that evidence would be destroyed.the police did not impermissibly create the exigency,the court explained,because they did not deliberately evade the warrant requirement.
the supreme court of kentucky reversed.as a preliminary matter,the court observed that there was certainly some question as to whether the sound of persons moving inside the apartment was sufficient to establish that evidence was being destroyed.at.but the court did not answer that question.instead,it assume d for the purpose of argument that exigent circumstances existed.ibid.
to determine whether police impermissibly created the exigency,the supreme court of kentucky announced a test.first,the court held,police can not deliberately creat e the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.at internal quotation marks omitted.second,even absent bad faith,the court concluded,police may not rely on exigent circumstances if it was reasonably foreseeable that the investigative tactics employed by the police would create the exigent circumstances.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.although the court found no evidence of bad faith,it held that exigent circumstances could not justify the search because it was reasonably foreseeable that the occupants would destroy evidence when the police knocked on the door and announced their presence.ibid.
we granted certiorari.
the fourth amendment provides 
the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.
the text of the amendment thus expressly imposes two requirements.first,all searches and seizures must be reasonable.second,a warrant may not be issued unless probable cause is properly established and the scope of the authorized search is set out with particularity.see payton new york.
although the text of the fourth amendment does not specify when a search warrant must be obtained,this court has inferred that a warrant must generally be secured.it is a basic principle of fourth amendment law,we have often said,that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.brigham city stuart,quoting groh ramirez.but we have also recognized that this presumption may be overcome in some circumstances because t he ultimate touchstone of the fourth amendment is reasonableness.brigham city,supra,at see also michigan fisher,per curiam slip,at.accordingly,the warrant requirement is subject to certain reasonable exceptions.brigham city,supra,at.
one exception applies when the exigencies of the situation make the needs of law so compelling that a warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the fourth amendment.mincey arizona,see also payton,supra,at t he fourth amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house.absent exigent circumstances,that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant 
this court has identified several exigencies that may justify a warrantless search of a home.see brigham city,at.under the emergency aid exception,for example,officers may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.see also,fisher,supra,at slip,at upholding warrantless home entry based on emergency aid exception.police officers may enter premises without a warrant when they are in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect.see united states santana.and what is relevant here the need to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence has long been recognized as a sufficient justification for a warrantless search.brigham city,supra,at see also georgia randolph,minnesota olson,
over the years,lower courts have developed an exception to the exigent circumstances rule,the exigency doctrine.under this doctrine,police may not rely on the need to prevent destruction of evidence when that exigency was created or manufactured by the conduct of the police.see,united states chambers,f or a warrantless search to stand,law enforcement officers must be responding to an unanticipated exigency rather than simply creating the exigency for themselves united states gould,en banc a lthough exigent circumstances may justify a warrantless probable cause entry into the home,they will not do so if the exigent circumstances were manufactured by the agents internal quotation marks omitted.
in applying this exception for the creation or manufacturing of an exigency by the police,courts require something more than mere proof that fear of detection by the police caused the destruction of evidence.an additional showing is obviously needed because,as the eighth circuit has recognized,in some sense the police always create the exigent circumstances.united states duchi.that is to say,in the vast majority of cases in which evidence is destroyed by persons who are engaged in illegal conduct,the reason for the destruction is fear that the evidence will fall into the hands of law enforcement.destruction of evidence issues probably occur most frequently in drug cases because drugs may be easily destroyed by flushing them down a toilet or rinsing them down a drain.persons in possession of valuable drugs are unlikely to destroy them unless they fear discovery by the police.consequently,a rule that precludes the police from making a warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence whenever their conduct causes the exigency would unreasonably shrink the reach of this exception to the warrant requirement.
presumably for the purpose of avoiding such a result,the lower courts have held that the exigency doctrine requires more than simple causation,but the lower courts have not agreed on the test to be applied.indeed,the petition in this case maintains that t here are currently five different tests being used by the united states courts of appeals,pet.for cert,and that some state courts have crafted additional tests,at.
despite the welter of tests devised by the lower courts,the answer to the question presented in this case follows directly and clearly from the principle that permits warrantless searches in the first place.as previously noted,warrantless searches are allowed when the circumstances make it reasonable,within the meaning of the fourth amendment,to dispense with the warrant requirement.therefore,the answer to the question before us is that the exigent circumstances rule justifies a warrantless search when the conduct of the police preceding the exigency is reasonable in the same sense.where,as here,the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the fourth amendment,warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence is reasonable and thus allowed 
we have taken a similar approach in other cases involving warrantless searches.for example,we have held that law enforcement officers may seize evidence in plain view,provided that they have not violated the fourth amendment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of the evidence is made.see horton california.as we put it in horton,i t is an essential predicate to any valid warrantless seizure of incriminating evidence that the officer did not violate the fourth amendment in arriving at the place from which the evidence could be plainly viewed.at.so long as this prerequisite is satisfied,however,it does not matter that the officer who makes the observation may have gone to the spot from which the evidence was seen with the hope of being able to view and seize the evidence.see,at the fact that an officer is interested in an item of evidence and fully expects to find it in the course of a search should not invalidate its seizure instead,the fourth amendment requires only that the steps preceding the seizure be lawful.see,at.
similarly,officers may seek encounters if they are lawfully present in the place where the consensual encounter occurs.see ins delgado,noting that officers who entered into encounters with employees in a factory building were lawfully present in the factory pursuant to consent or a warrant if consent is freely given,it makes no difference that an officer may have approached the person with the hope or expectation of obtaining consent.see,at while most citizens will respond to a police request,the fact that people do so,and do so without being told they are free not to respond,hardly eliminates the consensual nature of the response 
some lower courts have adopted a rule that is similar to the one that we recognize today.see united states macdonald,en banc law enforcement officers do not impermissibly create exigent circumstances when they act in an entirely lawful manner state robinson,wi.but others,including the kentucky supreme court,have imposed additional requirements that are unsound and that we now reject.
bad faith.some courts,including the kentucky supreme court,ask whether law enforcement officers deliberately created the exigent circumstances with the bad faith intent to avoid the warrant requirement.at quoting gould,at see also,chambers,at united states socey,cadc united states rengifo.
this approach is fundamentally inconsistent with our fourth amendment jurisprudence.our cases have repeatedly rejected a subjective approach,asking only whether the circumstances,viewed objectively,justify the action.brigham city,at alteration and internal quotation marks omitted see also fisher,at slip,at.indeed,we have never held,outside limited contexts such as an inventory search or administrative inspection,that an officer motive invalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the fourth amendment.whren united states,see also brigham city,supra,at.
the reasons for looking to objective factors,rather than subjective intent,are clear.legal tests based on reasonableness are generally objective,and this court has long taken the view that evenhanded law enforcement is best achieved by the application of objective standards of conduct,rather than standards that depend upon the subjective state of mind of the officer.horton,supra,at.
reasonable foreseeability.some courts,again including the kentucky supreme court,hold that police may not rely on an exigency if it was reasonably foreseeable that the investigative tactics employed by the police would create the exigent circumstances.at quoting mann state,see also,united states mowatt.courts applying this test have invalidated warrantless home searches on the ground that it was reasonably foreseeable that police officers,by knocking on the door and announcing their presence,would lead a drug suspect to destroy evidence.see,at,at.
contrary to this reasoning,however,we have rejected the notion that police may seize evidence without a warrant only when they come across the evidence by happenstance.in horton,as noted,we held that the police may seize evidence in plain view even though the officers may be interested in an item of evidence and fully expec t to find it in the course of a search.at.
adoption of a reasonable foreseeability test would also introduce an unacceptable degree of unpredictability.for example,whenever law enforcement officers knock on the door of premises occupied by a person who may be involved in the drug trade,there is some possibility that the occupants may possess drugs and may seek to destroy them.under a reasonable foreseeability test,it would be necessary to quantify the degree of predictability that must be reached before the exigency doctrine comes into play.
a simple example illustrates the difficulties that such an approach would produce.suppose that the officers in the present case did not smell marijuana smoke and thus knew only that there was a chance that the fleeing suspect had entered the apartment on the left rather than the apartment on the right.under those circumstances,would it have been reasonably foreseeable that the occupants of the apartment on the left would seek to destroy evidence upon learning that the police were at the door or suppose that the officers knew only that the suspect had disappeared into one of the apartments on a floor with,or even units if the police chose a door at random and knocked for the purpose of asking the occupants if they knew a person who fit the description of the suspect,would it have been reasonably foreseeable that the occupants would seek to destroy evidence 
we have noted that t he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make judgments in circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly evolving.graham connor.the reasonable foreseeability test would create unacceptable and unwarranted difficulties for law enforcement officers who must make quick decisions in the field,as well as for judges who would be required to determine after the fact whether the destruction of evidence in response to a knock on the door was reasonably foreseeable based on what the officers knew at the time.
probable cause and time to secure a warrant.some courts,in applying the exigency doctrine,fault law enforcement officers if,after acquiring evidence that is sufficient to establish probable cause to search particular premises,the officers do not seek a warrant but instead knock on the door and seek either to speak with an occupant or to obtain consent to search.see,chambers,supra,at citing t he failure to seek a warrant in the face of plentiful probable cause as a factor indicating that the police deliberately created the exigency.
this approach unjustifiably interferes with legitimate law enforcement strategies.there are many entirely proper reasons why police may not want to seek a search warrant as soon as the bare minimum of evidence needed to establish probable cause is acquired.without attempting to provide a comprehensive list of these reasons,we note a few.
first,the police may wish to speak with the occupants of a dwelling before deciding whether it is worthwhile to seek authorization for a search.they may think that a short and simple conversation may obviate the need to apply for and execute a warrant.see schneckloth bustamonte.second,the police may want to ask an occupant of the premises for consent to search because doing so is simpler,faster,and less burdensome than applying for a warrant.a consensual search also may result in considerably less inconvenience and embarrassment to the occupants than a search conducted pursuant to a warrant.ibid.third,law enforcement officers may wish to obtain more evidence before submitting what might otherwise be considered a marginal warrant application.fourth,prosecutors may wish to wait until they acquire evidence that can justify a search that is broader in scope than the search that a judicial officer is likely to authorize based on the evidence then available.and finally,in many cases,law enforcement may not want to execute a search that will disclose the existence of an investigation because doing so may interfere with the acquisition of additional evidence against those already under suspicion or evidence about additional but as yet unknown participants in a criminal scheme.
we have said that l aw enforcement officers are under no constitutional duty to call a halt to criminal investigation the moment they have the minimum evidence to establish probable cause.hoffa united states.faulting the police for failing to apply for a search warrant at the earliest possible time after obtaining probable cause imposes a duty that is nowhere to be found in the constitution.
standard or good investigative tactics.finally,some lower court cases suggest that law enforcement officers may be found to have created or manufactured an exigency if the court concludes that the course of their investigation was contrary to standard or good law enforcement practices or to the policies or practices of their jurisdictions.gould,at.this approach fails to provide clear guidance for law enforcement officers and authorizes courts to make judgments on matters that are the province of those who are responsible for federal and state law enforcement agencies.
respondent argues for a rule that differs from those discussed above,but his rule is also flawed.respondent contends that law enforcement officers impermissibly create an exigency when they engage in conduct that would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry is imminent and inevitable.brief for respondent.in respondent view,relevant factors include the officers tone of voice in announcing their presence and the forcefulness of their knocks.but the ability of law enforcement officers to respond to an exigency can not turn on such subtleties.
police officers may have a very good reason to announce their presence loudly and to knock on the door with some force.a forceful knock may be necessary to alert the occupants that someone is at the door.united states banks,police rapped hard enough on the door to be heard by officers at the back door and announced their presence,but defendant was in the shower and testified that he heard nothing furthermore,unless police officers identify themselves loudly enough,occupants may not know who is at their doorstep.officers are permitted indeed,encouraged to identify themselves to citizens,and in many circumstances this is cause for assurance,not discomfort.united states drayton.citizens who are startled by an unexpected knock on the door or by the sight of unknown persons in plain clothes on their doorstep may be relieved to learn that these persons are police officers.others may appreciate the opportunity to make an informed decision about whether to answer the door to the police.
if respondent test were adopted,it would be extremely difficult for police officers to know how loudly they may announce their presence or how forcefully they may knock on a door without running afoul of the exigency rule.and in most cases,it would be nearly impossible for a court to determine whether that threshold had been passed.the fourth amendment does not require the nebulous and impractical test that respondent proposes 
for these reasons,we conclude that the exigent circumstances rule applies when the police do not gain entry to premises by means of an actual or threatened violation of the fourth amendment.this holding provides ample protection for the privacy rights that the amendment protects.
when law enforcement officers who are not armed with a warrant knock on a door,they do no more than any private citizen might do.and whether the person who knocks on the door and requests the opportunity to speak is a police officer or a private citizen,the occupant has no obligation to open the door or to speak.florida royer.h e may decline to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way when the police knock on a door but the occupants choose not to respond or to speak,the investigation will have reached a conspicuously low point,and the occupants will have the kind of warning that even the most elaborate security system can not provide.chambers,at sutton,dissenting.and even if an occupant chooses to open the door and speak with the officers,the occupant need not allow the officers to enter the premises and may refuse to answer any questions at any time.
occupants who choose not to stand on their constitutional rights but instead elect to attempt to destroy evidence have only themselves to blame for the warrantless search that may ensue.
we now apply our interpretation of the exigency doctrine to the facts of this case.
we need not decide whether exigent circumstances existed in this case.any warrantless entry based on exigent circumstances must,of course,be supported by a genuine exigency.see brigham city,at.the trial court and the kentucky court of appeals found that there was a real exigency in this case,but the kentucky supreme court expressed doubt on this issue,observing that there was certainly some question as to whether the sound of persons moving inside the apartment was sufficient to establish that evidence was being destroyed.at.the kentucky supreme court assum ed for the purpose of argument that exigent circumstances existed,and it held that the police had impermissibly manufactured the exigency.
we,too,assume for purposes of argument that an exigency existed.we decide only the question on which the kentucky supreme court ruled and on which we granted certiorari under what circumstances do police impermissibly create an exigency any question about whether an exigency actually existed is better addressed by the kentucky supreme court on remand.see kirk louisiana,per curiam reversing judgment that exigent circumstances were not required for warrantless home entry and remanding for state court to determine whether exigent circumstances were present.
in this case,we see no evidence that the officers either violated the fourth amendment or threatened to do so prior to the point when they entered the apartment.officer cobb testified without contradiction that the officers banged on the door as loud as they could and announced either police,police,police or this is the police.app.this conduct was entirely consistent with the fourth amendment,and we are aware of no other evidence that might show that the officers either violated the fourth amendment or threatened to do so for example,by announcing that they would break down the door if the occupants did not open the door voluntarily.
respondent argues that the officers demanded entry to the apartment,but he has not pointed to any evidence in the record that supports this assertion.he relies on a passing statement made by the trial court in its opinion denying respondent motion to suppress.see app.to pet.for cert.in recounting the events that preceded the search,the judge wrote that the officers banged on the door of the apartment on the back left of the breezeway identifying themselves as police officers and demanding that the door be opened by the persons inside.ibid.emphasis added and deleted.however,at a later point in this opin
