petitioner cory maples was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in alabama state court.in,maples sought postconviction relief in state court under alabama rule.maples alleged,among other things,that his underpaid and inexperienced trial attorneys failed to afford him the effective assistance guaranteed by the sixth amendment.his petition was written by two pro bono attorneys,jaasai munanka and clara,both associated with the new york offices of the sullivan cromwell law firm.as required by alabama law,the two attorneys engaged an alabama lawyer,john butler,to move their admission pro hac vice.butler made clear,however,that he would undertake no substantive involvement in the case.
in,while maples state postconviction petition was pending,munanka and left sullivan cromwell.their new employment disabled them from representing maples.they did not inform maples of their departure and consequent inability to serve as his counsel.in disregard of alabama law,neither sought the trial court leave to withdraw.no other sullivan cromwell attorney entered an appearance,moved to substitute counsel,or otherwise notified the court of a change in maples representation.thus,munanka,and butler remained maples listed,and only,attorneys of record.
the trial court denied maples petition in may.notices of the order were posted to munanka and at sullivan cromwell address.when those postings were returned,unopened,the trial court clerk attempted no further mailing.butler also received a copy of the order,but did not act on it.with no attorney of record in fact acting on maples behalf,the period maples had to file a notice of appeal ran out.
about a month later,an alabama assistant attorney general sent a letter directly to maples.the letter informed maples of the missed deadline and notified him that he had four weeks remaining to file a federal habeas petition.maples immediately contacted his mother,who called sullivan cromwell.three sullivan cromwell attorneys,through butler,moved the trial court to reissue its order,thereby restarting the appeal period.the court denied the motion.the alabama court of criminal appeals then denied a writ of mandamus that would have granted maples leave to file an appeal,and the state supreme court affirmed.
thereafter,maples sought federal habeas relief.both the district court and the eleventh circuit denied his request,pointing to the procedural default in state court,maples failure timely to appeal the state trial court order denying his rule petition for postconviction relief.
held maples has shown the requisite cause to excuse his procedural default.
a as a rule,a federal court may not entertain a state prisoner habeas claims when a state court has declined to address those claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement,and the state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.walker martin.the bar to federal review may be lifted,however,if the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the procedural default in state court and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.coleman thompson.
cause for a procedural default exists where something external to the petitioner,something that can not fairly be attributed to him,impeded his efforts to comply with the state procedural rule.at.a prisoner postconviction attorney negligence does not qualify as cause,because the attorney is the prisoner agent,and under agency law,the principal bears the risk of his agent negligent conduct,at.thus,a petitioner is bound by his attorney failure to meet a filing deadline and can not rely on that failure to establish cause.ibid.
a markedly different situation arises,however,when an attorney abandons his client without notice,and thereby occasions the default.in such cases,the relationship is severed and the attorney acts or omissions can not fairly be attributed to the client.at.nor can the client be faulted for failing to act on his own behalf when he lacks reason to believe his attorneys of record,in fact,are not representing him.
holland florida,is instructive.there,the court found that the deadline for filing a federal habeas petition can be tolled for equitable reasons,and that an attorney unprofessional conduct may sometimes be an extraordinary circumstance justifying equitable tolling,at.the court recognized that an attorney negligence does not provide a basis for tolling a statutory time limit,at.holland claim that he was abandoned by his attorney,however,if true,would suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances beyond his control,at opinion of alito.
b from the time of his initial rule petition until well after time ran out for appealing the trial court denial of that petition,maples sole attorneys of record were munanka,and butler.unknown to maples,none of those lawyers was in fact serving as his attorney during the appeal period.
the state contends that sullivan cromwell represented maples throughout his state postconviction proceedings,and that,as a result,maples can not establish abandonment by counsel during the period.but it is undisputed that munanka and severed their agency relationship with maples long before the default occurred.furthermore,because the attorneys did not seek the trial court permission to withdraw,they allowed court records to convey that they remained the attorneys of record.as such,the attorneys,not maples,would be the addressees of court orders alabama law requires the clerk to furnish.
the state asserts that,after munanka and departure,other sullivan cromwell attorneys came forward to serve as maples counsel.at the time of the default,however,those attorneys had not been admitted to practice in alabama,had not entered their appearances on maples behalf,and had done nothing to inform the alabama court that they wished to substitute for munanka and ingenhousz.thus,they lacked the legal authority to act on maples behalf before his time to appeal expired.
maples only other attorney of record,local counsel butler,did not even begin to represent maples.butler told munanka and that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of enabling them to appear pro hac vice and would play no substantive role in the case.other factors confirm that butler was not maples agent in any meaningful sense of that word.holland,at opinion of alito.upon receiving a copy of the trial court order,butler did not contact sullivan cromwell to ensure that firm lawyers were taking appropriate action.nor did the state treat butler as maples actual representative.notably,the alabama assistant attorney general wrote directly and only to maples,notwithstanding an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an opposing party known to be represented by counsel.
not only was maples left without any functioning attorney of record the very listing of munanka,and butler as his representatives meant that he had no right personally to receive notice.he in fact received none within the days allowed for commencing an appeal.given no reason to suspect that he lacked counsel able and willing to represent him,maples surely was blocked from complying with the state procedural rule.
c the cause and prejudice requirement shows due regard for states finality and comity interests while ensuring that fundamental fairness remains the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus.dretke haley.in the unusual circumstances of this case,agency law principles and fundamental fairness point to the same conclusion there was indeed cause to excuse maples procedural default.through no fault of his own,he lacked the assistance of any authorized attorney during the appeal period.and he had no reason to suspect that,in reality,he had been reduced to pro se status.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
cory maples is an alabama capital prisoner sentenced to death in for the murder of two individuals.at trial,he was represented by two appointed lawyers,minimally paid and with scant experience in capital cases.maples sought postconviction relief in state court,alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and several other trial infirmities.his petition,filed in august,was written by two new york attorneys serving pro bono,both associated with the same new large law firm.an alabama attorney,designated as local counsel,moved the admission of the counsel pro hac vice.as understood by new york counsel,local counsel would facilitate their appearance,but would undertake no substantive involvement in the case.
in the summer of,while maples postconviction petition remained pending in the alabama trial court,his new york attorneys left the law firm their new employment disabled them from continuing to represent maples.they did not inform maples of their departure and consequent inability to serve as his counsel.nor did they seek the alabama trial court leave to withdraw.neither they nor anyone else moved for the substitution of counsel able to handle maples case.
in may,the alabama trial court denied maples petition.notices of the court order were posted to the new york attorneys at the address of the law firm with which they had been associated.those postings were,unopened,to the trial court clerk,who attempted no further mailing.with no attorney of record in fact acting on maples behalf,the time to appeal ran out.
thereafter,maples petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.the district court and,in turn,the eleventh circuit,rejected his petition,pointing to the procedural default in state court,maples failure timely to appeal the alabama trial court order denying him postconviction relief.maples,it is uncontested,was blameless for the default.
the sole question this court has taken up for review is whether,on the extraordinary facts of maples case,there is cause to excuse the default.maples maintains that there is,for the lawyers he believed to be vigilantly representing him had abandoned the case without leave of court,without informing maples they could no longer represent him,and without securing any recorded substitution of counsel.we agree.abandoned by counsel,maples was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state postconviction petition,and he lacked a clue of any need to protect himself pro se.in these circumstances,no just system would lay the default at maples door.satisfied that the requisite cause has been shown,we reverse the eleventh circuit judgment.

this system was in place when,in,alabama charged maples with two counts of capital murder the victims,stacy alan terry and barry dewayne robinson ii,were maples friends who,on the night of the murders,had been out on the town with him.maples pleaded not guilty,and his case proceeded to trial,where he was represented by two alabama attorneys.only one of them had earlier served in a capital case.see tr.neither counsel had previously tried the penalty phase of a capital case.compensation for each lawyer was capped at for time spent preparing maples case,and at per hour for services.see.code.

two volunteers represented maples in postconviction proceedings jaasi munanka and clara,both associates at the new york offices of the sullivan cromwell law firm.at the time,alabama required attorneys to associate local counsel when seeking admission to practice pro hac vice before an alabama court,regardless of the nature of the proceeding.rule governing admission to the.state bar vii hereinafter rule vii the alabama rule further prescribed that the local attorney name appear on all,orders,pleadings,and other documents filed in the cause,and that local counsel accept joint and several responsibility with the foreign attorney to the client,to opposing parties and counsel,and to the court or administrative agency in all matters relating to the case.rule vii c.
munanka and associated huntsville,alabama attorney john butler as local counsel.notwithstanding his obligations under alabama law,butler informed munanka and,at the outset,that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of allowing the two new york attorneys to appear pro hac vice on behalf of maples.app.to pet.for cert.given his lack of resources,available time and experience,butler told the sullivan cromwell lawyers,he could not deal with substantive issues in the case.ibid.the sullivan cromwell attorneys accepted butler conditions,at.this arrangement between and local attorneys,it appears,was hardly atypical.see justices brief the fact is that local counsel for attorneys in litigation most often do nothing other than provide the mechanism for foreign attorneys to be admitted.
with the aid of his pro bono counsel,maples filed a petition for postconviction relief under alabama rule of criminal procedure among other claims,maples asserted that his attorneys provided ineffective assistance during both guilt and penalty phases of his capital trial.app.he alleged,in this regard,that his inexperienced and underfunded attorneys failed to develop and raise an obvious intoxication defense,did not object to several egregious instances of prosecutorial misconduct,and woefully underprepared for the penalty phase of his trial.the state responded by moving for summary dismissal of maples petition.on december,the trial court denied the state motion.
some seven months later,in the summer of,both munanka and left sullivan cromwell.app.to pet.for cert.munanka gained a clerkship with a federal judge accepted a position with the european commission in belgium.ibid.neither attorney told maples of their departure from sullivan cromwell or of their resulting inability to continue to represent him.in disregard of alabama law,see.rule crim.proc,comment,neither attorney sought the trial court leave to withdraw,app.to pet.for cert.compounding munanka and inaction,no other sullivan cromwell lawyer entered an appearance on maples behalf,moved to substitute counsel,or otherwise notified the court of any change in maples representation.ibid.
another nine months passed.during this time period,no sullivan cromwell attorneys assigned to maples case sought admission to the alabama bar,entered appearances on maples behalf,or otherwise advised the alabama court that munanka and were no longer maples attorneys.thus,munanka and along with butler remained maples listed,and only,attorneys of record.at.
there things stood when,in may,the trial court,without holding a hearing,entered an order denying maples rule petition.app.the clerk of the alabama trial court mailed copies of the order to maples three attorneys of record.he sent munanka and copies to sullivan cromwell new york address,which the pair had provided upon entering their appearances.
when those copies arrived at sullivan cromwell,munanka and had long since departed.the notices,however,were not forwarded to another sullivan cromwell attorney.instead,a mailroom employee sent the unopened envelopes back to the court.returned to sender attempted,unknown was stamped on the envelope addressed to munanka.app.to reply to brief in opposition.a similar stamp appeared on the envelope addressed to,along with the handwritten notation return to sender left firm.at.
upon receiving back the unopened envelopes he had mailed to munanka and,the alabama court clerk took no further action.in particular,the clerk did not contact munanka or at the personal telephone numbers or home addresses they had provided in their pro hac vice applications.see verified application for admission to practice under rule vii,and munanka verified application for admission to practice under rule vii,in maples state,no.morgan.nor did the clerk alert sullivan cromwell or butler.butler received his copy of the order,but did not act on it.app.to pet.for cert.he assumed that munanka and,who had been cc on the order,would take care of filing an appeal.ibid.
meanwhile,the clock ticked on maples appeal.under alabama rules of appellate procedure,maples had days to file a notice of appeal from the trial court may,order denying maples petition for postconviction relief.rule a.no appeal notice was filed,and the time allowed for filing expired on july.
a little over a month later,on august,alabama assistant attorney general jon hayden,the attorney representing the state in maples collateral review proceedings,sent a letter directly to maples.app.to pet.for cert.hayden letter informed maples of the missed deadline for initiating an appeal within the state system,and notified him that four weeks remained during which he could file a federal habeas petition.ibid.hayden mailed the letter to maples only,using his prison address.ibid.no copy was sent to maples attorneys of record,or to anyone else acting on maples behalf.ibid.
upon receiving the state letter,maples immediately contacted his mother,at.she telephoned sullivan cromwell to inquire about her son case.ibid.prompted by her call,sullivan cromwell attorneys marc de leeuw,felice duffy,and kathy brewer submitted a motion,through butler,asking the trial court to reissue its order denying maples rule petition,thereby restarting the appeal period,at.
the trial court denied the motion,at,that munanka and had not withdrawn from the case and,consequently,were still attorneys of record for the petitioner,at.furthermore,the court added,attorneys de leeuw,duffy,and brewer had not yet been admitted to practice in alabama or entered appearances as attorneys of record.ibid.how,the court asked,can a circuit clerk in decatur,alabama know what is going on in a law firm in new york,new york at.declining to blame the clerk for the missed notice of appeal deadline,the court said it was unwilling to enter into subterfuge in order to gloss over mistakes made by counsel for the petitioner.ibid.
maples next petitioned the alabama court of criminal appeals for a writ of mandamus,granting him leave to file an appeal.rejecting maples plea,the court of criminal appeals determined that,although the clerk had assumed a duty to notify the parties of the resolution of maples rule petition,the clerk had satisfied that obligation by sending notices to the attorneys of record at the addresses those attorneys provided,at.butler receipt of the order,the court observed,sufficed to notify all attorneys in light of their apparent status.at quoting thomas kellett,so.the alabama supreme court summarily affirmed the court of criminal appeals judgment,app.to pet.for cert,and this court denied certiorari,maples alabama.
having exhausted his state postconviction remedies,maples sought federal habeas corpus relief.addressing the claims maples stated in his federal petition,the state urged that maples had forever forfeited those claims.maples did,indeed,present the claims in his state postconviction rule petition,the state observed,but he did not timely appeal from the trial court denial of his petition.that procedural default,the state maintained,precluded consideration of the claims maples replied that the default should be excused,because he missed the appeal deadline through no fault of his own.app.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court determined that maples had defaulted his claims,and that he had not shown cause sufficient to overcome the default.app.to pet.for cert.the court understood maples to argue that errors committed by his postconviction counsel,not any lapse on the part of the court clerk in alabama,provided the requisite cause to excuse his failure to meet alabama rule,at.such an argument was inadmissible,the court ruled,because this court,in coleman thompson,had held that the ineffectiveness of postconviction appellate counsel could not qualify as cause.app.to pet.for cert.citing coleman,at.
a divided panel of the eleventh circuit affirmed.maples allen,per curiam.in accord with the district court,the court of appeals majority held that maples defaulted his claims in state court by failing to file a timely notice of appeal,at,and that coleman rendered maples assertion of cause unacceptable,at.
judge barkett dissented,at.she concluded that the alabama court of criminal appeals had acted arbitrarily in refusing to grant maples request for an appeal,at.in a case involving indistinguishable facts,judge barkett noted,the alabama appellate court had allowed the petitioner to file a late appeal.ibid.citing marshall state,so.crim.app.inconsistent application of the rule,judge barkett said,render ed the rule an inadequate ground on which to bar federal review of maples claims.at.the interests of justice,she added,required review of maples claims in view of the exceptional circumstances and high stakes involved,and the absence of any fault on maples part.ibid.
we granted certiorari to decide whether the uncommon facts presented here establish cause adequate to excuse maples procedural default.
as a rule,a state prisoner habeas claims may not be entertained by a federal court when a state court has declined to address those claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement,and the state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.walker martin,slip,at quoting coleman,at.the bar to federal review may be lifted,however,if the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the procedural default in state court and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.at see wainwright sykes.
given the single issue on which we granted review,we will assume,for purposes of this decision,that the alabama court of criminal appeals refusal to consider maples claims rested on an and adequate state procedural ground namely,maples failure to satisfy alabama rule requiring a notice of appeal to be filed within days from the trial court final order.accordingly,we confine our consideration to the question whether maples has shown cause to excuse the missed notice of appeal deadline.
cause for a procedural default exists where something external to the petitioner,something that can not fairly be attributed to him,impeded his efforts to comply with the state procedural rule.coleman,at quoting murray carrier,emphasis in original.negligence on the part of a prisoner postconviction attorney does not qualify as cause.coleman,at.that is so,we reasoned in coleman,because the attorney is the prisoner agent,and under principles of agency law,the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his agent,at.see also irwin department of veterans affairs,under our system of representative litigation,each party is deemed bound by the acts of his.quoting link wabash.thus,when a petitioner postconviction attorney misses a filing deadline,the petitioner is bound by the oversight and can not rely on it to establish cause.coleman,at.we do not disturb that general rule.
a markedly different situation is presented,however,when an attorney abandons his client without notice,and thereby occasions the default.having severed the relationship,an attorney no longer acts,or fails to act,as the client representative.see restatement third of law governing lawyers,comment f withdrawal,whether proper or improper,terminates the lawyer authority to act for the client.his acts or omissions therefore can not fairly be attributed to the client.coleman,at.see,jamison lockhart,attorney conduct may provide cause to excuse a state procedural default where,as a result of a conflict of interest,the attorney ceased to be petitioner agent porter state,finding good cause for petitioner failure to file a timely habeas petition where the petitioner attorney terminated his representation without notifying petitioner and without taking any formal steps to withdraw as the attorney of record 
our recent decision in holland florida,is instructive.that case involved a missed deadline,prescribed by d,for filing a federal habeas petition.holland presented two issues first,whether the d time limitation can be tolled for equitable reasons,and,second,whether an attorney unprofessional conduct can ever count as an extraordinary circumstance justifying equitable tolling,at,slip,at,internal quotation marks omitted.we answered yes to both questions.
on the second issue,the court recognized that an negligence,for example,miscalculating a filing deadline,does not provide a basis for tolling a statutory time limit,at slip,at,at alito,concurring in part and concurring in judgment slip,at see lawrence florida.the holland petitioner,however,urged that attorney negligence was not the gravamen of his complaint.rather,he asserted that his lawyer had detached himself from any trust relationship with his client my lawyer has abandoned me,the petitioner complained to the court,at slip,at brackets and internal quotation marks omitted see nara frank,ordering a hearing on whether a client effective abandonment by his lawyer merited tolling of the deadline for filing a federal habeas petition.
in a concurring opinion in holland,justice alito homed in on the essential difference between a claim of attorney error,however egregious,and a claim that an attorney had essentially abandoned his client,at slip,at.holland plea fit the latter category he alleged abandonment evidenced by counsel failure to communicate with petitioner or to respond to petitioner many inquiries and requests over a period of several years.at slip,at see,at,majority opinion slip,at.if true,justice alito explained,petitioner allegations would suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances beyond his control common sense dictates that a litigant can not be held constructively responsible for the conduct of an attorney who is not operating as his agent in any meaningful sense of that word.at slip,at 
we agree that,under agency principles,a client can not be charged with the acts or omissions of an attorney who has abandoned him.nor can a client be faulted for failing to act on his own behalf when he lacks reason to believe his attorneys of record,in fact,are not representing him.we therefore inquire whether maples has shown that his attorneys of record abandoned him,thereby supplying the extraordinary circumstances beyond his control,necessary to lift the state procedural bar to his federal petition.
from the time he filed his initial rule petition until well after time ran out for appealing the trial court denial of that petition,maples had only three attorneys of record munanka,and butler.unknown to maples,not one of these lawyers was in fact serving as his attorney during the days permitted for an appeal from the trial court order.
the state contends that sullivan cromwell represented maples throughout his state postconviction proceedings.accordingly,the state urges,maples can not establish abandonment by counsel continuing through the six weeks allowed for noticing an appeal from the trial court denial of his rule petition.we disagree.it is undisputed that munanka and severed their agency relationship with maples long before the default occurred.see brief for respondent conceding that the two attorneys erred in failing to file motions to withdraw from the case.both munanka and left sullivan cromwell employ in the summer of,at least nine months before the alabama trial court entered its order denying rule relief.app.to pet.for cert.their new employment munanka as a law clerk for a federal judge,as an employee of the european commission in belgium disabled them from continuing to represent maples.see code of conduct for judicial employees,canon d prohibiting judicial employees from participating in litigation against federal,state or local government staff regulations of officials of the european commission,tit.i,employees can not perform outside work without first obtaining authorization from the commission,available at as visited,and in clerk of court case file.hornbook agency law establishes that the attorneys departure from sullivan cromwell and their commencement of employment that prevented them from representing maples ended their agency relationship with him.see restatement second of agency hereinafter restatement second t he authority of an agent terminates if,without knowledge of the principal,he acquires adverse interests or if he is otherwise guilty of a serious breach of loyalty to the principal.comment a t he agent commits a breach of duty of loyalty to his principal by acting for another in an undertaking which has a substantial tendency to cause him to disregard his duty to serve his principal with only his principal purposes in mind.
furthermore,the two attorneys did not observe alabama rule requiring them to seek the trial court permission to withdraw.see.rule crim.proc,comment.restatement second,comment b i t is ordinarily inferred that a principal does not intend an agent to do an illegal act.by failing to seek permission to withdraw,munanka and allowed the court records to convey that they represented maples.as listed attorneys of record,they,not maples,would be the addressees of court orders alabama law requires the clerk to furnish.see.rule crim.proc.upon the entry of any order in a criminal proceeding made in response to a motion,the clerk shall,without undue delay,furnish all parties a copy thereof by mail or by other appropriate means.and w here the defendant is represented by counsel,service shall be made upon the attorney of record.
although acknowledging that munanka and severed their agency relationship with maples upon their departure from sullivan cromwell,the state argues that,nonetheless,maples was not abandoned.other attorneys at the firm,the state asserts,continued to serve as maples counsel.regarding this assertion,we note,first,that the record is cloudy on the role other sullivan cromwell attorneys played.in an affidavit submitted to the alabama trial court in support of maples request that the court reissue its rule order,see supra,at,partner marc de leeuw stated that he had been in maples case since the summer of.app.to pet.for cert.after the trial court initially denied the state motion to dismiss in december,de leeuw informed the court,sullivan cromwell lawyers working on this case for maples prepared for an anticipated evidentiary hearing.at.another sullivan cromwell attorney,felice duffy,stated,in an affidavit submitted to the alabama trial court in september,that she ha d worked on maples case since october.app.but neither de leeuw nor duffy described what their involve ment or wor k on maples case entailed.and neither attorney named the lawyers,other than munanka and both of them still with sullivan cromwell in december,engaged in preparation for the expected hearing.nor did de leeuw identify the specific work,if any,other lawyers performed on maples case between munanka and departures and the firm receipt of the telephone call from maples mother 
the slim record on activity at sullivan cromwell,however,does not warrant a remand to determine more precisely the work done by firm lawyers other than munanka and.for the facts essential to our decision are not in doubt.at the time of the default,the sullivan cromwell attorneys who later came forward de leeuw,felice duffy,and kathy brewer had not been admitted to practice law in alabama,had not entered their appearances on maples behalf,and had done nothing to inform the alabama court that they wished to substitute for munanka and.thus,none of these attorneys had the legal authority to act on maples behalf before his time to appeal expired.restatement second the failure to acquire a qualification by the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized act terminates the agent authority to act.what they did or did not do in their new york offices is therefore beside the point.at the time critical to preserving maples access to an appeal,they,like munanka and,were not maples authorized agents.
maples only other attorney of record,local counsel butler,also left him abandoned.indeed,butler did not even begin to represent maples.butler informed munanka and that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of enabling the two attorneys to appear pro hac vice.supra,at.lacking the necessary resources,available time and experience,butler told the two sullivan cromwell lawyers,he would not deal with substantive issues in the case.ibid.that the minimal participation he undertook was inconsistent with alabama law,see rule vii,supra,at,underscores the absurdity of holding maples barred because butler signed on as local counsel.
in recognizing that butler had no role in the case other than to allow munanka and to appear pro hac vice,we need not rely solely on butler and de leeuw statements to that effect.app.to pet.for cert.other factors confirm that butler did not operat e as maples agent in any meaningful sense of that word.holland,at alito,concurring in part and concurring in judgment slip,at.the first is butler own conduct.upon receiving a copy of the trial court rule order,butler did not contact sullivan cromwell to ensure that firm lawyers were taking appropriate action.although butler had reason to believe that munanka and had received a copy of the court order,see app.indicating that munanka and were cc on the order,butler failure even to place a phone call to the new york firm substantiates his disclaimer of any genuinely representative role in the case.
notably,the state did not treat butler as maples actual representative.assistant attorney general hayden addressed the letter informing maples of the default directly to maples in prison.see supra,at.hayden sent no copy to,nor did he otherwise notify,any of the attorneys listed as counsel of record for maples.lawyers in alabama have an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an opposing party known to be represented by counsel.see.rule of professional conduct.rule crim.proc.requiring that the service of all documents be made upon the attorney of record in writing directly and only to maples,notwithstanding this ethical obligation,assistant attorney general hayden must have believed that maples was no longer represented by counsel,or local 
in sum,the record admits of only one reading at no time before the missed deadline was butler serving as maples agent in any meaningful sense of that word.holland,at opinion of alito,slip,at.
not only was maples left without any functioning attorney of record,the very listing of munanka,and butler as his representatives meant that he had no right personally to receive notice.see supra,at.he in fact received none or any other warning that he had better fend for himself.had counsel of record or the state attorney informed maples of his plight before the time to appeal ran out,he could have filed a notice of appeal or enlisted the aid of new volunteer attorneys given no reason to suspect that he lacked counsel able and willing to represent him,maples surely was blocked from complying with the state procedural rule.
the cause and prejudice requirement,we have said,shows due regard for states finality and comity interests while ensuring that fundamental fairness remains the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus.dretke haley,quoting strickland washington.in the unusual circumstances of this case,principles of agency law and fundamental fairness point to the same conclusion there was indeed cause to excuse maples procedural default.through no fault of his own,maples lacked the assistance of any authorized attorney during the days alabama allows for noticing an appeal from a trial court denial of postconviction relief.as just observed,he had no reason to suspect that,in reality,he had been reduced to pro se status.maples was disarmed by extraordinary circumstances quite beyond his control.he has shown ample cause,we hold,to excuse the procedural default into which he was trapped when counsel of record abandoned him without a word of warning.
having found no cause to excuse the failure to file a timely notice of appeal in state court,the district court and the eleventh circuit did not reach the question of prejudice.see supra,at.that issue,therefore,remains open for decision on remand.
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

i join the opinion of the court.unbeknownst to petitioner,he was effectively deprived of legal representation due to the combined effect of no fewer than eight unfortunate events the departure from their law firm of the two young lawyers who appeared as counsel of record in his state postconviction proceeding the acceptance by these two attorneys of new employment that precluded them from continuing to represent him their failure to notify petitioner of their new situation their failure to withdraw as his counsel of record the apparent failure of the firm that they left to monitor the status of petitioner case when these attorneys departed when notice of the decision denying petitioner request for state postconviction relief was received in that firm offices,the failure of the firm mail room to route that important communication to either another member of the firm or to the departed attorneys new addresses the failure of the clerk office to take any action when the envelope containing that notice came back unopened and local counsel very limited conception of the role that he was obligated to play in petitioner representation.under these unique circumstances,i agree that petitioner attorneys effectively abandoned him and that this abandonment was a cause that is sufficient to overcome procedural default.
in an effort to obtain relief for his client,petitioner counsel in the case now before us cast blame for what occurred on alabama system of providing legal representation for capital defendants at trial and in state collateral proceedings.see brief for petitioner.but whatever may be said about alabama system,i do not think that alabama system had much if anything to do with petitioner misfortune.the quality of petitioner representation at trial obviously played no role in the failure to meet the deadline for filing his notice of appeal from the denial of his state postconviction petition.nor do i see any important connection between what happened in this case and alabama system for providing representation for prisoners who are sentenced to death and who wish to petition the state courts for collateral relief.unlike other states,alabama relies on attorneys who volunteer to represent these prisoners pro bono,and we are told that most of these volunteers work for large,firms,at.petitioner brief states that the alabama system had a direct bearing on the events giving rise to the procedural default at issue,at,but a similar combination of untoward events could have occurred if petitioner had been represented by alabama attorneys who were appointed by the court and paid for with state funds.the firm whose lawyers represented petitioner pro bono is one of the country most prestigious and expensive,and i have little doubt that the vast majority of criminal defendants would think that they had won the lottery if they were given the opportunity to be represented by attorneys from such a firm.see,at stating that it seemed as though maples had won the lottery when two attorneys working at an elite new york law firm agreed to represent maples pro bono 
what occurred here was not a predictable consequence of the alabama system but a veritable perfect storm of misfortune,a most unlikely combination of events that,without notice,effectively deprived petitioner of legal.under these unique circumstances,i agree that petitioner procedural default is overcome.
scalia,dissenting 
cory maples,petitioner kim thomas,commissioner,alabama department of corrections 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice scalia,with whom justice thomas joins,dissenting.
the alabama court of criminal appeals held that cory maples appeal from the denial of his state postconviction petition was barred because he had not filed a notice of appeal within the allotted time.the court now concludes that maples has established cause for his procedural default by reason of abandonment by his attorneys.because i can not agree with that conclusion,and because maples alternative argument fares no better,i would affirm the judgment.
our doctrine of procedural default reflects,and furthers,the principle that errors in state criminal trials should be remedied in state court.as we have long recognized,federal habeas review for state prisoners imposes significant costs on the states,undermining not only their practical interest in the finality of their criminal judgments,see engle isaac,but also the primacy of their courts in adjudicating the constitutional rights of defendants prosecuted under state law,at.we have further recognized that t hese costs are particularly high when a state prisoner,through a procedural default,prevents adjudication of his constitutional claims in state court.coleman thompson.in that situation,the prisoner has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address those claims in the first instance,at,thereby leaving the state courts without a chance to mend their own fences and avoid federal intrusion,engle,at.for that reason,and because permitting review of defaulted claims would undercu t the state ability to enforce its procedural rules,we have held that when a state court has relied on an adequate and independent state procedural ground in denying a prisoner claims,the prisoner ordinarily may not obtain federal habeas relief.coleman,at.
to be sure,the prohibition on review of defaulted claims is not absolute.a habeas petitioner in state court will not bar federal habeas review if the petitioner demonstrates cause and actual prejudice,at cause constituting something external to the petitioner,something that can not fairly be attributed to him,that impeded compliance with the state procedural rule,at.as a general matter,an attorney mistakes or omissions do not meet the standard because the attorney is the petitioner agent when acting,or failing to act,in furtherance of the litigation,and the petitioner must bear the risk of attorney error.ibid.quoting murray carrier.see also link wabash,and.
when an attorney error occurs at a stage of the proceedings at which the defendant has a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel,that error may constitute cause to excuse a resulting procedural default.a state failure in its duty to provide an effective attorney,as measured by the standard set forth in strickland washington,makes the attorney error chargeable to the state,and hence external to the defense.see murray,supra,at.but when the client has no right to counsel as is the case in the postconviction setting,see pennsylvania finley,the client bears the risk of all attorney errors made in the course of the representation,regardless of the egregiousness of the mistake.coleman,supra,at i t is not the gravity of the attorney error that matters,but that it constitutes a violation of petitioner right to counsel,so that the error must be seen as an external factor 
in light of the principles just set out,the court is correct to conclude,ante,at,that a habeas petitioner procedural default may be excused when it is attributable to abandonment by his attorney.in such a case,coleman rationale for attributing the attorney acts and omissions to the client breaks down for once the attorney has ceased acting as the client agent,principles of agency law,at,no longer support charging the client with his lawyer mistakes.the attorney mistakes may therefore be understood as an external factor,and in appropriate circumstances may excusing the prisoner procedural default.
i likewise agree with the court conclusion,ante,at,that maples two attorneys of record,jaasi munanka and clara,had abandoned maples by the time the alabama trial court entered its order denying his petition for postconviction relief.as the court observes,ante,at,without informing maples or seeking leave from the alabama trial court to withdraw from maples case,both munanka and left sullivan cromwell employ and accepted new positions that precluded them from continuing to represent maples.this conduct amounted to renunciation of their roles as maples agents,see restatement second of agency,comment b hereinafter restatement,and thus terminated their authority to act on maples behalf.as a result,munanka and failure to take action in response to the trial court order should not be imputed to maples.
it is an unjustified leap,however,to conclude that maples was left unrepresented during the relevant window between the alabama trial court dismissal of his postconviction petition and expiration of the period for filing a notice of appeal established by alabama rule of appellate procedure a.start with maples own allegations in his amended federal habeas petition,maples alleged that,at the time he sought postconviction relief in alabama trial court,he was represented by sullivan cromwell of new york,new york.app.although the petition went on to identify munanka and as the two sullivan lawyers handling the matter,at,its statement that maples was represented by the firm itself strongly suggests that maples viewed himself as having retained the services of the firm as a whole,a perfectly natural understanding.when a client retains a lawyer who practices with a firm,the presumption is that both the lawyer and the firm have been retained.restatement third of the law governing lawyers,comment f.admittedly,in connection with the attempt before the alabama trial court to extend the time for appeal,sullivan cromwell partner marc de leeuw submitted an affidavit stating that the firm lawyers handle pro bono cases on an individual basis and that the lawyers who had appeared in maples case had followed that practice,attempt ing not to use the firm name on correspondence or court papers.app.to pet.for cert.but maples habeas petition is the pleading that initiated the current litigation and surely the allegations that it contained should be given priority over representations made to prior courts.
in any case,even if maples had no relationship with the sullivan cromwell firm,munanka and were surely not the only sullivan cromwell lawyers who represented maples on an individual basis.de leeuw affidavit acknowledged that he had been involved in maples case since the summer of,roughly a year before munanka and left sullivan cromwell,and it further stated that after and munanka learned of the court initial order denying the state motion to dismiss maples postconviction petition in december,the lawyers working on this case for maples prepared for the evidentiary hearing maples had requested,at.moreover,when sullivan cromwell attorney felice duffy filed a motion to appear pro hac vice before the alabama trial court in connection with the attempt to extend the deadline,she stated that she had worked on maples case since october,app,months before the procedural default took place.
according to the court,see ante,at,de leeuw affidavit does not make clear how he was involved in maples case or whether lawyers other than munanka and were among those who prepared for the anticipated evidentiary hearing and duffy motion does not make clear what her wor k entailed.but there is little doubt that munanka and were not the only attorneys who engaged in the preparations and that de leeuw was involved and duffy worked as lawyers for maples what other role could they have taken on.de leeuw distinction between and munanka and the lawyers working on his case for maples would have been senseless if the latter category did not extend beyond the two named attorneys.
in sum,there is every indication that when the trial court entered its order dismissing maples postconviction petition in may,maples continued to be represented by a team of attorneys in sullivan cromwell new york office.the court nonetheless insists that the actions of these attorneys are irrelevant because they had not been admitted to practice law in alabama,had not entered appearances in the alabama trial court,and had not sought to substitute for munanka and.see ante,at.the court does not,however,explain why these facts establish that the attorneys were not maples agents for the purpose of attending to those aspects of the case that did not require court appearance which would certainly include keeping track of orders issued and filing deadlines.the court quotation from the restatement of agency,ante,at,that the failure to acquire a qualification by the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized act terminates the agent authority to act,restatement,at,omits the crucial condition contained at the end of the section if thereafter he the agent should infer that the principal,if he knew the facts,would not consent to the further exercise of the authority.there was no basis whatever for these attorneys to infer that maples no longer wanted them to represent him,simply because they had not yet qualified before the alabama court.though it would have been illegal for these attorneys to file a notice of appeal without being authorized to practice in alabama,nothing prevented them from first seeking to secure admission to practice,as munanka and initially had done,and then filing a notice of appeal.
it would create a huge gap in our coleman jurisprudence to disregard all attorney errors committed before admission to the relevant court and an even greater gap to disregard as the court suggests all errors committed before the attorney enters an appearance.moreover,even if these attorneys can not be regarded as maples agents for purposes of conducting the alabama litigation,they were at least his agents for purposes of advising him of the impending deadline.his unawareness was the fault of counsel who were his agents,and must be charged to him.what happened here is simply a ttorney ignorance or inadvertence of the sort that does not furnish cause to excuse a procedural default.coleman,at.
but even leaving aside the question of maples unadmitted attorneys at sullivan cromwell,maples had a fully admitted attorney,who had entered an appearance,in the person of local counsel,john butler.there is no support for the court conclusion that butler did not even begin to represent maples.ante,at.true,the affidavit butler filed with the alabama trial court in the proceeding seeking extension of the deadline stated that he had no substantive involvement with the case,and that he had agreed to serve as local counsel only.app.to pet.for cert.but a disclaimer of substantive involvement in a case,whether or not it violates a lawyer ethical obligations,see ante,at,is not equivalent to a denial of any agency role at all.a local attorney nonsubstantive involvement would surely include,at a minimum,keeping track of local court orders and advising substantive counsel of impending deadlines.nor did butler explanation for his failure to act when he received a copy of the trial court order sound in abandonment.butler did not say,for instance,that he ignored the order because he did not consider maples to be his client.instead,based on past practice and the content of the order,butler assumed that maples lawyers at sullivan cromwell would receive a copy.app.to pet.for cert.
the court gets this badly wrong when it states that butler failure even to place a phone call to the new york firm demonstrates butler disclaimer of any genuinely representative role.ante,at.by equating the very attorney error that contributed to maples procedural default with the absence of an agency relationship,the court ensures that today opinion will serve as a template for future habeas petitioners seeking to evade coleman holding that ineffectiveness of postconviction counsel will not furnish cause to excuse a procedural default.see,at.the trick will be to allege,not that counsel was ineffective,but rather that counsel ineffectiveness demonstrates that he was not a genuinely representative agent.no precedent should be so easily circumvented by word games,but the damage is particularly acute when the affected precedent is so firmly grounded in concerns of comity and federalism.at.
the court attempt to justify its conclusion that butler was not maples agent is to point out that a prosecutor sent a letter to maples directly,informing him of the defaulted appeal.see ante,at.the court reasons that the prosecutor must have thought that maples had been abandoned by his lawyers,since to communicate with a represented party would have been a violation of ethical standards.ibid.but even if this supposition is correct,it is hard to understand what it proves.what matters,after all,is not whether the prosecutor thought maples had been abandoned,but whether maples really was abandoned.and as it turns out,butler conduct after learning about the default further belies any such contention.almost immediately,butler began to cooperate with maples lawyers at sullivan cromwell,filing papers as counsel for maples or local counsel for petitioner cory maples in multiple courts in an attempt to rectify the mistake.see app.had butler reassumed his representational duties after having abandoned them hardly.there is no proper basis for a conclusion of abandonment interruptus.
maples argues in the alternative that his default should be excused because his right to due process was violated when the clerk failed to take action after munanka and copies of the court dismissal order were returned undeliverable.according to maples,our decision in jones flowers,establishes that the clerk had a duty to do more.
we held in jones that,when a mailed no
