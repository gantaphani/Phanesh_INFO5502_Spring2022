petitioner alfred fusi fusi appeals from the united states district court for the district of massachusetts denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus and request for an evidentiary hearing.see fusi,d.in his habeas petition,fusi alleged that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to prepare for trial.because fusi failed to exhaust his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in state court,the district court should have dismissed his petition without prejudice.
the district court cogently and aptly described the circumstances surrounding fusi conviction and the performance of his initial trial counsel,richard chambers,as follows 
fusi prosecution arose out of an incident that occurred on the evening of september.the alleged rape victim in the case described how she had gone out to two bars and consumed five drinks during the evening.at about,the victim had an argument with her boyfriend and decided to take a walk.while walking,she passed a man to years old who said hi as she passed him.when she said hi in response,he hit her in the jaw,knocking her temporarily unconscious.she regained consciousness in a backyard where her assailant was kneeling on top of her,illuminated from some light source.she screamed but the man told her he would kill her if she did not stop screaming and stuffed a bandana into her mouth.he proceeded to rape her and then immediately left the area.
the victim walked out to a road where after a short time,she saw a friend driving by.the friend stopped and took her to the police station.although the victim reported the assault,she did not make a written statement about the rape at that time because she felt out of it and wanted to go to the hospital to obtain treatment for her jaw.
the following day,the victim leafed through a local high school yearbook to try to give her friends an idea of what her assailant looked like.she did not notice that fusi photograph appeared in the yearbook four times.six days later,the victim returned to the police station where the police arrayed seven photographs of men matching her description of the assailant.in less than one minute,she picked out fusi as the man that raped me.sic she also positively identified him after looking at the photographs a second time.at that time the victim provided the police with a written statement describing the rape.approximately one month later,the victim returned to the police station again and picked fusi out from a in less than one minute.the victim also positively identified fusi as her rapist at his trial.
the strategy chambers chose to adopt at fusi trial was one of and alibi.to that end,he the commonwealth witnesses,including the victim at length,focusing on the victim lack of opportunity to see her assailant and on discrepancies in her description of him as compared with his actual appearance,such as her failure to describe a fusi bears on his cheek,her description of him as and whereas he was very and her statement that the assailant weighed considerably less than fusi actually weighed.
chambers called several witnesses to testify about fusi appearance.he also called fusi girlfriend of six years and a friend of fusi to testify that on the evening in question they were hanging out at fusi home.fusi girlfriend testified that fusi drove her home about fusi mother testified that she was still awake when fusi returned home about half an hour later.she also testified that she went to bed around and did not hear anyone leave the house for the rest of the night.at the conclusion of the trial,the judge,addressing chambers,stated,i appreciate you worked hard.sic chambers did not,however,become aware of or the victim with respect to her,written statement describing the rape even though that statement was available for use at trial and was inconsistent with the victim testimony in several ways.
at the conclusion of the initial trial,an essex county jury found fusi guilty of rape and his conviction was subsequently affirmed by the state appellate courts.fusi then filed his first motion for relief on april.fusi motion alleged that the jury improperly considered his failure to testify at trial as evidence of guilt.chambers represented fusi during this first motion.the motion was denied after a hearing.
fusi,with the assistance of new counsel,then filed a second motion for relief on december.fusi new counsel argued that fusi was entitled to a new trial on several grounds,including ineffective assistance of counsel.specifically,fusi alleged that chambers provided ineffective assistance of counsel by,inter alia,failing to interview and call prospective witnesses.an evidentiary hearing was held and the motion was denied.fusi appealed,but narrowed his allegations of error and no longer argued that chambers provided ineffective assistance of counsel.the massachusetts appeals court subsequently affirmed the trial court denial.see commonwealth fusi,table.fusi appealed to the supreme judicial court sjc,which denied leave to purse further appellate review.see commonwealth fusi,table.
fusi then filed a third motion for relief on june.the third motion argued that the grand jury process had been impaired and that chambers failure to object to the grand jury process constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.following a hearing,the trial court denied the motion.fusi appealed and his appeal was denied by the massachusetts appeals court and the sjc.see commonwealth fusi,table commonwealth fusi,table.
fusi fourth motion for relief was filed on november.in the fourth motion,fusi again alleged that chambers provided ineffective assistance of counsel,this time due to his failure to object to alleged sentencing errors.after a hearing,the trial court denied fusi request for a new trial,but ordered a new sentencing hearing due to chambers failure to adequately represent fusi during sentencing.following the new sentencing hearing,the trial court reimposed the original sentence.fusi appealed,but the appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute.
on march,fusi filed his fifth motion for relief asserting several grounds,including ineffective assistance of counsel.with his motion,fusi provided the trial court with an affidavit from chambers in which chambers admitted that he received fusi case two days prior to trial and he visited the crime scene,but never spoke with leonard and cathleen bartolo,whose backyard was the crime scene and who fusi stated would contradict some of the victim testimony concerning the light in the bartolos backyard and whether she screamed on the night of the rape.relying on chambers affidavit and affidavits from his mother and sister,fusi argued that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel because chambers did not adequately prepare for trial.
the trial court denied fusi motion.fusi appealed to the massachusetts appeals court,which found no manifest injustice and affirmed the trial court ruling.fusi commonwealth,table.the sjc subsequently denied fusi application for leave to obtain further appellate review alofar.commonwealth fusi,table.
fusi continued his quest for a constitutional remedy by filing a habeas petition in federal district court.to support his habeas petition,fusi requested an evidentiary hearing.in the motion for an evidentiary hearing,fusi argued that because chambers completely failed to prepare for trial a presumption of prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel was warranted.
