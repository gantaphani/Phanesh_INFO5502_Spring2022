rafael fontanez challenges evidentiary rulings made in the course of the revocation of his supervised release and the ensuing revocation sentence.after careful consideration,we reject his asseverational array and affirm the judgment below.
background 
we start with an overview of the relevant facts and the travel of the case.on october,the appellant was charged with one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base crack cocaine and three counts of distribution of that controlled substance.see a.the indictment alleged the applicability of b a iii,which provides for a sentence up to life imprisonment 
the appellant maintained his innocence and went to trial.the jury found him guilty on all counts.the appellant had stipulated to the quantity of drugs for which he should be held accountable a series of transactions involving specified amounts,totaling more than one kilogram and the jury was not asked to make and did not make a separate determination.
at the disposition hearing,the sentencing court noted that the jury had to have found the appellant guilty of more than grams.this drug quantity exposed the appellant to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment instead of the default maximum penalty of twenty years in prison.compare b a iii with id.b c.the court proceeded to sentence the appellant to an term of immurement,to be followed by a term of supervised release 
the appellant served his incarcerative term and,on june,began serving his supervised release term.on november,a man was stabbed at a bar in springfield,massachusetts.an anonymous telephone call named the appellant as the perpetrator.three days later,a springfield police officer,eric podgurski,interviewed the victim in the hospital.he showed the victim an photo array,which included a picture of the appellant.the victim identified the appellant as the malefactor and wrote on his picture i am percent this is the guy that stabbed me.
in due course,the appellant was charged in a massachusetts state court with attempted murder and assault with a dangerous weapon.he was later brought before the federal district court in a revocation proceeding aimed at determining whether he had violated the conditions of his supervised release which included a condition forbidding him from committing another federal,state,or local crime during the currency of his supervised release.
the revocation hearing was continued at the appellant request.when the rescheduled date arrived,the government explained that the victim was out of state due to a vacation.in lieu of the victim testimony,it sought to introduce,through podgurski,hearsay evidence anent both the photo array identification and the anonymous telephone call.the district court allowed this evidence over the appellant objection.the government also introduced other evidence,including the bar video surveillance footage capturing the commission of the crime.
the district court found,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the appellant had committed the stabbing and,thus,had violated the conditions of his supervised release.the court based this determination primarily on the surveillance video,the victim identification of the appellant in the photo array,and evidence of the victim wounds.the court then determined that the offense undergirding the appellant supervised release term was an offense that fell within the purview of b a iii and,accordingly,was a class a felony.see a.having made this determination,the court sentenced the appellant to a incarcerative term for violating the conditions of his supervised release.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the appellant challenges both the finding that he violated the conditions of his supervised release and the sentence imposed.we discuss these challenges sequentially.
a.the supervised release violation.
the appellant merits challenge is premised on his view that the court improperly allowed the admission of hearsay evidence.he submits that the district court should not have permitted podgurski to testify either to the victim identification of the appellant in the photo array or to the anonymous telephone call.inasmuch as these objections were preserved below,we review the court decision to admit the challenged evidence for abuse of discretion.see united states rondeau,cir.
in revocation proceedings,a releasee does not have a sixth amendment right to confront adverse witnesses.see id.he has only a more circumscribed right,delineated in the federal rules of criminal procedure.hearsay evidence is allowable but,under rule b c,a releasee is entitled to question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.in making such a determination,the court must balance the releasee right to confront the witnesses against him with what good cause may exist for denying confrontation in a particular instance.see rondeau,at.in practice,this need for balancing requires the court to weigh both the apparent reliability of the hearsay evidence and the government proffered reason for not producing the declarant.see id.
here,the district court concluded that the interests of justice did not require the victim live testimony.in assailing this conclusion,the appellant trains his fire principally on the district court decision to admit podgurski testimony regarding the photo array.he argues that,as a practical matter,the court failed to carry out the balancing test at all because it admitted the testimony despite finding that the government reason for not producing the victim was very weak.he further argues that the district court crediting of that very weak reason and its admission of the hearsay evidence was an abuse of discretion.we do not agree.
to begin,podgurski photo array testimony was characterized by several indicia of reliability.as an initial matter,the government introduced a surveillance video of the stabbing,which corroborated the victim account of the incident as related to podgurski.so,too,it confirmed the victim identification of the appellant.objective evidence that corroborates a witness testimony may provide persuasive proof of that testimony reliability.see id.
here,moreover,the officer interaction with the victim bolstered the testimony reliability.united states taveras,cir.finding hearsay testimony unreliable where probation officer had only spoken to victim briefly.podgurski met with the victim in the hospital and interviewed him at length.the victim was cooperative,and his account of the stabbing was both internally consistent and consistent with the video.the consistency of a declarant account of events may lend support to a finding of reliability.see united states marino,cir.rondeau,at.and according to the district court which had the advantage of observing podgurski demeanor at first hand,podgurski testified in a way that indicated that he was getting reliable information from the victim.
relatedly,the victim identified the appellant confidently.he expressed no doubt,and memorialized the identification in writing on the photograph that he selected a photograph that was,in fact,a photograph of the appellant.the victim confidence in his account was a factor to which the court could give weight in gauging the reliability of that account.see united states decologero,cir.
last but far from least the manner in which podgurski handled the photo array bolstered the finding of reliability.the array was presented to the victim while the central events were fresh in his mind his identification was made a scant three days after the stabbing.furthermore,podgurski took care in composing and presenting the photo array before showing it to the victim,he read aloud a comprehensive explanation of the photo array process.among other things,this explanation warned the victim that the perpetrator might or might not be included in the array.importantly,the photographs used in the array were of men whose looks were generally similar to the appellant.and,all of the photographs had the same background thus mitigating the risk of drawing attention to a particular photograph.
the short of it is that the photo array testimony bore t
