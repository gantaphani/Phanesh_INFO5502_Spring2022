it is common ground that a police officer seeking to obtain a search warrant should include in the affidavit accompanying the warrant application any facts known to her that are material to the existence vel non of probable cause.see united states stewart,cir,as amended.under some limited circumstances,however,the officer duty may be broader she may be obliged to inquire further in order to dispel serious doubts about either the credibility of an informant upon whom she relies or the veracity of the allegations underlying the attempted showing of probable cause.this duty of further inquiry is not well understood,and the court below ruled categorically that no such duty ever exists.because this statement of the law is insufficiently nuanced,we remand for further factfinding consistent with this opinion.
background 
we briefly rehearse the facts as supportably found by the district court,along with the travel of the case.the reader who hungers for more exegetic detail may wish to consult the district court comprehensive account.see united states tanguay,d.
in february of,the conway police department received an,ostensibly from jim garrold,relating that he had seen child pornography on the laptop computer of john tanguway.the described tanguway as an emergency medical technician with a local ambulance service and indicated that the child pornography had been observed during a sexual encounter a few days earlier.this served to draw the attention of the police to jonathan tanguay,a selectman in the nearby town of bartlett.
a new hampshire state trooper,carrie nolet,took charge of the ensuing investigation.after searching without success for a jim garrold,nolet called the telephone number provided in the.a voicemail message identified the owner of the telephone as josh wiggin.nolet then asked alan broyer,a conway police officer,whether he knew anyone by that name.broyer responded that wiggin was known as a police groupie who was quirky,troubled in his teen years,and had a history of suicidal ideation.broyer also commented that wiggin had experienced a few scrapes with the law,specifically mentioning that wiggin had been convicted of uttering a false prescription he had altered the number of vicodin pills on a legitimate prescription from to before presenting the prescription to a pharmacist.nolet did not ask broyer for more details nor did she make any effort to find out what other scrapes wiggin may have had.
nolet proceeded to contact wiggin a year old conway resident.he admitted having sent the accusatory and agreed to an interview.during this interview,wiggin disclosed that he and the appellant had maintained a casual sexual relationship,off and on,since wiggin teenage years.he added that,on a recent evening,he had gone to the appellant home for that purpose.when he walked in,the appellant was watching a pornographic video on his laptop.wiggin described the subjects of this video as boys of maybe eight,thirteen,fifteen,sixteen.he also reported seeing thumbnail previews of a bunch of pictures and three or four videos depicting children engaging in sex acts with adults.
about a week after the interview,nolet applied for and obtained a warrant to search the appellant home,vehicle,and workplace for computer systems.in the affidavit supporting the warrant application,nolet communicated the substance of wiggin interview,emphasizing that wiggin had come forward despite the potential embarrassment of having his sexual interest in men revealed to his parents and girlfriend.the affidavit did not contain any of the information that nolet had learned from broyer regarding wiggin history and reputation.nor did she incorporate the typewritten notes that wiggin had prepared and brought to the interview.see supra note.
a state judge issued the warrant.during the search,the police seized a computer,hard drive,and compact disc that were found to contain a profusion of sexually explicit images and videos depicting minors.
a federal indictment followed charging the appellant with a single count of possession of child pornography.see a b.the appellant moved for an evidentiary hearing,see franks delaware,and to suppress the evidence seized during the search.he asserted that nolet had either deliberately or recklessly omitted material information from her affidavit.
the district court convened what amounted to a franks hearing at which nolet testified.the court reserved decision and subsequently filed a written rescript denying the motion to suppress.the court concluded that nolet had recklessly if not intentionally omitted from her affidavit three clusters of relevant information known to her at the time she sought the warrant wiggin prior conviction for falsifying a prescription,a crime of dishonesty wiggin reputation among local police as troubled,suicidal,quirky,and a police groupie,which the district court said suggested a history of mental instability and a willingness to compromise oneself to impress the police and the fact that wiggin interview statement that the appellant was viewing a pornographic video depicting children as young as eight years of age when wiggin arrived arguably conflicted with wiggin typed notes describing the subjects of that video as young men or teens.tanguay,d at.but these three clusters of omitted information,the court held,did not require suppression there would have been probable cause to authorize the search even if the affidavit had included the omitted facts.see id.at.
the appellant had a fallback position he argued that nolet affidavit was deficient because she had neglected to make any inquiry into the concerns voiced to her by broyer.had such an inquiry been mounted,nolet conceivably would have discovered that one of wiggin prior scrapes was a juvenile conviction for making a false report to the conway police.that conviction stemmed from wiggin claim that he had been shot in the leg by an unidentified sniper when,in fact,he had shot himself to see what it felt like.because such a conviction was for a crime of dishonesty,the appellant asserted,disclosing it would have cast grave doubt on wiggin credibility and,thus,undermined any showing of probable cause.
the district court rejected this plaint as well.in doing so,the court relied on the fact that nolet did not know of the false report conviction at the time she executed the affidavit.see id.at.since nolet had no duty as a matter of law to inquire further,the court reasoned,the false report conviction formed no part of the franks calculus.see id.at.
in due course,a jury convicted the appellant.the district court sentenced him to an month term of immurement.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the appellant challenges the district court denial of his motion to suppress on two grounds.first,he says that when nolet affidavit is reformed to include the material that the district court found intentionally or recklessly omitted,the reformed affidavit no longer supports a finding of probable cause.second,he contests the district court categorical ruling that the franks doctrine is never implicated by the omission from a warrant affidavit of facts unknown to the affiant at the time of the application.
the starting point for the consideration of both of these claims of error is the same.in franks,the supreme court established that,under the fourth and fourteenth amendments,a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to test the veracity of a warrant affidavit if he can make a substantial showing that the affiant intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth included a false statement in the affidavit,which statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause.see at.suppression of the evidence seized is justified if,at such a hearing,the defendant proves intentional or reckless falsehood by preponderant evidence and the affidavit creditworthy averments are insufficient to establish probable cause.see id.at.
material omissions from a warrant affidavit also may furnish the basis for a successful franks challenge.see united states hadfield,cir.the required showing is first,the omission must have been either intentional or reckless and second,the omitted information,if incorporated into the affidavit,must be sufficient to vitiate probable cause.see united states castillo,cir see also united states tate,cir a literally true affidavit can be intentionally misleading if it deliberately omitted material facts which,when included,would defeat the probable cause showing and thus render false the original literally true affidavit.because there is no requirement that every shred of known information be included in a warrant affidavit,the omission of a particular detail,without more,is not enough to satisfy the mens rea element of the franks test.see united states colkley,cir.rather,an omission triggers the exclusionary rule only if it is designed to mislead,or made in reckless disregard of whether it would mislead,the magistrate in his appraisal of the affidavit.id.at emphasis omitted.
recklessness may be inferred directly from the fact of omission only if the omitted information was critical to the probable cause determination.burke town of walpole,cir emphasis supplied internal quotation mark omitted.negligent omissions even negligent omissions of highly probative information do not satisfy this strict standard.see franks,at see also united states melvin,cir affirming finding that omission of key witness recantation was merely negligent,not reckless,because of affiant belief that recantation was incredible.
a.the reformed affidavit.
against this backdrop,we turn to the appellant initial claim of error.neither party contests the soundness of the district court plainly supportable finding that nolet recklessly omitted from her affidavit the three clusters of information limned above.the appellant nonetheless argues that the court misjudged the weight of those omitted facts.as he sees it,a reformed affidavit that includes those facts falls short of establishing probable cause.
we begin with the fourth amendment command that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched.const.amend.iv.as a general matter,a district court should pay great respect to the issuing magistrate determination of probable cause.see illinois gates.where relevant information has been withheld from the magistrate,however,the district court must probe the existence of probable cause anew.see united states gifford,cir citing burke,at.our review of the district court own probable cause determination is de novo.see ornelas united states,gifford,at.findings of fact,though,are reviewed only for clear error.see ornelas,at.
in giving effect to the fourth amendment commands,the principal task is to make a practical,decision whether,given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before us,including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information,there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.gates,at internal quotation marks omitted see united states schaefer,cir probable cause exists when the affidavit upon which a warrant is founded demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an offense has been committed and that there is sound reason to believe that a particular search will turn up evidence of it.quoting united states aguirre,cir.performance of this task must take account of the totality of the circumstances.see gates,at.within this rubric,the statements of a eyewitness to a crime are generally considered reliable without further corroboration.see united states blount,cir see also united states campbell,cir.
our review of the entire affidavit,supplemented only by the three recklessly omitted clusters of information,supports the conclusion that probable cause existed to search the appellant home.the most trenchant of the omitted facts wiggin conviction for uttering a false prescription is surely relevant to the decisional calculus.but the commission of a past crime does not necessarily undercut a person veracity.see united states rumney,cir.even a prior conviction for a crime of dishonesty is not always dispositive of a witness reliability.see,united states meling,cir.here,we do not think that the court erred in ascribing such limited significance to the altered prescription conviction.after all,it is not unreasonable to think that a willingness to lie to feed a drug addiction is materially different than a willingness to level false accusations against a third party.
to be sure,the second cluster of omitted information,including wiggin history of mental instability and his reputation as a police groupie,calls for some degree of increased skepticism.but a factfinder might reasonably think that these black marks against wiggin credibility,like his altered prescription conviction,are diminished in importance in light of countervailing indicia of truthfulness.see united states reeves,cir.an informant trustworthiness may be enhanced in a number of ways,including his willingness to reveal his identity,the level of detail in his account,the basis of his knowledge,and the extent to which his statements are against his interest.see wayne lafave,search seizure c e ed.supp.a number of such factors bolster the district court determination that the essence of wiggin account was worthy of credence.wiggin was willing to be identified despite his embarrassment about the potential revelation of his sexual orientation to his loved ones he candidly admitted that there might be compromising pictures of him in the appellant possession and,thus,likely to surface in the search and the record contains no credible suggestion of any ulterior motive for reporting the crime.all of these are positive factors in assessing wiggin veracity.
the third cluster of omitted information lacks any decretory significance.the modest discrepancy between wiggin interview statements and his notes does not defeat probable cause.the notes indicated that the appellant was watching young man or teen pornography when wiggin arrived,whereas he stated in the interview that the subjects of the videos ranged from maybe eight to sixteen years of age.but wiggin also gave a physical description of the subjects,stating that there was really much of any signs i guess,body hair,or facial hair and you can tell when you look at ah,a n eighteen year old versus you know,a fourteen year old.taken together,these statements create a fair probability that one or more of the actors was a minor.no more is exigible.see gates,at.
we hasten to add that wiggin rough guess as to the ages of the minors in the initial video was not the only basis for the conclusion that the appellant possessed child pornography.wiggin reported seeing a number of other pictures and videos containing sexual depictions of prepubescent children.and the inference that the appellant possessed child pornography was bolstered by plausible indications that the appellant harbored a sexual interest in young boys.the affidavit related that wiggin first met the appellant when the appellant a counselor at a summer camp ogled wiggin and other young campers as they showered that the appellant initiated a sexual relationship with wiggin when wiggin was still a student at the high school where the appellant worked that the appellant became aroused when talking about a rendezvous with a teen boy who had lied about his age and that the appellant had made sexual allusions to the son of wiggin girlfriend.
we recognize that the question is close.but assuming no duty to investigate further an issue to which we shortly shall return,we uphold the district court conclusion that the affidavit,reformed only to include the recklessly omitted facts,remains sufficient to establish probable cause there was no error.
b.the duty of further inquiry.
the appellant second claim of error raises a question of law,which engenders de novo review.see united states garcia hernandez,cir.this claim is premised on nolet omission of information not actually known to her at the time that she prepared the warrant application,but potentially available had she inquired further.the appellant argues that nolet was given ample reason to doubt wiggin veracity and that her failure to und
