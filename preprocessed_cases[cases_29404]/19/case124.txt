when petitioner setser was indicted in a texas court on drug charges,the state also moved to revoke the probation term that he was then serving for another drug offense.at about the same time,setser pleaded guilty to federal drug charges.the federal district court imposed a sentence to run consecutively to any state sentence imposed for the probation violation,but concurrently with any state sentence imposed on the new drug charge.while setser federal appeal was pending,the state court sentenced him to years for the probation violation and years for the drug charge,but ordered the sentences to be served concurrently.the fifth circuit affirmed the federal sentence,holding that the district court had authority to order a sentence consecutive to an anticipated state sentence,and that setser sentence was reasonable,even if the state court decision made it unclear exactly how to administer it.
the district court had discretion to order that setser federal sentence run consecutively to his anticipated state sentence for the probation violation.
a judges have traditionally had broad discretion in selecting whether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecutively with respect to other sentences that they impose,or that have been imposed in other proceedings,including state proceedings,see oregon ice.the statutory text and structure do not foreclose a district court exercise of this discretion with respect to anticipated state sentences.the sentencing reform act of addresses the.consecutive decision,but not the situation here,since the district court did not impose multiple terms of imprisonment at the same time,and setser was not already subject to the state sentences at issue,a.this does not mean,as setser and the government claim,that the district court lacked authority to act as it did and that the bureau of prisons is to make the.consecutive decision after the federal sentence has been imposed.section b,from which the bureau claims to derive this authority,says nothing about concurrent or consecutive sentences.and it is more natural to read a as leaving room for the exercise of judicial discretion in situations not covered than it is to read b as giving the bureau what amounts to sentencing authority.setser arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.
b none of the other objections raised by setser and the government requires a different result.
the state court subsequent decision to make the state sentences run concurrently does not establish that the federal district court imposed an unreasonable sentence.the difficulty here arises not from the sentence which is to run concurrently with one state sentence and consecutively with another but from the state court decision.deciding which of the district court dispositions should prevail under these circumstances is a problem,but it does not show the district court sentence to be unlawful.the reasonableness standard for reviewing federal sentences asks whether the district court abused its discretion,see gall united states,but setser identifies no flaw in the district court decisionmaking process,nor anything available at the time of sentencing that the court failed to consider.where facts make it difficult,or even impossible,to implement the sentence,the bureau of prisons may determine,in the first instance,how long the district court sentence authorizes it to continue setser confinement,subject to the potential for judicial review.

monroe ace setser,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether a district court,in sentencing a defendant for a federal offense,has authority to order that the federal sentence be consecutive to an anticipated state sentence that has not yet been imposed.
when officers of the lubbock police department arrested petitioner monroe setser for possessing methamphetamine,he was already serving a term of probation imposed by a texas court for another drug offense.setser was indicted in state court for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance,and the state also moved to revoke his term of probation.as often happens in drug cases,the federal authorities also got involved.a federal grand jury indicted setser for possessing with intent to distribute grams or more of methamphetamine,a,b a viii,and he pleaded guilty.
before the federal sentencing hearing,a probation officer calculated the applicable guidelines range to be to months imprisonment.citing precedent from the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit,united states brown,per curiam,he indicated that the district court had discretion to make setser sentence either concurrent with or consecutive to any sentence anticipated in the separate proceedings.setser objected,arguing that the district court lacked such authority.the court nevertheless made the sentence of months that it imposed consecutive to any state sentence imposed for probation violation,but concurrent with any state sentence imposed on the new drug charge.setser appealed.
while setser appeal was pending,the state court sentenced him to a prison term of years for probation violation and years on the new drug charge.it ordered that these sentences be served concurrently.setser then made before the court of appeals,in addition to the argument that the district court had no authority to order a consecutive sentence,the argument that his federal sentence was unreasonable because it was impossible to implement in light of the concurrent state sentences.
the court of appeals for the fifth circuit affirmed.following its earlier brown decision,the court held that the district court did have authority to order a consecutive sentence,at.it also held that setser sentence was reasonable,even if it was partially foiled by the state court decision,at.we granted certiorari,and appointed an amicus curiae to brief and argue this case in support of the judgment below.
before proceeding further,it is important to be clear about what is at issue.setser does not contend that his federal sentence must run concurrently with both state sentences imposed after his federal sentencing hearing.he acknowledges that someone must answer the consecutive versus concurrent question,brief for petitioner,and decide how the state and federal sentences will fit together.the issue here is who will make that decision,which in turn determines when that decision is made.one possible answer,and the one the fifth circuit gave,is that the decision belongs to the federal district court at the federal sentencing hearing.
the.consecutive decision has been addressed by a of the sentencing reform act of,reproduced in full as appendix a,infra.the first subsection of that provision,which says when concurrent and consecutive sentences may be imposed,and specifies which of those dispositions will be assumed in absence of indication by the sentencing judge,does not cover the situation here.it addresses only multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the same time and a term of imprisonment imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.a.here the state sentence is not imposed at the same time as the federal sentence,and the defendant was not already subject to that state sentence.
setser,supported by the government,argues that,because a does not cover this situation,the district court lacked authority to act as it did and that the.consecutive decision is therefore to be made by the bureau of prisons at any time after the federal sentence has been imposed.the bureau of prisons is said to derive this authority from b ed.and supp.iv,reproduced in full as appendix b,infra.
on its face,this provision says nothing about concurrent or consecutive sentences,but the government explains its position as follows section b gives the bureau the authority to order that a prisoner serve his federal sentence in any suitable prison facility whether maintained by the federal government or otherwise.the bureau may therefore order that a prisoner serve his federal sentence in a state prison.thus,when a person subject to a federal sentence is serving a state sentence,the bureau may designate the state prison as the place of imprisonment for the federal sentence effectively making the two sentences concurrent or decline to do so effectively making them consecutive based on a and b,setser and the government argue that the.consecutive decision,under the circumstances presented here,is committed exclusively to the bureau of prisons.
it is fundamental that we construe statutes governing the jurisdiction of the federal courts in light of the background against which the statutes were enacted,new orleans public service,council of city of new orleans,and the same approach is appropriate here,where the issue concerns a matter of discretion traditionally committed to the judiciary.judges have long been understood to have discretion to select whether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecutively with respect to other sentences that they impose,or that have been imposed in other proceedings,including state proceedings.see oregon ice.and a large majority of the federal appellate courts addressing the question have recognized a similar authority in the context here,where a federal judge anticipates a state sentence that has not yet been imposed.see salley united states,anderson united states,per curiam united states ex rel.lester parker,per curiam united states kanton,per curiam but see united states eastman.we find nothing in the sentencing reform act,or in any other provision of law,to show that congress foreclosed the exercise of district courts sentencing discretion in these circumstances.
setser main contention is that a has this effect.but that provision can not sustain the weight that setser asks it to bear.in essence,he reads the first sentence in a to say that terms of imprisonment may run concurrently or consecutively only i f multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed at the same time,or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.since the district court was not imposing the state sentence and since it was not already imposed,the sentence could not be ordered to run consecutively.but if the text is exclusive if the addition of only is correct the provision forbids not only the imposition of consecutive sentences,but the imposition of concurrent ones as well.and yet,as setser acknowledges,it must be one or the other someone must decide the issue.
setser response is that,read in context,the sentence speaks only to district courts.under the circumstances at issue here,he says,the federal and state sentences still might run either concurrently or consecutively,but just not at the discretion of the district court.that is an odd parsing of the text,which makes no distinction between the district court and the bureau of prisons.the placement of does indeed suggest that it is directed at district courts but that is likely because congress contemplated that only district courts would have the authority to make the.consecutive decision,not because congress meant to leave the bureau unfettered.indeed,the bureau already follows the other directives in a.see brief for united states.for example,if the district court imposes multiple terms of imprisonment at the same time,but fails to address the.consecutive issue,the terms run concurrently,a,and the bureau is not free to use its place of imprisonment authority to achieve a different result 
the latin maxim on which setser relies expressio unius est exclusio alterius might have application here if the provision in question were a conferral of authority on district courts.giving sentencing authority in only specified circumstances could be said to imply that it is withheld in other circumstances.section,however,is framed not as a conferral of authority but as a limitation of authority that already exists and a specification of what will be assumed when the exercise of that authority is ambiguous.it reads not district courts shall have authority to impose multiple terms of imprisonment on a defendant at the same time.but rather if multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time.quite clearly assuming that such authority already exists.the mere acknowledgment of the existence of certain authority and regulation of that authority in no way implies a repeal of other authority.and that is especially true when there is an obvious reason for selecting the instances of authority that are addressed to wit,that they are the examples of sentencing discretion most frequently encountered.
moreover,expressio unius est exclusio alterius is a sword.setser thinks it suggests that,because a recognizes judicial discretion in scenario a and scenario b,there is no such discretion in scenario c.but the same maxim shows much more convincingly why b can not be read to give the bureau of prisons exclusive authority to make the sort of decision committed to the district court in a.when a specifically addresses decisions about concurrent and consecutive sentences,and makes no mention of the bureau role in the process,the implication is that no such role exists.and that conclusion is reinforced by application of the same maxim properly,in this instance to b which is a conferral of authority on the bureau of prisons,but does not confer authority to choose between concurrent and consecutive sentences.put to the choice,we believe it is much more natural to read a as not containing an implied only,leaving room for the exercise of judicial discretion in the situations not covered,than it is to read b as giving the bureau of prisons what amounts to sentencing authority.
none of the other objections to this approach raised by setser and the government require a different result.
our decision today follows the interpretive rule they invoke,that we must give effect to every clause and word of the act.united states menasche,internal quotation marks omitted.the first sentence in a addresses the most common situations in which the decision between concurrent and consecutive sentences must be made where two sentences are imposed at the same time,and where a sentence is imposed subsequent to a prior sentence that has not yet been fully served.it says that the district court has discretion whether to make the sentences concurrent or consecutive,except that it may not make consecutive a sentence for an attempt and a sentence for an offense that was the sole objective of the attempt.and the last two sentences of a say what will be assumed in those two common situations if the court does not specify that the sentence is concurrent or consecutive.giving those dispositions full effect does not demand that we regard them as eliminating sentencing discretion in other situations.
setser and the government both suggest that,because b directs courts to consider the sentencing factors in a in making these decisions,and because some of those factors will be difficult to apply with respect to anticipated sentences,the act can not be read to allow judicial discretion in these circumstances.one can not be sure that the sentence imposed is sufficient,but not greater than necessary,a,the argument goes,if one does not know how long it will actually be.but the district judge faces the same uncertainty if the.consecutive decision is left for later resolution by the bureau of prisons he does not know,for example,whether the sentence he imposes will be an actual five years or will be simply swallowed within another sentence.to be sure,the bureau of prisons,if it waits to decide the matter until after the state court has imposed its sentence,will know for sure what sentences it is dealing with.but the bureau is not charged with applying a.the factors that guide the agency place of imprisonment decision do include the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the prisoner,b,b ed.factors that are,to be sure,relevant to sentencing but also relevant to selection of the place of confinement but they also include factors that make little,if any,sense in the sentencing context,such as the resources of the facility contemplated and whether the state facility meets minimum standards of health and habitability,b,b.these factors confirm our view that is not a sentencing provision but a provision.it is much more natural for a judge to apply the a factors in making all.consecutive decisions,than it is for some such decisions to be made by a judge applying a factors and others by the bureau of prisons applying b factors.
the final objection is that principles of federalism and good policy do not allow a district court to make the.consecutive decision when it does not have before it all of the information about the anticipated state sentence.as for principles of federalism,it seems to us they cut in precisely the opposite direction.in our american system of dual sovereignty,each sovereign whether the federal government or a state is responsible for the administration of its own criminal justice syste m.ice,at.if a prisoner like setser starts in state custody,serves his state sentence,and then moves to federal custody,it will always be the federal government whether the district court or the bureau of prisons that decides whether he will receive credit for the time served in state custody.and if he serves his federal sentence first,the state will decide whether to give him credit against his state sentences without being bound by what the district court or the bureau said on the matter.given this framework,it is always more respectful of the state sovereignty for the district court to make its decision up front rather than for the bureau of prisons to make the decision after the state court has acted.that way,the state court has all of the information before it when it acts the government position does not promote the states interest just the interests of the bureau of prisons.
as for good policy the basic claim of setser,the government,and the dissent is that when it comes to sentencing,later is always better because the decisionmaker has more information.see,post,at a sentencing judge typically needs detailed information when constructing a or guideline sentence that is undoubtedly true,but when that desideratum is applied to the statutory structure before us here it is overwhelmed by text,by our tradition of judicial sentencing and by the accompanying desideratum that sentencing not be left to employees of the same department of justice that conducts the prosecution moreover,when the district court failure to anticipat e developments that take place after the first sentencing,brief for united states,produces unfairness to the defendant,the act provides a mechanism for relief.section c a provides that a district court,
upon motion of the director of the bureau of prisons,may reduce the term of imprisonment after considering the factors set forth in section a to the extent that they are applicable,if it finds that extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction or that the defendant meets other criteria for relief.
setser argues that,even if the district court consecutive order was consistent with a,it made his sentence impossible to implement and therefore unreasonable under the act,see united states booker,in light of the state decision to make his sentences concurrent.we think not.there is nothing unreasonable let alone inherently impossible about the sentence itself.setser is ordered to serve a term in federal custody,and that sentence should run concurrently with one state sentence and consecutively with another.
the difficulty arises not from the sentence,but from the state court decision to make both state sentences concurrent.which of the district court dispositions should prevail that his federal sentence run consecutively to the state sentence on the parole revocation charge,or that his federal sentence run concurrently with the state sentence on the new drug charge if the federal sentence is added to the state sentence it will not be concurrent with the new drug charge,and if it is merged in the state sentence it will not be consecutive to the parole revocation charge.this is indeed a problem,but not,we think,one that shows the district court sentence to be unlawful.the reasonableness standard we apply in reviewing federal sentences asks whether the district court abused its discretion.see gall united states.setser identifies no flaw in the district court decisionmaking process,nor anything available at the time of sentencing that the district court failed to consider.that a sentence is thwarted does not mean that it was unreasonable.if a district court ordered,as a term of supervised release,that a defendant maintain a steady job,but a subsequent disability rendered gainful employment infeasible,we doubt that one would call the original sentence an abuse of discretion.there will often be facts that materially alter a prisoner position and that make it difficult,or even impossible,to implement his sentence.
this is where the bureau of prisons comes in which ultimately has to determine how long the district court sentence authorizes it to continue setser confinement.setser is free to urge the bureau to credit his time served in state court based on the district court judgment that the federal sentence run concurrently with the state sentence for the new drug charges.if the bureau initially declines to do so,he may raise his claim through the bureau administrative remedy program.see cfr et.and if that does not work,he may seek a writ of habeas corpus.see.we express no view on whether those proceedings would be successful.
because it was within the district court discretion to order that setser sentence run consecutively to his anticipated state sentence in the probation revocation proceeding and because the state court subsequent decision to make that sentence concurrent with its other sentence does not establish that the district court abused its discretion by imposing an unreasonable sentence we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.
it is so ordered.

the sentencing reform act of seeks to reform federal sentencing practices by creating a federal sentencing commission instructed to develop and to promulgate federal sentencing guidelines.the provision of the act here at issue concerns multiple sentences.see.it brings into focus a difficult problem how should a federal judge sentence an offender where the offender has been convicted of having violated several different statutes the convictions may have taken place all at the same time.or,some convictions might have taken place at an earlier time,the offender may already have been sentenced to prison,and indeed the offender may still be serving that sentence.the federal judge must decide the extent to which a sentence attached to one conviction should be served concurrently or consecutively with sentences attached to other convictions.
an understanding of the nature of this general problem and the sentencing commission statutorily foreseen solutions will help the reader understand why,in my view,the better legal answer to the question before us is that a federal sentencing judge does not have the power to order that a federal sentence be consecutive to an anticipated state sentence that has not yet been imposed.ante,at.
the sentencing reform act sra has two overall objectives.see barber thomas,slip,at see also united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual,ussg addressing statutory objectives.first,it seeks greater honesty in sentencing.instead of a parole commission and a judge trying to each other about the time an offender will actually serve in prison,the sra tries to create a sentencing system that will require the offender actually to serve most of the sentence the judge imposes.see mistretta united states,the sra makes all sentences basically determinate second,the act seeks greater fairness in sentencing through the creation of guidelines that will increase the likelihood that two offenders who engage in roughly similar criminal behavior will receive roughly similar.see barber,supra,at slip,at noting that congress sought to achieve,in part,increased sentencing uniformity 
to implement these reforms,the sra instructs the commission to write guidelines that inevitably move in the direction of increased real offense sentencing.see ussg.describing how statute,by insisting upon categories of offense behavior and offender characteristics,leads to this result.in principle,real offense sentencing would impose the same sentence upon different offenders who engage in the same real conduct irrespective of the statutes under which they are charged.real offense sentencing,for example,would mean that two individuals,both of whom rob a bank and injure a teller,would receive the same sentence even if the government charges one of them under a bank robbery statute and the other under an assault statute.see,ussg app.a listing federal statutory offenses,while keying them to specific individual guidelines that determine sentence based upon likely actual behavior.in the event,the guidelines move the sentencing system in this direction while simultaneously recognizing that other factors require considerable modification of the real offense principle.see ussg a real offense charge offense sentencing 
nonetheless the real offense goal influenced the act,and the commission,objectives in respect to the sentencing of an offender with multiple convictions.insofar as several convictions arise out of the same course of behavior,the sentencing judge should treat the crimes underlying the convictions as if they were all part of a single crime and sentence accordingly.but,insofar as the crimes underlying the convictions arise out of different courses of behavior,the sentencing judge should treat the crimes underlying the convictions as if they were not part of a single crime and should see that the ultimate sentence reflects that fact.
to achieve these objectives is easier said than done.for one thing,it requires a definition of what counts as the same course of behavior.the guidelines set forth that definition in,relevant conduct for another thing,statutes and guidelines that set forth related instructions must take into account the fact that circumstances can prove highly complex.to take a fairly simple example,suppose that a defendant is convicted of both robbery and impersonating a federal official,that he has engaged in a single course of behavior,but that neither the robbery nor the impersonation guidelines take account of the other.instructions about sentences must give the judge an idea about what to do in such a case.they must also take account of the fact that a maximum penalty contained in a statute will trump a greater penalty contained in a guideline.and they must tell the judge faced with multiple convictions what to do where that is so.
reflecting these,and other,complexities,the guidelines contain complex instructions about how to sentence where the offender is convicted of multiple counts,see ussg,or has previously been convicted of a crime for which he is subject to an term of imprisonment,see.the guidelines also tell the sentencing judge how,through the use of partially concurrent and partially consecutive sentences,to build a total sentence that meets the guidelines requirements.see d.
with this background it becomes easier to understand the statutory provisions before us.they reflect the fact that congress expected sentencing judges,when faced with a defendant convicted of multiple crimes,to construct a sentence that would,at least to a degree,reflect the defendant real underlying behavior.where two convictions reflect in whole or in part the same behavior,the overall sentences should reflect that fact,say by running concurrently.
accordingly,the statute says that m ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms are to run consecutively.a.and that statement reflects the fact that often but not always multiple convictions after a single trial will reflect a course of behavior different aspects of which violate different criminal statutes.the statute also says that m ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to run concurrently.ibid.this statement reflects the fact that several convictions imposed after different trials are more likely to reflect unrelated behaviors.in the first instance that the statute addresses,concurrent sentences are more likely to be appropriate in the second,consecutive sentences are more likely to be appropriate.but that is not always so.thus t
