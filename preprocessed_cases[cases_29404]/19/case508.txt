a jury convicted petitionerappellant robert lee of murder in the first degree for the death of angel santos davila.the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc affirmed lee conviction on direct appeal.see commonwealth lee.after several unsuccessful motions for a new trial in state court,lee filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in federal district court,arguing that his attorneys at both trial and postconviction proceedings were constitutionally ineffective and that prosecutorial misconduct tainted his case.the district court denied habeas relief as well as lee motion for discovery,holding that all of lee claims had been procedurally defaulted.after careful consideration,we hold that the claim of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel has not been procedurally defaulted,but that i constitutes an independent bar to habeas relief on this ground.we accordingly affirm.
facts background 
underlying crime 
we set forth the facts as recounted by the sjc in affirming lee conviction on direct appeal,supplemented by other consistent facts in the record.yeboah sefah ficco,cir.
janet brady hired lee to kill her boyfriend angel santos davila,with whom she lived brady testified at trial that her relationship with davila began deteriorating in the spring of,and that,by the summer,she had resolved to find someone to pay to do him harm.she contacted robert decot,the manager of a local bar,who put her in touch with lee.lee was known to decot as a patron of his bar brady,too,was already acquainted with lee,as he was a customer at the fort devens credit union where she worked as a loan officer.over the days leading up to davila shooting,brady and lee met several times at local bars and in the back office of the credit union.during these meetings,they made plans to take care of davila and discussed payment.lee demanded upfront,plus an additional brady complied.
davila was shot at approximately on thursday,august.people attending a pool party at the house next door to brady and davila heard shots ring out,as well as the sound of a car with a noisy muffler driving away.an old car,making a lot of noise and reddish in color was seen driving away very fast.lee wife,who was out of town at the time of the shooting,owned a red toyota,which lee had been seen driving that week.
police recovered one yellow sears shotgun shell,determined to have come from a gauge shotgun,outside davila house,as well as shot lead fragments from the stairway inside the house similar lead fragments also were extracted from davila body during the autopsy.there was testimony at trial that although lee had loaned his shotgun to a friend,he picked it up sometime between august and.when police arrested lee on august,they found in his closet a gauge remington shotgun and five yellow sears gauge shotgun shells filled with shot.
lee presented an alibi defense 
lee offered his own and corroborating testimony that he was at a bar some distance away from the victim home from eight until well after nine on the evening in question.he sought to show that he was not driving his wife red toyota but a jeep that night,that the toyota was not old or noisy,and that he did not recover his shotgun until friday,august,the day after the shooting.lee version of his contact with janet brady was that she asked him to collect money from a warner.he claimed brady concocted the story of the conspiracy with lee in order to protect her son or someone else who actually shot davilla sic.
lee,at.after a trial in may,the jury rejected this defense and found lee guilty of murder in the first degree.
direct appeal 
on appeal,lee challenged the denial of his motion to suppress and motion for a directed verdict,as well as the jury instructions on malice and the trial judge failure to instruct on manslaughter.the sjc affirmed lee conviction in,finding no merit to any of his arguments.
postconviction proceedings 
postconviction proceedings have extended over four decades since lee conviction was affirmed on direct appeal.lee filed his first motion for a new trial,through counsel,in july.after that attorney was disbarred,another lawyer took over his case and filed a substitute motion for a new trial in august.that motion raised claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,based on a failure to investigate lee purported lack of criminal responsibility as a result of mental impairment sustained in the vietnam war ineffectiveness of counsel in witnesses and failing to request a jury instruction on misidentification and error in the jury instructions on reasonable doubt and malice.the motion was denied without a hearing in february.
lee subsequently filed a pro se motion to reconsider that decision,which also added several claims centering on his lack of criminal responsibility and incompetence to stand trial,and ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to raise those claims.this motion,too,was denied without a hearing.lee sought leave to appeal,and a hearing was held before a single justice of the sjc in november.the single justice,acting as gatekeeper,declined to let the appeal proceed to the full court 
lee filed another pro se motion for a new trial in september,also requesting that counsel be assigned to him.although his motion for the appointment of counsel was allowed,none was assigned and,for reasons that are unclear from the record,no further action was taken on lee case for over seven years.mary rogers,lee current attorney,was appointed as new counsel in february in september,she filed a new motion for a new trial to substitute for lee pro se filing.
the motion for a new trial took a new tack.instead of focusing on lee alleged lack of criminal responsibility and claimed error in jury instructions,this motion asserted numerous instances of ineffective assistance of counsel at both trial and postconviction stages as well as prosecutorial misconduct as grounds for a new trial in connection with this motion,lee also filed motions for discovery,in attempt to obtain documents such as police reports,ballistics records,grand jury minutes,and the victim statements to police,which state prosecutors and law enforcement officers purportedly had not provided.the court denied the motion for new trial in september without explicitly addressing the motions for discovery.lee sought leave to appeal the denial of the motion before a single justice of the sjc.finding that the appeal did not raise a new and substantial question.laws ch,the single justice,in july,declined to let the appeal proceed to the full court.
lee,through current counsel,filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court in july,raising much the same claims as the motion presented.lee also filed several ancillary motions,including a motion for discovery,motion for an evidentiary hearing,and motion for criminal records of witnesses.the district court held a hearing in march,and subsequently denied lee motions.for reasons that are unclear from the record,the district court final memorandum and order denying habeas relief did not issue until december,nearly years after lee filed the petition.
applying our decision in costa hall,cir,the district court held that all of lee claims had been procedurally defaulted,since,as the single justice of the sjc had determined,they failed to overcome the new and substantial question hurdle of.laws ch.see lee corsini,mlw,wl,at.as denial of review under due to procedural waiver is an independent and adequate state ground that bars federal habeas review,simpson matesanz,cir,the district court declined to reach the merits of lee claims,finding neither cause for nor prejudice from the procedural default,nor any fundamental miscarriage of justice to excuse the default.
thus,after a long and tortuous process involving sometimes inordinate delay,this appeal has finally reached us,over years after the shooting of august.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court denial of a habeas corpus petition de novo.lynch ficco,cir.
because,as a general matter,a federal habeas court will not review a claim rejected by a state court if the decision of the state court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment,walker martin,d second alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted,we look to the last reasoned opinion of the state court to discern the grounds for its decision.ylst nunnemaker,d.
the last reasoned opinion here is the decision of the single justice of the sjc,who ruled that lee appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial did not present a new and substantial question which ought to be determined by the full court.laws ch.before the single justice were three types of claims ineffective assistance of trial counsel,prosecutorial misconduct,and ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel namely,the attorney who handled his first motion for a new trial in.the single justice held that the first two claims were not new,since they could have been raised in an earlier proceeding he held that the claim of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel,though arguably new,was nevertheless not substantial the parties agree that the first two claims have been procedurally defaulted,but disagree over whether the claim has been defaulted,and whether there is reason to excuse any default.we discuss these issues in more detail below.
whether claim of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel has been procedurally defaulted under.laws ch,
federal habeas review of the merits of a claim is precluded if there is an independent and adequate state law ground supporting the state court decision.walker.at.this principle is grounded in concerns of comity and federalism.costa,at quoting coleman thompson,d.a state procedural rule is adequate to preclude federal merits review so long as the state regularly follows the rule and has not waived it by relying on some other ground.jewett brady,cir citing horton allen,cir.if the state court decision indeed rests on some other,nonprocedural ground,federal merits review will be available only if that ground is federal in nature,or interwoven with federal law.brewer marshall,cir quoting coleman,at.
we have previously addressed the particular waiver rule of.laws ch,the statute specific to appeals of murder convictions,upon which the single justice relied in his decision.mendes brady,cir.according to the scheme set forth in that statute,a defendant who has been convicted of murder is afforded plenary review on direct appeal to the sjc.following such review,a defendant is free to file any number of motions for a new trial in state superior court.see id.he is only entitled to appellate review of the denial of such a motion,however,if a single justice of the sjc determines that the appeal presents a question that is both new and substantial,fit for resolution by the full court,or if it nevertheless raises the specter of a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice,commonwealth drew.
a defendant claim might be new,for example,if the applicable law was not sufficiently developed at the time of trial or direct appeal,such that the claim could not reasonably have been raised in those proceedings or if evidence not previously available comes to light.commonwealth gunter,citation omitted.by contrast,
a n issue is not new within the meaning of where either it has already been addressed,or where it could have been addressed had the defendant properly raised it at trial or on direct review.the statute requires that the defendant present all his claims of error at the earliest possible time,and failure to do so precludes relief on all grounds generally known and available at the time of trial or appeal.
commonwealth ambers,internal quotation marks omitted.an issue is substantial if it is meritorious in the sense of being worthy of consideration by an appellate court.gunter,at.a decision by the single justice that a appeal neither presents a new and substantial question nor raises a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice,is final and unreviewable.see commonwealth monteiro.
the single justice determination that an issue is not new within the meaning of is tantamount to a finding of procedural default,the classic example of an independent and adequate state ground.simpson,at.but the single justice decision need not rest on grounds of default she may instead find that the issue is in fact new but nevertheless insubstantial,based on an application of the substantive legal standard.a determination that the issues are new and simply not substantial resolves the claims on the merits and does not signal procedural default.jewett,at citing phoenix matesanz,cir see also simpson,at suppose that the denial by the single justice of the petition rests on a finding that while petitioner claim is new,it is,nonetheless,not substantial a conclusion reached by analysis under and resting on federal law.it could be cogently argued that such a denial does not rest purely on state law and so is not independent.that hypothetical involves clear reliance on federal law and is vastly different from an order denying review where there had been procedural waiver.citations omitted.
this,at least on its face,is straightforward enough a finding that the issue is not new amounts to procedural default,whereas a finding that the issue is new but not substantial does not.however,both the district court and the parties have identified some tension in our prior cases addressing single justices application of the rule.we take this opportunity to dispel any uncertainty.
the source of the confusion is a passage in our recent decision in costa,which,when read in isolation,appears to endorse the proposition that a single justice resolution of the substantiality prong against the petitioner by itself signals procedural default.in that case,the substantive issue underlying the claim raised on appeal to the single justice specifically,the inconsistent testimony of a particular witness had already been reviewed and rejected twice by the sjc,and was therefore neither new nor substantial.see costa,at.we rejected costa entreaty for merits review,reasoning 
the single justice finding that neither of costa ineffective assistance of counsel claims presented new and substantial questions within the meaning of review constitutes an independent and adequate state ground.the single justice observed that both claims merely reiterated the same substantive challenge to a trial witness credibility already decided against costa on the merits.although costa argues that his ineffectiveness of appellate counsel claim necessarily presents a new question in that it could not have been raised until after his direct appeal,the single justice also found that this claim was not substantial,rendering costa newness argument,were it even plausible,irrelevant.the single justice finding of a lack of substantiality constitutes an independent and adequate state ground in and of itself and acts to bar federal review.mendes,at.
id.at emphasis added.
as the district court here noted,the underlined text in particular is difficult to reconcile with our prior holdings,discussed above,that a determination of an issue insubstantiality preserves federal merits review,provided that the issue is also new.see,jewett,at.lee argues that those prior holdings remain good law.
we agree.costa did not impose a new categorical bar to federal review of habeas petitions.indeed,when read in conjunction with a footnote in the same case,it is clear that the costa decision as a whole reaffirms the general principle that a single justice determination that an issue is new but not substantial does not preclude federal habeas review on the merits.as we observed in that footnote 
this the principle that a single justice explanation of her views as to why claims are not new and not substantial does not convert the decision into one on the merits accords with our prior case law.in jewett brady,cir,we held that where,unlike here,the single justice finds that a claim is new within the meaning of,a federal habeas court must accept this as a binding merits determination of newness and may not look behind the reasoning.id.at a determination that the issues are new and simply not substantial resolves the claims on the merits and does not signal procedural default.however,where,as here,the single justice finds a claim is neither new nor substantial under,this is a procedural bar to federal habeas review.id.
thus,it is not the case that a single justice finding of a lack of substantiality will always bar merits review.rather,as per the facts of costa,a finding of a lack of substantiality precludes review only when it is accompanied by the conclusion that the issue is also not new.in essence,it is only the failure to satisfy the new prong of the rule that signals procedural default.
here,the single justice determined that lee claims regarding ineffective assistance of trial counsel and prosecutorial misconduct were not new because they could have been raised on direct appeal or in his first motion for a new trial.as the parties agree,such a finding amounts to a procedural default of these claims.see,yeboah sefah,at.but the single justice did not make a comparable finding regarding lee claim of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel.instead,he observed,arguably,this is lee first opportunity to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel who represented him on his first motion for new trial.however,even assuming that this claim could be new,it is not substantial.this conclusion was supported by a fairly detailed analysis of the merits of the claim several pages in length under the substantive legal standard of commonwealth saferian.phoenix,at.
the absence of any definite finding as to newness distinguishes this case from others such as mendes,at,and yeboah sefah,at,where we have held that the adequacy and independence of state law grounds are not undercut when the single justice finds procedural default but also briefly reviews the merits of the claim to ensure that there is no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.those cases make plain that procedurally defaulted claims can not be resurrected by a single justice holistic review of the merits in the context of a analysis.here,by contrast,the single justice avoided making any determination as to procedural default in connection with the claim of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel,instead resting his decision on the substance of that claim,which in his judgment was weak,since lee had not demonstrated that postconviction counsel performance was constitutionally deficient.
our inquiry does not,of course,end here.even holding that the single justice decision rested not on procedural default but on the merits of the petitioner ineffective assistance claim,we may not entertain habeas review if the merits determination was grounded in state law.phoenix,at.although the single justice did not cite federal constitutional provisions or case law in his decision,lee pressed arguments regarding the ineffectiveness of postconviction counsel under both the federal and state constitutions.because the state standard under commonwealth saferian,is the functional equivalent of the federal standard of strickland washington,ouber guarino,cir,the single justice necessarily rejected lee assertions under the federal constitution as well as state,phoenix,at.under the circumstances,then,the single justice decision as to the issue of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel only fairly appear s to rest primarily on the resolution of lee federal claim,or to be interwoven with th at claim,and does not clearly and expressly rely on an independent and adequate state ground.phoenix,at quoting coleman,at.as a result,the ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel claim has not been procedurally defaulted.
there is,however,an independent bar to habeas relief on this ground.i provides that t he ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during federal or state collateral proceedings shall not be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising under section,as this appeal does see also martel clair,d section i prohibits a court from granting substantive habeas relief on the basis of a lawyer ineffectiveness in proceedings.therefore,although lee claim of ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel has not been procedurally defaulted,the district court was,in any event,precluded from granting relief on that ground.
whether procedural default of claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and prosecutorial misconduct may be excused 
we next consider whether the remaining claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and prosecutorial misconduct,though procedurally defaulted,may nevertheless be reviewed on the merits.
a claim that has been procedurally defaulted may nevertheless be reviewed by a federal habeas court if the petitioner demonstrates cause for the default and prejudice resulting therefrom,or can show that failure to consider the federal claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.harris reed,d internal quotation marks omitted.lee presses two ostensible causes for default ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel,and various state agencies failure to turn over documents to his current counsel.we consider each in turn.
lee first argues that the attorney who handled his first motion for a new trial in was constitutionally ineffective in failing to present the claims raised by his current counsel in the latest motion for a new trial this postconviction ineffectiveness,lee maintains,constitutes cause for defaulting the trial claims.
to establish cause,there must be some objective factor external to the defense which impeded counsel efforts to comply with the state procedural rule.lynch,at quoting murray carrier.although constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel,at trial or on direct appeal,in failing to preserve a claim for review may constitute cause for default,ineffective assistance of counsel in postconviction proceedings typically will not.coleman,at.that is because,as the supreme court explained in coleman,there can be no constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in a proceeding in which there is no constitutional right to an attorney.id.where a petitioner defaults a claim as a result of the denial of the right to effective assistance of counsel,the state,which is responsible for the denial as a constitutional matter,must bear the cost of any resulting default and the harm to state interests that federal habeas review entails.id.at.but a different allocation of costs is appropriate in those circumstances where the state has no responsibility to ensure that the petitioner was represented by competent counsel.id.
lee focuses on two recent supreme court cases that set forth,as narrow exceptions to the coleman rule,specific sets of circumstances in which ineffective assistance of counsel in postconviction proceedings will indeed be imputed to the state,thereby constituting cause for procedural default in martinez ryan,d,the court addressed whether ineffective assistance of counsel during collateral postconviction proceedings could constitute cause for defaulting a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel,in the context of a state scheme that prohibited such claims from being raised on direct review.the court observed that b y deliberately choosing to move claims outside of the process,where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed,the state significantly diminishes prisoners ability to file such claims.martinez.at.in order to vindicate a prisoner right to present such claims,the court held that ineffective assistance of counsel in postconviction proceedings can constitute cause for procedural default,provided certain circumstances are present 
the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is a substantial claim the cause consist s of there being no counsel or only ineffective counsel during the state collateral review proceeding the state collateral review proceeding is the initial review proceeding in respect to the claim and state law requires that an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim be raised in an collateral proceeding.
trevino thaler,d final alteration in original quoting martinez.at.
a year later,in the case of trevino thaler,the court extended its holding in martinez to include not just scenarios where state law literally bars claims
