roxanne troy raises claims of evidentiary insufficiency,instructional error,and inadequacy of the charging document,all of which require us to explore the parameters of the interstate commerce element of the federal arson statute,i.the appellant caps her asseverational array with a claim of sentencing error.this final claim depends on the notion that section i mandatory minimum term of imprisonment does not preclude the imposition of a sentence of probation.after careful consideration of the arguments ably presented by the appellant counsel,we reject all of these claims and affirm the judgment below.
background 
because the appellant principal claim of error is couched as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we rehearse the facts in the light most hospitable to the verdict,consistent with record support.united states,cir.
for roughly eight years,beginning in,the appellant and her husband,david troy,operated rox,a nightclub and bar located at main street,oxford,massachusetts.they closed the establishment in,but by early,they had reopened it.
the resumption of business posed a problem.in,a law had taken effect in massachusetts,imposing new fire safety requirements on certain establishments with a seating capacity of or more persons.see.laws ch.the law demanded,among other things,that these facilities install sprinkler systems by a specified deadline.rox was subject to this proviso.
on april,the oxford fire chief,jeffrey wilson,wrote to the appellant,noting her obligation to submit plans for the installation of a conforming sprinkler system no later than may,with installation to be completed by november.in response,the appellant stated that she did not intend to install a sprinkler system but,rather,would raze the building and construct a new establishment at main street.chief wilson did not reply directly to the appellant letter he did,however,inform kimberly golenski,a managerial employee at rox,that the sprinkler system plans would have to be submitted by december,for rox to be in compliance with the law.
no plans were proffered by that date,and chief wilson told the chief of police that both the liquor license and the certificate of occupancy for rox should be regarded as null and void as of midnight on december.rox closed at that time and never reopened for business.the town of oxford town subsequently refused to renew the liquor license.
undaunted,the appellant applied for a new liquor license for the same site.she later sued the town,asserting a right to renew the previously suspended license.
early in,the town performed fire,electrical,and building inspections at the site.the appellant thereafter effected repairs to the building and its accouterments as a means of addressing shortcomings identified in the recent spate of inspections.
in april of,golenski began cooperating with local law enforcement and the federal bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms,and explosives in their joint investigation into an attempted arson at rox.on april,a concealed with the appellant.in the course of their conversation,the appellant admitted that she had offered rene armenia,golenski boyfriend,to burn rox to the ground.the fee was to be paid in advance and after the arson was accomplished.
during this same conversation,the appellant and golenski also discussed ways in which golenski could torch rox and make it look like an accidental fire.the appellant vouchsafed that,after it done,i will give you something.
in due season,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of massachusetts returned an indictment charging the appellant with two counts of solicitation to commit a crime of violence in violation of a,and one count of attempted arson in violation of i.after a modicum of pretrial skirmishing,not relevant here,the case went to trial in march of.at the close of the government case in chief and again at the close of all the evidence,the appellant moved for a judgment of acquittal.see.all of the counts required proof of the elements of i arson was the crime of violence specified in each of the first two counts of the the appellant argued that the government had failed to present sufficient evidence to prove the interstate commerce element of section i.the district court denied both motions.
the jury convicted the appellant on all three counts.on july,the district court sentenced her to a incarcerative term on each count to run concurrently,followed by two years of supervised release.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
we divide our analysis into three parts,each addressing a discrete set of claims.under this taxonomy,we first consider the appellant claims relating to the parameters of the interstate commerce element of i.we then address her plaint that the indictment failed adequately to describe the charged crimes.finally,we grapple with her claim of sentencing error.
use under i.
the appellant flagship claims concern the parameters of the interstate commerce element of section i.the first of these deals with the sufficiency of the evidence.the appellant maintains that the trial court erred in denying her rule motion for acquittal because the evidence did not establish that rox was used in interstate commerce as required by section i.
this challenge presents a question of law,engendering de novo review.see,at.to answer that question,we must look at the evidence as a whole and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the verdict.id.our objective is to ascertain whether the record evidence permitted a reasonable juror to find that each element of the crime charged was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia.
at the heart of the appellant argument lies a dispute over statutory interpretation.the pertinent statute,section i,provides 
whoever maliciously damages or destroys,or attempts to damage or destroy,by means of fire or an explosive,any building,vehicle,or other real or personal property used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce shall be imprisoned for not less than years and not more than years,fined under this title,or both 
i.the dispute in this case revolves around whether a reasonable jury could have found that the building at main street,at the time of the arson,was being used in interstate commerce within the purview of this statute.
the supreme court shed some light on this question in jones united states.that case dealt with the arson of an residence not itself devoted to a commercial purpose.id.at.the court indicated that,with respect to use,the proper inquiry focuses on the function of the targeted structure.id.at.the court added that the federal arson statute use in interstate commerce provision is most sensibly read to mean active employment for commercial purposes,and not merely a passive,passing,or past connection to commerce.id.at.section i covers only property currently used in commerce or in an activity affecting commerce.id.at.the case at hand requires us to determine what type of use is sufficiently active and current to satisfy this test in a case in which,unlike in jones,the building is not a private residence but,rather,a commercial establishment that was not open for business at the time of the planned arson.
to begin,jones is factually inapposite.consequently,the jones court language can not be transplanted root and branch into the much different terrain of this case.nevertheless,we can derive guidance from that language.the jones court expressed concern that,were it to find a private residence subject to the federal arson statute,it would make virtually every arson in the country a federal offense.id.at.we share the same concern about avoiding a reading of section i that reaches too far.
this brings us to the appellant invitation to adopt a strict and mechanical reading of the language employed by the jones court.we decline this invitation we do not read jones as suggesting that all commercial establishments,once closed for business for any period or purpose,move beyond the reach of section i.
the reading suggested by the appellant would produce ludicrous results.the phrases currently used and active employment can not sensibly be read
