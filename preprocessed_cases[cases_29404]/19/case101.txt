a federal court of appeals normally will not correct a legal error made in a criminal trial unless the defendant first brought the error to the trial court attention.united states olano.but federal rule of criminal procedure b provides an exception,permitting a plain error that affects substantial rights to be considered even though it was not brought to the trial court attention.
here,the district court increased the length of petitioner henderson sentence so he could participate in a prison drug rehabilitation program.henderson counsel did not object to the sentence,but,on appeal,henderson claimed that the district court plainly erred in increasing his sentence solely for rehabilitative purposes.while the appeal was pending,this court decided in tapia united states,that it is error for a court to impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.while this meant that the district court sentence was erroneous,the fifth circuit determined that rule b did not give it authority to correct the error.in doing so,it concluded that an error is plain under the rule only if it was clear under current law at the time of trial,but that,in this case,circuit law was unsettled until tapia was decided.
held regardless of whether a legal question was settled or unsettled at the time of trial,an error is plain within the meaning of rule b so long as the error was plain at the time of appellate review.
a the question of whether an error must be plain at the time it is committed or at the time it is reviewed reflects two competing legal principles.the principle that a right may be forfeited in a case if it is not timely asserted before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it favors limiting the assessment of plainness to the time of the error commission.see olano,supra,at.and the rule that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision favors assessing plainness at the time of review.see thorpe housing authority of durham.because neither principle is absolute,the conflict can not be decided by looking to one rather than the other.the text of rule b also leaves open the temporal question.and relevant precedent does not directly answer the question.in olano,this court said that rule b authorizes an appeals court to correct a forfeited error only if there is an error,that is plain,that affect s substantial rights,and that seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,at.in johnson united states,the court concluded that,where a trial court decision was clearly correct under circuit law when made but becomes clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal,it is enough that an error be plain at the time of appellate consideration.however,neither case addressed what rule should apply where the law is unsettled at the time of the error but plain at the time of review,at,s,at.
b this precedent,when read in light of the underlying background principles,leads to the conclusion that rule b plain error phrase applies at the time of review.if plain error covers trial court decisions that were plainly correct when made and those that were plainly incorrect when made,it should cover cases in the middle,where the law was neither clearly correct nor incorrect,but unsettled,at the time of the trial court decision.to hold to the contrary would lead to unjustifiably different treatment of similarly situated individuals,for there is no practical reason to treat a defendant more harshly simply because his circuit law was unclear at the time of trial.even if a time of error rule would provide an added incentive to counsel to call a trial judge attention to the matter so the judge could quickly consider remedial action,such incentive has little,if any,practical importance since counsel normally has good reasons for calling a trial court attention to potential error,the advantage to counsel and client of having an error speedily corrected.in sum,in contrast to a time of error rule,a time of review interpretation furthers the basic principle that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,thorpe,supra,at works little,if any,practical harm upon the competing administrative principle that insists that counsel call a potential error to the trial court attention and is consistent with rule b basic purpose of creating a exception to the general requirement that an objection be made at trial to preserve a claim of error.
c the government arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.its claim that appellate courts should consider only errors that counsel called to the trial court attention and errors that the court should have independently recognized overlooks the way in which rule b restricts the appellate court authority to correct an error to those errors that would,in fact,seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.the government also fears that the holding here will lead to too many plain error claims.but,a new rule of law set by an appellate court can not automatically lead that court to consider all contrary determinations by trial courts plainly erroneous,given that lower court decisions that are questionable but not plainly wrong fall outside the rule scope,and given that any error must have affected the defendant substantial rights and affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.finally,the government textual argument that rule b is written mostly in the past tense,whatever its merits,is foreclosed by johnson.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
a federal court of appeals normally will not correct a legal error made in criminal trial court proceedings unless the defendant first brought the error to the trial court attention.see united states olano.but federal rule of criminal procedure b,creating an exception to the normal rule,says that a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the trial court attention.emphasis added.the rule does not say explicitly,however,as of just what time the error must be plain.must the lower court ruling be plainly erroneous as of the time the lower court made the error or can an error still count as plain if the erroneous nature of that ruling is not plain until the time of appellate review 
the case before us concerns a district court decision on a substantive legal question that was unsettled at the time the trial court acted,thus foreclosing the possibility that any error could have been plain then.before the case was final and at the time of direct appellate review,however,the question had become settled in the defendant favor,making the trial court error plain but not until that later time.in our view,as long as the error was plain as of that later time the time of appellate review the error is plain within the meaning of the rule.and the court of appeals may conside r the error even though it was not brought to the trial court attention.fed.rule crim.proc.b.
in early,armarcion henderson,the petitioner,pleaded guilty in federal district court to a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm.the district judge accepted the plea and,in june,he sentenced henderson to an prison term of months.ibid.the judge entered the longer sentence to try to help henderson by qualifying him for an drug rehabilitation program,a program that would provide the treatment and the counse l ing that this defendant needs right now.app.to pet.for cert.
henderson counsel did not object.indeed,the judge asked counsel if there was any reason why that sentence as stated should not be imposed.at.and counsel replied,procedurally,no.ibid.subsequently,henderson appealed,claiming,among other things,that the district court had plain ly erred in sentencing him to an prison term solely for rehabilitative purposes,at.
in,after henderson was sentenced but before henderson appeal was heard,this court decided tapia united states.there,we held that it is error for a court to impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.at slip,at.given tapia,henderson sentence was unlawful,and the district court decision to impose that sentence was erroneous.but,since henderson counsel had not objected in the trial court,the court of appeals could not correct the error unless rule b applied.the rule,however,applies only if the error was plain.the error was not plain before tapia it was plain after tapia.thus,the fifth circuit had to determine the temporal scope of rule b words plain error.
the appeals court decided that rule b did not give it the authority to correct the trial court error,at.the appellate panel pointed out that,b efore tapia,there was a circuit split on whether a district court can consider a defendant rehabilitative needs to lengthen a sentence.ibid.the panel added that the fifth circuit had not pronounced on the question before henderson was sentenced.ibid.thus,at the time when the district court reached its decision,the law in that circuit was unsettled.the court of appeals concluded that henderson can not show that the error in his case was plain,because an error is plain only if it was clear under current law at the time of trial.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.
the fifth circuit denied rehearing en banc by a divided vote.per curiam to.henderson filed a petition for certiorari.and we granted the petition to resolve differences among the circuits.compare,united states cordery,time of review,with,united states mouling,cadc time of error.
is the time for determining plainness the time when the error is committed,or can an error be plain if it is not plain until the time the error is reviewed the question reflects a conflict between two important,here competing,legal principles.on the one hand,n o procedural principle is more familiar to this court than that a constitutional right,or a right of any other sort,may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.olano,at quoting yakus united states.this principle favors assessing plainness limited to the time the error was committed.
on the other hand,t he general rule is that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision.thorpe housing authority of durham.see ziffrin united states.indeed,chief justice marshall wrote long ago 
it is in the general true that the province of an appellate court is only to enquire whether a judgment when rendered was erroneous or not.but if subsequent to the judgment and before the decision of the appellate court,a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs,the law must be obeyed,or its obligation denied.in such a case the court must decide according to existing laws,and if it be necessary to set aside a judgment,rightful when rendered,but which can not be affirmed but in violation of law,the judgment must be set aside.united states schooner peggy,cranch.
this principle favors assessing plainness at the time of review.
rule b itself makes clear that the first principle is not absolute.indeed,we have said that a rigid and undeviating judicially declared practice under which courts of review would invariably and under all circumstances decline to consider all questions which had not previously been specifically urged would be out of harmony with the rules of fundamental justice.olano,supra,at quoting hormel helvering,ellipsis in original.but neither is the second principle absolute.even where a new rule of law is at issue,rule b does not give a court of appeals authority to overlook a failure to object unless an error not only affect s substantial rights but also seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.olano,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted brackets in original.because the two principles here point in different directions and neither is absolute,we can not decide this conflict simply by looking to one rather than to the other.
the text of rule b does not resolve the problem.it does not say that a court of appeals may consider an error that was plain language that would look to the past.rather,it simply says that a court of appeals may consider a plain error.and that language leaves the temporal question open.but see infra,at.
neither does precedent answer the temporal question at least not directly.olano is clearly relevant.there,we said that rule b authorizes an appeals court to correct a forfeited error only if there is an error,the error is plain,and the error affect s substantial rights.at internal quotation marks omitted.pointing out that rule is permissive,not mandatory,at,we added that the standard that should guide the exercise of remedial discretion under rule b is whether the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,at quoting united states atkinson,brackets in original.at the same time,we said that w e need not consider the special case where the error was unclear at the time of trial but becomes clear on appeal because the applicable law has been clarified.at.that is the case now before us.
johnson united states,is also relevant.we there considered a trial court decision that was clearly correct under circuit law when made but which,by the time of review,had become plainly erroneous due to an intervening authoritative legal decision.we concluded that,where the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal,it is enough that an error be plain at the time of appellate consideration.at.as in olano,however,we declined to decide whether that same rule should apply where the law is unsettled at the time of error but plain at the time of review,at.as we have said,this is precisely the case now before us.
the text,precedents,and background principles do not directly dictate a result here.but prior precedent has helped to shape current law.and that precedent,read in light of those underlying principles,leads us to interpret rule b phrase plain error as applying at the time of review.given johnson,a time of error interpretation would prove highly,and unfairly,anomalous.
consider the lay of the legal land no one doubts that an to error by a trial judge will ordinarily fall within rule b word plain as long as the trial court decision was plainly incorrect at the time it was made,olano,supra,at.that much is common ground.johnson then adds that,at least in one circumstance,an to error by a trial judge will also fall within rule b word plain even if the judge was not plainly incorrect at the time it was made.that is the circumstance where an error is plain even if the trial judge decision was plainly correct at the time when it was made but subsequently becomes incorrect based on a change in law,at.and,since by definition the trial judge did not commit plain error at the time of the ruling,johnson explicitly rejects applying the words plain error as of the time when the trial judge acted.instead,johnson deems it enough that an error be plain at the time of appellate consideration for that error to fall within rule b category of plain error.ibid.
but if the rule words plain error cover both trial court decisions that were plainly correct at the time when the judge made the decision and trial court decisions that were plainly incorrect at the time when the judge made the decision,then why should they not also cover cases in the middle,where the law at the time of the trial judge decision was neither clearly correct nor incorrect,but unsettled 
to hold to the contrary would bring about unjustifiably different treatment of similarly situated individuals.imagine three virtually identical defendants,each from a different circuit,each sentenced in january to identical long prison terms,and each given those long sentences for the same reason,namely to obtain rehabilitative treatment.imagine that none of them raises an objection.in june,the supreme court holds this form of sentencing unlawful.and,in december,each of the three different circuits considers the claim that the trial judge prison term constituted a legal error.imagine further that in the first circuit the law in january made the trial court decision clearly lawful as of the time when the judge made it in the second circuit,the law in january made the trial court decision clearly unlawful as of the time when the judge made it and in the third circuit,the law in january was unsettled.
to apply rule b words plain error as of the time of appellate review would treat all three defendants alike.it would permit all three to go on to argue to the appellate court that the trial court error affected their substantial rights and seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.olano,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.to interpret plain error differently,however,would treat these three virtually identical defendants differently,allowing only the first two defendants,but not the third defendant,potentially to qualify for rule b relief.all three defendants suffered from legal error all three failed to object and all three would benefit from the new legal interpretation.what reason is there to give two of these three defendants the benefits of a new rule of law,but not the third schooner peggy,cranch,at.
there is no practical ground for making this distinction.to the contrary,to distinguish and treat more harshly cases where a circuit law was unclear would simply promote arguments about whether the law of the circuit initially was unclear rather than clearly settled one way or the other.and these arguments are likely to be particularly difficult to resolve where what is at issue is a matter of legal degree,not kind.to what extent,for example,did a prosecutor closing argument go too far down the road of prejudice a time of error interpretation also would require courts of appeals to play a kind of temporal,looking at the law that now is to decide whether error exists,looking at the law that then was to decide whether the error was plain,and looking at the circumstances that now are to decide whether the defendant has satisfied olano third and fourth criteria.thus,the time of error interpretation would make the appellate process yet more complex and time consuming.
we recognize,as the solicitor general points out,that a time of error rule,even if confined to instances in which the law is uncertain,would in such cases provide an added incentive to counsel to call the lower court judge attention to the matter at a time when that judge could quickly take remedial action.and,even if no remedy is offered,the lower court judge analysis may help the court of appeals to decide the legal question.see brief for united states.see also mouling,at.we disagree with the solicitor general,however,in that we also believe that,in the present context,any added incentive has little,if any,practical importance.
that is because counsel normally has other good reasons for calling a trial court attention to potential error for example,it is normally to the advantage of counsel and his client to get the error speedily corrected.and,even where that is not so,counsel can not rely upon the plain error rule to make up for a failure to object at trial.after all,that rule will help only if the law changes in the defendant favor,the change comes after trial but before the appeal is decided,the error affected the defendant substantial rights,and the error seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.olano,at internal quotation marks omitted.if there is a lawyer who would deliberately forgo objection now because he perceives some slightly expanded chance to argue for plain error later,we suspect that,like the unicorn,he finds his home in the imagination,not the courtroom.
the upshot is that a time of review interpretation furthers the basic schooner peggy principle that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision.thorpe,at.it works little,if any,practical harm upon the competing administrative principle that insists that counsel call a potential error to the trial court attention.and,it is consistent with the basic purpose of rule b,namely the creation of a exception to the general requirement that an objection be made at trial.see supra,at.
at the same time,the competing time of error rule is out of step with our precedents,creates unfair and anomalous results,and works practical administrative harm.thus,in the direct appeals of cases that are not yet final,we consider the time of review interpretation the better reading of rule words plain error.
the solicitor general makes several other important arguments,but they fail to lead us to a different conclusion.first,the government argues that the purpose of review is to ensure the integrity of the trial proceedings.brief for united states.in turn,the argument goes,appellate courts should consider only errors that counsel called to the court attention and errors that the trial court should have known about regardless,namely those that then were plain.expanding on this theme,one court of appeals described plain error as error that is so,so obvious,a competent district judge should be able to avoid it without benefit of objection.when the state of the law is unclear at trial and only becomes clear as a result of later authority,the district court error is perforce not plain we expect district judges to be knowledgeable,not clairvoyant.united states turman,citation omitted.
this approach,however,overlooks the way in which the rule rule b restricts the appellate court authority to correct an error to those errors that would,in fact,seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states farrell,considering the issue from this perspective.and the approach runs headlong into johnson.the error in johnson was not an error that the district court should have known about at the time.it was the very opposite the district judge should have known that his ruling at the time he made it was not error and perhaps not even clairvoyance could have led him to hold to the contrary.khan state oil,registering disagreement with this court precedent while following it nonetheless state oil khan,approving of that approach.
rather,johnson makes clear that review is not a grading system for trial judges.it has broader purposes,including in part allowing courts of appeals better to identify those instances in which the application of a new rule of law to cases on appeal will meet the demands of fairness and judicial integrity.see johnson,at olano,at.
second,the government fears that our holding will lead to too many claims of plain error.brief for united states.after all,courts of appeals,not just the supreme court,clarify the law through their opinions.when a court of appeals does so,will not all defendants,including many who never objected in the court below,insist that the court of appeals now judge their cases according to the new rule and will plain error in such cases not then disappear,leaving only simple error in its stead 
the answer to this claim is that a new rule of law,set forth by an appellate court,can not automatically lead that court to consider all contrary determinations by trial courts plainly erroneous.many such new rules,as we have pointed out,concern matters of degree,not kind.and a lower court ruling about such matters say,the nature of a closing argument,even if now wrong in light of the new appellate holding,is not necessarily plainly wrong.the rule requirement that an error be plain means that lower court decisions that are questionable but not plainly wrong at time of trial or at time of appeal fall outside the rule scope.
and there are other reasons for concluding that our holding will not open any plain error floodgates.as we have said,the rule itself contains other screening criteria.the error must have affected the defendant substantial rights and it must have seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.olano,supra,at.when courts apply these latter criteria,the fact that a defendant did not object,despite unsettled law,may well count against the grant of rule b relief.moreover,the problem here arises only when there is a new rule of law,when the law was previously unsettled,and when the district court reached a decision contrary to the subsequent rule.these limitations may well explain the absence of any account before us of plain error inundation in those circuits that already follow the interpretation we now adopt.see,farrell,supra,at cordery,at united states garcia,united states ross.
finally,the government points out that rule b is written mostly in the past tense.it says that a plain error may be considered even though it was not brought to the court attention.emphasis added.this use of the past tense,the government argues,refers to a plain error that was not brought to the court attention back then,when the error occurred.and that linguistic fact,in turn,means that the error must have been plain at that time.brief for united states.
whatever the merits of this textual argument,however,johnson forecloses it.the error at issue in that case was not even an error,let alone plain,at the time when the defendant might have brought it to the court attention.nonetheless,we found the error to be plain error.we can not square the government textual argument with our holding in that case.
for these reasons,we conclude that whether a legal question was settled or unsettled at the time of trial,it is enough that an error be plain at the time of appellate consideration for t he second part of the olano test to be satisfied.johnson,supra,at.the contrary judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

when the law was unsettled at the time an error was committed,the error is not plain within the meaning of federal rule of criminal procedure b.to hold otherwise disregards the importance of claim preservation and deprives rule b plainness limitation of all conceivable purpose.
the court begins its analysis by misconceiving our task.we are here,it thinks,in order to resolve a supposed conflict between two competing legal principles,ante,at the principle that a legal right may be forfeited by the failure to assert it in a timely fashion,and the principle that an appellate court must apply the law in effect at the time of its judgment.to begin with,there is no such conflict.forfeiture rules establish exceptions to the legal rights that they qualify like all exceptions they do not conflict with what they modify but rather mark out its scope.and second,our task in this case is not the exalted philosophical one of deciding where justice lies.it is presumed rightly or not that congress has taken that into consideration in approving the rules of criminal procedure.ours,alas,is the more mundane and lawyerly task of deciding whether the rules of criminal procedure make the failure of timely objection an exception to the rule that an appellate court applies the law in effect at the time of its judgment.
having addressed itself to the wrong question,the court unsurprisingly gives the wrong answer.the correct answer must be sought in the text of the federal rules of criminal procedure,beginning with rule b,which provides a party may preserve a claim of error by informing the court when the court ruling or order is made or sought of the action the party wishes the court to take,or the party objection to the court action and the grounds for that objection.emphasis added.surely this means that a party does not preserve a claim of error can not assert that on appeal,whatever the law on the point may be unless he informs the court or objects to the court action when the ruling or order is made or sought.if it does not mean that,it means nothing.
we move then to rule b,which says a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the trial court attention.the meaning of that is not difficult to grasp.it is an exception to rule b rule of forfeiture an exception that applies only to plain error.the question before us is whether plainness means plainness at the time the trial court ruling or order is made or sought or plainness when the case reaches the court of appeals.
the answer to that question seems to me entirely clear.a rudimentary principle of textual interpretation so commonsensical that it scarcely needs citation is that if one interpretation of an ambiguous provision causes it to serve a purpose consistent with the entire text,and the other interpretation renders it pointless,the former prevails.limiting review of forfeited errors to those that were plain when the objection should have been made serves a purpose consistent with rule it permits reviewing courts to correct error where doing so will not thwart the objective of causing objections to be made when they can do some good.objection is not so much needed when the error ought to be plain to the court and to the prosecution.and the fault in overlooking such an error is not solely the defendant,but must be shared equally by the court and the prosecutor.we have affirmed this principle,and have affirmed the proposition that plainness is to be determined at the trial stage,in our prior opinions.by its terms,recourse may be had to rule b only on appeal from a trial infected with error so plain the trial judge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it,even absent the defendant timely assistance in detecting it.united states frady.where error at trial is plain,the rationale for penalizing forfeiture is at its weakest and the injustice to the defendant correspondingly strong.
the court,on the other hand,is unable to provide any purpose served by a plainness requirement applied when the case reaches the court of appeals.consider two defendants in the same circuit who fail to object to an identical error committed by the trial court under unsettled law.by happenstance,defendant a appeal is considered first.the court of appeals recognizes that there was error,but denies relief because the law was unclear up to the time of the court of appeals opinion.defendant b appeal is heard later,and he reaps the benefit of the opinion in defendant a case settling the law in his favor.what possible purpose is served by distinguishing between these two appellants the negligence in not raising the error is equivalent regardless of what happens by the time of appeal.united states,en banc smith,dissenting.since a doctrine of this sort can not possibly induce counsel to make contemporaneous objection,it seemingly has no purpose whatever except to create the above described anomaly.
no,that is not quite true.it does serve the purpose of enabling today opinion to say that the rule has been preserved,and has not been entirely converted to a rule.of course a rule all mistakes affecting substantial rights can be corrected on appeal would better serve the court mistaken understanding that the only purpose of rule b is fairness,ante,at combined with its erroneous perception that all defendants who fail to make a timely objection to misapplication of the law stand in the same boat,see ante,at.but a rule would be contrary to the clear text of rule b,which tempers rule b with fairness only when the error is plain.the court must find some application for the plainness requirement,even if it be one that is utterly pointless.it has done so.
the court contends that evaluating plainness at the level runs headlong into johnson united states.ante,at.the error there,it points out,was not an error that the district court should have known about at the time.ibid.johnson would have been decided the same way at whatever stage the plainness requirement was evaluated,since the court found that the error did not meet the final requirement of olano,that the forfeited error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.at i accept,however,that the court said in johnson,and will presumably hold in future cases,that in the situation presented by that case,plainness at the time of appeal will suffice.that was a situation in which the law was settled against the defendant at trial but became plain in his favor by the time of appeal.as to that narrow class of cases,a rule promotes both the fairness and efficiency concerns of rule b.when the law is settled against a defendant at trial he is not remiss for failing to bring his claim of error to the court attention.it would be futile.an objection would therefore disserve efficiency,and a rule would result in counsel inevitably making a long and virtually useless laundry list of objections to rulings that were plainly supported by existing precedent.at.in that unique context,a approach actually furthers the substantial interest in the orderly administration of justice that underlies the contemporaneous objection rule.united states david.
the court wrote in johnson a circumspect opinion that took pains to exclude from the method it articulated the case before us now.after agreeing with the petitioner that in the situation before the court a rule would impede rather than assist fairness and efficiency,the opinion said that in a case such as this where the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal it is enough that an error be plain at the time of appellate consideration.at.the limitation of the court opinion is clear.the concerns that justified evaluating plainness at the time of appeal in johnson cut against such a rule here,where the law was not clear but uncertain at the time of trial.in the difficult and often hectic process of conducting a trial,a judge depends on the parties officers of the court to flag issues that might otherwise escape his notice.a prompt claim of error in those circumstances is not futile but eminently useful.
the court hypothesizes three defendants failing to object at trial to a ruling that later before the case reaches the court of appeals is shown by a supreme court opinion to have been error one tried in a circuit whose law at the time clearly accorded with the supreme court holding,one tried in a circuit whose law clearly contradicted that holding,and one tried in a circuit whose law on the point was uncertain.ante,at.these defendants,the court asserts,are similarly situated,and the rule appropriately treats them alike.but they are not similarly situated insofar as the purposes of rules b and b are concerned,and treating them alike frustrates those purposes.where the circuit law clearly accorded with the supreme court later opinion,the trial court should have known that law,and hence the raising of the point by counsel should not have been needed this is the classic case for reversal on appeal.where the circuit law clearly contradicted the later supreme court opinion,again the trial court should have known that law,and counsel raising the point would be futile and wasteful rather than sparing of judicial resources this is the classic case for johnson reversal on appeal.where the circuit law was unsettled,the trial court was most in need of counsel assistance,and the failure to provide it has no excuse this is the classic case for normal application of the requirement of rule b.to be sure,these litigants are alike in that all three suffered from legal error,ante,at and if the sole,unqualified objective of appellate review were to correct error that would suffice to entitle them to equal treatment.until today,however,the objective of correcting error has been qualified by the objective of inducing counsel to bring forward claims of error when they can be remedied without overturning a verdict and setting the convicted criminal defendant free.to overlook counsel failure to object,spend judicial resources to conduct review,and set aside a criminal conviction where retrial may be difficult if not impossible,is exactly the extravagant protection that this court has up until now disavowed.united states young,quoting henderson kibbe,in turn quoting namet united states.
the court sees no harm in its evisceration of the rule,disbelieving that a lawyer would deliberately forgo objection now because he perceives some slightly expanded chance to argue for plain error later,ante,at.it is hard to say whether this conclusion springs from a touching faith in the good sportsmanship of criminal defense counsel or an unkind disparagement of their intelligence.where a criminal case always has been,or has at trial been shown to be,a sure loser with the jury,it makes entire sense to stand silent while the court makes a mistake that may be the basis for undoing the conviction.the thought that counsel will not deliberately forgo objection is not a delusion that this court has hitherto indulged,worrying as it has in an opinion joined by the author of today opinion about counsel sandbagging the court by remaining silent about his objection and belatedly raising the error only if the case does not conclude in his favor.puckett united states.in any event,sandbagging is not the only evil to be feared.what is to be feared even more is a lessening of counsel diligent efforts to identify uncertain points of law and bring them or rather the defendant version of them to the court attention,so that error will never occur.it is remarkably naïve to disbelieve the proposition that lessening the costs of noncompliance with rule b diminishes the incentives to be diligent in objecting.see meltzer,state court forfeitures of federal rights,harv.meant to apply only in exceptional circumstances,united states atkinson,rule b today has been transformed into an around the consequences of claim forfeiture.
the court final argument,that a rule would wor k practical administrative harm,ante,at,is even more peculiar than the rest of its opinion.whatever administrative ease may flow from a rule and more on that in a moment it is outweighed by lower ing the bar for review,which will undoubtedly result in more remands and new trials.at smith,dissenting.the court pollyannaish rejoinder is that few reversals will occur anyway because a defendant must still show that the error affected his substantial rights olano prong and seriously affected the fairness of judicial proceedings olano prong,ante,at.i doubt that.many hitherto forfeited claims may incorrectly be found to meet those vague requirements.and all claims whether found to meet them or not will have to be evaluated under those vague standards,requiring intensive consideration and producing a judgment whose correctness is often difficult to assess.
as for the court belief that it is difficult to assess whether error was plain at the time of trial it is really not that hard.appellate courts regularly conduct that type of inquiry in other areas of law.for example,in the context of federal habeas corpus review under d relief may not be granted to a state prisoner based on a legal error unless that error was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as of the time the state court render ed its decision,cullen pinholster,slip,at.similarly,we determine whether public officials have immunity based on what law was clearly established at the time of their acts.see harlow fitzgerald.the court offers us no reason to believe the inquiry would be any more difficult in this context.
in any event,a rule for assessing plainness does not eliminate the need to assess plainness.and contrary to the court belief,that need
