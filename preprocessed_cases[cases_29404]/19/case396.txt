in this appeal,john analetto brings three challenges to his conviction,under,for knowingly participating in the use of extortionate means to collect or attempt to collect an extension of credit.we reject each one of analetto challenges and affirm the conviction.
after a jury trial,analetto,a former massachusetts state trooper,was convicted of using extortionate means to attempt to collect an extension of credit arising out of a gambling debt from a man named christopher twombly.see making it a crime to knowingly participate in any way,or conspire to do so,in the use of any extortionate means to collect or attempt to collect any extension of credit.the prosecution put on evidence to show that analetto had made an implicit threat of violence to twombly in a voicemail that he left on twombly phone on december.see defining extortionate means as any means which involves the use,or an express or implicit threat of use,of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person,reputation,or property of any person.
analetto first contends that the conviction must be set aside because the district court chose the wrong remedy for the prosecution discrimination in the use of peremptory challenges during jury selection.see alabama ex rel,d holding that gender,like race,is an unconstitutional proxy for juror competence and impartiality batson kentucky,d setting out the general rule that a defendant has the right to be tried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to nondiscriminatory criteria.analetto next contends that the conviction must be reversed because the evidence at trial was insufficient to support a finding that his voicemail message conveyed an implicit threat of violence and because the government failed to put on any other evidence that could suffice to prove that he had done so.and,finally,analetto challenges the district court refusal to instruct the jury regarding whether analetto specifically intended to cause fear in twombly and whether analetto was too intoxicated at the time he left the voicemail message to have had such a specific intent.
we consider analetto challenges in this order.
analetto batson challenge targets only the remedy that the district court used to cure the prosecution,discriminatory use of peremptory challenges during jury selection.the district court imposed a remedy following an objection that analetto lodged after the prosecution attempted to use its eighth peremptory strike against a male juror juror number.that remedy was to seat juror number and to prohibit the prosecution from further exercising peremptory strikes against male jurors.analetto contends that remedy was too limited.
the key premise on which analetto challenge rests is that the district court found the prosecution had violated batson not only in exercising a peremptory strike against juror number,but also in using peremptory strikes against seven other male jurors earlier in the selection proceedings.from that premise,analetto contends that the district court was required to cure the batson violation that it found either by seating all eight male jurors that the prosecution had peremptorily struck or by redoing jury selection with an entirely new venire 
a review of the record shows,however,that analetto challenge to the district court batson remedy rests on a mistaken premise.the district court finding of discrimination related only to the prosecution use of a peremptory challenge against juror number and not to the prosecution use of peremptory challenges against the seven other male jurors that the prosecution had struck earlier.
the record makes that more limited scope of the district court batson finding quite clear.the district court announced that it was imposing a remedy only in response to the objection by defense counsel to the prosecution attempt to peremptorily strike juror number,who was a male.in finding that strike impermissibly,the district court stated the objection is sustained e very government strike has been a male,and i think that i not persuaded by the explanation i wo allow you to strike him.
the explanation to which the district court referred was the one that the prosecutor gave in her attempt to justify the challenge of juror number.the prosecutor offered that explanation after defense counsel had argued that juror number in particular was unworthy of the strike,because o f all jurors,this guy has to be the one who worn all the hats,who got to be the most fair and impartial of all of them the prosecutor responded that the prosecution took a different view of the impression that the juror gave at sidebar and that she was concerned that the juror has had experience in the court system.
thus,in rejecting the prosecutor explanation for striking the juror,the district court found only that the prosecution had failed to explain how its decision to strike juror number in particular was based on anything other than that juror gender.no broader finding of discrimination in the prosecution use of other strikes was made.
in lodging the batson challenge to the prosecution attempt to strike juror number,analetto counsel did refer to the prosecution prior striking of seven male jurors.but,in context,that reference to the prosecution prior conduct is reasonably understood,not as a batson challenge to each of the prosecution seven prior strikes of male jurors,but only as support for the contention that gender discrimination explained the prosecution eighth strike given the prosecution lack of any other reasonable explanation for it.see sanchez roden,cir d emonstrating a pattern of strikes against members of a cognizable group may raise an inference of discrimination against a particular juror.thus,one can not infer from the nature of analetto counsel objection to the striking of juror number that the district court,in ruling in defense counsel favor,must have been making the more sweeping finding of discrimination that analetto contends it made 
consistent with the conclusion that the district court made a narrowly tailored finding of discrimination in response to a narrowly tailored objection,analetto never raised any further objection or asked for clarification after the district court sustained the objection and announced its limited remedy.rather,when faced with a remedy that did not purport to address the striking of the seven other male jurors,defense counsel affirmatively stated he was content with the jury 
the district court did,in addition to requiring the seating of juror number,impose a partially prospective remedy.that aspect of the remedy banned the prosecution from striking any male jurors in the future while seating the eighth juror.but the part of the district court remedy does not itself suffice to show that the district court must have implicitly found that the seven previously challenged male jurors also had been struck in violation of batson.in fact,the district court at no point asked the government for an explanation of why it had struck any of those seven jurors.we therefore decline to presume that the district court made a sweeping,but utterly unsupported,finding of discrimination as to the other seven challenged male jurors when the record supports a far more reasonable conclusion the district court found discrimination only in connection with the striking of juror number.
because the district court found discrimination only with respect to the government attempt to strike juror number,the district court chosen remedy disallow ing the discriminatory challenge and resum ing selection with the improperly challenged jurors reinstated on the venire,while also barring the government from challenging another male can not be said to have been inadequate under batson.see batson,at we thus reject analetto challenge to his conviction.
analetto also challenges the district court denial of his rule motion for acquittal based on insufficiency of evidence.he contends the district court erred in denying the motion because the evidence at trial did not support the government theory that he made an implicit threat of violence within the meaning of.
under the statute,the government must show that there was evi
