stage setting 
brian mulkern pled guilty to a federal charge of possessing ammunition as a felon.see g.normally the max prison sentence for an felon is years.see a.but under the armed career criminal act acca,for short,a felon with three or more prior convictions for violent felon ies or serious drug offense s carried out on occasions different from one another must get at least years.see id.e.in addition to two concededly maine burglary convictions,mulkern has a maine robbery conviction and a maine conviction on his record.so when it came time for sentencing,the government argued for an acca enhancement.mulkern argued against it,unsurprisingly.but siding with the government,the judge sentenced him to the statutory minimum of years in jail.
mulkern now appeals.and having reviewed the matter afresh we now vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.we will explain our thinking shortly right after a quick tutorial on some rules.
as just noted,acca requires mandatory sentences for recidivist criminals with three or more convictions for crimes committed on different occasions that qualify as predicate offenses.the government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant stands convicted of a particular crime.see united states murdock,cir.and whether that crime is an offense is ultimately a legal question subject to de novo review.see,united states hudson,cir,cert.denied.
one type of offense is a violent felony,relevantly defined as any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.e b i.the phrase physical force means force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.johnson united states johnson i.
the other type of offense is a serious drug offense,pertinently defined as an offense under state law,involving manufacturing,distributing,or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute,a controlled substance,for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.e a ii.the word involving helps acca capture more offenses than just those that are in fact the manufacture,distribution,or possession of,with intent to distribute,a controlled substance,thanks to involving,the statute captures offenses that are related to or connected with such conduct as well.see united states mckenney,cir.quoting united states king,cir.see also whindleton,at.
our judicial superiors have devised two ways for deciding whether a defendant prior conviction satisfies acca the categorical approach and the approach.bear with us,because explaining these approaches is no walk in the park.
under the categorical approach,the court assumes that the state statute of conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of th e acts criminalized.see moncrieffe holder,quoting johnson i,at.the court then compares the state statute of conviction elements to acca definitions of violent felony or serious drug offense.mathis united states.and if there is a match,the state conviction is an acca predicate.see id.citing,among other things,taylor united states.
this comparison is difficult enough when the state statute lists a single,indivisible body of elements to define a single crime.see id.but some state statutes,divisible statutes lay out elements in the alternative,and thereby define multiple crimes,making the comparison of elements harder still.see id.at.in that situation,courts employ the approach.see id.under that method,the court looks beyond the statute of conviction to a narrow class of documents for example,the indictment,jury instructions,or plea agreement and colloquy known as shepard documents to determine what crime,with what elements,a defendant was convicted of.id.citing shepard united states.the court can then compare that crime,as the categorical approach commands,with the pertinent acca definitions to see if the state conviction is acca eligible.see id 
with these principles in place,we turn to whether mulkern maine robbery and convictions trigger the acca bump up.fyi as the combatants correctly agree,mulkern convictions rest on divisible statutes.so we as do the parties apply the approach to this case.
mulkern robbery conviction 
the maine statute 
at the time mulkern pled guilty to robbery in,the maine legislature defined the crime as follows 
a person is guilty of robbery if he commits or attempts to commit theft and at the time of his actions 
a.he recklessly inflicts bodily injury on another 
b.he threatens to use force against any person present with the intent 
to prevent or overcome resistance to the taking of the property,or to the retention of the property immediately after the taking or 
to compel the person in control of the property to give it up or to engage in other conduct which aids in the taking or carrying away of the property 
c.he uses physical force on another with the intent enumerated in paragraph b,subparagraphs or 
d.he intentionally inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily injury on another or 
e.he or an accomplice to his knowledge is armed with a dangerous weapon in the course of a robbery as defined in paragraphs a through 
me.stat.tit.according to the statutes in effect in,violations of subparts a and b constituted class b crimes punishable by up to years in prison,while violations of subparts c,d,and e constituted class a crimes punishable by up to years in prison.see id,a b.
the parties arguments 
the parties begin on common ground,agreeing that the relevant count in the maine court indictment alleged the following 
o n or about july,in pownal,cumberland county,maine,brian mulkern did attempt to commit theft by attempting to exercise unauthorized control over the property of the short stop store named victim,namely money,and at the time of his actions he threatened to use force against named victim with intent to compel her to give up the money,and he was armed with a dangerous weapon during the course of the robbery.
the indictment cover sheet listed section e as the charged offense,recording it as a class a crime.someone crossed out the a in class a crime and replaced it with a b,though this alteration is not signed or dated.someone also crossed out and he was armed with a dangerous weapon during the course of the robbery and section e and signed and dated the area the signature is illegible,and the parties do not tell who did this.without mentioning a subpart,the judgment form has a handwritten note that listed section as the offense of conviction,recording it as a class b crime though the state docket sheet lists section a as the offense of conviction.
now to the key points of contention between the parties 
insisting that he ultimately pled guilty to section b,mulkern principally relies on raymond state,a maine case holding that any physical force,pulling a purse from a person hand is sufficient force to convict of robbery.see,me.discussing,among other things,commonwealth jones.in other words,a de minimis amount of force,mulkern writes,suffices to raise a crime of theft to one of robbery.ergo,his theory concludes,robbery under maine law is not a violent felony after johnson i because section b does not require the use of force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another.see at.raymond dealt with robbery under section c,not section b.see at.but mulkern argument appears to be that robbery under section b which requires a threat to use force must mean a threat to use the same amount of force required for section c.
hold on,says the government mulkern actually pled guilty to section c indeed,the government at oral argument adamantly opposed the notion that he had pled guilty to anything else.and as the government sees it,because section c requires the use of physical force a quote lifted from the statute,a violation of that provision amounts to an acca felony a quote lifted from its brief.the government then talks up jones,a massachusetts case mentioned in raymond.jones noted that under the commonwealth statutes,as at common law,in order to sustain a charge of robbery,there must be proof of a larceny from the person,and by force and violence,or by assault and putting in fear.at alteration in original footnote omitted quoting.laws ch.looking to parry mulkern argument,the government again quotes the massachusetts high court in jones 
snatching necessarily involves the exercise of some actual force.w e hold that,where,as here,the actual force used is sufficient to produce awareness,although the action may be so swift as to leave the victim momentarily in a dazed condition,the requisite degree of force is present to make the crime robbery.
id.at.and,says the government,because robbery requires actual force,robbery in violation of maine law has as an element force and violence sufficient for purposes of johnson 
we need not resolve the parties dispute over which subpart of the robbery statute mulkern pled guilty to violating section b or section c and we take this tack because,even assuming as the government urges that he pled guilty to infracting section c,we believe his robbery conviction can not be an acca predicate.our reasoning is simple.
section c,to repeat,criminalizes the use of physical force on another with the intent either to prevent or overcome resistance to the taking of the property or to compel the person in control of the property to give it up.raymond,at quoting me.stat.tit,c see generally johnson i,at stressing that,in deciding whether a state conviction is a violent felony under acca,federal courts are bound by the state supreme court interpretation of state law,including its determination of the elements of the statute of conviction.maine highest court recognizes that any physical force suffices to satisfy the physical force element in section c.see raymond,at.so,for example,the mere act of snatching a purse from the hand of a victim is thus a sufficient act of physical force required for robbery,even if the robber never made direct bodily contact with the victim.id.at,see also state rembert,me.
now we must compare section c elements to the definition of violent felony in acca force clause,keeping in mind that for a crime to be an acca violent felony,it must involve physical force,which means violent force that is,force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.see johnson i,at.true,as the government notes,section c talks about physical force.but again and we apologize for the repetition in defining that element,maine top court proclaimed that any physical force with the required intent is enough to raise the offense to the level of robbery.see raymond,at.the word any is a powerful beacon to us here,making clear that the crime does not require a showing of force capable of causing physical pain or injury something short of that will do.given raymond,mulkern robbery conviction is not a violent felony for acca purposes.
and the government argument about massachusetts law does not alter this conclusion.whatever the exact state of massachusetts law may be and we express no opinion here on that matter zero,none,zip raymond,as we said,is the beacon by which we steer our course.and raymond,as we have been at pains to explain,held that any physical force with the specified intent elevates the crime to robbery,see at a holding that compels us to hold that mulkern robbery conviction can not be an acca predicate.
the net result is that mulkern conviction can not provide the third predicate offense necessary to uphold his acca sentence so now we must see if his conviction can a task we turn to in the next part of this opinion.
mulkern conviction 
the maine statute 
everyone agrees that shepard documents show mulkern pled guilty in maine state court to trafficking in grams or more of heroin in.under the version of the statute to which he pled guilty titled unlawful trafficking in scheduled drugs a person is guilty of unlawful trafficking in a scheduled drug if the person intentionally or knowingly trafficks in what the person knows or believes to be a scheduled drug,which is in fact a scheduled drug.see me.stat.tit,emphases added.the statute defines traffick this way 
to make,create,manufacture 
to grow or cultivate,except for marijuana 
to sell,barter,trade,exchange or otherwise furnish for consideration 
to possess with the intent to do any act mentioned in paragraph c or 
to possess grams or more of heroin or or more individual bags,folds,packages,envelopes or containers of any kind containing heroin.
id.if the drug trafficked is a schedule w drug which heroin,then statutorily defined as any compound,mixture,or preparation containing heroin,unquestionably is then a violation of this statute is a class b crime.see id.a,i.and a class b crime carries a max penalty of years in jail.see id.b.
the parties arguments 
mulkern argument for why this conviction is not a countable acca predicate is straightforward enough.as he sees things,he did not pled guilty to a serious drug crime defined for our purposes remember as involving possession of a controlled substance with intent to manufacture or distribute.and he quickly adds that the pertinent trafficking statute dealing with the grams or more of heroin criminalizes possession with no intent to manufacture or distribute.all that is required,he says,is that the possessor possessed the requisite amount of heroin and nothing in the shepard documents,he writes,shows he pled guilty to intending to manufacture or distribute heroin either.
stressing that we must interpret involving expansively,see whindleton,at,the government counters that the statute of conviction need not match up word for word with acca definitions to qualify as a serious drug offense.so,the government writes,it is of no moment that the state statute here does not require proof of intent to distribute what matters is whether the offense involv es in acca lingo possess ion with intent to distribute.
building on this foundation,the government then argues that we must conclude that mulkern trafficking conviction involv ed an intent to distribute.it offers two reasons why.the first reason turns on the trafficking name maine legislature used for the statute trafficking is synonymous with distribution,the government suggests,so from the legislature trafficking label we can infer that mulkern crime here involv es the required distributive intent.the second reason turns on the statute saying that or more grams of heroin can support a conviction relying chiefly on eleventh circuit case law,the government implies that this drug amount justifies the inference that mulkern possessed the heroin with intent to distribute,rather than for his personal use.see united states james,cir.inferring intent to distribute from the defendant copping to trafficking in cocaine by possess ing between and grams of the drug,overruled on other grounds by johnson ii.
not about to go down without a fight,mulkern argues that reading involving broadly helps the government not a whit because it would stretch that word beyond its breaking point to hold that a state conviction for trafficking by possession alone,possession without intent to distribute is a conviction involving possession with intent to distribute.and he highlights fourth circuit caselaw to support the idea that one can not infer that he had the requisite intent either from maine designating the crime as trafficking or from the small amount of heroin in play.see united states brandon,cir.emphasizing that,per taylor,an acca enhancement appl ies to those who have engaged in certain specific conduct,regardless of the label attached to that conduct by state law,and concluding that because we can not say that intent to manufacture or distribute is inherent in the class of conduct banned by the statute and alleged in the indictment at issue in this case possession of between and two hundred grams of cocaine,the defendant state conviction was not an acca serious drug offense.
as we said many pages ago,acca pertinently defines violent felony as a felony that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force.see e b i emphases added.contrastingly,acca relevantly defines serious drug offense as crimes involving possess ion with intent to distribute.id.e a ii emphases added.the
