respondents and burgess each carried a firearm during an attempted robbery.count three of their indictment charged them with using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence,which carries a mandatory minimum prison term.c a i.count four alleged use of a machinegun here,a pistol that authorities believed operated as a fully automatic firearm in furtherance of that crime,which carries a mandatory minimum term.c b ii.the government moved to dismiss the fourth count on the basis that it could not establish the count beyond a reasonable doubt,but it maintained that c b ii machinegun provision was a sentencing enhancement to be determined by the district court upon a conviction on count three.the court dismissed count four and rejected the government position.respondents then pleaded guilty to the remaining counts.the court sentenced to a term and burgess to an term for their c convictions.in affirming the district court c b ii ruling,the first circuit looked primarily to castillo united states,which held that the machinegun provision in an earlier version of c constituted an element of an offense,not a sentencing factor.the court found that castillo was close to binding,absent clearer or more dramatic changes than those made by congress amendment of c or a clearer legislative history.
held the fact that a firearm was a machinegun is an element to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt,not a sentencing factor to be proved to the judge at sentencing.
a generally,a fact that increase s the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed is an element of a crime,apprendi new jersey,to be charged in an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,hamling united states,rather than proved to a judge at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence,mcmillan pennsylvania.subject to this constitutional constraint,congress determines whether a factor is an element or a sentencing factor.when congress is not explicit,courts look to a statute provisions and framework for guidance.analysis of the current machinegun provision begins with castillo,where the court found the bare language of prior version neutral,at,but ruled that four factors language and structure,tradition,risk of unfairness,and severity of the sentence favored treating the machinegun provision as an element of an offense,at while a fifth factor legislative history did not favor either side,ibid.
b as relevant here,the amendment divided what was once a lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs.thus,with regard to the first castillo factor,the court observation that congress placed the element uses or carries a firearm and the word machinegun in a single sentence,not broken up with dashes or separated into subsections,at,no longer holds true.however,the amendment did not affect the second through fifth castillo factors.each of them,except for legislative history which remains relatively silent,continues to favor treating the machinegun provision as an element.the amendment effect on the language and structure factor requires closer examination.
c given the court determination in castillo that the machinegun provision in prior version is an element,a substantive change in the statute should not be inferred a bsent a clear indication from congress of a change in policy,grogan garner.nothing in the amendment indicates such a change.there are three principal differences between the previous and current c.the first,a substantive change,shifts what were once mandatory and sentences to mandatory minimum sentences.the second,also substantive made in direct response to the holding in bailey united states,that uses or carries in preamendment version connotes more than mere possession,at adds possesses to the uses or carries language in c principal paragraph and provides sentencing enhancements for brandishing or discharging the firearm,c a ii and iii,which do state sentencing factors,harris united states.neither of these substantive changes suggests that congress meant to transform the machinegun provision from an element into a sentencing factor.the third difference is the machinegun provision relocation from the principal paragraph that unmistakably lists offense elements to a separate subsection,c b,but this structural or stylistic change provides no clear indication that congress meant to alter its treatment of machineguns as an offense element.a more logical explanation is that the restructuring was intended to break up a lengthy principal paragraph,which exceeded words,into a more readable statute,which is in step with current legislative drafting guidelines.while this court has recognized that placing factors in separate subsections is one way congress might signal that it is treating them as sentencing factors rather than elements,castillo,supra,at,it has rejected the view that such a structural consideration predominates even when other factors point in the other direction,harris,supra,at.the current structure of c is more favorable to treating the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor than was true in castillo,particularly because the machinegun provision is now positioned between the sentencing factors provided in a ii and iii and those in c i and ii.this structural point is overcome by the substantial weight of the other castillo factors and the principle that congress would not enact so significant a change without a clear indication of its purpose to do so.
kennedy,delivered the opinion of the court,in which roberts,and stevens,scalia,ginsburg,breyer,alito,and sotomayor,joined.stevens,filed a concurring opinion.thomas,filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.
united states,petitioner martin and arthur burgess 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court.
the court must interpret,once again,c of title of the united states code.this provision prohibits the use or carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,or the possession of a firearm in furtherance of such crimes.c a.a violation of the statute carries a mandatory minimum term of five years imprisonment,c a i but if the firearm is a machinegun,the statute requires a mandatory minimum sentence,c b ii.whether a firearm was used,carried,or possessed is,as all concede,an element of the offense.at issue here is whether the fact that the firearm was a machinegun is an element to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt or a sentencing factor to be proved to the judge at sentencing.
in an earlier case the court determined that an analogous machinegun provision in a previous version of constituted an element of an offense to be proved to the jury.castillo united states.the castillo decision,however,addressed the statute as it existed before congressional amendments made in.and in a case after castillo,the brandishing provision in the version of was held to provide a sentencing factor,not an element of the offense.harris united states.in light of the amendments and the harris decision,the question of how to interpret machinegun provision is considered once more in the instant case.
on june,respondents martin and arthur burgess attempted to rob an armored car making a scheduled delivery of cash to a bank.along with a third collaborator,respondents hid in a minivan and waited for the armored car to make its stop.each of the men carried a firearm.containing nearly million and attended by two guards,the armored car arrived.a guard began to unload boxes of coins.the three men came out of the van and,while one of them brandished his weapon,they ordered the guards to get on the ground.one guard did so,but the other ran to a nearby restaurant.the respondents abandoned the robbery and fled without taking any money.no shots were fired,and no one was injured.
authorities apprehended respondents and recovered the three firearms used during the attempted robbery.the firearms were a semiautomatic pistol,an semiautomatic rifle,and a cobray pistol.the cobray pistol had been manufactured as,and had the external appearance of,a semiautomatic firearm.according to the federal bureau of investigation,though,it operated as a fully automatic weapon,apparently due to some alteration of its original firing mechanism.respondents dispute whether the cobray in fact did operate as a fully automatic weapon.
respondents were indicted on multiple counts.relevant here are counts three and four,both of which charged offenses under c.count three charged respondents with using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence,which carries a statutory minimum of five years imprisonment.count four charged respondents in more specific terms,alleging use of a machinegun the cobray in furtherance of a crime of violence,as proscribed by c a and b ii.the latter provision mandates a minimum sentence of years imprisonment.
the government moved to dismiss count four on the basis that it would be unable to establish the count beyond a reasonable doubt.the issues in the present case do not require the court to consider any contention that a defendant who uses,carries,or possesses a firearm must be aware of the weapon characteristics.this opinion expresses no views on the point.
the government then maintained that the machinegun provision in c b ii was a sentencing factor,so that,if respondents were convicted of carrying a firearm under count three,the court could determine at sentencing that the particular firearm was a machinegun,thus activating the mandatory minimum.the district court dismissed count four,as the government requested,but rejected the government position that the machinegun provision was a sentencing enhancement to be determined by the court at sentencing once there was a conviction on count three.it ruled that the machinegun provision states an element of a crime.thus,to invoke the minimum sentence,the government was required to charge in the indictment,and then prove to the jury,that the cobray was a machinegun.
at this point,after the district court foreclosed the possibility of respondents facing a minimum,respondents pleaded guilty to the remaining counts,including count three.the district court sentenced to a term for his c conviction,to run consecutively with his sentence on two other counts.it sentenced burgess to an term for his c conviction,also to run consecutively to his sentence on the other charges.the government appealed the district court ruling that the machinegun provision constitutes an element of an offense instead of a sentencing factor.
the united states court of appeals for the first circuit affirmed.it looked primarily to castillo,which held that the machinegun provision in an earlier version of c constituted an element of an offense,not a sentencing factor.the court noted that the statute under consideration in castillo had been revised by congress,break ing what was a single sentence into subparagraphs,and it acknowledged that the earlier repealed version of the statute was slightly more favorable to the respondents than the current version,but not markedly so.it found no evidence that the breaking up of the sentence into the present subdivisions or recasting of language was anything more than a current trend probably for ease of reading to convert lengthy sentences in criminal statutes into subsections in the fashion of the tax code.at.the court concluded absent a clearer or more dramatic change in language or legislative history expressing a specific intent to assign judge or jury functions,we think that castillo is close to binding,and any reconsideration of the issue should be left to this court.see also rodriguez de quijas express,if a precedent of this court has direct application in a case,yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,the court of appeals should follow the case which directly controls,leaving to this court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions 
we granted certiorari.
elements of a crime must be charged in an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.hamling united states,jones united states.sentencing factors,on the other hand,can be proved to a judge at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence.see mcmillan pennsylvania.though one exception has been established,see united states,i t is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.apprendi new jersey,quoting jones,supra,at stevens,concurring.in other words,while sentencing factors may guide or confine a judge discretion in sentencing an offender within the range prescribed by statute,apprendi,supra,at,sentencing factors can not increase the maximum sentence a defendant might otherwise receive based purely on the facts found by the jury.
subject to this constitutional constraint,whether a given fact is an element of the crime itself or a sentencing factor is a question for congress.when congress is not explicit,as is often the case because it seldom directly addresses the distinction between sentencing factors and elements,courts look to the provisions and the framework of the statute to determine whether a fact is an element or a sentencing factor,supra,at.in examining whether the machinegun provision in is an element or a sentencing factor,the analysis must begin with this court previous examination of the question in castillo.
in castillo,the court considered a prior version of,which provided 
c whoever,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,uses or carries a firearm,shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,be sentenced to imprisonment for five years,and if the firearm is a rifle or a shotgun to imprisonment for ten years,and if the firearm is a machinegun,or a destructive device,or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler,to imprisonment for thirty years.c,supp.v.
in determining whether the machinegun provision in the version of constituted an element or a sentencing factor,the court in castillo observed that the bare statutory language was neutral.at.it examined five factors directed at determining congressional intent language and structure,tradition,risk of unfairness,severity of the sentence,and legislative history,at.the court unanimously concluded that the machinegun provision provided an element of an offense,noting that the first four factors favored treating it as such while legislative history did not significantly favor either side.ibid.
section c was amended to its current form in.
the amendment had been enacted when the court considered castillo,supra,at,but the version of the statute was at issue there.the instant case concerns the and current version of the statute,which provides 
a except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law,any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm,shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime i be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years ii if the firearm is brandished,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years and iii if the firearm is discharged,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years.b if the firearm possessed by a person convicted of a violation of this subsection i is a rifle,shotgun,or semiautomatic assault weapon,the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years or ii is a machinegun or a destructive device,or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler,the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years.c ed.
the amendment did make substantive changes to the statute,to be discussed below but for purposes of the present case the most apparent effect of the amendment was to divide what was once a lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs.this court observation in considering the first castillo factor,that congress placed the element uses or carries a firearm and the word machinegun in a single sentence,not broken up with dashes or separated into subsections,at,no longer holds true.aside from this new structure,however,the amendment of did nothing to affect the second through fifth castillo factors.each of the factors,except for legislative history which,assuming its relevance,remains relatively silent,continues to favor the conclusion that the machinegun provision is an element of an offense.
legal tradition and past congressional practice are the second castillo factor.the factor is to be consulted when,as here,a statute text is unclear as to whether certain facts constitute elements or sentencing factors.sentencing factors traditionally involve characteristics of the offender such as recidivism,cooperation with law enforcement,or acceptance of responsibility,at.characteristics of the offense itself are traditionally treated as elements,and the use of a machinegun under c lies closest to the heart of the crime at issue.at.this is no less true today than it was years ago in castillo.unsurprisingly,firearm type is treated as an element in a number of statutes,as numerous gun crimes make substantive distinctions between weapons such as pistols and machineguns.see,a,b,and o.
the government counters that this tradition or pattern has evolved since the version of c under review in castillo was enacted.the government contends that the federal sentencing guidelines altered the tradition by treating the possession of a firearm as a sentencing factor.brief for united states citing united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual a raising base offense level if the offense involved a firearm 
the argument is not persuasive.the sentencing reform act of,stat,establishing the federal sentencing guidelines,was enacted four years before the version of under review in castillo,see abuse act of,stat.while the resulting guidelines were not effective until,this was still before the enactment of the statute at issue in castillo,and years before this court conclusion in castillo that firearm type is traditionally treated as an offense element.the government can not claim the benefit of any shift in how the law traditionally treats firearm type from the guidelines,for that supposed shift would have occurred before the version of was enacted.the guidelines were explicitly taken into account when this court analyzed the traditions in castillo,at discussing federal sentencing guidelines in determining what traditionally qualifies as a sentencing factor.
the third castillo factor,potential unfairness,was unchanged by the restructuring of.the court explained in castillo that treating the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor might unnecessarily produce a conflict between the judge and the jury because a jury may well have to decide which of several weapons a defendant used,at.the concern was that the judge may not know which weapon the jurors determined a defendant used,and a judge later,decision that the defendant used the machinegun,rather than,say,the pistol,might conflict with the jury belief that he actively used the pistol.ibid.this same concern arises under the current version of,where jurors might have to determine which among several weapons a defendant used,carried,or possessed in furtherance of a crime.
the government response,that permitting a judge to make this finding would streamlin e proceedings,without interfering with the accuracy of,brief for united states,is unconvincing.it does not address the particular unfairness concern expressed in castillo,which was not alleviated by the restructuring of.and the government does not suggest that it would be subjected to any unfairness if the machinegun provision continues to be treated as an element.
the fourth castillo factor,the severity of the sentence accompanying a finding that a defendant carried a machinegun under,was also unaffected by the statute restructuring.a finding that a defendant carried a machinegun under,in contrast to some less dangerous firearm,vaults a defendant mandatory minimum sentence from to years,castillo,supra,at,or from to years if,as in this case,the firearm was brandished,c a ii.this is not akin to the incremental changes in the minimum that one would expect to see in provisions meant to identify matters for the sentencing judge consideration,harris,at from years to years it is a drastic,sixfold increase that strongly suggests a separate substantive crime.
there is one substantive difference between the old and new versions of that might bear on this fourth factor.the previous version of provided mandatory sentences years for using or carrying a firearm and years if the firearm is a machinegun,for example.see c,supp.v.the current statute provides only mandatory minimums not less than years for using or possessing a firearm not less than for brandishing it and not less than if the firearm is a machinegun.c a i,a ii,b ii.the government argues that this difference is critical because a sentence is conceivable under the statute even without a finding that the particular weapon is a machinegun.brief for united states.
this is a distinction in theory,perhaps,but not in practice.neither the government nor any party or amicus has identified a single defendant whose conviction under for possessing or brandishing a nonspecific firearm led to a sentence approaching the sentence that is required when the firearm is a machinegun.respondents advise,without refutation,that most courts impose the mandatory minimum of years imprisonment for brandishing a nonspecific weapon and the longest sentence that has come to the litigants or the court attention is years.brief for respondent,citing united states batts,fed.appx.per curiam see also harris,supra,at thomas,dissenting.indeed,in the instant case,burgess received the statutory minimum sentence,and received only months more than that.once the machinegun enhancement was off the table,the government itself did not seek anything approaching terms,instead requesting terms for each respondent.
the immense danger posed by machineguns,the moral depravity in choosing the weapon,and the substantial increase in the minimum sentence provided by the statute support the conclusion that this prohibition is an element of the crime,not a sentencing factor.it is not likely that congress intended to remove the indictment and jury trial protections when it provided for such an extreme sentencing increase.see jones,at it is at best questionable whether the specification of facts sufficient to increase a penalty range by,let alone from years to life,was meant to carry none of the process safeguards that elements of an offense bring with them for a defendant benefit perhaps congress was not concerned with parsing the distinction between elements and sentencing factors,a matter more often discussed by the courts when discussing the proper allocation of functions between judge and jury.instead,it likely was more focused on deterring the crime by creating the mandatory minimum sentences.but the severity of the increase in this case counsels in favor of finding that the prohibition is an element,at least absent some clear congressional indication to the contrary.
the fifth factor considered in castillo was legislative history,and the court there found it to be of little help,at insofar as this history may be relevant,however,it does not significantly help the government the amendment has its own legislative record,discussed below,but the parties accurately observe that it is silent as to congressional consideration of the distinction between elements and sentencing factors.brief for united states brief for respondent.this silence is not neutral,however,because as explained below,it tends to counsel against finding that congress made a substantive change to this statutory provision.
four of the five factors the court relied upon in castillo point in the same direction they did years ago.how the amendment affects the remaining factor the provision language and structure requires closer examination.
in castillo,the court interpreted c in its original version,though congress had at that point already amended the provision.here,the applicable principle is that congress does not enact substantive changes sub silentio.see director of revenue of cobank acb.in light of castillo determination that the machinegun provision in the previous version of is an element,a change should not be inferred a bsent a clear indication from congress of a change in policy.grogan garner,see also rivers roadway express,w hen this court construes a statute,it is explaining its understanding of what the statute has meant continuously since the date when it became law 
the government argues that the amendment restructuring c demonstrates the congressional judgment to reclassify the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor,rather than as an offense element.but the better understanding,as the government acknowledged in its submission in castillo,is that there is nothing to suggest that the amendments were intended to change,rather than simply reorganize and clarify,treatment of firearm type.brief for united states.a closer review of the amendment confirms this.
there are three principal differences between the previous and current versions of c two substantive changes and a third regarding the stylistic structure of the statute.the first difference,as discussed above,supra,at,is that the amendment changed what were once mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences.a person convicted of the primary offense of using or carrying a firearm during a crime of violence was once to be sentenced to imprisonment for five years,but under the current version he or she is to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years.
the second difference is that the amended version includes the word possesses in addition to uses or carries in its principal paragraph,and then adds the substantive provisions in c a ii and iii,which provide mandatory minimums for brandishing years and discharging years the firearm.these provisions are new substantive additions to the text of the previous version,which provided a bare mandatory minimum for any offender who use d or carrie d a firearm,without concern for how the firearm was used.
the changes were a direct response to this court decision in bailey united states,which held that the word use in the version of must connote more than mere possession of a firearm by a person who commits a drug offense.at.the court in bailey went on to observe that,h ad congress intended possession alone to trigger liability under c,it easily could have so provided by using the word possess,as it had so frequently done in other statutory provisions.ibid.three years later,congress made the change and added the word possesses to the principal paragraph.congress additionally provided mandatory sentences above the minimum depending on whether and how the firearm was used.sections c a ii and iii provide sentencing enhancements for brandishing or discharging the firearm,and the court has held that these enhancements are sentencing factors to be found by a judge.see harris,at see also dean united states,slip,at referring to the brandishing and discharge provisions as sentencing factors the amendment was colloquially known as the bailey fix act.cong.rec.remarks of dewine see also dean,supra,at stevens,dissenting slip,at.
aside from shifting the mandatory sentences to mandatory minimums,and this bailey fix,congress left the substance of the statute unchanged.neither of these substantive changes suggests that congress meant to transform the machinegun provision from an element into a sentencing factor.
the government stresses a third,structural,difference in the statute,pointing out that the machinegun provision now resides in a separate subsection,c b,whereas it once resided in the principal paragraph that unmistakably lists offense elements.this structural or stylistic change,though,does not provide a clear indication that congress meant to alter its treatment of machineguns as an offense element.see grogan,at.a more logical explanation for the restructuring is that it broke up a lengthy principal paragraph,which exceeded words even before adding more to it for the bailey fix,into a more readable statute.this is in step with current legislative drafting guidelines,which advise drafters to break lengthy statutory provisions into separate subsections that can be read more easily.see house legislative counsel manual on drafting style,hlc,senate office of the legislative counsel,legislative drafting manual.
while the court has indicated that placing factors in separate subsections is one way congress might signal that it is treating them as sentencing factors as opposed to elements,castillo,at,harris,at,it has rejected the view that this structural consideration predominates even when other factors point in the other direction,at e ven if a statute has a look to it suggesting that the numbered subsections are only sentencing provisions,the court will not ignore compelling evidence to the contrary quoting jones,at.for instance,in jones the court found that the federal carjacking statute set forth elements of multiple offenses despite a structure similar to the statute at issue here,at.and in harris,the court was careful to point out that,unlike the case at bar,the other castillo factors reinforce d the interpretation implied by the statute structure.at.
in examining the amended version of c structure,there is an additional consideration that supports interpreting the machinegun provision to be an offense element.as explained above,the brandishing and discharge provisions codified in a ii and iii do state sentencing factors.see harris,supra,at dean,supra,at slip,at.had congress intended to treat firearm type as a sentencing factor,it likely would have listed firearm types as clauses iv and v of subparagraph a,instead of as clauses i and ii of subparagraph b.by listing firearm type in subparagraph b,congress set it apart from the sentencing factors in a ii and iii this is consistent with preserving firearm type as an element of a separate offense.
to be sure,there are some arguments in favor of treating the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor.the current structure of c is more favorable to that interpretation than was true in castillo,particularly because the machinegun provision is now positioned between the sentencing factors provided in a ii and iii,see harris,supra,at,and the recidivist provisions in c i and ii,which are typically sentencing factors as well.see,at.these points are overcome,however,by the substantial weight of the other castillo factors and the principle that congress would not enact so significant a change without a clear indication of its purpose to do so.the evident congressional purpose was to amend the statute to counteract bailey and to make the statute more readable but not otherwise to alter the substance of the statute.the analysis and holding of castillo control this case.the machinegun provision in c b ii is an element of an offense.
the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.
it is so ordered.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit 
justice stevens,concurring.
a sentencing factor may serve two very different functions.as a historical matter,the term has described a fact that a trial judge might rely upon when choosing a specific sentence within the range authorized by the legislature.in that setting,the judge has broad discretion in determining both the significance of the factor and whether it has been established by reliable evidence.
in the and,as part of a national effort to enact tougher sentences a new type of sentencing factor emerged.since then the term has been used to describe facts,found by the judge by a preponderance of the evidence,that have the effect of imposing mandatory limits on a sentencing judge discretion.when used as an element of a mandatory sentencing scheme,a sentencing factor is the functional equivalent of an element of the criminal offense itself.in these circumstances,i continue to believe the constitution requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of this factor.
we first encountered the use of a sentencing factor in the m
