this is a case of first impression for this circuit on several issues under the lanham act,et.
the plaintiff,formerly known as the state compensation insurance fund,was chartered in by the rhode island legislature as the workers compensation insurer of last resort in the state.in,it adopted the name the beacon mutual insurance company beacon mutual and,since then,has sold workers compensation insurance in rhode island under the marks the beacon mutual insurance company,beacon insurance,and the beacon,with an accompanying lighthouse logo.the name change was brought about by increased competition following the resolution of a crisis in the state workers compensation market.
in june,the defendant onebeacon insurance group onebeacon,which sells various forms of commercial insurance nationwide,switched to its current name and adopted a lighthouse logo as well,albeit in a different font and arrangement.the name change resulted from the sale of the company,then called cgu corporation,to another company the terms of the sale required cgu to change its name.onebeacon is a direct competitor of beacon mutual in the rhode island market for workers compensation insurance.
beacon mutual brought suit one month after onebeacon name change,alleging violations of the lanham act,a,and state trademark laws.on november,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of onebeacon on all counts on the ground that beacon mutual had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of confusion.beacon mut.ins.onebeacon ins.group,d.beacon mutual now appeals.
for likelihood of confusion to be actionable,the confusion has to exist in the mind of a relevant person.astra pharm,beckman instruments,cir.the primary issue in this appeal is the relevance of evidence submitted by beacon mutual showing instances of confusion between the two companies in the sixteen months following onebeacon adoption of its current name.most of the confusion involved misdirected premium checks,claim forms,medical records,and legal correspondence.onebeacon argues that those incidents do not demonstrate confusion among relevant persons because the confused persons were not those who made purchasing decisions and there was no evidence that their confusion caused beacon mutual to lose sales.onebeacon argument impermissibly narrows the scope of the court inquiry into both the harm suffered by the plaintiff and the persons among whom confusion exists.
we hold that the type of commercial injury actionable under a of the lanham act,a,is not restricted to the loss of sales to actual and prospective buyers of the product in question.confusion is relevant when it exists in the minds of persons in a position to influence the purchasing decision or persons whose confusion presents a significant risk to the sales,goodwill,or reputation of the trademark owner.this holding is consistent with our existing case law,under which confusion is actionable.see lund trading,aps kohler,cir.we also hold that relevant commercial injury includes not only loss of sales but also harm to the trademark holder goodwill and reputation.see mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.hereinafter,mccarthy.
on summary judgment,all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the party,beacon mutual.here,a factfinder could reasonably infer that the misdirected communications showed confusion among purchasing companies,their covered employees,consulting physicians and other health care providers,insurers,attorneys for claimant employees,and courts handling such claims,and had caused commercial injury to beacon mutual in the form of,inter alia,delays in claims processing,mistaken cancellations of coverage for failure to pay premiums,delayed reimbursements of health care providers,improper disclosure of confidential medical records,and risk of potential legal penalties for purchasers,covered workers,and providers.reasonable inferences could be drawn that these problems had damaged beacon mutual goodwill and reputation.reasonable inferences could also be drawn that these problems had led or would lead to lost sales,although the drawing of such inferences is not necessary to survive summary judgment in light of the other forms of commercial injury present in this case.because inappropriate legal standards were employed both as to the substantive application of trademark law and as to the drawing of inferences on summary judgment,we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the following facts are described in the light most favorable to beacon mutual,the party.zyla wadsworth,cir.
beacon mutual is the largest writer of workers compensation insurance in rhode island,collecting over million in premiums in.it has used its marks and lighthouse logo since june,but never registered them.over the years,beacon mutual has steadily increased its advertising and promotional expenditures to build its brand,spending close to million in.beacon mutual says that these promotional activities,most of which involve displaying its marks,are necessary to maintain its position in an increasingly competitive market.according to a consumer survey submitted by beacon mutual on summary judgment,many rhode island consumers now associate the mark the beacon with beacon mutual.beacon mutual offers its workers compensation insurance through agents as well as through direct sales.
onebeacon,formerly known as cgu insurance,began using its current name and lighthouse logo nationally in early june.a corporation that sells commercial insurance nationwide,onebeacon offers workers compensation insurance in rhode island on a much smaller scale than beacon mutual,collecting around million in workers compensation premiums in.onebeacon says that workers compensation insurance is not a profitable line of business for it in rhode island and that it offers the product only as a convenience to its existing customers.the workers compensation coverage offered by onebeacon is comparable to that offered by beacon mutual and is sold at rates that are the same or higher than beacon mutual.
beacon mutual and onebeacon share addresses that sound similar.beacon mutual is located at one beacon center,warwick,rhode island,and onebeacon is located at one beacon street,boston,massachusetts.counsel for onebeacon informed us at oral argument that beacon mutual was already located at its current address when her client began using the name onebeacon in june.
on july,beacon mutual brought a trademark infringement action against onebeacon in the rhode island superior court.count i alleged unfair competition under the lanham act,a count ii alleged unfair competition under rhode island common law count iii alleged service mark infringement under rhode island common law and count iv alleged trademark dilution under laws.
onebeacon removed the case to federal court and then moved for summary judgment,arguing that all four counts should be dismissed because there was no likelihood of confusion onebeacon relied principally on the fact that it sells workers compensation insurance exclusively through licensed independent insurance agents.onebeacon submitted a telephone survey showing that those agents understand the difference between the two companies and that those agents typically guide consumers,whom the agents said do not ordinarily express a preference for a particular brand of workers compensation insurance,through the purchasing process.onebeacon argued that if its agents are not confused,purchasers guided by those agents are unlikely to be confused either.moreover,onebeacon argued that to the extent that confusion exists among or potential purchasers before the point of sale,such confusion is not actionable because it can not possibly cause the harm that the trademark laws are meant to prevent economic harm to beacon mutual in the form of lost sales.
beacon mutual opposed summary judgment,arguing that,contrary to onebeacon assertion,confusion need not be tied specifically to lost sales or to the state of mind of purchasers at the point of sale to be actionable.confusion,beacon mutual argued,is relevant where it adversely affects the trademark owner commercial interests.here,beacon mutual argued,at a minimum,the goodwill and reputation of beacon mutual were harmed by actual confusion among rhode island employers,workers,health care providers,insurance companies,attorneys,and courts.
beacon mutual submitted an affidavit by michael lynch,vice president of legal services for beacon mutual,stating that shortly after onebeacon name change,beacon mutual began receiving misdirected,telephone calls,checks,and letters intended for onebeacon.attorney lynch attached to his affidavit an exhibit,entitled the confusion matrix,that detailed instances of confusion between beacon mutual and onebeacon between june and november,based on lynch own personal knowledge and information in beacon mutual business records.the confusion matrix documented,inter alia,confusion among four main groups 
rhode island employers instances mostly,premium checks sent to beacon mutual instead of onebeacon or in at least one instance vice versa.
health care providers instances mostly,insurance claim forms or patient medical records sent to beacon mutual instead of onebeacon or vice versa.
insurance companies instances mostly,beacon mutual was contacted to resolve claims instead of onebeacon or vice versa.
courts or attorneys instances mostly,summonses,complaints,or legal correspondence sent to beacon mutual instead of onebeacon or vice versa.
lynch stated in his affidavit that these instances of confusion had led to 
claims processing being delayed or not accomplished,both companies being potentially subjected to legal action for breach of contract or individual privacy rights,injured workers not being timely compensated or notified of court hearings,employers not being notified of court proceedings,providers not being paid in a timely manner,and insureds not being credited for premium payments and then having their coverage lapse or cancelled,resulting in their being in violation of the state workers compensation laws.
lynch also attached to his affidavit an august,letter from the chief judge of the rhode island workers compensation court to beacon mutual complaining about delays caused by confusion between the two companies 
the workers compensation court is concerned as a result of recent confusion arising from the similarity of names between the beacon mutual insurance company and onebeacon insurance group formerly cgu insurance group 
the court has been made aware that service of process and notices that are intended for onebeacon are unintentionally being sent to the beacon mutual insurance company office in warwick.this confusion impacts our workers compensation cases,in that notice to parties may be delayed,affecting both the employees and employers rights and benefits 
an additional concern is regarding preferred provider networks ppn.the beacon mutual insurance carrier does have an approved ppn,while onebeacon does not.when an injured worker telephones to determine if a ppn is in effect for their employer,some confusion may exi st as to the appropriate carrier on the part of the employee,thereby possibly limiting the employee choice of physician inappropriately.
onebeacon response was that these many instances of confusion were simply irrelevant because beacon mutual had not demonstrated that they led to a loss of sales.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of onebeacon on all counts.beacon mutual,d at.after first determining that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether beacon mutual marks were distinctive,the court turned to the relevance of the confusion matrix.it determined that while the confusion matrix showed that the confusion plaintiff complains of is real,the plaintiff has not established that the entities and persons identified in its matrix fall into the confusion category,for the simple reason that the confused entities are not consumers of the product,nor has plaintiff shown any commercial relevance as to these entities.id.at.
the court acknowledged that even if the confusion of actual purchasers is always corrected at the point of sale,confusion among and potential purchasers can be relevant where it affects the trademark owner commercial interests.id.at citing cmm cable,ocean coast properties,aff,cir.at one point,the court described those commercial interests as including goodwill,citing other cases that recognize the confusion of third parties as relevant when their views are somehow related to the goodwill of the aggrieved manufacturer.id.quoting landscape forms,columbia cascade,cir.
in applying this standard,however,the court focused on what it found to be beacon mutual failure to connect the instances of confusion described in the confusion matrix to lost sales.it emphasized that there is no indication that this type of confusion has ever played any role in the purchasing calculus.id.at.the theme of the opinion was that plaintiff has put on no evidence that it has lost any business as a result of confusion among its insured or proffered any evidence from which this court reasonably could infer that the confusion has affected the decision of any insured to switch providers.id.at.it therefore concluded that there was an absence of evidence about the possible nocent effect of this confusion on plaintiff market interests and that it could not find any such effect without engaging in speculation.id.at.
drawing on its analysis of the relevance of the confusion matrix,the court applied the test for likelihood of confusion used by this court in astra,at adopting the test articulated in pignons de mecanique de precision polaroid,cir.see also lund,at int l ass of machinists aero.workers winship green nursing,cir.it concluded that no reasonable factfinder could find in favor of beacon mutual on the most important factors in the case evidence of actual confusion,similarity in the classes of prospective purchasers,and similarity in the channels of trade.d at.the court then held that although beacon mutual marks were strong and the two parties marks were similar,those factors could not overcome beacon mutual fatal failure to demonstrate that the confusion it identifies is connected in any way to its commercial interests.id.
having found no likelihood of confusion connected to commercial interests,the court dismissed the lanham act and state common law claims counts.the court also dismissed the rhode island statutory dilution claim count iv,reasoning that b ecause the court has held that plaintiff can not survive summary judgment on the likelihood of confusion prong of its lanham act claim,so,too,does its dilution claim fail.id.
beacon mutual timely appealed from the dismissal of all four claims.
our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.douglas york county,cir.on a motion for summary judgment,all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the party here,beacon mutual,regardless of who bears the ultimate burden of proof.id.
beacon mutual acknowledges that it must demonstrate a substantial likelihood of confusion to survive summary judgment on the lanham act and state common law counts section of the lanham act,under which count i is brought,provides that 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device which is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
a.the same likelihood of confusion requirement applies to beacon mutual claims under rhode island common law for unfair competition and service mark infringement.see decosta viacom int l,cir applying collateral estoppel to prevent relitigation of likelihood of confusion issue under lanham act when that issue had already been decided in earlier suit under rhode island common law.
eight factors,outlined most recently in lund,are typically used to assess the likelihood of confusion the similarity of the marks the similarity of the goods the relationship between the parties channels of trade the relationship between the parties advertising the classes of prospective purchasers evidence of actual confusion the defendant intent in adopting its mark and the strength of the plaintiff mark.at.these factors are not to be applied mechanically.courts may consider other factors and may accord little weight to factors that are not helpful on the particular facts of a case.see id.
evidence of actual confusion 
we turn first to the sixth factor,evidence of actual confusion.on summary judgment,onebeacon,for its part,has not disputed the accuracy of the instances of actual confusion listed in the confusion matrix.
instead,onebeacon argued to the district court that confusion is relevant only if it involved actual or potential purchasers and caused the trademark holder to lose sales.the extent to which the district court accepted these arguments is not clear.the district court clearly rejected the notion that confusion is relevant only if it involves actual or potential purchasers.beacon mutual,d at.but the district court appears at some points to have required beacon mutual to demonstrate that the confusion caused lost sales or lost customers,while suggesting at other points that loss of goodwill is a relevant harm.compare id.requiring only a showing of an effect on goodwill quoting landscape forms,at or other commercial interests,with id.at faulting beacon mutual for failing to offer evidence that it lost any business or that the confusion has affected the decision of any insured to switch providers.in any event,we need not determine what standard the district court applied,as our review is de novo.
we join those courts holding that actual confusion is commercially relevant if the alleged infringer use of the mark could inflict commercial injury in the form of a diversion of sales,damage to goodwill,or loss of control over reputation on the trademark holder.the sports authority,prime hospitality,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also landscape forms,at confusion of general public is relevant if related to the goodwill of the aggrieved manufacturer perini perini,cir public confusion among is relevant if it adversely affect s the plaintiff ability to control his reputation among its laborers,lendors,investors,or other group with whom the plaintiff interacts int l kennel club of chicago,mighty star,cir the owner of a mark is damaged by a later use of a similar mark which place s the owner reputation beyond its control,though no loss in business is shown emphasis and alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted balance dynamics schmitt,cir damages may be awarded for actual confusion that causes harm to goodwill under lanham act,a,even if no lost sales have been shown.the fact that the injury is to a company reputation or goodwill,rather than directly to its sales,does not render the confusion any less actionable.meridian mutual ins.meridian ins.group,cir.
our holding is reinforced by the position of the restatement of unfair competition,which treats confusion as relevant where it presents a significant risk to the sales or good will of the trademark owner.restatement third of unfair competition cmt.b.the leading commentators also agree that harm to goodwill and harm to reputation are actionable.mccarthy states that the confusion of a purchaser of an insurance policy who mistakenly makes a claim to another company with a similar name is relevant and quotes meridian,at,for the proposition that the fact that a company goodwill,rather than its pocketbook,is injured by actual confusion does not render the confusion meaningless.mccarthy see also callman on unfair competition,trademarks and monopolies ed.even without passing off and diversion of trade,the injury suffered by a trademark owner may be grievous because of harm to reputation.indeed,onebeacon,backing off its assertion to the district court that confusion must be linked to lost sales,now admits on appeal that confusion is relevant if it threaten s the sales or goodwill of the trademark owner emphasis added.
it is true that when a lanham act case involves directly competing goods,as here,the usual harm from confusion is both the potential purchase of the defendant product rather than the plaintiff and the loss of goodwill and reputation occasioned when the defendant product is inferior but nothing in the statute suggests that demonstrable harm to plaintiff goodwill and reputation resulting from confusion of marks is restricted to this classic situation.
we also hold that the likelihood of confusion inquiry is not limited to actual or potential purchasers,but also includes others whose confusion threatens the trademark owner commercial interest in its mark see landscape forms,at insty bit,cir confusion under a of the lanham act,a,include s confusion of nonpurchasers as well as direct purchasers champions golf club,v.the champions golf club,cir confusion among suppliers is relevant perini,at public confusion among is actionable if it will adversely affect the plaintiff ability to control his reputation in re artic elecs,wl the notion that likelihood of confusion is limited to purchaser confusion is simply not correct.restatement third of unfair competition cmt.b to be actionable confusion must threaten the commercial interests of the owner of the mark,but it is not limited to the confusion of persons doing business directly with the actor.actual and potential customers of the trademark owner are the most obvious relevant persons,but other persons might be relevant if their confusion threaten s the commercial interests of the owner of the mark.cmm cable.at internal quotation marks omitted.relevant confusion among may well extend beyond the confusion of those persons positioned to influence directly the decisions of purchasers.
onebeacon argues that summary judgment is appropriate because beacon mutual has not produced evidence specifically demonstrating that the confusion threatened its commercial interests,including its goodwill.if onebeacon means that,in general,commercial injury may not ever be inferred on summary judgment,that proposition is flatly wrong.on summary judgment,all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of beacon mutual,the party.douglas,at zyla,at see also ferrara dimercurio,paul mercury ins,cir noting that reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the party on summary judgment and that i nferences can,of course,properly be drawn from circumstantial evidence.
if onebeacon means that as a matter of substantive trademark law,only direct evidence with no room for inference may establish harm to goodwill,that contention is wrong as well.in the title vii context,the supreme court has expressly rejected a direct evidence requirement,instead applying the conventional rule that a plaintiff may amass a preponderance of the evidence through direct or circumstantial evidence.desert palace,costa,d.we see no reason for applying a different rule in the trademark context.
if onebeacon means only that the evidence of record,even drawing all inferences in beacon mutual favor as required on summary judgment,is insufficient to support a finding of harm to goodwill or reputation,onebeacon is wrong yet again.here,a factfinder taking all inferences in favor of beacon mutual could reasonably infer that much of the actual confusion described in the confusion matrix is commercially relevant.
misdirected premium payments,one could reasonably infer,cause delays in crediting those payments.one could infer that those delays,in turn,cause the coverage of beacon mutual customers,employers to lapse or to be cancelled if the error is not corrected in time.that,in turn,one could further infer,places those employers in violation of rhode island laws requiring employers to maintain workers compensation insurance.laws.indeed,according to the confusion matrix the accuracy of which has not been challenged,at least one beacon mutual customer has had its policy lapse because of such an error.moreover,even if the error is corrected before a lapse or cancellation in coverage occurs,it i
