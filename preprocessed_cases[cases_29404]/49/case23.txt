this appeal involves the question of whether,as a matter of law,the antioch company scrapbook album configuration is functional and therefore ineligible for trade dress protection.by seeking trade dress protection for its album design,antioch is trying to bar western trimming corporation westrim from selling copies of the album format under the westrim trademark.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for westrim.
background 
factual background 
antioch produces and markets a scrapbook album under the trademark creative memories that has several distinctive features.the album utilizes a dual design that permits the pages to lie flat when the album is open,facilitates the turning of the pages,and enables the easy insertion of additional pages.another design element of the creative memories album is its spine cover that conceals the dual,which causes it to be known as a closed back or bookshelf album.a third element of antioch album is the laminated,padded album covers.finally,the creative memories album pages have ribbed edges that provide reinforcement,keep them separated,and hold the staples together.antioch seeks trade dress protection for the creative memories album that encompasses these features.
in,westrim,a competitor of antioch in the hobby and craft industry,decided to copy the antioch album in order to provide its customers with the functional benefits of the design.after determining that antioch patents that potentially covered the features in question had expired,westrim developed and marketed its own version of the cherished line under its existing memories forever trademark.through the use of its own distinctive logo and scroll work on the album covers,westrim links the cherished line to its other photo,scrapbook,and related accessories in the memories forever product line.
procedural background 
westrim presented the cherished line products at a craft industry trade show on june.antioch filed suit three days later,alleging trademark and trade dress infringement violations under the lanham act,as well as various claims for trademark infringement,unfair competition,and deceptive trade practices.it essentially protested westrim sale of an album that was virtually identical to its own.in addition,antioch sought to immediately enjoin westrim from introducing the cherished line albums into the market pending resolution of the litigation.
on july,the district court denied antioch motion for a preliminary injunction,focusing its discussion primarily on the trademark infringement issue.the district court found that westrim adopted antioch album design in order to achieve its functional benefits,not to confuse scrapbook enthusiasts about the supplier or source of the album.in an unpublished opinion,a prior panel of this court affirmed the district court denial of a preliminary injunction,concluding that westrim would probably defeat antioch claim of likelihood of confusion when the case went to trial.antioch western trimming,wl,at cir.
although it found the oversight harmless,the prior panel acknowledged that the district court had not addressed the trade dress infringement issue.the panel,nonetheless,drew several tentative conclusions about the trade dress claim.in particular,it expressed skepticism regarding the distinctiveness and attachment of secondary meaning to the antioch albums,and also observed that the contested spine cover was purely functional.id.at.
following the denial of the preliminary injunction and the clear indication that antioch was unlikely to prevail on its trademark infringement claim,antioch abandoned that cause of action.antioch instead filed an amended complaint on march,focusing its efforts on its federal and common law trade dress claims,as well as implied claims under a of the lanham act,a,and chapter of the ohio revised code.the district court granted westrim summary judgment on the implied claims on september.as a consequence,only the trade dress claims remained.
antioch has alleged that westrim cherished line albums infringe on antioch creative memories trade dress and trade dress.westrim moved for summary judgment on several grounds,one of which was that the album and page configurations were functional and thus not entitled to trade dress protection.adhering to this court decision in marketing displays,traffix devices,cir,the district court applied the test to the trade dress claim.this test evaluates whether use of the particular album design was dictated by competitive necessity because the configuration was purely functional.westrim motion was denied because the existence of alternative album designs was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning the functionality of antioch album and page configurations.the district court did,however,invite westrim to renew its motion for summary judgment if the supreme court,which at the time had under advisement the traffix devices decision,altered the legal framework for assessing trade dress protection claims.
in traffix devices,marketing displays,d,the supreme court in fact reversed this court prior decision and provided clarification regarding the appropriate test for evaluating whether a product was nonfunctional and thereby eligible for trade dress protection.based upon the changed landscape after traffix devices,westrim renewed its motion for summary judgment in the district court.the district court subsequently granted westrim motion in accordance with the supreme court traffix devices guidance.antioch western trimming,d.from this decision,antioch appeals.

b.the legal test for trade dress infringement 
section a of the lanham act,a,protects a product trade dress from infringement.to recover for trade dress infringement,however,the complaining party must show that the allegedly infringing feature is not functional and is likely to cause confusion with the product for which protection is sought.stores,samara,d internal citation omitted see also abercrombie fitch stores,american eagle outfitters,cir stating that,under a,the plaintiff has the burden of proving nonfunctionality.in addition,a product design is distinctive,and therefore protectible,only upon a showing of secondary meaning.stores,at.see also gray meijer,cir explaining that trade dress protection is warranted where a product trade dress has acquired secondary meaning in the marketplace,its appropriated features are nonfunctional,and the infringing product trade dress is confusingly similar to its own.
the district court grant of summary judgment was based exclusively on the functionality factor of the trade dress infringement analysis.it concluded that,as a matter of law,antioch trade dress was functional.antioch,d at.antioch contends on appeal that the district court misinterpreted the supreme court guidance in traffix devices regarding the appropriate tests for evaluating product functionality in the trade dress context.in particular,antioch argues that the district court erred in reading traffix devices to preclude consideration of evidence of alternative designs in order to gauge a product functionality.antioch also attacks what it perceives as the district court exclusive focus on the functionality of individual components of the creative memories album,rather than evaluating the trade dress of the album as a whole.we will first review the guiding principles from traffix devices and then take each of antioch contentions in turn.
determining product functionality 
in the decision underlying traffix devices,this court evaluated the functionality of a traffic sign stand by examining whether a key feature was a competitive necessity,whether the e xclusive use of the feature put s competitors at a significant disadvantage.marketing displays,at.emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.to further implement the test,this court queried whether there were alternative designs available to competitors to produce the equivalent product with the same functional benefits.the availability of alternative designs,in other words,would indicate that a company was not at a competitive disadvantage just because a key feature was monopolized by the originator of the design.
on certiorari,the supreme court reversed the marketing displays decision,explaining that this court erred in believing that the test for functionality was whether the particular product configuration is a competitive necessity.traffix devices,at.quoting marketing displays,at.the supreme court clarified that the principal basis for assessing the functionality of a product design is the traditional rule originally set forth in a footnote in inwood laboratories,ives laboratories,d,that a product feature is functional if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article.at.critical for the present case,the supreme court stated that w here the design is functional under the inwood formulation there is no need to proceed further to consider if there is a competitive necessity for the feature.id.at.the court went on to say that t here is no need to engage in speculation about other design possibilities which might serve the same purpose where functionality is established.id.in other words,e ven if there are alternative designs available in the marketplace,they can not turn a feature that is functional under the traditional definition into a feature which is the exclusive trade dress property of one seller.thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.
the supreme court did not,however,reject the possibility that the test might be applicable in certain contexts.specifically,the court stated that i t is proper to inquire into a significant disadvantage in cases of a esthetic functionality.traffix devices,at.internal quotation marks omitted.this concept of aesthetic functionality originated from a comment in the version of the restatement of torts.mccarthy,supra.although the supreme court has never directly addressed aesthetic functionality,justice breyer opinion in qualitex jacobson products,d,proposed in dicta that where an aesthetic feature like color,serves a significant as helping an individual distinguish between a heart pill and a digestive should examine whether the exclusive use of that feature by one supplier would interfere with legitimate competition.see also abercrombie fitch stores,where this court explained that the competitive disadvantage test did not displace the traditional functionality standard from inwood,but rather that it was most adaptable to the problem of aesthetic functionality.at.
a leading treatise,on the other hand,opines that a esthetic functionality is an oxymoron,mccarthy,supra,and reports that a majority of courts have rejected the concept.id.at.because there is no suggestion that the antioch scrapbook album is aesthetically functional,we need not address the validity of the concept any further.
since the supreme court decided traffix devices,however,at least one circuit and a leading treatise author have expressed their views that the availability of alternative designs may be helpful in applying the traditional inwood test for functionality.see valu engineering,rexnord,commenting that the availability of alternative designs can be a legitimate source of evidence to determine whether a feature is functional in the first place mccarthy,supra,stating his personal view that evidence of alternative designs can be useful in evaluating whether the design is essential to the use or purpose of the article.
we need not resolve the question of whether evidence of alternative designs has a place outside of the test because,at the very least,a court is not required to examine alternative designs when applying the traditional test for functionality.that much is clear from traffix devices,where the supreme court applied inwood in a straightforward fashion,without looking at alternative designs,and found that the design of the traffic sign stand in question was essential to the stand purpose because it kept the sign upright during inclement weather.at.although the traffix devices decision does not fully resolve the uncertainties of trade dress protection,these uncertainties do not affect the present case.the traditional inwood test for functionality is the main rule,and if a product is clearly functional under inwood,a court need not apply the test and its related inquiry concerning the availability of alternative designs.
the district court properly applied the traditional rule for assessing the functionality of antioch product design and correctly rejected evidence of alternative designs 
the district court opinion in the present case conveys the impression that the court understood traffix devices to categorically reject the test in all instances.in deciding what test to apply,the district court stated 
the defendant initially argues that,in light of the supreme court decision in traffix devices,the sixth circuit competitive need test is no longer applicable.this court agrees,since the sixth circuit adopted that test in its decision in traffix devices,a decision which the supreme court reversed.accordingly,this court will not apply the rejected,competitive need test when ruling upon the defendant renewed motion for partial summary judgment.as a consequence,the court will not consider whether alternative designs exist,when ruling upon that motion.
antioch,d at internal citations omitted.the district court went on to apply the traditional rule that product configuration trade dress is functional when it is essential to the use or purpose of the device or when it affects the cost or quality of the device.id.at quoting traffix devices,at.
antioch argues that the district court misinterpreted traffix devices by allegedly determining that the test was rejected and no longer applicable.we opt for a more benign interpretation of the district court opinion namely,that the district court correctly concluded that the supreme court rejected the test as the main test and reinstated the inwood formulation as the primary method for evaluating functionality.the district court presumably determined that the test was no longer applicable to the matter before it because the antioch westrim trade dress dispute does not concern aesthetic functionality.as stated above,the inquiry is still viable in limited circumstances that do not exist in the present case.see traffix devices,at.
although the district court opinion leaves room for conflicting interpretations in its discussion of traffix devices,the outcome of the present case is unaffected because the court properly applied the traditional rule from inwood.it concluded that the essential feature of antioch claimed product configuration trade dress is its dual strap hinge design,which is unquestionably functional.antioch,d at.the straps both hold the album together and produce the advertised functional benefits of allowing the pages to lie flat when the album is open,permitting their easy turning,and enabling the insertion of additional pages.id.referring to this court prior skepticism about the distinctiveness of the spine cover,the district court concluded that antioch had not raised any evidence that would create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a spine cover was anything other than functional.id.the district court also determined that the laminated,padded album covers were functional.id.finally,the district court concluded that antioch claimed trade dress regarding the album pages was purely functional because the ribbed edges had the effect of reinforcing the pages keeping the pages separated,and thus,permitting air to circ
