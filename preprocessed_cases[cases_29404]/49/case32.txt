this case requires us to construe damages provisions in the computer fraud and abuse act 
truck drivers and trucking companies try to avoid dead heading.deadheading means having to drive a truck,ordinarily on a return trip,without a load.if the truck is moving,truck drivers and their companies want it to be carrying freight.in the past,truckers and shippers used blackboards to match up trips and loads.eventually television screens were used instead of blackboards,but the matching was still inefficient.better information on where the trucks and the loads quick,easy access to that shippers,carriers,and consumers.
creative computing developed a successful internet site,which it calls the internet truckstop,to match loads with trucks.the site is very easy to use.it has a feature called radius search that lets a truck driver in,say,middletown,connecticut,with some space in his truck,find within seconds all available loads in whatever mileage radius he likes and of course lets a shipper post a load so that a trucker with space can find it.the site was created so early in internet history and worked so well that it came to dominate the industry.
getloaded decided to compete,but not honestly.after getloaded set up a site,it wanted to get a bigger piece of creative market.creative wanted to prevent that,so it prohibited access to its site by competing loadmatching services.the getloaded officers thought trucking companies would probably use the same login names and passwords on as they did on.getloaded president,patrick hull,used the login name and password of a getloaded subscriber,in effect impersonating the trucking company,to sneak into.getloaded,ken hammond,accomplished the same thing by registering a defunct company,rft trucking,as a subscriber.these tricks enabled them to see all of the information available to creative bona fide customers.
getloaded officers also hacked into the code creative used to operate its website.microsoft had distributed a patch to prevent a hack it had discovered,but creative computing had not yet installed the patch on.getloaded president and hacked into creative computing website through the back door that this patch would have locked.once in,they examined the source code for the tremendously valuable feature.
getloaded used a more trick to get unauthorized access to creative computing customer list.it hired away a creative computing employee who had given getloaded an unauthorized tour of the website.this employee,while still working for creative,accessed confidential information regarding several thousand of creative customers.he downloaded,and sent to his home email account,the confidential address to server so that he could access the server from home and retrieve customer lists.
creative computing first discovered what getloaded had done at a trade show in.getloaded was demonstrating a program that looked suspiciously like.years later,it was clear why.during discovery,creative uncovered a handwritten getloaded employee list that included mimic.after the creative employee who had been feeding confidential information to getloaded defected,creative checked his computer and found evidence that he improperly accessed customer information before his departure.
creative computing sued getloaded in district court for copyright infringement,lanham act violations,and misappropriation of trade secrets under the idaho trade secrets act.creative also sought a temporary restraining order.the court granted a tro that prohibited getloaded from,among other things,removing or destroying evidence of how it had copied and used source code,marketed to customers on creative customer list,or accessed the site.the parties stipulated to continuing the order in substantially the same form as a preliminary injunction while the litigation was pending.subsequently,creative amended its complaint,adding claims for damages under the federal computer fraud and abuse act 
the injunction did not work.getloaded violated it.the district court made an express finding that getloaded acted in bad faith as its senior others under its supervision and with its under oath and violated the court injunction.the district judge carefully worked his way through contradictions in patrick hull testimony,matching the testimony with log of access to the site and the testimony of others who could have logged on at the critical times,thereby establishing that hull had lied under oath.expert testimony demonstrated to the judge that getloaded had destroyed evidence that showed it had copied source code in violation of the injunction.
the case went to a jury trial.it turned out that none of code was found in code,so the jury special verdict was for the defendant on the copyright claim.also,the site looked different enough that the special verdict was in favor of the defendant on the lanham act trade dress claim.but creative computing won anyway because the jury rendered special verdicts that getloaded had violated the idaho trade secrets act and the federal computer fraud and abuse act.damages awarded were for the state law violation and for each of three federal law violations,totaling.pursuant to the idaho trade secrets act,the district court awarded an additional in exemplary damages because of getloaded willful and malicious conduct the court also awarded in fees and in expenses as sanctions to compensate creative computing for the expense of figuring out and proving getloaded violations of the preliminary injunction and false statements in depositions the court entered a permanent injunction extending indefinitely several provisions of the preliminary injunction,such as the prohibition against getloaded accessing.getloaded appeals.
i.the computer fraud and abuse act 
getloaded argues that no action could lie under the computer fraud and abuse act because it requires a floor for damages from each unauthorized access,and that creative computing submitted no evidence that would enable a jury to find that the floor was reached on any single unauthorized access.it relies for this argument on several district court cases that required damages from a single act or event and on a phrase in the senate report on the bill creative computing cites several district court cases going the other way but neither the parties nor we have found circuit court authority on point.
the briefs dispute which version of the statute we should one in effect when getloaded committed the wrongs,or the one in effect when the case went to trial which is still in effect.the old version of the statute made an exception to the fraudulent access provision if the value of such use unauthorized access to a protected computer is not more than in any period.the new version,in effect now and during trial,says loss during any period aggregating at least in value.these provisions are materially identical.
the old version of the statute defined damage as any impairment to the integrity or availability of data,a program,a system,or information that caused the loss of at least it had no separate definition of loss.the new version defines damage the same way,but adds a definition of loss.loss is defined in the new version as any reasonable cost to any victim,including the cost of responding to an offense,conducting a damage assessment,and restoring the data and any revenue lost,cost incurred,or other consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service.
for purposes of this case,we need not decide which version of the act applies,because getloaded loses either way.neither version of the statute supports a construction that would require proof of of damage or loss from a single unauthorized access.the syntax makes it clear that in both versions,the floor applies to how much damage or loss there is to the victim over a period,not from a particular intrusion.getloaded argues that impairment is singular,so the floor has to be met by a single intrusion.the premise does not lead to the conclusion.the statute both the earlier and the current versions says damage means any impairment to the integrity or availability of data that causes loss aggregating at least.multiple intrusions can cause a singl
