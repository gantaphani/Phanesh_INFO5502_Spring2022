plaintiffs willie gray,gregory gray,glenda gray,wilmer gray,another image management,doing business as the popcorn shoppe,and tps packaging,also known as tps popcorn,collectively,gray appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to defendant meijer,meijer on their claim of trade dress infringement under the lanham act.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in may,the gray family opened the popcorn shoppe the shoppe in kentwood,michigan,adjacent to a beauty salon owned by a member of the gray family.initially,the shoppe sold three different types of,caramel and the salon customers.the shoppe soon expanded to selling popcorn at other beauty salons.the original packaging was cellophane with a small,yellow label that described its contents.in january,gray decided to pursue wholesale sales of its product.as part of this effort,a customer who was a graphic designer agreed to design a new package for gray chicago style mix of their three types of popcorn.according to gray,the main elements of its packaging were the brand name the popcorn shoppe on the top of the bag a description of the contents chicago style mix also on the upper portion of the bag a depiction of the chicago skyline in the middle of the bag and red and yellow colors on the top and bottom of the bag.
with the new package,gray approached meijer,a midwest retailer that operates stores in michigan,illinois,indiana,ohio and kentucky.gray representatives met with meijer salty snack buyer and his planned successor to that position on march.the meijer representatives tasted gray product and examined its packaging.the meijer representatives agreed to make shelf space available in all its stores once gray had obtained a nutritional label,as required by law,and selected a distributor capable of handling large volume orders.gray representatives agreed to keep meijer updated on their progress.the remaining package and product were left behind.
meijer had begun developing its own chicago style popcorn in,and began selling the product in its michigan stores by march.meijer original popcorn package had a background with red and blue lettering,no trim,no depiction of the chicago skyline,and included the description chicago style.three months after meijer meeting with gray,meijer commissioned a redesign of its entire private label salty snack food line.meijer hired a freelance graphic designer.the redesign included meijer chicago style popcorn package.she completed her redesign that summer and the changes were incorporated into the bag beginning in late.she attests that she did not refer to or even know of the bag.
meanwhile,gray hired a laboratory to conduct the requisite nutritional analysis and incorporated this analysis into its package.gray also made arrangements with a new distributor and manufacturer.finally,two years later in march,gray returned to meijer.meijer ordered cases of gray popcorn.gray complains that meijer did not inform gray when its product would be in its stores,and gray did not find out until it received an inquiry from a customer.thus,gray was not able to arrange promotions or other support for its product.
in its salty snack food aisle,meijer shelves products by source,not type.meijer groups all of its snack foods together,including its chicago style popcorn.gray product was shelved on aisle endcaps or in center aisle displays,the premium spots designed to feature new products,pursuant to standard meijer practice.in april,meijer decided to discontinue carrying gray popcorn due to poor sales.both the individual and corporate plaintiffs filed for bankruptcy in,with the corporate plaintiffs permanently ceasing all operations.
besides meijer,gray sales efforts involved several other retailers.from april to may,gray sold cases of popcorn to the supermarket d w,with an estimated gross profit of.from april to april,it sold cases to spartan stores,with an estimated gross profit of.the record does not indicate that gray made further wholesale sales,aside from meijer,after the fall of.
as for its marketing efforts,gray performed promotions in d w supermarkets in april.also,gray ran some limited newspaper advertisements.
gray sued meijer in.meijer moved for summary judgment as to all claims.on the claim for trade dress infringement,the court found that there were genuine issues of material fact on the issue of whether gray product was inherently distinctive,but the court found that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to the likelihood of consumer confusion between gray product and meijer product,granting summary judgment to meijer.this finding disposed of the trade dress infringement claim under the lanham act,as well as the common law unfair competition claim and the michigan consumer protection act mcpa claim.the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim,dismissing it without prejudice.gray does not appeal the court holdings as to its other claims though each is of course dependent upon the lanham act issue before us.
the lanham act protection of registered trademarks also extends to unregistered trade dress.marketing displays,traffix devices,cir citation omitted,overruled in part on other grounds,d.to recover for trade dress infringement under a of the lanham act,a,a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its trade dress has obtained secondary meaning in the marketplace that the trade dress of the two competing products is confusingly similar and that the appropriated features of the trade dress are primarily nonfunctional.id.to defeat summary judgment,gray must show a genuine issue of material fact as to each of these issues.
as the dispositive element of the district court analysis,we take up likelihood of confusion first.
likelihood of confusion 
to prevail on its trade dress claim under the lanham act,gray must prove that the purportedly infringing mark is likely to cause confusion in prospective purchasers minds.marketing displays,at addressing trademark infringement.likelihood of confusion can be a question of law appropriate for determination on a motion for summary judgment.marketing displays,at citing wsm,tennessee sales,cir.we have identified eight factors relevant to the likelihood of confusion inquiry,commonly known as the frisch factors 
strength of the plaintiff mark 
relatedness of the goods 
similarity of the marks 
evidence of actual confusion 
marketing channels used 
likely degree of purchaser care 
defendant intent in selecting the mark and 
likelihood of expansion of the product lines.
frisch restaurants,elby big boy,cir.none of these factors is dispositive of a plaintiff case t hese factors are simply a guide to help determine whether confusion would be likely to result from simultaneous use of the two contested marks.they imply no mathematical precision,and a plaintiff need not show that all,or even most,of the factors listed are present in any particular case to be successful.wynn oil thomas,cir.the general concept underlying likelihood of confusion is that the public believe that the mark owner sponsored or otherwise approved of the use of the trademark.id.citations omitted.summary judgment for the defendant is appropriate if,upon consideration of all factors,the district court determines that no reasonable jury could fail to find that confusion of the marks would be likely.it would be illogical for a merely disputed factor to preclude summary judgment the nonmoving party burden is to identify a disputed factor or set of factors whose resolution would necessarily be dispositive on the likelihood of confusion issue.marketing displays,at.a finding that at least one factor favors the nonmoving party is likely,but such finding does not prevent an overall finding of no likelihood of confusion or preclude summary judgment.id.
the district court weighed the eight factors and found that four factors favored meijer,that gray had not raised a material issue of fact as to those factors,including strength of the plaintiff mark similarity of the marks evidence of actual confusion and likely degree of purchaser care.the court found that two factors favored gray relatedness of the goods and marketing channels used.finally,the court found that two factors favored neither party or were irrelevant defendant intent in selecting the mark and likelihood of expansion of the product lines.on appeal,neither gray nor meijer contests that the relatedness of the goods is present,both products are a chicago style popcorn,and that likelihood of expansion of the product lines is not a relevant factor.leading the district court inquiry was the fact that it found no genuine issue of fact as to the two most important frisch factors,strength of the mark and similarity of the trade dress.
strength of the plaintiff mark 
the strength of a mark is a determination of the mark distinctiveness and degree of recognition in the marketplace.a mark is strong if it is highly distinctive,if the public readily accepts it as the hallmark of a particular source it can become so because it is unique,because it has been the subject of wide and intensive advertisement,or because of a combination of both.the stronger the mark,all else equal,the greater the likelihood of confusion.
homeowners group,home marketing specialists,cir citations and quotations omitted.the district court held that w hile a reasonable jury could conclude that any package is inherently distinctive,to gauge the strength of that trade dress,it is useful to look to the extent to which that packaging has acquired secondary meaning.citing mexican food specialties,festida foods.the district court then proceeded to consider the factors articulated by this court to aid in determining whether a trade good has acquired secondary meaning.see marketing displays,at setting forth the seven factor test for determining acquisition of secondary meaning.gray argues principally that the court inappropriately focused on the acquisition of secondary meaning as opposed to the inherent distinctiveness of the product,emphasizing that the court had already found material questions of fact existed as to the inherent distinctiveness element of the test for trade dress infringement.gray also refers to point of sales reports in the record as evidence of a strong trade dress not considered by the court below.
strength of a plaintiff trade dress depends upon the interplay of two elements,the uniqueness of the trade dress and the investment in imbuing a trade dress with secondary meaning.thus,the most mundane packaging may be infused with meaning by advertising and other promotional tools,rendering a strong trade dress.likewise,particularly unique packaging even without any artificial efforts to establish a secondary meaning for the product may result in a strong trade dress.the combination of these two factors determines the relative strength or weakness of the trade dress.
in this case,as the district court found,it is clear that gray packaging had not received any significant advertising or promotional efforts to create a secondary meaning for the packaging,and the product enjoyed no real success in the market.the facts speak for themselves.the sales of popcorn products from april till gray went out of business in totaled less than cases.gray invested almost nothing in building the brand equity of the product,and the actual brand equity was reflected in the low sales of the product.the vague results of the extremely limited point of sales reports referred to by gray in its brief add nothing to this analysis.however,it is true,as gray points out,that a unique product may still be considered to have a strong trade dress despite the lack of investment in the branding or notoriety of the product.this is right and fair in that companies,such as gray,would not be afforded trade dress protection without such an exception.the problem for gray is that its packaging is not unique.
gray confuses the first element of the trade dress analysis,inherent distinctiveness,with this aspect of the likelihood of confusion analysis.as the district court noted,any packaging may be said to have inherent distinctiveness by virtue of the breadth of colors,shapes,graphics,available to the packager in designing its trade dress.in determining the strength of such trade dress,however,the analysis is different as the inquiry revolves around the uniqueness of the packaging.to be considered a strong mark without any significant branding of the product through artificial means,the product must be naturally branded.the district court aptly addressed gray product,finding 
n either the elements of the packaging,nor the product itself were exclusive or unique.the term chicago style has been widely used for many years for a variety of products.it has been used to describe popcorn combination mixtures and,in fact,meijer sold its private label triple mix product in its michigan stores before the grays did.the same is true of the chicago skyline.the grays have no proprietary rights to the chicago skyline which is depicted on the packaging of many products.
accordingly,absent any uniqueness of the packaging or any significant branding investment in the packaging,the district court finding that the gray trade dress was weak is not erroneous.
similarity of the marks 
this point is best articulated by actually comparing the gray packaging with the meijer packaging.the district court found the two packages dissimilar.we agree.the packages have some coloring and the inclusion of chicago style and a silhouette of the chicago skyline in common,but the skylines are in different places on the package middle bottom the skyline silhouettes look very different meijer has a big popcorn kernel on the front the brand meijer is labeled prominently on the top of the package as is gray the popcorn shoppe label and though using similar colors,the design layout of the bags are sharply different.gray criticizes the district court analysis,arguing that the test is not the appropriate test.rather,gray argues that this court precedents provide that the appropriate test is whether a given mark would confuse the public when viewed alone,in order to account for the possibility that sufficiently similar marks may confuse consumers who do not have both marks before them daddy junky music stores,at.
it is unfortunate that the district court used the terminology comparison,but,nevertheless,the court then carefully proceeded to compare and contrast the bags,finding significant differences,as noted supra.importantly,as the district court also noted,the fact that the meijer bag prominently displays the meijer mark and that its design is consistent with its other private label brands would lead a consumer to believe that the product is a private label snack,not a product manufactured by the grays.the differences noted by the district court were not the technical differences implied by a comparison.rather,the differences in the two packages and the general impression each creates are not similar.the district court finding that the gray trade dress was not very similar to the meijer trade dress is not erroneous.
evidence of actual confusion 
the district court found that gray admitted that there was no evidence of actual confusion.thus,the court found that this factor favors meijer.gray argues on appeal that the absence of evidence favors neither party.however,such semantic difference has no practical effect as t he nonmoving party burden is to identify a disputed factor or set of factors whose resolution would necessarily be dispositive on the likelihood of confusion issue.marketing displays,at.whether the court says that this factor favors meijer or neither party is of no import in that gray bears the burden to identify disputed factors.this factor does not satisfy that burden.
marketing channels used 
the district court found that t o the extent that the grays attempted to sell their product in meijer stores,the parties had similar marketing channels.this factor favors the grays.meijer argues that it only sells its brand in its stores and that gray product would not be sold in its stores after the initial failure of that effort.thus,this factor should favor meijer or be neutral.gray responds that when it was in business,both parties targeted retail consumers of pop
