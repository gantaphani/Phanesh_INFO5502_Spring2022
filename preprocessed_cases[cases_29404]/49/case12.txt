the district court dismissed miller yacht sales suit for infringement,statutory and common law unfair competition,and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage,because it concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over appellees.because we conclude that appellees have sufficient contacts with new jersey,we will reverse.
to defeat appellee motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,miller yacht was required to present a prima facie case that jurisdiction existed.mellon bank east psfs ass farino,cir.miller yacht is a new jersey corporation with its principal offices in south toms river,new jersey.miller yacht designs,manufactures,markets and sells boats.specific to this action,miller yacht has designed,manufactured,marketed and sold and marine trader double cabin and sedan yachts.
appellees also sell and market boats,but are not new jersey residents or corporations.beginning in,miller yacht and appellees began negotiating a deal that was intended to allow the appellees to become exclusive marketing representatives and dealers for some of miller yacht boats,including the marine trader yachts during these negotiations,appellees made phone calls from their offices outside new jersey to miller yacht offices in new jersey.additionally,appellees transmitted facsimiles into new jersey,including proposed licensing agreements for the trade names relevant to the negotiations.appellees also traveled to miller yacht offices in new jersey.during one of these trips,donald miller,the president of miller yacht,provided steven smith with a copy of miller yacht sales brochure.that brochure included photographs and floor plans of the marine trader yachts.miller yacht also alleges that it arranged and paid for smith to travel to china to observe the manufacturing process for the marine trader yachts and meet miller yacht business contacts relevant to those yachts.miller yacht claims that appellees sent facsimile transmissions to donald miller as part of the planning activities for smith trip to china.
eventually,the negotiations between the parties reached a standstill and they failed to reach an agreement.miller yacht alleges that appellees misappropriated the photographs and floor plans contained in miller yacht sales brochure,as well as other intellectual property owned by miller yacht,and used it to produce and market boats that are identical to the marine trader yachts.it further alleges that appellees engaged miller yacht business contacts in china to manufacture the boats,and thereby interfered with miller yacht business relationship with those contacts.
based on these allegations,miller yacht sued appellees for infringement,statutory and common law unfair competition,and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage.appellees moved to dismiss miller yacht complaint based on lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue.the district court,without holding an evidentiary hearing,granted appellees motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.this appeal followed.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this action under,and.we have appellate jurisdiction over the district court final order under and review the district court decision de novo.pinker,at.
a federal court sitting in new jersey has jurisdiction over parties to the extent provided under new jersey state law.see.e see also carteret,at.new jersey statute provides for jurisdiction coextensive with the due process requirements of the united states constitution.court rule c see charles gendler telecom equip.thus,parties who have constitutionally sufficient minimum contacts with new jersey are subject to suit there.see carteret,at.
miller yacht claims that the district court had specific jurisdiction over appellees based on their contacts with new jersey miller yacht concedes that appellees do not have the consistent and systematic contacts with new jersey that would subject them to general jurisdiction in that forum.see pinker,at.
in analyzing miller yacht specific jurisdiction argument,we must examine the relationship among the appellees,the forum,and the litigation.id.at.specific jurisdiction over a defendant exists when that defendant has purposefully directed his activities at residents of the forum and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities.burger king rudzewicz,d internal quotations and citation omitted.a single contact that creates a substantial connection with the forum can be sufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant.id.at.
if these purposeful availment and relationship requirements are met,a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant so long as the exercise of that jurisdiction comport s with fair play and substantial justice.id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted.to defeat jurisdiction based on this fairness inquiry,a defendant must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.id.at.the supreme court has indicated that lower courts addressing the fairness question may consider the burden on the defendant,the forum state interest in adjudicating the dispute,the plaintiff interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.id.internal quotations omitted.
to survive a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the court jurisdiction over the moving defendants.pinker,at.however,when the court does not hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss,the plaintiff need only establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction and the plaintiff is entitled to have its allegations taken as true and all factual disputes drawn in its favor.see also carteret,at.
the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing but did determine,based on the parties submissions and arguments,that miller yacht failed to satisfy its burden because the contacts it presented did not show that appellees purposefully availed themselves of new jersey laws.we disagree based on three important contacts and the context of those contacts.
infringement and unfair competition claims 
first,miller yacht alleges that appellees made trips to new jersey as part of their negotiations.miller yacht claims that during one of these trips smith came to new jersey and received miller yacht sales brochure.the receipt of this sales brochure was appellees first step toward the misappropriation of miller yacht,photos and floor plans.this misappropriation is not only related,but is essential,to miller yacht unfair competition and infringement claims.thus,appellees came to new jersey allegedly to receive the property that they eventually misappropriated and used to injure miller yacht.
second,miller yacht alleges appellees placed the misappropriated photos and floor plans in advertisements in boating magazines circulated in new jersey and in at least one brochure that was sent directly to a potential customer in new jersey.intentionally and directly transmitting the misappropriated property that appellees initially obtained in new jersey back into new jersey is a very strong contact between them and the state.it is also a second essential element of miller yacht infringement and unfair competition claims 
miller yacht also alleges that,at least before appellees misappropriated its intellectual property,appellees were directly engaged in the marketing of boats in new jersey.they attended trade shows in new jersey and adjoining states and advertised in regional boating magazines that were distributed in new jersey.these contacts and the continued advertisements in new jersey provide a nexus between appellees and new jersey,and logically explain why at least one new jersey resident would request appellees sales brochure.while we do not base our holding on these contacts they are not among the three contacts on which we rely,they are relevant to show that the request for sales material that appellees received from a new jersey resident was not a random or fortuitous occurrence upon which jurisdiction may not properly lie.see volkswagen woodson,d holding that one fortuitous act connecting a defendant with a state with which it has no other ties is not sufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over that defendant in that state.
the contacts alleged by miller yacht are sufficient to satisfy the purposeful availment and relatedness requirements of due process with respect to miller yacht infringement and unfair competition claims.
tortious interference claim 
miller yacht also alleges that appellees had substantial and repeated contact with new jersey during the negotiations between the parties.although these negotiations are only indirectly related to miller yacht infringement and unfair competition claims,they are directly related to its tortious interference claim and are the third contact upon which we rely.miller yacht specifically alleges that appellees sent facsimile transmissions into new jersey in order to arrange for smith to travel to china to visit the chinese companies that manufactured the marine trader yachts for miller yacht.miller yacht further alleges that,subsequent to this trip,appellees unlawfully engaged these chinese companies to produce strikingly similar yachts according to the interior and exterior plans and specifications owned by miller yacht,using the molds used to construct said yachts.appellant app.at.miller yacht alleges that appellees engagement of these companies to produce the strikingly similar yachts interfered with miller yacht prospective economic advantage flowing from its own relationship with these companies.
we conclude that appellees contacts with new jersey in setting up their trip to china,coupled with the contacts we found sufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over appellees on miller yacht other claims,are sufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction on the tortious interference with prospective economic advantage claim as well.
we disagree with the argument that these contacts do not support jurisdiction over this claim.first,we do not agree that we must apply an immediate or proximate cause standard to determine whether a claim arises out of a defendant contacts with a forum state and we do not read pinker,vetrotex certainteed consolidated fiber glass products,cir,or remick manfredy,cir,as standing for such a proposition.in pinker,we had to determine whether a foreign issuer and sponsor of american depositary receipts adrs was subject to personal jurisdiction in this country on claims that it misrepresented material facts relevant to those adrs we concluded that because the foreign issuer sponsor ed an adr facility in america,it purposely availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in the american securities market,and thereby established the requisite minimum contacts with the united states.pinker,at internal quotation omitted.importantly,we did not apply a proximate cause test to determine personal jurisdiction.instead,based solely on the defendant sponsorship of the adr facility at issue,an action that was certainly not the proximate cause of the fraudulent misrepresentation,we found that the defendant had the requisite minimum contacts to establish jurisdiction with regard to the plaintiff claims.id.
vetrotex involved contract claims and there are different considerations in analyzing jurisdiction over contract claims and over certain tort claims.remick,at.further,in contract claims we analyze the totality of the circumstances surrounding a contract to determine whether the exercise of jurisdiction over the defendant is proper.id.at.we do not consider this totality of the circumstances test to be the equivalent of a requirement that the defendants contacts with the forum be the proximate cause of the plaintiff claims.
remick also does not support a proximate cause standard.remick was a breach of contract case,but involved various tort claims as well.id.at.with respect to those tort claims,we applied the effects test to determine if the defendant was subject to jurisdiction in pennsylvania.id.at.similarly,in imo industries,kiekert ag,we applied the effects test to analyze whether the defendant was subject to jurisdiction in new jersey on the plaintiff intentional tort claims,cir.the focus on the effects test in both these cases convinces us that their requirement that the tortious actions of the defendant have a purpose is not applicable in the more traditional specific jurisdiction analysis.as pointed out in note supra,the effects test expressly requires that the defendant expressly aimed its tortious conduct at the forum,and thereby made the forum the focal point of the tortious activity.id.at.this requirement is reasonable within the effects test because it insures that the defendant,who may not have any actual contact with the forum state,have sufficiently directed his tortious conduct at the state to render him subject to personal jurisdiction there.see id.at.unlike this express requirement in the effects test,the traditional specific jurisdiction analysis simply requires that the plaintiff claims arise out of or relate to the defendant forum contacts.burger king,at.internal quotations omitted.we do not agree with the argument that this traditional requirement is the equivalent of the more demanding relatedness requirement of the effects test.
we recognize that our conclusion that a defendant contacts with a forum need not have been the proximate cause of the plaintiff injuries in a tort case begs the question of what level of relationship is necessary under the arise out of or relate to requirement.we need not address this question that has plagued federal courts of appeals and has resulted in divergent rules.we have not laid down a specific rule because we have approached each case individually and taken a realistic approach to analyzing a defendant contacts with a forum.mellon bank east psfs,ass farino,cir internal quotation omitted see also pennzoil prods.colelli assocs,cir acknowledging the difficulty of formulating rules in the personal jurisdiction analysis and indicating the nature of that analysis.
this is the approach we take here,and conclude that appellees contacts with new jersey are sufficient to subject them to jurisdiction on miller yacht tortious interference claim.first,miller yacht alleges that appellees sent communications into new jersey in order to set up their trip to china.we have been clear that such communications may be factored into the minimum contacts analysis.grand entm t group,star media sales,cir.second,we can not ignore the fact that miller yacht alleges appellees tortious interference resulted from their engaging the chinese companies to build the very boats that miller yacht alleges appellees are using misappropriated photos and floor plans to advertise.as described above,those photos and floor plans were obtained in new jersey and were sent back into new jersey,after having been misappropriated,as part of appellees sales efforts.it is only in selling the boats that miller yacht or appellees could expect to get any kind of economic advantage from the building agreement with the chinese companies.thus,these sales efforts,and their new activities,are vital parts of miller yacht tortious interference claims.the sum of these contacts is sufficient to subject appellees to personal jurisdiction in new jersey on miller yacht tortious interference claim.
we easily conclude that jurisdiction over appellees is consistent with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.there is no compelling evidence of record why it would be unfair or unjust for appellees to litigate this dispute in new jersey.without such compelling evidence,they can not avoid the district court appropriate jurisdiction.
for these reasons,we will reverse the district court order dismissing miller yacht complaint and remand the case to the district court.
i write separately because i would find specific jurisdiction only as to miller yacht unfair competition and trade dress infringement claims against appellees island yacht and mariner yacht.nevertheless,because appellant claims sound in tort,i would remand for the district court to consider appellees forum contacts under the effects test.see imo,kiekert ag,cir.
personal jurisdiction over a defendant may be asserted under general or specific theories of jurisdiction.see helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.because there are no allegations that appellees contacts with the forum are so continuous and systematic as to give rise to general jurisdiction,our inquiry is limited to specific jurisdiction.specific jurisdiction permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendant only if the plaintiff claims arise out of or relate to the defendant forum contacts.burger king rudzewicz,d.consequently,the specific jurisdiction determination is both,see remick manfredy,cir analyzing specific jurisdiction over tort and contract claims separately gehling george sch.of,cir finding personal jurisdiction over fraudulent misrepresentation and emotional distress claims,but not negligence and breach of contract claims,and,see rush savchuk,d the requirements of international shoe must be met as to each defendant.
while acknowledging the claim and nature of the specific jurisdiction inquiry,the majority concludes the allegations in the complaint require us to attribute the forum contacts of any one individual appellee to all of the appellees.the majority reaches this conclusion by inferring the existence of a partnership based upon miller yacht allegations that smith and bogachoff act ed as partners in their negotiations with miller yacht,in which they represented island yacht and mariner yacht,respectively.although we accept all allegations in the complaint as true and construe all disputed facts in favor of the plaintiff on a motion to dismiss under fed.civ.pro.b,i do not believe it is reasonable to infer the appellees engaged in a partnership.
there is no averment in the complaint or in the supporting affidavits that persons and two collectively organized as a partnership.as i read the complaint,the allegation that smith and bogachoff act ed as partners merely suggests some level of coordinated conduct of course,this relationship ultimately may prove relevant to the jurisdictional analysis.see rush,at.t he parties relationships with each other may be significant in evaluating their ties to the forum.but on the allegations and affidavits presented,i can not infer the existence of a partnership that would provide the basis for attributing the jurisdictional contacts of one appellee to them all 
aggregating appellees contacts obscures important differences in their individual forum activities and the alleged conduct giving rise to the claims asserted.for example,smith contacts with new jersey in arranging his trip to china did not involve bogachoff or mariner yacht.moreover,as miller yacht affidavit states,the china trip itself was in furtherance of negotiations that took place between smith,island yacht brokers and miller yacht relating to island yacht becoming an exclusive dealer of marine trader and trade wind yachts in maryland.appellant app.these negotiations did not involve bogachoff or mariner yacht.similarly,the primary forum contact relied upon by the of the miller yacht sales brochure in new apparently attributable only to smith in his capacity as agent for island yacht.even assuming bogachoff had implied authority to act as smith agent during the negotiations with miller yacht,this agency relationship should not provide a basis for imputing forum contacts by smith to bogachoff or mariner yacht.
i recognize the supreme court has rejected overly mechanical or quantitative tests of jurisdiction.int l shoe,at.but even a realistic approach to specific jurisdiction must comport with due process,and due process requires that we consider the forum contacts of each defendant independently according to the specific claims asserted.
even if the alleged contacts could be attributed to all appellees en masse,miller yacht claims do not necessarily arise out of or relate to those contacts.see burger king,at.the courts of appeals have adopted divergent interpretations of arise out of or relate to as that phrase relates to the specific jurisdiction analysis.see united radio mach.workers of am.pleasant,cir describing uncertainty among the circuits see generally mark maloney,specific personal jurisdiction and the arise from or relate to requirement what does it mean,lee.summer.the distinctions between these interpretations are not without constitutional significance,as the arise out of or relate to requirement establishes a due process limitation on the degree of permissible attenuation between the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.shaffer,at.
at one end of the spectrum,the court of appeals for the first circuit has held that with respect to a tort claim,a defendant forum contacts must provide the cause in fact and legal cause for the plaintiff injury.sch.of law,am.bar,cir see also marino hyatt,cir holding that contacts must form a material element of proof in order for the cause of action to arise from or relate to the forum contacts.at the other end of the spectrum,the courts of appeals for the fifth and ninth circuits formulate a more expansive interpretation of arise out of or relate to,under which a defendant forum contacts are sufficient if they provide a but for cause for plaintiff injury.see prejean sonatrach,cir noting that contractual contacts may provide but for causation for a claim sounding in tort doe am.red cross,cir t he but for test is still employed in determining whether a plaintiff injuries arose out of a defendant activities.under this standard,a plaintiff claim arises out of or relates to a foreign defendant contacts with the forum if the defendant forum activities provide a link in the causal chain which ultimately leads to plaintiff injury.
still other courts have navigated a course between these positions.for example,in chew dietrich,cir,the court of appeals for second circuit has suggested a sliding scale approach to evaluating the relatedness of specific jurisdiction contacts,which more closely resembles the but for standard in its potentially expansive scope 
t he relatedness test is but a part of a general inquiry which is designed to determine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction in a particular case does or does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.where the defendant has had only limited contacts with the state it may be appropriate to say that he will be subject to suit in that state only if the plaintiff injury was proximately caused by those contacts.where the defendant contacts with the jurisdiction that relate to the cause of action are more substantial,however,it is not unreasonable to say that the defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction even though the acts within the state are not the proximate cause of the plaintiff injury.
at citations omitted.
by contrast,the court of appeals for the seventh circuit has rejected this sort of hybrid jurisdictional analysis which effectively blends the concepts of general and specific jurisdiction 
we can not simply aggregate all of a defendant contacts with a matter how dissimilar in terms of geography,time,or evidence of the constitutionally required minimum contacts w hen conducting business with a forum in one context,potential defendants should not have to wonder whether some aggregation of other past and future forum contacts will render them liable to suit there.unless their contacts are continuous and systematic enough to rise to the level of general jurisdiction,individuals and corporations must be able to conduct interstate business confident that transactions in one context will not come back to haunt them unexpectedly in another.
rar,turner diesel,cir citations omitted.the supreme court has yet to definitively resolve the appropriate scope of the arise out of or relate to requirement.see carnival cruise lines,shute,d declining to reach the scope of the relatedness requirement despite having certified it for review.
although we have not expressly articulated our view on the arise out of or relate to requirement,our cases implicitly apply an immediate or proximate cause standard.in analyzing jurisdictional contacts on a basis,we have been careful to note that forum contacts supporting a contract claim are not necessarily relevant to establishing jurisdiction over a tort claim.for example,in remick,we noted there are different considerations in analyzing jurisdiction over contract claims and over certain tort claims.at.in that case,we separately analyzed the forum contacts supporting jurisdiction over plaintiff breach of contract,tortious interference with contract,misappropriation of image,civil conspiracy and defamation claims.in finding specific jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim,we noted the contract had been solicited,negotiated,consummated and performed in the forum.at the same time however,we found insufficient contacts to support jurisdiction over plaintiff defamation and misappropriation claims notwithstanding an express contractual relationship between plaintiff and defendant clearly situated in the forum.in finding specific jurisdiction over plaintiff intentional interference with contract claim,we reasoned that although the claim sounded in tort,it was necessarily related to the contract that was the subject of the alleged tortious interference.id.at.
likewise,in vetrotex certainteed consolidated fiber glass prods,cir,we concluded that only dealings between the parties in regard to the disputed contract,not dealings unrelated to the cause of action,are relevant to the minimum contacts analysis.vetrotex involved a breach of contract dispute over payments due under a supply agreement between vetrotex and consolidated fiber glass.the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of specific jurisdiction.we affirmed noting various contracts between vetrotex and consolidated fiber glass over the previous ten years were not sufficiently related to the claims based upon the contested supply agreement to give rise to jurisdiction.the partitioning of jurisdictional contacts evident in remick and vetrotex demonstrates that forum contacts which merely provide a general context for the parties relationship are insufficiently related to a claim to support specific jurisdiction.
moreover,our holding in pinker roche holdings,cir,supports application of the proximate cause standard.in pinker,investors filed a securities fraud class action alleging foreign defendant roche made material misrepresentations and misleading statements in press releases and reports filed with the securities and exchange commission which caused plaintiffs to pay artificially high prices for roche adrs.the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and we affirmed.the majority holds we based our dismissal solely on the defendant sponsorship of the adr facility at issue,an action that certainly was not the proximate cause of the fraudulent misrepresentation.but the misrepresentation claim was not predicated on sponsorship of the adrs per se,but rather on the allegedly fraudulent information roche filed with securities regulators in connection with that sponsorship.in finding roche established minimum contacts by purposefully directing its activities towards the forum,the court noted that a foreign corporation that has created an american market for its securities can fairly expect that that market will rely on reports and media releases issued by the corporation.id.at.the forum contact in pinker reporting incorrect or fraudulent information to federal regulators was the proximate cause of plaintiffs fraudulent misrepresentation claim.
the majority finds specific jurisdiction over appellees based on three important contacts,and the context of those contacts.the first contact concerns miller yacht allegation that smith and island yacht came to new jersey to receive one of its sales brochures.because receipt of the brochure represents the first step towards the misappropriation of miller yacht photographs,floor plans and trade dress,the majority concludes this contact provides a sufficient jurisdictional basis for appellant common law and statutory unfair competition and trade dress infringement claims.i have a different view.
miller yacht unfair competition and trade dress infringement claims relate to misuse of its intellectual property,not to the mere acquisition or possession of that property for example,the lanham act,a,on which miller yacht infringement of trade dress count i and federal unfair competition claims count ii are based,prohibits the use in commerce of any false descriptions or designations of origin which are likely to cause confusion regarding the origin of goods or services of another.id.emphasis added.likewise,the new jersey unfair competition act counts iii and iv prohibits a person from appropriating for his or their own use a name,brand,reputation or goodwill of any maker in whose product such merchant,firm or corporation deals.stat.a claim for unfair competition under new jersey common law count v is substantially similar.american.winback conserve program,cir.
although receipt of the sales brochure by smith and island yacht in new jersey may have provided the first step for miller yacht unfair competition and trade dress infringement claims,this contact at most might supply the but for causation for these claims.the conduct which provides the immediate cause of injury relates to the subsequent improper use of the material contained in the brochure.applying the proximate cause standard,miller yacht unfair competition and trade dress infringement claims against smith and island yacht do not arise out of or relate to receipt of the sales brochure.
the majority observes that plac ing the misappropriated photos and floor plans in boating magazines circulated in new jersey and in at least one brochure that was sent directly to a potential customer in new jersey provides a strong contact in support of appellant unfair competition and trade dress infringement claims.the record reveals that these allegedly improper transmissions into the forum actually involve the use of allegedly misappropriated photographs and floor plans in island yacht advertisements which appear in trade publications distributed in new jersey and the use of allegedly misappropriated photographs by mariner yacht in a sales brochure distributed to a single new jersey resident.see ja.these contacts should be evaluated separately to determine whether they provide a sufficient basis for exercising specific jurisdiction.
advertising in a trade publication that reaches the forum generally does not,without more,provide a sufficient basis for exercising specific jurisdiction over a foreign defendant.see,mesalic fiberfloat,cir noting that defendant marketing strategy,including advertising in national publications distributed in the forum,provided only tangential support for specific personal jurisdiction gehling,at holding that advertising in newspapers which reach the forum are insufficient to establish minimum contacts.moreover,there is no evidence in the record regarding the frequency with which island yacht advertised in these publications,the number of new jersey residents reached,or whether island yacht had any knowledge or control over the extent to which they targeted new jersey consumers.nevertheless,the extent or frequency of advertising in the forum may be less significant where,as here,the plaintiff unfair competition and trade dress infringement claims arose directly out of the improper use of miller yacht photographs,plans and trade dress in commerce.burger king,at.so long as it creates a substantial connection with the forum,even a single act can support jurisdiction.i agree with the majority that the allegations relating to island yacht publication of certain advertisements in trade journals that reached new jersey are sufficiently related to miller yacht unfair competition and trade dress claims as to provide specific jurisdiction over island yacht with respect to those claims.
but there are no allegations or any evidence in the record that appellee smith was involved in this advertising effort or otherwise was engaged in conduct that
