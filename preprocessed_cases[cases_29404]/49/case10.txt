factual and procedural history 
factual history 
this matter comes on before this court on appeal from an order entered august,denying appellant shire shire application for a preliminary injunction in its case against barr laboratories,barr charging barr with trade dress infringement and trade dress dilution under sections a and c of the lanham act,a and c,and state unfair competition laws with respect to shire rights in adderall,an unpatented drug shire manufactures and sells.adderall is a central nervous system stimulant used in treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd available only by prescription and dispensed to patients in pharmacy vials labeled as required by law.adderall is composed of the mixed salts of a amphetamine and is a controlled substance.shire first placed adderall on the market in and since that time it has enjoyed substantial success so that by it had a market share in the united states adhd prescription market 
adderall originally came in two dosage strengths and colors,mg.blue,round and mg.orange,round.the tablets are currently either blue or pale and either round or oval.color and size vary with the tablet strength,seven of which currently are prescribed mg.blue,round,mg.blue,oval,mg.blue,round,mg,round,mg,oval,mg,round,and mg,round.adderall tablets are scored and stamped with the mark ad on one side and the dosage size,on the other.
recently,shire sought a trademark for the adderall trade dress.shire trademark applications sought protection for the overall configuration of the round tablet shape and the colors blue and orange used in conjunction with the ad marking.the united states patent and trademark office uspto initially has refused to register shire configuration 
shire product literature,promotional materials,and mailings,which its sales staff distributed to physicians,feature color pictures of the adderall tablets and sometimes direct patients to examine the tablets to ensure that they have received exactly the drug prescribed.shire does not advertise its products in general consumer publications,but pictures of adderall tablets appear in the physician desk reference and in certain consumer books.while shire continues to sell adderall,it altered its marketing strategy for and discontinued promoting adderall,promoting instead a patented,version of the drug,adderall xr.
barr,a public company that develops and manufactures generic and proprietary pharmaceuticals,was the first manufacturer of a generic equivalent to adderall.it began developing a generic amphetamine salt alternative in and started marketing it in february after submitting an abbreviated new drug application anda to the united states food and drug administration fda and obtaining its approval.the fda has approved barr generic amphetamine salts as safe and effective,and has classified barr product,which it manufactures in accordance with fda regulations,as therapeutically equivalent to adderall.barr product is the bioequivalent of adderall,for which it thus may be interchanged freely.according to shire,however,the products contain different inactive ingredients,and,in particular,barr tablets contain saccharin,a once controversial ingredient the fda only recently removed from its list of banned substances.
barr manufactures its generic amphetamine salts in mg.blue,oval,mg.blue,oval,mg,oval,and mg,oval tablets barr generic amphetamine salts are oval and convex in shape.both the size and the color of barr tablets are linked to dosage.the face of the tablets has a b mark or the trade name barr,and contains a numerical product code.the district court,on the basis of its physical examination of the tablets and the record before it,determined that while barr tablets,like shire,are blue and orange and those colors are keyed to dosage amounts,their shape and markings are different and j uxtaposed against one another,the products are similar though not identical.ja.
procedural history 
on april,shire filed this action against barr,alleging that barr sale of generic amphetamine salts copying adderall appearance constituted unfair competition and diluted shire rights under federal and state law on may,shire filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction precluding barr use of a tablet with an appearance similar to that associated with the appearance of shire adderall tablets.
on june,after the parties had engaged in limited,discovery,the district court heard oral arguments on shire motion.in a comprehensive opinion dated august,the court denied shire motion on the grounds that shire had not credibly carried its burden of establishing that the color and shape of adderall is.therefore the court concluded that shire was not likely to succeed on the merits of its case.the court entered the order denying the motion for a preliminary injunction on august,but subsequently altered parts of its opinion by an amended opinion dated september,which corrected inaccuracies in certain terminology used in the original opinion shire filed a timely appeal on september.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we approach this case recognizing that when ruling on a motion for preliminary injunctive relief,a district court must be convinced that consideration of the four following factors favors the granting of preliminary relief the likelihood that the moving party will succeed on the merits the extent to which the moving party will suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief the extent to which the nonmoving party will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is issued and the public interest.see clean ocean action york,cir at t winback and conserve program,cir.as we have indicated,the district court determined that shire had failed to satisfy the first prong of the test for preliminary injunctive relief,finding that shire was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its trade dress claim because it failed to demonstrate that the product configuration of adderall is,which is one of the factors shire needed to prove in order to prevail in an action for trade dress infringement 
on this appeal we recognize that t he decision whether to enter a preliminary injunction is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court,and will be reversed only if the court abused its discretion,committed an obvious error in applying the law,or made a serious mistake in considering the proof.duraco,joy plastic,cir quoting loretangeli critelli,cir.however,a lthough terms of an injunction are normally reviewed for abuse of discretion,any determination that is a prerequisite to the issuance of an injunction is reviewed according to the standard applicable to that particular determination.john harkins waldinger,cir see at t winback and conserve,at.thus,we review the district court factual determinations for clear error but exercise plenary review with respect to its legal conclusions.see a h sportswear,victoria secret stores,cir.under the clearly erroneous standard,a finding of fact may be reversed on appeal only if it is completely devoid of a credible evidentiary basis or bears no rational relationship to the supporting data.american home prods.barr,cir 
likelihood of success on the merits 
the lanham act,a establishes a cause of action for trade dress infringement.trade dress refers to the design or packaging of a product which serves to identify the product source.see traffix devices,marketing displays,d.the purpose of trade dress protection,like trademark protection,is to secure the owner of the trade dress the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers.two pesos,taco cabana,d citation omitted.
trade dress protection,however,is not intended to create rights in innovative aspects of product design.eppendorf netheler hinz gmbh ritter gmbh,cir.thus,trade dress protection,unlike patent law which is not implicated here,does not foster innovation by preventing reverse engineering or copying of innovative product design features.id.trade dress protection must subsist with the recognition that in many instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products.traffix,at.at.therefore,trade dress protection extends only to incidental,arbitrary or ornamental product features which identify the product source.eppendorf,at.to establish infringement of its unregistered trade dress a plaintiff must prove that the allegedly infringing feature is,the feature is inherently distinctive or has acquired secondary meaning,and consumers are likely to confuse the source of the plaintiff product with that of the defendant product.see wal mart stores,samara,d.
the functionality doctrine accommodates the twin purposes behind the lanham act.it protects the manufacturer and the consumer from the copying of those features that signify a product source and quality and encourages competition by preventing one manufacturer from acquiring a monopoly by attempting to trademark those features of a design essential to a successful product of that type.standard terry mills,shen,cir.however,the definition of functionality has not enjoyed such clarity.see thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed discussing the plethora of definitions for functionality.in traffix,the supreme court set forth two tests for functionality.first,the court recognized the traditional definition of functionality a product feature is functional,and can not serve as a trademark,if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article.traffix,at.at quoting qualitex jacobson prods,d quoting inwood,ives,d.in addition to the traditional definition,traffix recognized a second test for functionality a functional feature is one the exclusive use of which would put competitors at a significant disadvantage.id.quoting qualitex,at.at.
the district court,applying the traditional definition of functionality found that i n reviewing the proofs,the court is not persuaded that the color and shape of shire product is.ja.preliminarily the court noted that,contrary to shire contention,barr did not adopt the identical trade dress developed by shire for its adderall product.id.after an examination of the actual tablets the court found that the products have different shapes and markings and therefore while the products are similar,they are not identical.
in addition,the district court found that the record developed for purposes of this injunctive relief application fails to support the conclusion that shire alleged trade dress is inasmuch as shire falls short on its burden to prove because it has not credibly rebutted barr theory that the similar and shape of the products are particularly meaningful for adhd patients and enhance efficacy.ja.in reaching its conclusion the district court quoted the declaration of lawson bernstein,the affidavit of cheryl blume,and the declaration of gregory drew.
bernstein declaration explains,inter alia,that because adhd patients overuse visual cues,when therapeutically equivalent adhd products have similar visual recognition properties,adult adhd patients will experience less confusion in correctly identifying the agent its dosage strength given that almost all patients require some initial dosage titration and a subsequent substantial majority require intermittent dosage adjustment,the color coding of a particular preparation of mixed amphetamine salts tablets confers a substantial degree of clinical functionality for the patient in the process many adult patients may take multiple daily dosages of different strength amphetamine salts tablets,also inferring the usefulness of similar.
the district court quoted blume affidavit explaining that a generic drug similar appearance to the branded product enhance s patient safety and compliance with the medically prescribed dosing regimen and that safety and compliance would be particularly important for adhd drugs when intermediaries such as school secretaries dispense doses to children treated for adhd.ja.blume affidavit explains that d osage form similarities enhance patient acceptance and points to generic formulations of other central nervous system drugs that are identical or mirror the brand drug in color.id.
the district court also noted that,concurring with both bernstein and blume,the declaration of gregory drew,a registered pharmacist and vice president of pharmacy health services for rite aid corporation,explains that rite aid prefers that the generic tablet look as similar to the branded tablet as possible so as to increase patient acceptance and comfort,as well as compliance and that all other things being equal,rite aid will choose to stock the generic product that most closely resembles the branded product.id.
the district court found that barr has not copied features signifying the adderall source and that the color and shape of barr product are directly linked to the drug efficacy in adhd patients.ja.the court concluded that shire has failed to prove the requisite as an initial step to gaining the desired relief here.id.the court functionality conclusion is a factual finding,see ciba geigy bolar pharm,cir,that may be reversed on appeal only if it is completely devoid of a credible evidentiary basis or bears no rational relationship to the supporting data.american home,at.
shire primary argument is that the district court committed an obvious error by failing to apply third circuit precedent which is contrary to the district court ruling.br.of appellant at.but as barr points out,most of opinions on which shire relies were district court opinions from the early which the court here was not bound to follow.br.of appellee at.in addition,even when shire district court case law is considered for its persuasive value,it does not support its contention that the court committed reversible error as a court must decide each trademark case on its own facts,dresser,heraeus engelhard vacuum,cir,and the cases on which shire relies are distinguishable on their facts.most significantly,though the cases involved prescription drugs,none involved controlled substances and in all of the cases there was evidence of the passing off of the defendant product by pharmacists,see boehringer ingelheim pharmadyne.hoffman la roche,premo pharm,biocraft,merck.american home prods.chelsea,aff,cir table,or of an intent to induce illegal substitution on the defendant part.see ciba geigy bolar pharm,aff,cir shire also relies on our opinion in,premo pharmaceutical laboratories,cir,but also is distinguishable on its facts as in we found evidence of actual passing off by pharmacists.id.at.shire does not make a comparable claim in this case 
it is true that in and several of the other cases on which shire relies,the defendant offered affidavits and declarations of pharmacists and physicians making claims relating to functionality similar to those bernstein,blume and drew have made in this case and that the courts in those cases did not credit the evidence.for example,in shafer,a physician,submitted an affidavit in which he supported the sale of similarly configured generic tablets as he believed this configuration would enable the patient to feel confident that there was no change in the chemistry of the medication and that patients might become uneasy,confused or react adversely if the generic medication looked different from the market innovator.id.at.but we explained that the district court nevertheless apparently chose not to credit the assertion of the shafer affidavit,crediting instead the affidavits of meyerson and tannenbaum that in their experience the appearance of a drug bears no established relationship to its therapeutic efficacy.id.at.does not dictate,however,that we overturn the district court findings of fact in this case because,in contrast to the district court conclusions in,the district court in this case did credit the assertions made by bernstein and blume and drew that were comparable to those of shafer.just as in we deferred to the district court findings of fact it is appropriate for us to do so in this case as well after all,it is inherent in the very nature of the deferential appellate review of findings of fact that a court of appeals can and,indeed,should,depending on the records before it,uphold arguably inconsistent outcomes.
we also point out that while shire is correct that the district court did not discuss most of the case law on which it relies,it concedes that the court did not ignore all precedents in its favor.thus,after quoting at length from bernstein declaration explaining that there is clinical functionality when a generic drug is physically similar to the branded version,testimony which the district court credited,the court cited our opinion in ciba geigy,at,contrasting it as a case affirming finding of where district court found no medical or business considerations compelled the size and shape of a drug.ja.
while district courts in this circuit have rejected functionality arguments similar to those the court credited in this case,other district courts,such as that in ives laboratories,darby drug.have credited similar testimony bearing on functionality.in ives the manufacturer of the prescription drug cyclandelate sought an injunction against manufacturers of generic cyclandelate claiming that the defendants use of the same capsule colors was a false designation of origin or a false description or representation of defendants product.id.at.but the district court in ives found that capsule colors were functional in several respects.first,many elderly patients associate the appearance of their medication with its therapeutic effect second,some patients their drugs in a single container and then rely on the appearance of the drug to follow their doctors instructions third,to some limited extent color is also useful to doctors and hospital emergency rooms in identifying overdoses of drugs.id.at 
the supreme court noted the district court finding of functionality in ives in inwood laboratories,ives laboratories,d,after it granted certiorari and reversed the judgment of the court of appeals which had reversed the district court in addition,citing its opinion in inwood ives in qualitex,the court commented on the functional nature of the color of medical pills stating 
t his court has written that competitors might be free to copy the color of a medical pill where the color serves to identify the kind of medicine,a type of blood medicine in addition to its source.see inwood ives at.at,some patients commingle medications in a container and rely on color to differentiate one from another see also ginsberg,goldberg and greenbaum,trademark and unfair competition law noting that drug color cases have more to do with public health policy regarding generic drug substitution than with trademark law.
qualitex,at.at.
here the district court credited barr evidence that similarity in tablet appearance enhances patient safety by promoting psychological acceptance.we reiterate that we recognize that district courts in this circuit have rejected arguments of functionality similar to those credited by the trial court in ives and by the district court in this case,and that we have affirmed several of those factual determinations as not clearly erroneous.but,as we have said,those cases are distinguishable on their facts.moreover,we have the benefit of the supreme court most recent trade dress decisions which caution against the of trade dress protection.in this regard we point out that there is language in several of the court opinions supporting a conclusion that the district courts in ives and in this case did not err in their functionality conclusions.overall we are satisfied that the district court,after it determined that by being physically similar to adderall barr generic amphetamine salts tablets materially benefitted the patient population,did not clearly err in finding that shire had failed to show that its product configuration was.consequently,shire did not demonstrate its likelihood of success on the merits and the court appropriately denied it a preliminary injunction.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons the order of august,will be affirmed.
in addition to adderall,adderall xr,and barr generic amphetamine salts,other currently marketed products used in the treatment of adhd include ritalin,ritalin sr,methylin generic branded methylphenidate,generic methyphenidate,dexedrine,cylert,provigil,and concerta.
the uspto refused to register shire configuration because the proposed mark appears to be functional.ja.the examining attorney reached that conclusion because the proposed mark consists of a design feature of the identified goods which serves a utilitarian purpose,namely,to hold contain pharmaceutical preparations used for the treatment of attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity.id.the examining attorney letter goes on to explain that a mark may be functional in two senses de jure and de facto.if a mark is de jure functional it is unregisterable.if a mark is merely de facto functional it may be registerable if it is either inherently distinctive or has acquired distinctiveness.the examining attorney found that shire proposed mark is not inherently distinctive,ja,and thus determined that even if the proposed mark was de facto and not de jure functional it only would be registrable with a showing of acquired distinctiveness.it appears that shire did not submit evidence of acquired distinctiveness.
the fda rates a generic product ab equivalent to its branded counterpart if a study is submitted demonstrating bioequivalence to the branded product.barr generic product has an ab equivalency rating from the fda.
for barr product to be approved as a generic equivalent for adderall,it was required to produce the same dosage strengths available for adderall.shire,however,launched its dosages,mg.and mg.after barr filed its anda with the fda.in an internal memorandum,shire indicated that its motivation for introducing these new strengths was to buy time to protect market share because generic substitutes would not be available for all strengths,thereby minimizing competition from substitutes.
barr chose the oval shape for its generic tablets without knowing that shire planned to use an oval configuration for two of its new dosages.shire does not assert any trade dress claims with respect to these new dosages.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and,a,and b.we have jurisdiction under a.
the district court also found that inasmuch as a trade dress dilution claim similarly requires a showing of.shire was unlikely to prevail on that claim.in addition,the district court denied as moot two motions by barr to strike materials that shire submitted in support of its motion for injunctive relief inasmuch as the court determined that shire was not entitled to a preliminary injunction.
shire suggests that the district court amended opinion was the product of an improper communication between the court and barr attorney.see br.of appellant at the opinion was subsequently altered after a communication by barr attorney to the court which was not shared with shire counsel,and a new written opinion was issued dated september.we,however,have compared the opinions and determined that the district court made only minor terminological changes in the amended opinion.see ja and ja sought a trademark application for the adderall trade dress changed from applied for trademark protection regarding adderall.its trademark application seeks protection only for the product colors and shapes when used together with the ad marking changed from its patent application seeks protection only for the product colors and shapes when used together with the ad marking and ja,and ja,its trademark applications changed from its patent applications.the court added a new footnote at the outset of its amended opinion explaining why it issued the opinion.this addition had the effect of changing the number of the subsequent footnotes so that footnote in the amended opinion corresponds to footnote in the original opinion.
the other factors relate to secondary meaning or acquired distinctiveness and likelihood of product confusion.see traffix devices,marketing displays,d.
shire suggests,citing our opinion in scott paper scott liquid gold,cir,that b ecause there was no live testimony and this case involved only documentary evidence,this court is in an equally good position as the district court to evaluate the evidenc
