background 
eppendorf is a german company which manufactures medical and laboratory equipment.at issue in this case is eppendorf line of disposable pipette and dispenser syringes capable of accurate and rapid multiple dispensing of liquids.eppendorf disposable pipette tips are sold in the united states marked with the combitips,eppendorf and eppendorf combitips hereinafter referred to as combitips.eppendorf manufactures eight combitip sizes,from milliliters to milliliters.all eight sizes are designed to fit into the combitip dispenser syringe.by attaching a combitip to the dispenser syringe,a user can rapidly dispense liquids in precisely measured aliquots.
ritter is a german manufacturer specializing in plastic products.in the early,ritter began manufacturing disposable pipettes virtually identical to the combitips.at that time,there was a large american market for disposable pipettes,and the market was dominated by eppendorf ritter,through its american distributor,rk manufacturing,entered the american market in march of.ritter disposable pipettes were marked with the ritips hereinafter ritips and distributed in boxes marked with ritips and ritter name.ritter also introduced its own dispenser syringe,known in the market as the ripette.however,the ritips were compatible with eppendorf combitip dispenser syringe,and the ritips were marketed as a direct replacement for combitips.ritter priced its ritips below eppendorf combitips in an attempt to acquire market share from eppendorf.
in june of,eppendorf filed suit in the eastern district of new york against ritter and rk,asserting various trademark and trade dress infringement claims under a of the lanham act,a.eppendorf suit was transferred to the southern district of mississippi.eppendorf alleges that ritter infringed on its trade dress rights by slavishly mimick ing the design and trade dress of the entire family of eppendorf combitips.second amended complaint at.eppendorf contends that ritter infringed upon eight elements of the combitips trade dress the flange on top of the tip the fins connecting the flange to the body of the tip the plunger head the plunger the length of the tips the eight sizes of the tips the coloring scheme on the tips and the angle of the stump on the tips.eppendorf also contends that ritter willfully and intentionally infringed upon its trade dress rights.

ii.discussion 
the lanham act,establishes a cause of action for trade dress infringement.trade dress refers to the design or packaging of a product which serves to identify the product source.traffix devices,marketing displays,d.the purpose of trade dress protection,like trademark protection,is to secure the owner of the trade dress the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing products.two pesos,taco cabana,d citation omitted.
trade dress protection,however,is not intended to create rights in innovative aspects of product design.trade dress protection,unlike patent law,does not foster innovation by preventing reverse engineering or copying of innovative product design features.see thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed.unlike patent law,the purpose of trademark and trade dress law is to prevent customer confusion and protect the value of identifying symbols,not to encourage invention by providing a period of exclusive rights.trade dress protection must subsist with the recognition that in many instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products.traffix,at.at.therefore,trade dress protection extends only to incidental,arbitrary or ornamental product features which identify the source of the product.if a product feature is functional,it can not be protected trade dress.unless protected by patent or copyright,functional product features may be copied freely by competitors in the marketplace.id.allowing competitors to copy will have salutary effects in many instances.reverse engineering often leads to significant advances in technology.id.citing bonito boats,thunder craft boats,d.
the lanham act expressly limits the scope of trade dress protection by providing that the person who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that the matter sought to be protected is not functional.a.the requirement of prevents trademark law,which seeks to promote competition by protecting a firm reputation,from instead inhibiting legitimate competition by allowing a producer to control a useful product feature.qualitex jacobson products,d.protection of functional product features is the province of patent law,which confers a monopoly over new product designs for a limited time only,after which competitors are free to copy at will.abercrombie fitch stores,american eagle outfitters,cir citing qualitex,at.
it is clear that functional product features do not qualify for trade dress protection.however,the definition of functionality has not enjoyed such clarity.see thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed.discussing the plethora of definitions for functionality.in traffix,the supreme court recognized two tests for functionality.first,the court recognized the traditional definition of functionality a product feature is functional,and can not serve as a trademark,if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of an article.traffix,at.citations omitted.under this traditional definition,if a product feature is the reason the device works,then the feature is functional.id.at.the availability of alternative designs is irrelevant.id.at.
in addition to the traditional definition,traffix recognized a second test for functionality a functional feature is one the exclusive use of which would put competitors at a significant disadvantage.id.at.quoting qualitex,at.this competitive necessity test for functionality is an expansion of the traditional test.id.the court emphasized,however,that the competitive necessity test is not a comprehensive definition of functionality.id.at.the primary test for functionality is the traditional test,and there is no need to consider the competitive necessity test where a product feature is functional under the traditional definition.id.at.
eppendorf correctly argues that before traffix,this circuit had adopted a utilitarian test of functionality.under this utilitarian test,t he ultimate inquiry concerning functionality is whether characterizing a feature or configuration as protected will hinder competition or impinge upon the rights of others to compete effectively in the sale of goods.sicilia di biebow cox,cir citation omitted see also,pebble beach tour i,cir sunbeam products,west ben
