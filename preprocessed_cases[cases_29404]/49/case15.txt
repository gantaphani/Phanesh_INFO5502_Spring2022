the scott fetzer company owns the kirby company,a manufacturer of vacuum cleaners,as well as the kirby trademark and service marks.house of vacuums is an independent vacuum cleaner sales and repair shop located in san antonio.scott fetzer sued house of vacuums for unfair competition,trademark infringement,and trademark dilution after house of vacuums used the kirby mark in an advertisement.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of house of vacuums on scott fetzer unfair competition and trademark claims but refused to award attorneys fees to house of vacuums.
we agree with the district court that no reasonable jury could conclude that house of vacuums misappropriated the kirby mark in any way.we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorneys fees to house of vacuums.therefore,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
house of vacuums sells new,used,and reconditioned vacuum cleaners of several brands.earl farmer,the owner and sole employee,repairs all types of vacuum cleaners.house of vacuums is not an authorized kirby distributor or service center,but farmer typically repairs at least one kirby vacuum cleaner per day and occasionally sells new and slightly used kirby vacuum cleaners that he has acquired from kirby distributors or through.
scott fetzer and house of vacuums first clashed in,when scott fetzer complained to farmer about a house of vacuums yellow pages ad that depicted,among other brand logos,the kirby logo.following an exchange of letters,scott fetzer sent farmer a proposed agreement.the agreement provided that farmer advertisement could use the word kirby but not the kirby logo so long as the ad did not create an impression of authorization,affiliation,or sponsorship.the agreement also provided several examples of acceptable use of the kirby mark.farmer neither signed nor returned the agreement but claims to have resolved the dispute informally through phone calls to scott fetzer representatives.in any event,scott fetzer took no further action.
farmer reviewed the examples of acceptable use listed by scott fetzer in the proposed agreement and created a yellow pages ad that,with insignificant changes,has run ever since.the version of that ad is the subject of the current litigation.the ad begins with the name house of vacuums in large letters.below this title,two lines new used rebuilt and sales service parts supplies bracket a list of thirteen different vacuum cleaner brand names,one of which is kirby.a cloud encapsulating the words one day service all makes models hovers to the right side of this listing,and a picture of a nondescript vacuum cleaner sits to the left side of the listing.the ad concludes with a promise of free estimates,a telephone number,an address,and a rudimentary map.
in january,scott fetzer sent a letter objecting to the yellow pages ad.the letter demanded that house of vacuums cease and desist all use of the kirby mark and disconnect its telephone number.farmer refused these demands and reminded scott fetzer attorneys of the parties previous interactions.neither party yielded.
in august,scott fetzer filed a federal suit alleging,under texas and federal law,trademark infringement,unfair competition,and trademark dilution.house of vacuums moved unsuccessfully to dismiss,then filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that house of vacuums had not infringed or diluted the kirby mark that laches,estoppel,waiver,and acquiescence barred scott fetzer claims and that scott fetzer abandoned the kirby mark.house of vacuums moved for summary judgment,and scott fetzer moved for partial summary judgment solely on the issue of consumer confusion,an issue relevant to trademark infringement.
the district court granted summary judgment to house of vacuums on all scott fetzer claims and denied scott fetzer.with respect to scott fetzer unfair competition and trademark infringement claims,the district court ruled that the ad did not infringe the kirby mark because the ad did not create a likelihood of consumer confusion.with respect to scott fetzer trademark dilution claims,the district court ruled that both federal and texas law require a showing of actual dilution and that scott fetzer had made no such showing.finally,the district court found that scott fetzer did not bring its claims in bad faith and therefore refused to award attorneys fees to house of vacuums.
scott fetzer appealed the grant of summary judgment in favor of house of vacuums and the denial of its own motion for partial summary judgment.house of vacuums the denial of attorneys fees.
ii.trademark infringement,unfair competition,and trademark dilution 
we turn first to the district court grant of summary judgment,which we review de novo,new orleans assets,woodward,cir.we grant summary judgment only if the case presents no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,but if no reasonable juror could find for the nonmovant,then summary judgment is warranted.gallo winery spider webs,cir.because we conclude that no reasonable juror could find for scott fetzer on any of its claims,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment 
infringement and unfair competition 
to prove trademark infringement and unfair competition under federal law,scott fetzer must show that the use of the kirby mark by house of vacuums is likely to cause confusion among consumers as to the source,affiliation,or sponsorship of house of vacuums products or services.see west supp id.a west westchester media prl usa holdings,cir.a likelihood of confusion means that confusion is not just possible,but probable.westchester,at.the likelihood of confusion standard also governs scott fetzer claims for trademark infringement and unfair competition under texas law.see id.at elvis presley,capece,cir.
scott fetzer complaints focus on the house of vacuums yellow pages ad.scott fetzer argues that the words new and kirby,though not juxtaposed,suggest that house of vacuums sells new kirby vacuum cleaners.according to scott fetzer,this suggestion is likely to confuse consumers in two ways.first,scott fetzer asserts that house of vacuums can not truthfully claim to sell new kirby vacuum cleaners because only kirby dealers are authorized to sell new kirby vacuum cleaners.second,scott fetzer alleges that the yellow pages ad will create a false impression of affiliation or sponsorship.neither argument withstands scrutiny.
house of vacuums may use the kirby mark to advertise that it sells new kirby vacuum cleaners.independent dealers and repair shops may use a mark to advertise truthfully that they sell or repair certain branded products so long as the advertisement does not suggest affiliation with or endorsement by the markholder.see trail chevrolet,motors,cir per curiam accord volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft church,cir see generally thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks unfair competition ed for all its bluster about authorization,scott fetzer admits that new kirby vacuum cleaners sometimes reach independent dealers.these leaks in scott fetzer distribution chain are well documented.see scott fetzer williamson,cir.in light of this admission,scott fetzer can not rebut summary judgment evidence showing that house of vacuums sometimes obtains new kirby vacuum cleaners,albeit without authorization,and resells them to customers because house of vacuums sells new kirby vacuum cleaners,house of vacuums may use the kirby mark to advertise that fact so long as the advertisement does not suggest affiliation with or endorsement by scott fetzer.
the critical question is whether the advertisement suggests affiliation or endorsement.in assessing whether use of a mark creates a likelihood of confusion as to affiliation or endorsement,we consider the digits of confusion,a list of factors that tend to prove or to disprove that consumer confusion is likely.westchester,at.those factors are the type of mark allegedly infringed the similarity between the two marks the similarity of the products or services the identity of retail outlets and purchasers the identity of the advertising media used the defendant intent and any evidence of actual confusion.id.
the digits are a flexible and nonexhaustive list.see id.they do not apply mechanically to every case and can serve only as guides,not as an exact calculus.see pebble beach tour i,cir.for example,consider two yellow pages advertisements by independent vacuum dealers,one reading your kirby headquarters and the other reading sales repairs of kirby vacuums not authorized by kirby.a court applying the digits without regard to context would find that a majority of the digits indicate confusion in both cases.the kirby mark is strong and arbitrary and would thus indicate confusion under the first digit.see elvis,at.the kirby marks used in the ads would be not just similar but identical to scott fetzer kirby mark this similarity would indicate confusion under the second digit,see id.the independent dealers products and services would be identical with those offered by centers this similarity would indicate confusion under the third digit,see id.at.the group of consumers seeking to purchase kirby vacuum cleaners from the independent dealers would overlap almost completely with the group of consumers seeking to purchase kirby vacuum cleaners from authorized dealers this similarity would indicate confusion under the fourth digit,see fuji photo film shinohara shoji kabushiki kaisha,cir.yet while the first advertisement would plainly create a likelihood of confusion as to affiliation,the second one just as plainly would not.
this example illustrates two important aspects of our traditional likelihood of confusion analysis.first,we must consider the application of each digit in light of the specific circumstances of the case otherwise,we risk inadvertently lowering the standard of confusion.see lyons giannoulas,cir holding that court must consider application of digits in light of parody claim even when evaluating a motion for summary judgment pebble beach,at holding that court must consider application of digits in light of comparative advertising claim.whenever an independent dealer advertises that it sells a certain marked product in competition with authorized dealers,several of the digits will appear to indicate confusion even if no confusion is likely.lyons,at noting that first digit would point to confusion in any parody case pebble beach,at recognizing that a number of digits would point to confusion in any comparative advertising case.therefore,we must consider the application of each digit in light of the fact that an independent dealer is advertising marked products.
second,we must consider the marks in the context that a customer perceives them in the marketplace,which includes their presentation in advertisements.elvis,at.context is especially critical in a case like this one.trail chevrolet,at forbidding use of the chevrolet mark as part of the defendant trade name but allowing the defendant to state that it sold and repaired chevrolet cars.prominent and pervasive use of a mark will suggest affiliation,but mere reference to a marked product will not.see pebble beach,at.therefore,in addition to the digits of confusion,the particular context in which the mark appears must receive special emphasis.
with these principles in mind,we turn to scott fetzer proffered evidence of infringement,which focuses on the second,sixth,and seventh digits.even viewed in the light most favorable to scott fetzer,this evidence is not sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find a likelihood of confusion as to affiliation.
scott fetzer first argues that the second digit similarity between the marks supports a finding of likely confusion.the house of vacuums ad uses the kirby mark,so the marks at issue are more than are practically identical as suggested above,however,the second digit proves little about likelihood of confusion when,as in this case,an independent dealer is using a mark to advertise sales and repairs of the marked product.
a review of the ad,in fact,can only hurt scott fetzer case.the context in which the kirby mark appears significantly reduces any chance of confusion.the word kirby is fifth in a list of thirteen brand names and is not especially prominent.therefore,consumers are much less likely to conclude that house of vacuums is affiliated with or approved by kirby than they would be were the kirby mark emphasized in some way.
scott fetzer next argues that house of vacuums intended to confuse consumers,an inquiry relevant under the sixth digit,elvis,at.scott fetzer contends that the district court should have presumed intent to confuse because house of vacuums used a mark it knew to be owned by scott fetzer.in some situations,a showing that the defendant intended to use the allegedly infringing mark with knowledge of the predecessor mark may give rise to a presumption that the defendant intended to cause public confusion.conan,conans pizza,cir.this presumption of bad intent is unreasonable when an independent dealer advertises its sales or repairs of a branded product.in such cases,a defendant will always use the plaintiff mark with knowledge that the plaintiff owns the mark.
scott fetzer also claims to have direct evidence of intent to confuse because farmer admitted that he intended to attract the attention of customers interested in purchasing or repairing kirby vacuum cleaners.according to scott fetzer,these customers would otherwise have patronized dealers and service centers.intent to compete,however,is not tantamount to intent to confuse.house of vacuums has evinced no intent to confuse,so the sixth digit does not support a finding of a likelihood of confusion.
finally,scott fetzer claims to have evidence of actual confusion.to show actual confusion,a plaintiff may rely on anecdotal instances of consumer confusion,see moore bus.forms,ryu,cir,or consumer surveys,see exxon.motor exchange of houston,cir.neither scott fetzer anecdotal evidence nor its survey evidence could reasonably support a finding of infringement.
scott fetzer points to several anecdotes that purportedly indicate consumer confusion as to the affiliation of house of vacuums.for example,farmer deposition and several of scott fetzer affidavits recount instances in which customers have said they thought house of vacuums was an authorized kirby dealer or an authorized kirby repair shop.the problem with these anecdotes,however,is that no competent evidence connects them to any representation by house of vacuums.the record indicates that in many of these instances,customers assumed affiliation based on the fact that house of vacuums the approval of scott rug shampoos and like products.to prove infringement,scott fetzer must ultimately prove that a misleading representation by house of vacuums,as opposed to some other source,caused a likelihood of confusion.see westchester,at requiring that defendant use of mark cause confusion pebble beach,at same sebastian int l longs drug stores,cir refusing to hold unauthorized seller liable for confusion engendered by manufacturer own practices.standing alone,scott fetzer anecdotes are not sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to infer that house of vacuums caused the cited instances of confusion 
the only evidence purporting to link the yellow pages ad to consumer confusion is a survey conducted at scott fetzer behest.the expert who conducted the survey used scott fetzer customer lists to construct a survey universe consisting entirely of san antonio residents who own a kirby vacuum cleaner.the surveyors showed respondents the yellow pages ad in question,then asked,looking at this ad,would you say this company is in any way affiliated with,connected with,sponsored by,associated with or authorized by the kirby company percent of survey participants answered in the affirmative 
we agree with the district court that no reasonable jury could regard the survey presented by scott fetzer as evidence of confusion.in assessing the validity of a survey,we look to two factors first,the manner of conducting the survey,including especially the adequacy of the universe and second,the way in which participants a
