although p rotection of trade dress,no less than of trademarks,serves the lanham act purpose,two pesos.taco cabana,that protection does not extend to designs that are functional.we consider here whether a traction hoist manufactured by secalt,and tractel,collectively tractel qualifies for trade dress protection.we agree with the district court that tractel did not meet its burden to establish nonfunctionality and affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of jiangsu shenxi construction machinery jiangsu.we affirm the district court award of attorney fees to jiangsu upon finding that this is an exceptional case meriting fees.while the line delineating exceptional cases under the lanham act may be murky,this action falls squarely within the realm of exceptional cases contemplated by the act.
factual and procedural background 
tractel manufactures and sells the tirak traction hoist,which is used typically for commercial building projects and external maintenance,like window washing.these devices are commonly affixed to suspended platforms to power the platforms up and down stationary wire ropes.upon discovering that jiangsu,a chinese competitor,exhibited similar looking hoists at a trade show in las vegas,tractel brought suit claiming that jiangsu hoists infringed the trade dress of the tractel traction hoist.the complaint included three counts against jiangsu trade dress infringement under the lanham act federal unfair competition and related state law trade dress and unfair competition claims.this photograph reflects the design of tractel hoist.
tractel alleges that the external design elements of its hoist deserve trade dress protection.it claims as its trade dress a gear box with horizontal fins a cylindrical motor mounted in an position on the cube and partially overhanging the edge of the cube the cylindrical motor including vertical fins on a lower portion and a generally smooth sheet metal upper cover having a control descent lever and top cap positioned over the upper end and supported by rectangular legs a rectangular control box cantilevered to the motor by a square shaped member,the control box positioned over the cube,the control box including controls thereon and a rectangular frame.
in the district court,jiangsu argued that tractel failed to establish that its claimed trade dress was nonfunctional.noting that e ven when viewed in the most favorable light,the admissible evidence submitted by tractel fails to suggest that the alleged tirak trade dress is,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of jiangsu.the district court also found the action to be exceptional under the lanham act and awarded both fees and costs to jiangsu.
discussion 
trade dress protection and nonfunctionality 
trade dress protection under federal law is designed to promote competition.traffix devices,mktg.displays.such protection,however,must subsist with the recognition that in many instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products.id.at.rather,t he physical details and design of a product may be protected under the trademark laws only if they are nonfunctional clamp enco,cir citing vuitton et fils young,cir.were a product functional features protected,then a monopoly over such features could be obtained without regard to whether they qualify as patents and could be extended forever.disc golf ass champion discs,cir citation omitted.
under the lanham act,congress imposes a presumption of functionality,and plaintiff bears the burden of proving.a in a civil action for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the principal register,the person who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that the matter sought to be protected is not functional.therefore,tractel,as the one who seeks to establish trade dress protection must carry the heavy burden of showing that the feature is not functional,for instance by showing that it is merely an ornamental,incidental,or arbitrary aspect of the device.traffix,at.in cases of product design,the supreme court has counseled that design,like color,is not inherently distinctive.wal mart stores,samara.
in conducting the functionality analysis,which is a question of fact,we must be mindful that f or an overall product configuration to be recognized as a trademark,the entire design must be nonfunctional.leatherman tool grp.cooper,cir quoting clamp,at see also tie tech,kinedyne,cir foreclosing a finding of nonfunctionality where the whole is nothing other than the assemblage of functional parts quoting leatherman,at.de facto functionality means that the design of a product has a function,a bottle of any design holds fluid,whereas de jure functionality means that the product is in its particular shape because it works better in this shape.leatherman,at citation omitted.b efore an overall product configuration can be recognized as a trademark,the entire design must be arbitrary or non de jure functional.id.
tractel claims that the overall exterior appearance of its hoist is nonfunctional because the hoist design wherein the component parts meet each other at right angles demonstrates a cubist look and feel.its engineering manager testified that the hoist cube shape was part of the design look and that the fins were supposed to be modern and flashy.tractel touts the singular exterior design that sets its hoist apart from those of its competitors by presenting evidence that its hoist has more square edges and a rectangular look.tractel fundamental misunderstanding which infects its entire argument is that the presumption of functionality can be overcome on the basis that its product is visually distinguishable from competing products.while such distinctive appearance is necessary,it is here insufficient to warrant trade dress protection.
our decision in leatherman is determinative and underscores the fallacy of tractel approach.the court in leatherman was faced with competing multifunction pocket tools that resembled the classic swiss army knife.at.the defendant products contained only small but not particularly visible differences from the plaintiff product.id.nonetheless,we reversed a jury finding of infringement because 
to be sure,the pocket tool has an appearance,as every physical object must.there is no evidence,however,that anything about that appearance other than the leatherman name exists for any nonfunctional purpose.rather,every physical part of the leatherman tool is de jure functional t he evidence showed,as in textron,that the product is in its particular shape because it works better in this shape.
id.at quoting textron,int l trade comm n.
just as in leatherman,tractel hoist has an exterior appearance,as every object must but there is no evidence that anything about the appearance exists for any nonfunctional purpose.rather,every part is de jure functional.a piece of industrial machinery with rectangular components that meet each other at right angles,without more,is wholly insufficient to warrant trade dress protection.it is not enough to say that the design portrays a cubist feel so does a square table supported by four legs.the fins may be attractive but they serve a functional purpose.and the gear box is simply housing.except for conclusory,statements,tractel provides no other evidence of fanciful design or arbitrariness instead,here,the whole is nothing other than the assemblage of functional parts,and where even the arrangement and combination of the parts is designed to result in superior performance,it is semantic trickery to say that there is still some sort of separate overall appearance which is.id.
as evidence of nonfunctionality,tractel points to a united states design patent issued to griefzug hebezeubau gmbh.to be sure,the supreme court has recognized that a producer can ordinarily obtain protection for a design that is inherently source identifying if any such exists by securing a design patent or a copyright wal mart,at design patent protection,which is limited,extends only to any new,original and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.see also manual of patent examining procedure ed.july.such protection extends only to the appearance of the article and not structural or utilitarian features.
courts have uniformly held that a design patent,without more,is insufficient to prove that a design is nonfunctional.see mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed.while a design patent is some evidence of nonfunctionality,alone it is not sufficient without other evidence.in krueger int l,nightingale,judge sotomayor collected cases and concluded that a t best,a design patent can only help rebut the functionality defense it can not do the whole job of proving inherent distinctiveness.the plaintiff still needs to show that,in its market at the time of the alleged infringement,the design is both ornamental and deserving of trade dress protection,overruled on other grounds by landscape forms,columbia cascade,cir.other than conclusory assertions about the design patent,tractel offers no other relevant evidence.because tractel is unable to present evidence of nonfunctionality,it fails to demonstrate that the exterior design and appearance of its hoist deserve trade dress protection.
tractel reliance on the design patent is further problematic for a number of reasons.to begin,tractel baldly asserts its claimed trade dress is protected by the patent and yet offers no analysis and proffers no evidence of any connection with the design or the designer.nor is there any evidence the patent has been assigned or licensed to tractel,or that tractel has any relationship to the patent.the chain becomes even more attenuated based on the issuance of the patent in the year,more than twenty years after tractel started selling its hoist in the united states.see b a person shall be entitled to a patent unless the invention was on sale in this country,more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states.and finally,tractel purported trade dress does not even match the design in the patent for example,the patent drawings do not contain legs,whereas tractel explicitly claims support by rectangular legs as a distinctive feature.in short,tractel does have a leg to stand on via the design patent.
tractel also criticizes the district court for failing to cite the four disc golf factors in analyzing functionality whether the design yields a utilitarian advantage,whether alternative designs are available,whether advertising touts the utilitarian advantages of the design,and whether the particular design results from a comparatively simple or inexpensive method of manufacture.disc golf,at.these factors certainly illuminate the functionality analysis,but instead of aiding tractel,they further support the district court finding of functionality.
disc golf teaches that a product feature need only have some utilitarian advantage to be considered functional.id.at.tractel claims of its cubist visual effect are undermined by its own engineering witness who testified that numerous features of the claimed trade dress serve a function round motors can accommodate the rotating cylindrical shaft,vertical fins can dissipate heat,and the top cap can keep water and debris from falling into the fan.absent is any evidence that these functional aspects of the trade dress were adorned with arbitrary,ornamental embellishments instead,tractel claims that the exterior design has nothing to do with how the hoist functions internally and that customers consider how the hoist performs,not how it looks.this argument undercuts tractel position by demonstrating that hoists are fungible goods for which customer preferences do not depend on visual features.see tie tech,at differentiating between features that constitute the benefit that the consumer wishes to purchase,which is unprotected,from artificial embellishment,which has trademark significance.since at least some and in this case significant utilitarian advantage stems from the visual appearance,the presumption of functionality remains intact.
under the second disc golf factor,a lack of alternative designs favors a finding of functionality.it is undisputed that tractel competitors market and sell hoists that look similar,but not identical,to the tractel hoist.this does not help tractel because e ven though many of the competitor hoists likely are highly functional and useful,none of them offer exactly the same features as tractel hoist.leatherman,at.for example,a particular alternative design might be smaller or larger than tractel hoist.as such it may be preferred by a customer looking either for a easily maneuverable hoist,or a heavier duty hoist.the same considerations apply to differences in maintenance costs and ease of storage.unfortunately for tractel,a customer preference for a particular functional aspect of a product is wholly distinct from a customer desire to be assured that a particular entity made,sponsored,or endorsed a product.whereas the latter concern encompasses the realm of trademark protection,the former does not.tie tech,at quoting leatherman,at.
next,advertising that touts the utilitarian advantages of the tractel design points to functionality.tractel advertising specifically claims that the angular construction of its hoist a llows for easier maintenance.the hoist does not roll off of the table.service people love it.this direct utilitarian advantage of the angular design favors functionality.
we consider last whether the particular design results from a comparatively simple or inexpensive method of manufacture.since manufacturing costs are generally the same in the hoist industry,about per hoist,this factor is neutral.
jiangsu contends that alternative designs are subsumed by competitive necessity and therefore need not be considered.as the supreme court noted in inwood,ives,a product feature is functional if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article.the court later explained that w here a product design is functional under the inwood formulation there is no need to proceed further to consider if there is a competitive necessity.traffix,at.thus,a determination of functionality under inwood may be seen as short circuiting some of the disc golf factors.see au tomotive gold,volkswagen of,cir as to functionality,we read the court decision in traffix to mean that consideration of competitive necessity may be an appropriate but not necessary element of the functionality analysis.
nonetheless,even if the disc golf factors are somewhat more expansive than the inwood formulation,they do not aid tractel in meeting its burden of demonstrating.tractel hoist is,at bottom,a utilitarian machine with no indication that the visual appearance of its rectangular exterior design is anything more than the result of a simple amalgamation of functional component parts.absent are any indicia of arbitrary or fanciful design.to uphold a finding of infringement here would suggest that the general appearance of almost any unpatented product rarely if ever could be copied faithfully.that is not the law.leatherman,at.the form of tractel hoist follows its function,making the hoist a classic example of de jure functionality.we affirm the district court determination that tractel did not present evidence sufficient to create a triable issue as to the nonfunctionality of its claimed trade dress.
ii.exceptionality and attorney fees 
section a of the lanham act provides that t he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.a.an action may be considered exceptional w hen a plaintiff case is groundless,unreasonable,vexatious,or pursued in bad faith.stephen boney,boney,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs were unable to provide the court with any evidence to support their assertion that the trade dress was not functional.it further found that 
t he mere absence of bad faith on tractel part does not render it ineligible for attorney fees.tractel does not provide the court with any evidence that there were debatable issues of law and fact with regards to the trade dress.they assert rights in the design patent to rebut the defendant unreasonable argument,yet fail to produce evidence that they own the design patent or t
