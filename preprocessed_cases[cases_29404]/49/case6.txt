in this trade dress infringement case under a of the lanham trademark act lanham act,a,nora beverages,nora appeals from a summary judgment order granted by the united states district court for the district of connecticut,ellen bree burns,judge.nora also appeals the verdict against it on its breach of contract claim.because we agree with the district court that nora failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding likelihood of confusion and because we believe that the court evidentiary rulings were not manifestly erroneous,we affirm.
background 
this dispute involves the trade dress of plastic bottles used for packaging spring water.because this case comes before our court for a second time,we assume familiarity with the facts set forth in our previous opinion,and we address only those facts that are necessary and unique to this appeal.see nora beverages,perrier group of,nora beverages i,cir.
before going into bankruptcy,nora was a canadian company engaged in the business of bottling spring water,which it marketed and sold under the brand name naya.since beginning its operation in,nora bottled its water in clear,ribbed plastic bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate pet.pet is a clear,strong and resin that was developed in the early by dupont and is now widely used among bottled drink manufacturers.the ribbed bottles are endowed with a waist that creates what nora refers to as a bottle upon bottle effect a dark blue label with the block letters naya outlined in white is wrapped around the upper third of the bottle.
the perrier group of america,pga is also engaged in the business of bottling water.through its subsidiaries poland spring,zephyrhills,arrowhead and calistoga,pga sells various regional brands of bottled water throughout the united states.although these subsidiaries sold bottled water prior to nora entry into the market,they did not sell bottles until afterwards.
wishing to enter the bottle market,pga negotiated with two bottle manufacturers to purchase pet bottles for its spring water.after pga chosen manufacturer was unable to perform the work,pga entered into contract negotiations with nora for the supply of plastic bottles.these negotiations fell through,and pga ultimately purchased its bottles from another producer.
nora filed a complaint against pga on december,alleging,inter alia,trade dress infringement and breach of contract.on december,the district court granted summary judgment and dismissed nora trade dress and state law claims against pga and other defendants.
on december,this court partially vacated and remanded for further findings the district court rulings on the trade dress claim and on one related state statutory claim.we remanded in order to allow the district court to conduct a full analysis of the polaroid test used to determine likelihood of confusion.see nora beverages i,at.
as instructed,the district court on remand applied the polaroid factors.the court found that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that no reasonable juror could find that there was a likelihood of confusion between nora bottle and the pga brand bottles.accordingly,on october,the district court granted pga summary judgment on the trade dress infringement claim.on may,the court entered a judgment on jury verdict in favor of pga on the contract claim.
on appeal,nora argues that the district court improperly dismissed its claim for trade dress infringement a by reconsidering the issue of distinctiveness and finding nora bottle to be generic,b by applying the wrong legal standard for likelihood of confusion,and c by considering issues of arguable fact in applying the polaroid factors and that the jury verdict in pga favor was predicated on erroneous evidentiary rulings.
discussion 
we review de novo grants of summary judgment.see nora beverages i,at.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and when,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the party,no reasonable trier of fact could disagree as to the outcome of the case.see nabisco,cir nora beverages i,at.
i.the trade dress infringement claim 
section a of the lanham act protects trade dress a product trade dress encompasses the overall design and appearance that make the product identifiable to consumers.see nora beverages i,at quoting too,gemmy indus,cir.a product trade dress is protected under the lanham act if it is not functional and if it is either inherently distinctive or has acquired secondary meaning in the marketplace.see two pesos,taco cabana,d.
owning a protectable trade dress is not sufficient for a finding of trade dress infringement in order to prevail on an infringement claim,a plaintiff must also prove that the allegedly infringing product is likely to confuse consumers as to its source or sponsorship.see nabisco,at nora beverages i,at.
in this circuit,likelihood of confusion is determined by the test set out in polaroid polarad elecs,cir.the list of polaroid factors includes 
the strength of the prior owner mark,the degree of similarity between the two marks,the proximity of the products,the likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the gap between the two products,actual confusion,and the reciprocal of defendant good faith in adopting its own mark,the quality of defendant product,and the sophistication of the buyers.
the polaroid analysis is not a mechanical measurement.see squibb,cir.when conducting a polaroid analysis,a court should focus on the ultimate question of whether consumers are likely to be confused.paddington attiki imps,cir.in making this determination,a court looks to the totality of the product.see squibb,at.although no one factor is necessarily dispositive,any one factor may prove to be so.see nabisco,at finding dispositive on review of summary judgment the similarity of marks factor in polaroid analysis.
it is important to keep in mind that the lanham act must be construed in the light of a strong federal policy in favor of vigorously competitive markets.landscape forms,columbia cascade landscape forms ii,cir.when evaluating trade dress claims,courts must not lose sight of the underlying purpose of the lanham act,which is protecting consumers and manufacturers from deceptive representations of affiliation and origin.id.at.as the supreme court recently noted,t rade dress protection must subsist with the recognition that in many instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products.in general,unless an intellectual property right such as a patent or copyright protects an item,it will be subject to copying.traffix devices,mktg.displays,d.
inherent distinctiveness 
in nora beverages i,we concluded that the district court improperly found on summary judgment that nora bottle was generic and not inherently distinctive.see at.we based our conclusion in part on the fact that in making its determination,the court relied on stricken testimony that evian had sold its spring water in the united states in clear,ribbed pet bottles since.see id.
on remand,the district court reconsidered the issue of distinctiveness and found that nora bottle was generic as early as because it was used,with minor variations,throughout the entire market of similar products the court based its finding on testimony regarding evian sales and on evidence that prior to,north country,another competitor in the bottled spring water market,was selling its spring water in bottles that nora had manufactured and sold to north country.
nora argues that the district court defied our directive in nora beverages i by reconsidering the issue of distinctiveness.to the extent that nora interprets this court earlier discussion as an affirmative finding that nora bottle was distinctive,nora misreads the opinion.we held in nora beverages i not that nora bottle was in fact distinctive,but that on the facts properly before it at that time,the district court could not support a finding on summary judgment regarding distinctiveness.see at.
nora further argues that by relying upon evidence of the north country sales,the district court disobeyed a footnote in nora beverages i in which we stated that evidence of sales to north country would support a finding that nora trade dress was generic but,in light of the other evidence in the record,would not be conclusive.at.had the court on remand relied solely upon the north country evidence,nora argument might be more persuasive.but it did not.in addition to the north country evidence,the district court also considered the evidence of evian sales of ribbed pet bottles prior to,which,for the first time,was properly before the court.
however,even were we to assume that nora bottle was distinctive in and therefore protected,it would not matter in light of our conclusion that a reasonable trier of fact could not find for nora on the likelihood of confusion prong of its trade dress infringement claim.
likelihood of confusion 
in nora beverages i,we remanded in order to allow the district court to conduct a full analysis of the polaroid factors to determine whether there was a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the pga brand bottles.see at.we recognized on nora first appeal that the district court might validly grant summary judgment in favor of pga on remand 
t he defendants contend that,because of the prominence of the labels on the bottles at issue,no rational trier of fact could conclude that there is a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of defendants products.we believe that the district court should consider this argument in the context of its assessment of the remaining polaroid factors.nothing in this opinion precludes the district court on remand from granting summary judgment to perrier should it determine on review of all the material evidence that nora trade dress was functional,or there are no issues of fact on likelihood of confusion.
as instructed,the district court on remand analyzed each of the polaroid factors and found that there was no likelihood of confusion between the naya bottle and the pga brand bottles.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment to pga.we affirm 
nora argues that the district court misstated this circuit standard for granting summary judgment on likelihood of confusion by requiring the plaintiffs to show a probability of confusion,not a mere possibility.nora argument is unavailing.as we noted in estee lauder v.the gap,a l ikelihood of confusion means a probability of confusion it is not sufficient if confusion is merely possible,cir quoting mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,at to see also streetwise maps,vandam,cir to support a finding of infringement,a probability of confusion,not a mere possibility,must exist.a probability of confusion may be found when a large number of purchasers likely will be confused as to the source of the goods in question.citations omitted.
the standard of likelihood of confusion does not change on summary judgment,as nora argues.the fact that on summary judgment the evidence must be construed in a light favorable to the party does not modify the standard itself,which requires a showing of a probability,or likelihood,of confusion.
nora also contends that the district court resolved issues of arguable fact regarding some of the polaroid factors in favor of pga,thereby improperly granting summary judgment to pga.we address individually nora principal arguments.
similarity between the marks 
nora argues that the district court put undue emphasis upon the naya label in making its determination that consumers would not be confused as to the source of the respective products.nora contends that the virtually identical bottle shapes preclude summary judgment in favor of pga.we disagree.
as we noted in nora beverages i,perrier labels must be considered in the likelihood of confusion analysis.at.labels can be integral,if not dispositive,factors in determining overall similarity of trade dress.see nabisco,at stating that the similarity of marks factor can be dispositive and will warrant summary judgment for an infringement defendant if the court is satisfied that the marks are so dissimilar that no question of fact is presented.quoting res.developers,statue of island,cir,random house,cir holding that defendant logo precluded a finding of similarity likely to confuse squibb,at finding that despite similar trade dress elements,the prominence of the trade names on the two packages weighs heavily against a finding of consumer confusion.
while it is true,as nora points out,that labels alone can not insulate an infringer,samara,stores,cir,rev on other grounds,d,we have repeatedly held that the appropriate test for similarity of trade dress is the overall impression of the products and the entirety of the trade dress,and that a mark may not be dissected in order to prove similarity.see nabisco,at,at squibb,at.
nora cites to lucien lelong,george button lucien lelong i,to support its argument that dissimilar labels can not overcome the infringing similarity in bottle shape.while this may be the case in certain circumstances,the facts here are quite different from those in lucien lelong there,the plaintiff bottle shape was the predominating,if not the single,mark of origin that had become fixed in the minds of the patrons of the cosmetic market as the distinctive sign of plaintiff manufacture.id.at.at the same time,the defendant infringing label was so small as to be visible only when it is held near the eye.id.at.
the facts in lucien lelong i were so distinctive that in a subsequent case brought by the same plaintiff against a different defendant,we distinguished lucien lelong i,stating that a defendant might use the design of the bottle if there were distinctive signs indicating that it was defendant product.lucien lelong,lander,cir.
here,naya admits that its bottle shape is neither its predominating nor its single mark of origin.the record also indicates that the naya label was heavily advertised in its promotional materials and advertisement campaigns.moreover,pga brand labels are prominently displayed in a bold and colorful manner and do not require close scrutiny to be visible to the human eye.
nora also cites to the trademark analysis in source perrier,waters of saratoga springs,wl,to argue that pga brand labels were insufficient to overcome similarity of marks.in source perrier,the court held that the bottle in question functioned as a trademark and that t he addition of a second trademark here,the defendant label to the infringing trademark the bottle shape does not dissipate the confusion engendered through the use of the infringing trademark.id.at.the bottle in source perrier had been competing successfully in the relevant market for over fifty years prior to the arrival of the infringing bottle,and had attained secondary meaning indicating the plaintiff as the source of the product.id.at.here,nora bottle was a relative newcomer to the market and held only a small fraction of the share therein.likewise,nora has not presented evidence that its from its acquired secondary meaning.
based on the record before us,we find that the presence of the prominent and distinctive labels alone negates any possibility of a likelihood of confusion and provides sufficient basis for affirming the district court grant of summary judgment.consideration of further polaroid factors only strengthens this conclusion.
strength of mark 
nora argues that the district court ignored our ruling in nora beverages i that its mark is distinctive and that the court erred in weighing the strength of its mark.as mentioned above,we reject nora interpretation of our previous opinion as finding that nora bottle was distinctive.we also find that the court was correct to find for pga on the strength of mark factor.
the strength of a particular mark is measured by the degree to which it indicates source or origin of the product.see estee lauder,at squibb,at.the strength of mark analysis should be conducted from the vantage point of the product commercial setting.see too,at.as such,the strength of a particular mark encompasses the totality of the product in the relevant commercial context.
even an inherently distinctive mark can,in its commercial context,lack strength as a mark.see pharm.gillette,cir.sales of a mark to third parties,as in this case,can warra
