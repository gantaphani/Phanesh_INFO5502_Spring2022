joanne slokevage slokevage appeals from the decision of the united states patent and trademark office,trademark trial and appeal board board sustaining the refusal of the examiner to register her trade dress mark for clothing.in re joanne slokevage,serial ttab,final decision.because the board finding that slokevage trade dress was product design and thus could not be inherently distinctive,and that the trade dress was not unitary are supported by substantial evidence,we affirm.
background 
slokevage filed an application to register a mark on the principal register for pants,overalls,shorts,culottes,dresses,skirts.slokevage described the mark in her application as a configuration that consists of a label with the words flash dare in a background,and areas located on each side of the label.the areas consist of a hole in a garment and a flap attached to the garment with a closure device.this trade dress configuration,which is located on the rear of various garments,is depicted below 
although slokevage currently seeks to register a mark for the overall configuration of her design,she has already received protection for various aspects of the trade dress configuration.for example,she received a design patent for the area design.she also registered on the supplemental register a design mark for the area.in addition,she registered the word mark flash dare on the principal register.
the trademark examiner initially refused registration of the proposed mark on the ground that it constituted a clothing configuration that is not inherently distinctive.the examiner afforded slokevage the opportunity to submit evidence of acquired distinctiveness or to disclaim the design elements of the configuration,but slokevage chose not to submit evidence of acquired distinctiveness or to disclaim the design elements.rather,she argued that the trade dress was inherently distinctive.the examiner,relying on section f of the trademark act,f,made final his refusal to register the mark on the ground that the clothing configuration constitutes product,and pursuant to the decision of the supreme court in stores,samara brothers,d,product design can not be inherently distinctive.the examiner noted that slokevage reference in her application to the trade dress as a flap design supported a determination that the configuration constitutes product design.finally the examiner found that the configuration is not unitary,for purposes of avoiding a disclaimer requirement.
slokevage appealed the refusal of the examiner to register the trade dress configuration,and the board affirmed the examiner decision.the board found that the areas,consisting of the holes and flaps,constituted product design.relying on,the board observed that a product design will not be regarded as a source indicator at the time of its introduction.according to the board,slokevage trade dress,as product design,could not be inherently distinctive,and therefore could not be registered absent a showing of acquired distinctiveness.
the board also determined that the trade dress configuration was not unitary and slokevage therefore could not avoid the examiner disclaimer requirement.according to the board,various elements of the trade dress are not so merged together that they can not be divided and treated as separable elements.the board noted that slokevage previously registered the words flash dare on the principal register.because portions of the trade dress were registered separately,the board found that that fact supported a determination that the elements of the configuration were not unitary.the board offered to set aside its decision in accordance with g if slokevage disclaimed the unregistrable holes and flaps portion of the configuration.slokevage declined to do so and subsequently filed a request for reconsideration.the board denied the request,determining that the request amounted to a reargument of the same points made during prosecution before the examiner.
slokevage timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a b.
discussion 
we apply a limited standard of review to board decisions,reviewing legal determinations de novo and factual findings for substantial evidence.in re pacer.substantial evidence requires the reviewing court to ask whether a reasonable person might find that the evidentiary record supports the agency conclusion.careline,am.online.
as a preliminary matter,slokevage argues that whether trade dress is product design or not is a legal determination,whereas the government asserts that it is a factual issue.the resolution of that question is an issue of first impression for this court.we conclude that the determination whether trade dress is product design is a factual finding because it is akin to determining whether a trademark is inherently distinctive or whether a mark is descriptive,which are questions of fact.see,hoover royal appliance,the issue of inherent distinctiveness is a factual determination made by the board see also in re nett designs,placement of a term on the continuum is a question of fact.inherent distinctiveness or descriptiveness involves consumer perception and whether consumers are predisposed towards equating a symbol with a source.see in re mbna am.bank,in re nett designs,at.such issues are determined based on testimony,surveys,and other evidence as questions of fact.determining whether trade dress is product design or product packaging involves a similar inquiry,at.discussing product packaging and design in the context of consumers ability to equate the product with the source.we therefore will defer to the board finding on product design,affirming the board if its decision is supported by substantial evidence.in addition,the inquiry into whether a mark is unitary is a factual determination.see dena belvedere int l,test for unitariness requires the board to determine how the average purchaser would encounter the mark under normal marketing of such goods citations omitted.
trade dress and product design 
on appeal,slokevage argues that the board erred in determining that the trade dress for which she seeks protection is product design and thus that it can not be inherently distinctive.she asserts that the board reliance on the supreme court decision in to support its position that slokevage trade dress is product design is misplaced.in particular,she contends that does not provide guidance on how to determine whether trade dress is product design.moreover,she maintains that the trade dress at issue in,which was classified as product design without explanation,is different from slokevage trade dress because the trade dress implicated the overall appearance of the product and was a theme made up of many unique elements.slokevage argues that her trade dress,in contrast,involves one component of a product design,which can be used with a variety of types of clothing.slokevage further asserts that her trade dress is located on the rear hips of garments,which is a location that consumers frequently recognize as identifying the source of the garment.
the pto responds that the board correctly concluded that slokevage trade dress is product design and that it properly relied on for support of its determination.according to the pto,in the decision the supreme court determined that a design of clothing is product design.the pto further asserts that the trade dress at issue in,which was classified as product design,is similar to slokevage trade dress.the trade dress in consists of design elements on a line of garments,and slokevage trade dress similarly consists of a design component common to the overall design of a variety of garments.the pto notes that slokevage trade dress application refers to her trade dress as a configuration including a clothing feature,and that product configuration is synonymous with product design.the pto also argues that under product design can not be inherently distinctive,the rationale being that consumers perceive product design as making the product more useful or desirable,rather than indicating source.according to the pto,the trade dress at issue here makes the product more desirable to consumers,rather than indicates source.fi
