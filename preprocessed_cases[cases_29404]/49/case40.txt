pool halls conjure up images of green felt tables,lights,and billiard cues.but can a pool hall overall image constitute protectable trade dress to answer that question in this dispute between two pool hall operators,appellant clicks billiards,clicks,and its competitor,sixshooters,sixshooters,we must address whether clicks claimed trade dress was nonfunctional whether clicks trade dress had acquired secondary meaning and whether there was a likelihood of confusion between the two establishments.because there are disputed issues of material fact on each of these three questions,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of sixshooters and remand for trial.
background 
clicks operates a number of billiards establishments in the southwest,including two in the phoenix area.sixshooters opened a single pool hall in the phoenix area in december,sometime after the two clicks facilities were already in existence.daryl chester,a former clicks manager who left to work for sixshooters,was ostensibly involved in the design of sixshooters both before and after he left clicks.clicks presented evidence that chester and others affiliated with sixshooters visited clicks and engaged in detailed inspection and measuring of clicks interior features while the design of sixshooters was being formulated.clicks also claims that sixshooters was built in the path of clicks planned expansion.
in april clicks filed suit under the lanham act,et,alleging that sixshooters infringed its trade dress.in summary judgment proceedings,clicks asserted that the following individual features of its billiard halls,taken collectively,constitute its trade dress 
large floral print carpet pattern and style.
dark mahogany wood finishes.
ceiling and wall covers.
appearance,color,and design of custom lighting fixtures.
millwork details on woodwork.
layout and arrangement of pool tables.
various electrical details as well as air conditioning features to the extent they are part of the look,feel,and appearance of the decor of clicks.
tile color,pattern,and use.
color,shape,and appearance of top and bottom portions of bar.
acoustical wall treatment on lower third of perimeter walls and drink rails.
light to medium colored oak cocktail tables.
drink rails.
signage at front door,including color,content,and font.
standardized appearance of the clicks entry area,including the black and white tile on the floor.
drink rails,cue racks,and wood trim on top of the dark green acoustical wall.
spatial and layout arrangements between the drink rails and the pool tables.
neon beer signs placed on the fur down or soffit above the dark,wall.
the design,color,shape,and placement of the lights over the pool halls,as well as the number and spacing between them.
the design of the bar edge and the raised motifs on the bar.
the coordinated color scheme relating to the acoustical tile ceilings,the light fixtures,and the drink railings.
the color,shape,and location of the ceiling fans.
the location of the bartender relative to the entry way.

internal layout of bar and laminate top of bar.
the type,shape,configuration,and color of the drop ceiling.
both parties conducted extensive discovery,including depositions of employees and patrons of both establishments.clicks submitted photographs of clicks and sixshooters,and the district court conducted visits to the two clicks and one sixshooters pool halls,though not in the presence of the parties or their attorneys.clicks also submitted a survey purporting to provide support for a finding of secondary meaning and likelihood of confusion.the district court granted summary judgment to sixshooters,finding that clicks had not presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact on the basic trademark issues of functionality,secondary meaning,and likelihood of confusion.
standard of review 
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment.balint carson city,cir en banc.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party clicks and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor,we must determine whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law and whether there are any genuine issues of material fact.see id.
trade dress refers generally to the total image,design,and appearance of a product and may include features such as size,shape,color,color combinations,texture or graphics.int l jensen,metrosound,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.it is well settled that restaurants and similar establishments may have a total visual appearance that constitutes protectable trade dress.see,two pesos,taco cabana,d describing protectable trade dress of mexican restaurant as a festive eating atmosphere having interior dining and patio areas decorated with artifacts,bright colors,paintings,and murals fuddruckers,doc others,cir a restaurant decor,menu,layout and style of service may acquire the aspects of protectable trade dress shakey covalt,cir claimed aspects of pizzeria trade dress included menu content,prices,pizza ingredients,and style of preparation.
to sustain a claim for trade dress infringement,clicks must prove that its claimed dress is nonfunctional that its claimed dress serves a role either because it is inherently distinctive or has acquired secondary meaning and that the defendant product or service creates a likelihood of consumer confusion.see disc golf ass n,champion discs,cir fuddruckers,at.the district court held that clicks did not present evidence sufficient to create a triable issue of fact on any of the three elements.we address them in turn.
functionality 
the first hurdle clicks must overcome is functionality.trade dress protection extends only to design features that are nonfunctional.as the supreme court explained,a product feature is functional and can not serve as a trademark if the product feature is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article,that is,if exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a significant,disadvantage.qualitex jacobson prods,d accord traffix devices,marketing displays,d.functionality is a question of fact.fuddruckers,at citing transgo,ajac transmission parts,cir.
although trade dress had already been recognized by courts as worthy of protection under the lanham act,in congress amended the act to make this statutory protection explicit.and,although the amendment took effect after the filing of this case,it confirms the functionality limitation on trade dress 
in a civil action for trade dress infringement under this chapter for trade dress not registered on the principal register,the person who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that the matter sought to be protected is not functional.
a.as the supreme court observed this burden of proof gives force to the rule that trade dress protection may not be claimed for product features that are functional.traffix devices.at.
this court in case bearing many similarities to this considerable light on the precise meaning of functionality in the context of a restaurant trade dress the court stressed the importance of evaluating the establishment combination of visual elements that,taken together,may create a distinctive visual impression.fuddruckers,at quoting falcon rice mill cmty.rice mill,cir.the fact that individual elements of the trade dress may be functional does not necessarily mean that the trade dress as a whole is functional rather,functional elements that are separately unprotectable can be protected together as part of a trade dress.id.quoting le sportsac,mart,cir.
to illustrate,many of the elements that constitute part of clicks claimed trade dress are indeed functional the lamps illuminate the pool tables,and the counters provide a place for customers to place their drinks.clicks can not claim a monopoly in using the particular type of lamps or counters with which it furnished its pool halls.nor can it prevent sixshooters from copying purely functional aspects of the pool hall.it can,however,claim as its mark the particular combination and arrangement of design elements that distinguish it from others using the same concept.id.citing lesportsac,at.as the fuddruckers court further explained,
viewing the elements as a whole does not result in monopoly protection for necessary elements.if fuddruckers were to get protection for its trade dress,which includes such items as directors chairs,white tile,and an open bakery,it could not preclude other restaurants from using those items.it can only prevent competitors from using the items in a way that,viewed as a whole,is likely to confuse consumers.there are many ways to use directors chairs,white tile,open bakeries,and the many other items that make up fuddruckers trade dress that would not cause confusion.
we emphasize here that,in evaluating functionality as well as the other elements of a trade dress claim,it is crucial that we focus not on the individual elements,but rather on the overall visual impression that the combination and arrangement of those elements create.trade dress is the composite tapestry of visual effects.courts have repeatedly cautioned that,in especially trade,the mark must be examined as a whole,not by its individual constituent parts.see,the forschner group,arrow trading,cir w e are not so much concerned with dissecting the competing trade dress and enumerating discrete points of similarity,but rather we focus on the overall image created.union carbide,cir d issecting marks often leads to error.words which would not individually become a trademark may become one when taken together.see also thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.t he issue is not whether defendant package or trade dress is identical to plaintiff in each and every particular.rather,it is the similarity of the total,overall impression that is to be tested.
in addressing functionality in its order granting summary judgment,the district court stated,the overall image of click sic is functional and purely aesthetic,not source identifying.we disagree with this formulation of the functionality inquiry.first,trade dress can not be both functional and purely aesthetic.such a formulation is internally inconsistent and at odds with the commonly accepted view that functionality denotes utility.nor has this circuit adopted the aesthetic functionality theory,that is,the notion that a purely aesthetic feature can be functional.see first brands fred meyer,cir in this circuit,the aesthetic functionality test has been limited,vuitton et fils young,cir,if not rejected,fabrica,el dorado,cir,in favor of the utilitarian functionality test.mccarthy aesthetic functionality is an oxymoron.ornamental aesthetic designs are the antithesis of utilitarian designs.see also leatherman tool group,cooper,cir distinguishing functional from ornamental features 
we do not accept that there is a dichotomy between functional and source identifying.although the evidence relevant to them may overlap,these are two separate aspects of the protectability analysis.whether a feature is functional has no direct bearing on whether it plays a role.the functionality analysis should not be conflated with the inquiry into whether the purchasing public associates the dress with a particular source.fuddruckers,at conducting functionality analysis and then conducting separate secondary meaning analysis.trade dress,of course,can be aesthetically pleasing and still play a role it can also be both aesthetically pleasing and functional.trade dress can not,however,be both functional and purely aesthetic.
we consider several factors in determining whether trade dress is functional whether the design yields a utilitarian advantage,whether alternative designs are available,whether advertising touts the utilitarian advantages of the design,and whether the particular design results from a comparatively simple or inexpensive method of manufacture.disc golf,at.these factors do not translate easily from application in the context of utilitarian product features such as a parabolic chain on a disc golf hole,see,or the configuration of a swiss army tool,see leatherman,at,to application in the context of services,such as a restaurant or a pool hall.neither is the fuddruckers case much help in this regard.there the court did not actually evaluate whether the restaurant trade dress was functional it merely held that it was error for the district court not to instruct the jury as to functionality.see fuddruckers,at.
the discussion of functionality in the fifth circuit two pesos opinion may be most instructive.see taco cabana int l,two pesos,cir,aff,d acknowledging the difficulty of applying traditional functionality analysis in the restaurant context,the fifth circuit pointed out that the usual concern motivating the functionality inquiry,not to allow a merchant to obtain perpetual,protection for a product feature is generally not present in this area the need to avoid monopolization of a design lessens in the area of distinctive trade dress.the wide range of available packaging and design options allows a producer to appropriate a distinctive identity without unduly hindering his competitors ability to compete.id.at quoting sicilia di biebow cox,cir.thus,in that case,where plaintiff taco cabana claimed trade dress protection for the overall image of its restaurant,the fact that many of the individual features of its establishments were functional did not preclude protection,because taco cabana particular integration of elements leaves a multitude of alternatives to the upscale mexican industry that would not prove confusingly similar to taco cabana trade dress.id 
here,then,the ultimate issue on functionality is whether clicks particular integration of elements leaves a multitude of alternatives to the pool hall industry that would not prove confusingly similar to its trade dress.clicks,we conclude,presented sufficient evidence of the arbitrariness and nature of its design decisions and the availability of alternative designs to clear the summary judgment hurdle.the district court,even as it came to the conclusion that sixshooters was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the functionality issue,identified various arbitrary elements of clicks trade dress,among them the size,placement,and layout of the pool tables the color combination,including the contrast between the carpet and the dark wood the lighting the neon beer signs,bar tap handles,and the like the cue racks the selection of video games the floor covering the wall treatment the drink rails and the millwork.to be sure,many of these elements,considered in isolation,may be functional.the issue,however,is whether,taken as a whole,the overall look and feel of the establishment is functional.
as the district court itself stated,clicks alleged trade dress is purely aesthetic,and part of an overall image of an upscale bar within the overall image are several distinct decisions,such as the darkness of the wood,the placement of various items,color choices and patterns.the district court concluded that these decisions are decorative and aesthetic.although the court did go on to state as part of the same sentence that these decisions are not source identifying,as explained above,we address separately the secondary meaning analysis.that the design decisions were made for aesthetic not,for example,because they were the only,the cheapest,or the most efficient way to design a pool evidence of nonfunctionality.
in sum,clicks presented evidence sufficient to raise an issue of fact that the trade dress of its pool halls is nonfunctional.
ii.secondary meaning 
we turn next to analysis of secondary meaning,a term of art for identification of source.as the supreme court elaborated in stores,samara brothers,d,a mark has acquired distinctiveness,even if it is not inherently distinctive,if it has developed secondary meaning.the trade dress of a product or service attains secondary meaning when the purchasing public associates the dress with a particular source.fuddruckers,at.t he elements making up the alleged trade dress must have been used in such a manner as to denote product source.thus,a product feature whose only impact is decorative and aesthetic,with no role,can not be given exclusive rights under trade dress law.mccarthy quoted in stephen boney,boney,cir.whether a particular trade dress has acquired secondary meaning is a question of fact first brands,at.
clicks introduced substantial evidence tending to show that the trade dress of its pool halls had attained secondary meaning.chief among this evidence was a survey commissioned by clicks purporting to demonstrate that patrons associated the look of clicks with that establishment and not others.such surveys,while often subject to criticism and varying interpretations,are a routine and feature of trademark practice.surveys in trademark cases may be considered so long as they are conducted according to accepted principles.stuhlbarg int l sales,john brush,cir see also gallo winery gallo cattle,cir surveys in trademark cases are to be admitted as long as they are conducted according to accepted principles.emphasis added vision sports,melville,an expert survey of purchasers can provide the most persuasive evidence of secondary meaning.technical unreliability goes to the weight accorded a survey,not its admissibility.prudential ins.gibraltar fin,cir.
clicks submitted a survey prepared by sandra cogan,president of cogan research group.according to cogan resume,she has conducted surveys in over eighty trademark cases and has testified in eight cases within the ninth circuit.in this survey,patrons at a clicks establishment were asked,do you associate the visual look and appearance of this billiard parlor with clicks billiards only or with other billiard parlors too eighty percent of respondents said that they associated the look and feel with clicks only eighteen percent said,other billiard parlors too.
the district court stated,this survey is not without flaws,and ultimately concluded,put bluntly,the survey is of little or no value.the court was troubled by the fact that in response to a question respondents often used vague and general language in describing clicks image and made reference to unprotectable features of clicks interior,such as its cleanliness,upkeep,good service,and music.this is a valid observation and may indeed be true,but the issue is not one subject to resolution on summary judgment.it is true that some respondents used such vague language and referred to unprotectable elements of clicks trade dress,but other responses tend to support clicks contention that patrons specifically associate its image with clicks and not with other pool halls.among the responses associating clicks with elements,that,when taken as a whole,may constitute protectable trade dress different from other billiard parlors nice layout lots of room between tables general decor,pictures,signs the matchbooks,the,uh,pictures on the wall logos,the logos the tables,more space,the tvs the appearance and position of the bar they have high ceilings,pool tables in a line,and the size.large size.there are two levels.step down to play pool.bar is round and stools two levels,bar is unique,entrance.t he felt on the wall felix the cat.the matches on top of the ashtrays.no other place does that these black dots,on the floor,you know,like metal,but this is a rubber floor.the way the lights hang down.most places have track lighting,one long light.
ultimately these responses may not add up to much,and a reasonable juror might ultimately agree with the district court that the survey did not prove that clicks trade dress had acquired secondary meaning.but the juror could only have done so after considering conflicting evidence and deciding what weight to accord the survey and the interviews.this undertaking describes the proper role for a trier of fact it is not the role of a district court at the summary judgment stage where the issue is whether a triable issue of fact even exists.see,summers teichert son,cir the court must not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matters asserted but must only determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.
here,the district court did not exclude the survey on the ground that it was irrelevant or that it was undermined by some other fatal flaw.rather,the court appeared to admit the survey into evidence and then to analyze what it considered to be its deficiencies.treatment of surveys is a process.first,is the survey admissible that is,is there a proper foundation for admissibility,and is it relevant and conducted according to accepted principles see wendt host int l,cir gallo winery,at.this threshold question may be determined by the judge.once the survey is admitted,however,issues of methodology,survey design,reliability,the experience and reputation of the expert,critique of conclusions,and the like go to the weight of the survey rather than its admissibility.stuhlbarg,at.these are issues for a jury or,in a bench trial,the judge.in laying this guide for analysis of survey evidence,we are not endorsing the survey here nor are we prejudging its fate at trial.nor are we suggesting that the presence of a survey will always preclude summary judgment.we are simply saying that the survey admitted by the district court raises questions of material fact with respect to secondary meaning that may not be disposed of by the court alone.
aside from the survey,clicks presented evidence that sixshooters intentionally copied clicks trade dress.our cases recognize that evidence of deliberate copying is relevant to a determination of secondary meaning.transgo,at indeed,in appropriate circumstances,deliberate copying may suffice to support an inference of secondary meaning.see id.at dictum.fuddruckers,at lisa frank,impact int l,see also vision sports,at w e have held that proof of copying strongly supports an inference of secondary meaning.
as the district court stated in its summary judgment order,one former sixshooters employee,employed by clicks prior to joining sixshooters,testified that daryl chester stated that he wanted sixshooters to look like clicks because the look worked.clicks also presented evidence that chester,while working at sixshooters,greeted a clicks manager who came to visit him,welcome to clicks west.when asked if he knew what chester meant,the manager said the comment referred to the look and that he thought sixshooters looked like clicks.clicks employee shawnna gereg stated in her deposition that the forbes brothers the owners of sixshooters visited clicks and actually took measurements of various features,including the foosball areas,the bar,and the lighting.they also examined other details of the interior,such as the rails and the woodwork.clicks employee roger collett testified that the forbes brothers brought samples of countertops into clicks to compare them with those at clicks and took measurements of cabinets above the bar.clicks manager tanya mueller stated that she once saw the forbes brothers in clicks before opening time apparently accompanied by chester examining and measuring lighting fixtures,counter tops,shelves,and the distance between pool tables.a clicks patron confirmed that she saw the forbes brothers come into clicks and examine various aspects of the pool hall,specifically the tables,walls,and bar stools.
the district court response to such extensive evidence of intentional copying was to deem it slight and contested,and to note that it was controverted in the record.no doubt,the statements at issue are subject to various interpretations.but the very fact that the court acknowledged that the evidence of copying was contested and controverted should have precluded summary judgment on this point.on summary judgment,the district court
