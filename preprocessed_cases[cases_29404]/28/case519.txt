introduction 
this case presents an instructive contrast to another election petition case that we publish today,preserve shorecliff homeowners city of san clemente january,th,wl.in preserve shorecliff,there is substantial evidence of reliance by petition circulators on the acceptance by local elections officials of the practice of having petition signers also sign a circulator affidavit when the circulators do not live in the city involved in the petition.and that evidence was accepted by the trial court.moreover,in preserve shorecliff the practice relied on was developed in precise response to a facially unconstitutional statute.and the attorney general had already published an opinion stating that an identical statute in another part of the elections code was indeed unconstitutional.all one would have to do is compare the two statutes to realize that the same went for the statute at issue in preserve shorecliff.under such circumstances,any arguable noncompliance with a requirement that petition circulators themselves had to sign circulators affidavits could be excused.see assembly deukmejian cal d.
here,we have a different practice.circulators would fill in signers addresses for them in a recall election involving multiple targets.there is no substantial evidence of reliance on the acceptance of that practice by local elections officials.and any such evidence of reliance was in fact rejected by the trial court.nor is there any hint that the practice of having circulators fill in signers addresses was developed in response to an unconstitutional statute.
on top of that,the practice of having circulators fill in signers addresses for them in a recall petition substantially circumvents an important statutory protection afforded officials who are the targets of recall right to be judged on their own individual merits.that right is expressed in statutes requiring recall petitions be individuated,concerned with a specific official,and which give that official the right to include his or her own answer to the recall petition.in other words,recall law requires potential petition signers to be exposed to both sides of the question of whether a specific official should be recalled.the practice of filling in signers addresses for them after a signer signs and addresses one petition and then hurriedly signs another six petitions effectively obliterates the statutory protections afforded officials as individuals.
ii.background 
in the summer and fall of,a group of voters in the capistrano unified school district wanted to recall all seven members of the school board.voters donated countless hours of personal time to collecting signatures for the recall but the recall never happened because the registrar of voters disqualified signatures where the signers addresses had been filled in by someone other than the actual signer.this appeal is solely confined to the validity of the registrar disqualifications.
so,after petition signers signed their names to the multiple petitions and wrote in one residence address,volunteers would helpfully,they thought fill in the residence addresses for the remaining petitions.at the time the process saved time.
the problem was,cutting that corner violated at least two california statutes.those statutes,elections code sections and practically duplicate each other,and both plainly require that each signer of a recall petition personally affix his or her residence address to a recall petition.disallowing signatures where signers had themselves actually filled out the address box meant that none of the recall petitions had the requisite number of signatures.recall supporters then filed this proceeding in superior court seeking a writ requiring the registrar to count the disputed signatures.after the trial court entered a judgment formally denying the request,this appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
no excusable reliance 
recall supporters argued to the trial court and again on appeal that employees of the registrar office told them the practice of writing in signers addresses was permissible.
the evidence on that point was at best contested.at least two employees of the registrar office unequivocally declared that recall supporters would have been told no such thing,as a matter of policy we say at best contested,because the trial judge doubted that the declarations submitted by recall supporters even supported the idea that they had been told by the registrar employees that it was okay to copy addresses 
in any event,though,even if those declarations did provide an evidentiary basis for some sort of reliance argument,the presence of substantial evidence in the form of the unequivocal denials from the two employees is sufficient to dispose of the issue.
pointing out that the trial court did not actually receive any testimony on the evidence proffered on the reliance issue,the recall supporters assert that they,rather the party prevailing on appeal,should receive the benefit of any conflicts in the evidence,such as would be the case in a summary judgment motion.
the argument fails because the trial court disposed of the case in a proceeding for traditional mandamus under section of the code of civil procedure.such a proceeding is,in substance,a trial to the court,as distinct from a summary judgment motion.the case law is well established that in a proceeding for a writ of mandate,when the matter is heard only on written evidence,all conflicts in the written evidence are resolved in favor of the prevailing party,and factual findings are examined for substantial evidence,appelgate dumke d.in case where trial court denied petition for writ of mandate receiving evidence in the form of declarations and depositions,facts had to viewed in light most favorable to the findings of fact of the trial court dean associates city of south san francisco d.testing trial court decision on writ of mandate to prohibit a referendum election on substantial evidence standard with facts viewed in the light most favorable to the findings of the trial court accord,lynch spilman cal d,when an issue is tried on affidavits,the rule on appeal is that those affidavits favoring the contention of the prevailing party establish not only the facts stated therein but also all facts which reasonably may be inferred therefrom,and where there is a substantial conflict in the facts stated,a determination of the controverted facts by the trial court will not be disturbed.
no actual compliance 
the text of both sections and is inescapable both statutes refer to each signer,and use the active voice in describing the requirement of personally affixing the residence address.
the legislature could have used the vaguer,passive voice for the residence requirement,each signers will personally sign the petition,on which the residence of the signer shall be printed and in fact it did use the passive voice for another requirement set forth in section the need for the consecutive numbering in the format of the petition.but it did not use the passive voice for the requirement.the contrast in voices underscores the intent of the legislature for personal affixation by each signer of his or her residence address.
confirming that reading,both statutes also use the word shall,which is a mandatory usage,as distinct from a permissive one,and particularly in the context of this exact language.assembly deukmejian,supra,cal d,holding that election statute requiring that petition sections shall be designed so that each signer shall personally affix his or her residence address was so clear as to not be subject to liberal construction see also jones catholic healthcare west th,d general rule that courts routinely construe the word may as permissive and words like shall or must as mandatory.
boxed in by the text of sections and,the recall supporters rely on another statute in the elections code,section,as specifically allowing to fill in signers addresses the statute allows a petition signer to make a mark or signature but also allows the signer to request another person to print the voter name and residence address on the appropriate spaces of the petition or paper.
the statute,however,was
