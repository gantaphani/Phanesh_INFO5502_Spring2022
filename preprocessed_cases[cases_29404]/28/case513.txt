california has two statutes requiring that all circulators of referendum petitions be qualified to register to vote in the city whose ordinance is the object of the code,section,subdivision c and section in this case involving a challenge to signatures on a referendum petition obtained by a group seeking to have a referendum on an ordinance restricting additions,the trial court 
a found that section,subdivision c and,by implication,section as well had indeed been violated,but 
b did not invalidate the petition,thus allowing the referendum election to go forward.
the group has appealed,arguing that by allowing the referendum to go forward,the trial court voided these statutes.
we affirm.it turns out that the trial court merely voided statutes that are unconstitutional anyway.
background 
on july,the san clemente city council enacted an ordinance ordinance prohibiting additions in a section of the city known as shorecliffs.opponents of the will call them the group hired a professional signature gathering firm to obtain the signatures of the minimum percent of registered voters in the city necessary to subject the new ordinance to a referendum which in this case was signatures.the gathering firm obtained the necessary number by late august over signatures on the referendum petition.
however,the gathering firm employed a peculiar methodology to avoid section,subdivision c requirement that circulators of a referendum petition be eligible to vote in the city.specifically,the circulators hired by the signature gathering firm had each petition signer also sign a separate declaration of circulator portion of the petition,the idea being that each petition signer was his or her own circulator.
in september,proponents of the story is,the opponents of the referendum on the ordinance,we will call them the group filed this action.they sought a writ of mandate directing the city clerk to certify the referendum as in sufficient,or,alternatively,directing the city council not to place the referendum on the ballot.
their main theory for their request for writ of mandate was that section read together with section requires that circulators be residents of the cities whose ordinances are the subject of referendum petitions,and that the circulators used by the group here were not residents of san clemente.section,like section,requires a circulator to declare that he or she is a resident of the relevant city section requires that circulators be qualified to vote in the state section,subdivision c,which is the focus of the group appellate argument,is not to be found in the group trial court petition.that fact is interesting given that in,california attorney general concluded that section is un constitutional in its restriction of circulators to the relevant city,though the attorney general opinion does not mention.see.in short,the verified petition was predicated on a statute that had already been opined to be unconstitutional by the attorney general.
no one in this case contends that sufficient numbers of petition signatures had been gathered by employees of the professional signature gathering company who,by coincidence,also happened to be eligible to vote in san clemente,so that the referendum could make it onto the ballot on the strength of those signatures alone.
the case was heard in february.the issue of the constitutionality of section,subdivision c was not raised.the omission was ironic,since it was the group represented then by different counsel who,in their verified petition for a writ of mandate,first cited the united states supreme court opinion that must be the basis of any constitutional challenge to section,subdivision c or to section,buckley american constitutional law foundation,d.the group also submitted evidence that city clerks in various areas around the state have routinely allowed signers of petitions to witness their own signatures by signing again in the declaration of circulator portion of the petition.and indeed,in this appeal,both the city and the orange county registrar of voters have filed briefs taking no position on the validity of the process used by the signature gathering company.
the trial court took the matter under submission,and in the court ruled in a minute order.the minute order was not a formal statement of decision,but rather as a series of formal written responses to a joint list of controverted issues.
in his written responses,the trial judge determined that the process of deeming every signer to be his or her own circulator violated section,subdivision c.however,the trial judge also ruled that since the city clerk had determined that there were a sufficient number of qualified signatures to put the referendum on the ballot,under truman royer d,the city clerk was required to certify the referendum.moreover,the trial court specifically held that,assuming a violation of the elections code,disqualification of the petition was not the proper remedy.reasoning that the requirements of section,subdivision c are for the benefit and convenience of the clerk,the court concluded that if the clerk found that the signatures were genuine,then the petition is sufficient.
section was not mentioned.the statute,which had featured so prominently in the verified petition of the group was not mentioned at all in the group trial brief.nor were any of the statutes specifically sections and that simply provide for circulator declarations in the first place.neither of those statutes were mentioned in the group trial brief either.
a judgment declaring the referendum petition valid was entered in may.the group promptly filed this appeal,asserting that the trial court failure to stop the election in effect voided section.
ii.consideration of constitutionality for the first time on appeal 
the group argues that this court should not consider at all the question of the constitutionality of section,subdivision c,because the issue was not raised by the group at trial.the argument is not well taken.
appellate courts have discretion to consider the constitutionality of a statute for the first time on appeal when the question involves a pure question of law which is presented by undisputed facts.people hines cal th,d,people blanco th,d exercising discretion to consider,for the first time on appeal,constitutionality of evidentiary statute involving character trait.
indeed,appellate courts typically have engaged in the discretionary review of otherwise forfeited arguments only claim involves an important issue of constitutional law or a substantial right.in re sheena cal th,fn,d,collecting authorities in context of discussion of whether condition of probation was unconstitutional on its face hale morgan cal d,considering for first time on appeal constitutional validity of statute assessing penalty against landlord for depriving tenant of utility services for purpose of eviction,bayside timber board of supervisors d.considering for first time on appeal whether forestry statute was constitutional in light of impact of timber and logging operations on state as a whole see also alfaro terhune th,d claim that including inmates under a sentence of death within certain legislation was unconstitutional on its face was question of law thain city of palo alto d.however the question of the validity and constitutionality of the ordinance,on its face,including its notice provisions,is one of law.
the group posits three areas,or questions,where consideration of the constitutionality of section,subdivision c would require the court to decide the issue without crucial evidence,that is,evidence that should have been presented to the trial court,but was.the three questions are whether any of the paid signature gatherers were actual residents of san clemente whether the circulator declaration requirement under ec section c imposed any significant burden on the circulators and proponents and whether the governmental interests justifying these statutory requirements are supported by adequate evidence.
on scrutiny,though,none of these questions present any material issues of disputed fact.first,in regard to question,as we will see when we examine the controlling case on the point,buckley american constitutional law foundation,supra,d,it makes no difference as a matter of law whether any portion of the paid signature gatherers were,by coincidence,eligible to vote in san clemente.the issue of the constitutionality of the circulator statute is independent of the particular city in which any particular signature gatherer might reside.indeed,we may assume for sake of this case that not a single circulator in the case before us resided in san clemente.and,of course,to the degree that,by coincidence,some paid gatherers actually happened to be eligible to vote in san clemente,the signatures obtained by those gatherers would have to be counted as valid under the theory of the group.
second,the same goes for question.as we will see when we examine the buckley decision,the nature of the burden created by a statute such as section,subdivision c,is also independent of any evidence that might have been submitted to the trial court.under evidence code section,subdivision g courts must take judicial notice of propositions so universally known that they can not reasonably be the subject of dispute.under evidence code section,subdivision g courts may take judicial notice of propositions that are of such common knowledge within the territorial jurisdiction of the court that they can not reasonably be the subject of dispute.as we will show,under buckley,there is only one proposition necessary to a determination of the constitutionality of section,subdivision c that the number of residents of any political subdivision in the state of california is only a small less than the number of residents of the state as a whole.
whether that proposition is so universal that it comes within evidence code section must take notice or merely within evidence code section may take notice we need not decide.no one can doubt it.moreover,precedent certainly supports taking notice of it here.california courts have regularly taken judicial notice of such demographic propositions far less obvious and universally known than the proposition that the population of even the largest city or county in california is only a small percentage of the population of the state as a whole,people posey cal th,fn,d,taking judicial notice that a given city was located in a given county,with one telephone area code,while two other counties had another area code sanchez city of modesto th,d taking judicial notice of percentage of given ethnic category as a certain percentage of state population as revealed by census figures people bhakta th,d taking judicial notice of fact that population of los angeles exceeded bennett livermore unified school dist.d,fn.taking judicial notice of ethnic categories set forth in department of education publication.
as to the third there might be evidence out there that might have been submitted to the trial court supporting the governmental interests justifying the statutory requirements of section point does not preclude consideration of the constitutionality of a statute on its face.in sheena our high court recently contrasted an appellate claim involving some discretionary decision by a trial judge with an appellate claim involving a facial challenge,based on lack of constitutionality the court said a facial challenge does not require scrutiny of individual facts and circumstances but instead requires the review of abstract and generalized legal concepts and is thus a task that is well suited to the role of an appellate court.sheena,supra,cal th at,d.
a court can also take the precaution in regard to legal issues of soliciting amicus curiae briefs in order to assure that all sides of an issue are fairly presented,small fritz companies,cal th,fn,d,conc.opn.of baxter,noting that since court had solicited and received supplemental briefs on issue involving efficiency of capital markets,the parties had reasonable notice and opportunity to brief and argue the issue and the court could resolve it in the interest of judicial efficiency in re smith cal d,fn.when an appellate court,in the course of its normal process,discovers a crucial matter ignored by appellate counsel which should have been raised as an assignment of error,the court ordinarily will solicit supplemental briefs.sugimoto exportadora de sal,de d,fn.in light of respondent failure to file brief,appellate court asked superior court to file brief on issue.
thus,in addition to requesting briefing from the parties on the issue,this court,on its own motion,also invited the california attorney general office to give its views on the constitutionality of section,subdivision c.as noted,our request for briefing was explicitly without prejudice to a determination that the group was correct and the issue should not be decided in this appeal.
as it turned out,the attorney general office respectfully declined the invitation to address the constitutionality of the statute.
no matter,though,the attorney general office has already provided a formal opinion on the constitutionality of the functionally identical section,and found that statute requirement that circulators be a voter of the city to be unconstitutional in light of buckley.said the attorney general,and the emphasis is his own the first question to be resolved is whether the circulator of an initiative petition must be a voter of the city as required under section,or whether such statutory requirement is now unconstitutional in light of the united states supreme court recent decision in buckley american constitutional law foundation citation.we conclude that the statutory requirement is unconstitutional under buckley.at,original emphasis.
finally,there is one more consideration in favor of exercising discretion to consider the constitutionality issue in this particular appeal the very nature of appellant argument is intertwined with the constitutionality of the statute appellant defends.a litigant can hardly say that a statute not otherwise enforced by the trial court must be somehow vindicated if that selfsame statute is unconstitutional.inherent in the appellant argument is the idea that the trial court was under an obligation to assure that the legislature had not wasted its time in writing section,subdivision c that there had to be some teeth in the statute,and those teeth necessarily consist of the invalidation of the petition signatures obtained in violation of the statute.that very argument necessarily implicates the issue of the legality of the statute itself,because the federal constitution is the supreme law of the land,donaldson national marine,cal th,d,the federal constitution supremacy clause makes that law the supreme law of the land and as binding on the citizens and courts as state laws.
it would be,to put it mildly,unseemly for a state intermediate appellate to articulate,if not invent out of whole cloth,a remedy that itself unconstitutionally burdened first amendment rights federal constitutional law trumps any state policy embodied in the statute.see donaldson,supra,cal th at,d,noting that when state statute confers concurrent jurisdiction over federal right of action,federal right can be enforced in state court regardless of contrary state policy and further state court may not refuse to enforce a federal right in the absence of a valid excuse consistent with federal law.appellate courts are not in the business of directing trial courts to violate the constitution.
we now turn to the merits.
iii.the merits 
a.the controlling decisions from the united states supreme.meyer 
back in the,colorado had a statewide ban on paying people to gather signatures for petitions and referenda.the proponents of a proposed amendment to the colorado constitution obtained various approvals regarding the title and summary for the measure,but soon came to the conclusion that they could not obtain the requisite number of signatures without paying signature gatherers.the proponents challenged the ban in federal courts under section on the theory that the ban violated their first amendment rights.in meyer grant,d,a unanimous united states supreme court agreed with them.the court struck down the ban as unconstitutional,reasoning that the ban limit ed the number of voices who could convey a political message,thus making it less likely that the supporters of a given viewpoint would be able to place the matter on the ballot.id.at.
in striking down the legislation,the federal high court specifically rejected the idea that a state interest in making sure that an initiative has sufficient grass roots support to be placed on the ballot,or by its interest in protecting the integrity of the initiative process justified the ban.there were other,less restrictive,ways of implementing those interests than a blanket ban on remuneration for signature gatherers the grass roots interest can be protected by requiring a given number of signatures meyer,supra,at.while the integrity interest is protected by laws making it a felony to obtain false signatures,by way of forging,paying a signer,or misleading in regard to a petition.both of those protections,said the court,were adequate to the task of minimizing the risk of improper conduct in the circulation of a petition.id.at.besides which,the court noted,professional firms who submitted too many unqualifying signatures would quickly gain a reputation in the marketplace as being unreliable.id.at.
making paid petition circulators legal,however,does not make them any less annoying to people who find them annoying.see generally trader joe progressive campaigns,th,d signature gatherers harassed,threatened and intimidated patrons.and so,as one commentator would later put it,r esponding to the increasing prevalence of paid petition circulators in the state initiative process,the colorado legislature enacted a series of measures to regulate the state initiative and referendum procedures.carlin,buckley american constitutional law foundation,emblem of the struggle between citizens first amendment rights and states regulatory interests in election issues,footnotes omitted.
one of those new regulatory measures was that petition circulators had to be registered voters residing in the state of colorado.buckley,supra,at,fn.a public interest foundation oriented in favor of direct democracy and a group of several political activists,ranging from the chair of the state libertarian party to supporters of initiatives on workplace safety,joined to challenge the requirement in federal court.
as in meyer,the restriction was found unconstitutional by the united states supreme court,albeit this time in what was substantively a decision including a clear majority opinion,as distinct from a unanimous decision the court noted that there were about million registered voters statewide,and at least million eligible to vote but not registered.buckley,supra,at.beyond question,said the high court majority,the registration requirement drastically reduces the number of persons,both volunteer and paid,available to circulate petitions.ibid.elaborating,the registration requirement decreases the pool of potential circulators as certainly as that pool is decreased by the prohibition of payment to circulators.id.at.
the state dominant interest in shrinking the pool of potential petition circulators was in making sure the circulators complied with the law.buckley,supra,at.but that interest could readily be served by a lesser restriction of having a state residency,as distinct from a state registration,requirement.residency guaranteed that circulators would be within the state subpoena service powers.id.at.the residency aspect of the colorado regulation had not been the registration aspect.the net effect of the registration requirement was to cut down the number of message carriers in the arena without impelling cause.ibid.
buckley progeny so far 
in buckley,the federal supreme court had struck down a regulation that diminished the pool of potential petition circulators on a statewide basis by as low as if one does the arithmetic called that reduction drastic.
the reduction in the number of persons,both volunteer and paid,available to circulate petitions would,of course,be much more drastic if petition circulators were limited to residents of a given political subdivision within a state.that fact would be noted in quick succession in the year by three courts,respectively in september,early november and late november krislov rednour cir lerman board of elections in the city of new york cir and kzpz broadcasting,black canyon city concerned citizens.
krislov involved,among other things,an illinois requirement that signature gatherers be registered voters in the relevant political subdivision.as in meyer,the krislov court held that the legitimate state interest in assuring a minimum level of support in the relevant political subdivision was adequately served by the minimum signature requirement.krislov,supra,at.the court noted that a candidate who had reasonable support in his district might be denied the possibility of being placed on the ballot simply because his supporters who are registered voters and who reside in the relevant political subdivision may not have the time or the energy to solicit signatures.id.at.and as to the state obviously compelling interest in the integrity of the election process,it was served by the less restrictive means,including the opportunity to challenge fraudulent signatures.id.at.the court observed that a resident circulator was no less likely to exclude invalid signatures than a.ibid.
lerman presented only a slight variation of the issue of restricting circulators to political subdivisions in which they reside.the state of new york had a requirement that a witness to signatures on a city council candidate petition had to be a resident of the political subdivision in which the office or petition had to be voted for lerman,supra,at.if one thinks about it,such a requirement is functionally the equivalent of a requirement that petition circulators be residents of the political subdivision,since it would be grossly inefficient for any campaign to have one person circulate a petition and another person witness it.the law was challenged by a witness circulator who lived in the council district who gathered signatures for a candidate in the council district,because signatures she had witnessed had been ruled invalid.id.at.the second circuit,directly following buckley,struck down the requirement,reasoning that the two cases could not be not on the basis that candidate petitions are distinct from ballot measure petitions.there is no basis to conclude,said the lerman court,that petition circulation on behalf of a candidate involves any less interactive political speech than petition circulation on behalf of a proposed ballot nature of the regulated activity is identical in each instance.id.at.
turning to various state interests supposedly justifying the political subdivision restriction,the court noted that the restriction did nothing to ensure what one might call the integrity interest.a witness to a petition was still answerable to a subpoena.lerman,supra,at.
the court also considered the modicum of support rationale for supporting the restriction to represent an even weaker state interest than what one might call the integrity interest.echoing meyer,the lerman court reasoned that the modicum of support interest is already advanced by the requirement that candidates obtain a minimum number of signatures from district residents.lerman,supra,at.
lerman further addressed an interesting twist on the modicum of local support rationale the theory was that allowing petition witnesses circulators would have the effect of imposing the costs of an election on the subdivision residents that otherwise might not have taken place.see lerman,supra,at.
the sort of political version of trade particular fire from the lerman court as directly contrary to the first amendment.said the court t o the extent that the defendants mean to argue that the witness residence requirement helps to prevent from influencing politics within the district,that interest does not appear to be legitimate at all.a desire to fence out political to prevent both residents and from associating for political purposes across district can not be reconciled with the first amendment purpose of ensuring the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources.lerman,supra,at.
finally,in late november the arizona court of appeals decided kzpz,supra,which perhaps encapsulated most elegantly the application of buckley to the idea of political subdivision restrictions on circulators.kzpz is the precedent most like the case before us,because,like here,the case involved an attempt to use the referendum process to overturn a local land use decision and a subsequent attack by proponents of the decision to prevent the referendum from going on the ballot because of the use of petition circulators.except in kzpz,the land use decision was permissive,allowing a radio station to erect seven radio towers in a city,and the party wanted the permissive ordinance to be the subject of a referendum.in our case,the land use ordinance is restrictive,and the group wants the restrictive ordinance to be the subject of a referendum.
arizona had a statutory requirement which could be read to require that a petition circulator had to be a resident of the relevant political subdivision where a referendum petition was to be filed,and the radio station sued to enjoin placement of the referendum on the ballot on the theory of the invalidity of the signatures collected by the nonresident circulators.kzpz,supra,at.much of the opinion is devoted to a statutory analysis of arizona law independent of the constitutional question see id.at,with the court noting that the radio station had made a convincing argument that the literal wording of the statutes,read in pari materia,support ed the trial court conclusion that,in order to qualify to circulate petitions for a local referendum,the circulator must be a qualified elector of the locality.id.at.
but that literal wording was not the end of the matter.like this appellate court,the arizona appellate court was not particularly enthusiastic about enforcing a potentially unconstitutional statute.as we have in this opinion,the kzpz court recognized that the constitutional issue is inextricably intertwined with our statutory interpretation.it thus found discussion of the issue essential.kzpz,supra,at.
the kzpz court applied buckley to the facts at hand,noting that a county residency requirement decreased the pool of available petition circulators from the total number of qualified electors in about,the actual number of qualified electors in the county.kzpz,supra,at.that,said the court,was a heavy burden on political expression regarding referendum issues in our smaller counties.ibid.
the radio station countered by arguing that the restriction of circulators to the residents of a political subdivision furthered the compelling interest of assuring that circulators had ties to the community or stake in the outcome of a referendum election.kzpz,supra,at.that is,it was a kind of argument,based on the idea that,as the radio station contended,the subdivision residency requirement prevents abuse and capture of the local referendum process by political outsiders.ibid.
the idea was rejected because,after all,only county residents could vote in the actual election.kzpz,supra,at.by the same token,the rationale that lerman had rejected was again rejected in kzpz,because the ultimate control of whether there would be an election did not rest with the circulators of petitions,but with the county residents who sign the petition.ibid.the net result was that the kzpz court construed the problematic arizona statutory scheme not to include a local residency requirement in order not to run afoul of the first and fourteenth amendments under the principles set forth in buckley.id.at.
contrary authority 
we are aware of no case since buckley and its progeny of krislov,lerman and kzpz that has upheld a requirement of circulator residency in a given political subdivision.restrictions to political subdivisions necessarily,after all,entail even more drastic reductions in the pool of potential circulators defining that pool by the voting age residents of a state than statewide restrictions to registered voters.
the group cites a number of cases as upholding residency requirements for petition circulators,but fails to tell us that these cases uniformly involved statewide residency requirements in the context of statewide ballot propositions.see initiative referendum institute jaeger cir,the appellants challenge the requirement that all those who circulate petitions must be north dakota residents idaho coalition united for bears cenarrusa d,evaluating requirement that any person who circulates a petition for an initiative must be a resident of the state of idaho yes on term limits,savage wl at evaluating statute requiring the petition circulator to verify that he or she is a qualified elector of the state of oklahoma kean clark d,ultimate issue was whether the requirement that petition circulators for ballot initiatives must be residents of the state of mississippi see also hart secretary of state me,case considering challenge to state constitutional requirement requiring circulators to be residents of state maine taxpayers action network secretary of state me,fn.refusing to address challenge to maine requirement that circulators be registered voters and residents of maine.whether these cases are ones in which ideologically motivated political activists crossed state lines to promote nationally significant causes by ballot propositions in those states or merely reflect a tendency of petition circulators to be,in essence,migrant workers,is beside the point.none of these cases involve state residents barred from acting as circulators because they do not reside in a given political subdivision within their state.
buckley,of course,never addressed the issue of a statewide residency must remember that the shrinkage in the potential pool of circulators in that case was the product of using a statewide registration requirement as distinct from a statewide residency requirement.and in fact buckley,in striking down a statewide registration requirement,explicitly assumed that a statewide residency requirement would be upheld as a needful measure.buckley,supra,at.
there is,of course,a big difference between the two residency requirement assures that circulators are subject to the subpoena power of the state,and thus can be held accountable for their actions even if they do register to vote.in re initiative petition,state question,emphasizing need for residency requirement to protect integrity of the circulation process.a registration requirement merely duplicates the benefit achieved by the residency requirement insuring that circulators remain easily subject to the state subpoena powers,but has the unfortunate of needlessly reducing the pool of potential circulators.
thus it is safe to say that no case authority to date supports the constitutionality of section,subdivision c.
the amendment to section,subdivision c 
the group also presents a statutory variation on the constitutionality of residency as distinct from registration requirements,which must fail for the same reason.the group points to senate bill,which amended section,subdivision c in the wake of buckley,and to the fact that the legislative counsel office opined that,after the amendment,the law is constitutional.the quotes are from the group briefing,not from the legislative counsel from that the group invokes a kind of argument from authority to the effect that since the legislative counsel office has found section,subdivision c constitutional,so should this court.
but that is not a correct characterization of what the legislative counsel concluded,as shown by the changes in section,subdivision c actually wrought by senate bill and recognized in the legislative counsel digest of the bill 
specifically,section was originally enacted as part of a comprehensive revision of the elections code in.stats,ch.as enacted in,section subdivision c required that the circulator be a voter of the city mere eligibility to vote was good enough.
after the buckley decision,requirements that circulators be registered to vote,as distinct from merely eligible to vote,became untenable.section had to be amended to avoid that particular problem.the legislative counsel digest of senate bill thus implicitly recognized the impetus of the bill was to broaden the pool of circulators to all those eligible to vote.that digest provided existing law requires that persons who circulate state,county,municipal,or district initiative and referendum petitions be registered to vote within the jurisdiction of the governmental entity to which the initiative or referendum measure would apply.this bill would alternatively allow these petition circulators to be eligible to vote within the jurisdiction to which the initiative or referendum measure would apply.stats,ch,italics added.and that is precisely what senate bill did it amended section,subdivision c to add language that being qualified to register as a voter of the city was sufficient.stats,ch.
and,of course the change in the law in the direction of expanding the pool of circulators from registered voters to persons eligible to register was far as it that was all the legislative counsel concluded.the legislative counsel office did not opine on the constitutionality of restricting the pool of potential petition circulators to residents of a given political subdivision.the office only addressed the bill at hand 
the browne decision 
a.what browne said 
there is,though,one california court of appeal decision,browne russell th,d,that does uphold a subdivision residency restriction on petition circulators.back in the early,a charter city los angeles enacted an ordinance prohibiting smoking in restaurants.parties,one of whom owned a restaurant with the help of contributions from tobacco companies hired paid petition circulators to subject the ordinance to a referendum.id.at,d.los angeles had an ordinance in its own election code paralleling section,subdivision c.this ordinance required referendum circulators to be residents and registered voters.
the city clerk rejected about signatures gathered by the professional circulators,and the parties,now effectively the party,filed a petition for a writ attacking the city election ordinance as violative of free speech.the trial court determined that the ordinance was indeed unconstitutional,and ordered that no signatures were to be disqualified on the basis of the city ordinance.parties intervened and appealed from the trial court order,prompting the court of appeal to issue a writ of supersedeas.meanwhile,the governor signed a bill prohibiting smoking in restaurants on a statewide basis,making the case moot.the appellate court,however,decided that the issue would arise again and exercised its discretion to resolve issues of continuing public importance.browne,supra,th at,d.the court ultimately determined that the ordinance was constitutional.
structurally,the browne court analysis of the constitutional issue essentially consisted of the seriatim batting down of the losing side arguments.the first argument was that the circulator restriction imposed a substantial burden on their free speech rights.browne,supra,th at,d.the court basically said that a it was the party burden of production of evidence to establish that the circulator restriction had burdened its free speech rights,and b the party evidence fell short of meeting their burden of production.ibid.rather,all the party had shown is that the professional signature gathering company had a policy that the local ordinance was to be followed by its signature,and that it had been.that evidence did prove that the ordinance was a substantial burden.the dispositive phrase in that section of the opinion is there is no support for the claim that respondents did all they could have done id.at,d,italics added,suggesting that the browne court thought the signature gathering company should simply have tried harder to find circulators who were city voters.see generally id.at,d.
next,the court distinguished the meyer opinion,on which the party had rel ied heavily.browne,supra,th at,d.the browne court recognized that the supreme court had reasoned that the ban on paid circulators in meyer made the pool of circulators necessarily smaller,but counterintuitively juxtaposed the reduction of the pool in meyer with the absence of a reduction in the pool in the case before it.ibid.specifically,the browne court reasoned that it was dealing with a decidedly different situation because the party had neither argued nor shown that people who live and vote outside the city were more willing to circulate their petitions than those who live and vote within the city.ibid.even more specifically,the court noted that there was a pool of about million potential circulators in the city of los angeles.so the court returned to the theme that the party simply had not tried hard enough to recruit from that pool.the court said that the party supporting documentation does not establish that they tried but were unable to find circulators among those members of the city population.ibid.
next the browne court turned its attention to a variation on the issue of the problem which it had touched on in distinguishing meyer.the party had argued that the circulator restriction burdens those who live outside the city and wish to circulate a petition.browne,supra,th at,d.
we pause to note something at this point the fact that the party argument was framed in terms of a burden on outsiders makes sense when one realizes the context of the browne case the party in browne was partly financed by tobacco companies and other large corporations.see browne,supra,th at,fn,d listing major contributors.it is a fair inference that the impetus for the referendum came fundamentally from outside corporate interests,bent on holding the line against ordinances in any large california city.
but we should emphasize the browne court did not at all address the circulator restriction in terms of whether truly indigenous inside interests were also being prejudiced by the reduction in the potential circulator pool.the opinion did not consider the problem from the point of view of the local restaurant owner who was,after all,the named plaintiff in the was as if the court focused only on who it considered the real proponents of the referendum,the tobacco companies.the browne court thus saw the issue in terms of moneyed outsiders barging into a given political subdivision and asserting a right qua outsiders to circulate a referendum petition.see generally browne,supra,th at,d.
and,having framed the case as one of insiders versus outsiders,the browne court found the position of the outsiders unpersuasive the court reasoned that the outsiders were required to cite other authority than meyer for the proposition that los angeles had a duty to offer nonresidents the opportunity to circulate petitions which concern a city ordinance browne,supra,th at,d,italics added since meyer did stand for that idea.
it was in that the idea that the city was required to offer outsiders the opportunity to circulate petitions that the browne court came closest to confronting the issue of whether there was a governmental interest that would be sufficiently strong enough to justify whatever burden the circulator restriction did remember that just five paragraphs previously the court had said that the burden was not substantial.see browne,supra,th at,d.the court weighed the effect of an it had already said about a paragraph prior did not impose a substantial burden on free speech the interest served by the circulator restriction ordinance,which it,in passing,deemed compelling.having weighted the scales beforehand,it was no surprise that the court found the position of the party to be wanting.
because the passage is perhaps the most substantively important one in the browne opinion for purposes of our present analysis,we now quote it in full we therefore hold that respondents have not established that section restricted their right of political expression.moreover,we hold that the city has compelling interests which are protected by section.the electorate of this state adopted the initiative and referendum methods to have access to and control of a legislative process because it believed that the process could otherwise be dominated by special interests.citizens against rent control city of berkeley cal d,reviewed on other grounds sub nom.citizens against rent control berkeley,d.t he initiative and referendum processes can themselves be employed by the special interest groups whose power they were designed to curb.citizens against rent control city of berkeley,supra,cal d at.we can think of no better way to preserve the integrity of the referendum process as it relates to local ordinances than to require that only those eligible to vote for the members of the body which passed the ordinance be able to engage in the core political speech of attempting to gather signatures to challenge the ordinance.meyer grant,supra,at.at,d at see lawing faull d.having given section the strict scrutiny required,we conclude that the trial court erred in granting respondents petition for a writ of mandate.browne,supra,th at,d.
b.why we respectfully decline to follow browne 
the arizona court of appeals in kzpz would opine that browne was questionable law after buckley.kzpz,supra,at.we are forced to decision is,in light of buckley and its subsequent precedent in the context of political subdivision restrictions,untenable.
at the most basic level,browne,decides a question of federal law in a manner that can not be reconciled with the authoritative federal decisions in the area.buckley applies a fortiori to section,subdivision c if a statewide reduction in the potential pool of potential petition circulators of about percent was too drastic and therefore unconstitutional in buckley,how much more hence even more a reduction of the pool of potential circulators to only a tiny fraction of the state residents.even los angeles largest political subdivision in up less than percent of the state population as a whole.the reduction in the pool would be percent in san clemente,the effect of section,subdivision c is to reduce the pool of potential circulators from the pool of state residents eligible to vote by more than percent thus the group arguments that section does not pose a severe burden on first amendment rights,or that the ascertainment of the burden imposed is necessarily a issue is,under buckley,incorrect.indeed,at oral argument,counsel for the group essentially echoed the browne rationale,when he argued that the group simply should have tried harder to find qualified circulators among the residents of san clemente.
in that regard,the attorney general opinion finding section statute functionally identical to section,subdivision c unconstitutional basically quoted large swaths of the buckley opinion.it did not discuss browne directly.it was as if the passages from buckley precluded any argument that section was constitutional,and browne could be serenely ignored.see.at.
next we consider the main state interest which the browne court thought to be sufficient to justify the restriction of circulators to a given political subdivision.that interest often is described in slightly different terms in the case law meyer called it the grass roots interest,krislov called it the minimum support interest,lerman called it the modicum of support interest,and kzpz described it as the stake in the outcome interest.the group in its supplemental briefing here refers to it as the statutory purpose to maintain proper local control over policymaking and elections.but whatever it is called,this grass roots interest was authoritatively held by the buckley court to be sufficiently served by the lesser measure of requiring a certain number of signatures from actual voters,as distinct from the more intrusive measure of reducing the pool of potential circulators who could bring those voters a given message.
browne invocation of higher authority also does not fare well in retrospect.as is evident from the long passage we quoted above,the main authority for browne invoking the spectre of domination of local politics by special interests was citizens against rent control city of berkeley cal d,citizens against i 
the browne court acknowledged that something had happened to citizens against i,but it was accurate in characterizing that something.the browne court citation to the citizens against i opinion was that it was reviewed on other grounds sub nom italics added by the united states supreme court in citizens against rent control berkeley,d citizens against ii.
but citizens against i was reviewed by citizens against ii.it was reversed.and the grounds on which it was reversed were not other grounds separable from those passages in citizens against i on which the browne court relied.rather,those main theme we might describe as the danger of special interests as related to the initiative and referendum process were part and parcel of the rationale of the citizens against i opinion that did not find favor in the federal high court in citizens against ii.in citizens against ii the united states supreme court reasoned that the city interest in protection from domination by moneyed special interests was already adequately served by the lesser intrusive means of identification of contributors in public filings,together with the possible preclusion of anonymous contributions.citizens against ii,at.
in that regard,a unanimous supreme court in meyer had already relegated to a footnote the argument that it is permissible to mute the voices of those who can afford to pay petition circulators meyer,supra,at,fn,italics added.that is,the federal high court did not think much of discriminating against causes supported by those who could afford to pay petition circulators as distinct from manning tables themselves.the meyer court rejected the idea of muting the voices of such special interests precisely because the voters would ultimately be entrusted with the responsibility for judging and evaluating the relative merits of conflicting arguments,quoting first nat.bank of boston bellotti,d.and yet it was the wariness of moneyed special interests that animated the browne court more than anything else.
looking at the browne analysis point by point also shows its inconsistency with buckley.the browne court operated on the assumption that the party challenging the ordinance had the evidentiary burden of establishing that it had tried very hard to find circulators in the relevant political subdivision and still could find enough local circulators,and that it had failed to carry that burden simply by showing the shrinkage inherent in restricting circulators to that subdivision.for buckley,by contrast,it was enough to show that the pool of circulators statewide had been reduced by around percent.
similarly,browne distinguishing of meyer on the basis that the party had failed to argue or show that the outsiders were more willing than locals to work as circulators fails because both meyer and buckley came to their conclusions based on the fact of a shrinkage of the pool of potential circulators,as distinct from the particular willingness of members of the available pool to work for a given cause.
finally,there is another,perhaps even more basic flaw,in browne reliance on the rationale to support a restriction on petition circulators.browne did not consider whether genuine insider and grass roots interests might themselves need to employ professional,that is,outsider,circulators.it takes little imagination to realize that circulator restrictions may actually hinder local grass roots petition efforts.not every local cause is supported by people who have the free time and energy to devote to manning tables at large shopping centers for hours on end.see krislov,supra,at a candidate who has reasonable support in his district might be denied the possibility of being placed on the ballot simply because his supporters who are registered voters and who reside in the relevant political subdivision may not have the time or the energy to solicit signatures.a restriction on outside circulators necessarily discriminates against some local causes in favor of others 
indeed,the case before us is a perfect example of a how a circulator restriction can work against local interests as such.here,the issue to be put to the voters is very land use regulat
