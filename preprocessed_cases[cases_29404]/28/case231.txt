ralph nader,joined by his campaign committee and two registered illinois voters who support his candidacy,brought this suit to require the state of illinois to place his name on the ballot for the forthcoming presidential election.he appeals to us from the district court denial of a preliminary injunction that would order the state to do that.we have expedited the parties briefing and our consideration of the appeal because of the short time remaining to the election.
the suit challenges,as violations of the first and fourteenth amendments,munro socialist workers party,d anderson celebrezze,d bullock carter,d libertarian party of illinois rednour,cir,three provisions of the illinois election code that have in combination prevented nader from qualifying for a place on the ballot.the first provision requires any candidate who has not been nominated by a party that received at least percent of the votes in the most recent statewide election to obtain nominating petitions signed by at least qualified voters.ilcs.the second provision requires that the address on each petition be the address at which the petitioner is registered to vote.and the third requires that the petitions be submitted to the state board of elections at least days before the election.the deadline this year was thus june.only two states,texas and arizona,had an earlier deadline.
nader declared his candidacy on february,which gave him four months to drum up support for his presidential bid,though a provision of the election code that he does not challenge required him to wait until the ninetieth day before the expiration of the june deadline to begin circulating the actual petition forms for signature.ilcs.on june he turned in petitions.more than of these were challenged by defendant john tully,whom nader describes as a minion of the illinois democratic party.the principal ground for challenging a petition was that the petitioner was registered to vote at the address shown on it.after state administrative hearings,petitions were struck,which brought nader total below.nader campaign continued to obtain petitions after the june deadline,and by august,when the district court held a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction,another or so had been collected,but the election authorities refused to consider them because they were untimely.
nader also sued in state court,where he sought a ruling that the refusal of the election board to certify his candidacy violated illinois state law.that proceeding is pending,and the board argues frivolously that its pendency requires dismissal of nader federal suit by virtue of the doctrine of younger harris,d.that decision and cases following it,such as our majors case on which the board particularly relies,majors engelbrecht,cir,hold with irrelevant exceptions that if a person is believed to have violated a state law,the state has instituted a criminal,disciplinary,or other enforcement proceeding against him,and he has a federal defense,he can not scurry to federal court and plead that defense as a basis for enjoining the state proceeding.ohio civil rights comm dayton christian schools,d middlesex county ethics committee garden state bar ass n,d hoover wagner,cir storment,cir anthony council,cir.that is not this case.nader is not accused of having violated any state law,and the state has not instituted any proceedings against him he merely is pursuing parallel remedies against the state refusal to certify him as a candidate.federal courts do sometimes stay their hand when parallel state judicial or administrative proceedings are pending colorado river abstention,see,clark lacy,cir cigna healthcare of louis,kaiser,cir,or burford abstention,see,international college of surgeons city of chicago,cir,but the election board has made no effort to fit this case to that mold and it could,if only because of the time factor.abstention would almost certainly moot nader case.
nader argues that the three rules that in combination ruled him off the ballot impose an unreasonable burden on and independent nonparty candidacy though the libertarian party candidate was able to qualify,and if this is so the rules are unconstitutional.timmons twin cities area new party,d burdick takushi,d schulz williams,cir cromer south carolina,cir.nader emphasizes the role that third parties have played in american democracy.the republican party started as a third party and such third parties as the progressive party of theodore roosevelt,lafollette progressive party,and the reform party have made significant contributions to political competition,whether by injecting new ideas or,in the case of the republican party,by actually displacing one of the major parties.
so the barriers to the entry of third parties must not be set too high yet the two major parties,who between them exert virtually complete control over american government,are apt to collude to do just that.for like other duopolists they would prefer not to be challenged by some upstart although if a major party believes that a third party will take more votes from the other party than from itself,it will support that third party surreptitiously,because it supporting an ideological opponent,and the other party will oppose it also surreptitiously,because it opposing an ideological ally.that is why nader assumes that tully is a minion of the democratic party but we should point out that there was no basis for joining him as a defendant.tully is not a state actor,and he is not conspiring with the board of elections to keep nader off the ballot.
it does follow from what we said about the importance of preserving opportunities for the entry of new parties into the political arena that it would be a good thing if there were no barriers at all to candidacies.a multiplication of parties would make our politics more ideological by reducing the influence of the median voter who in a system determines the outcome of most elections,and this could be a very bad thing.more mundanely,terminal voter confusion might ensue from having a multiplicity of presidential candidates on the ballot for think of the confusion caused by the butterfly ballot used in palm beach county,florida in the presidential election.that fiasco was a consequence of the fact that the ballot listed ten presidential candidates.the butterfly ballot was a folded punchcard ballot in which the ten candidates for president were listed on facing pages.this unusual design was innocently adopted in order to enable the candidates names to be printed in large type,in consideration of the number of elderly voters in the county,while at the same time placing all the candidates for each office in sight of the voter at one time so that he would be less likely to overvote.another ballot design might have effectively disfranchised voters who had poor eyesight,or who cast their vote before realizing there were additional candidates for the same office on the next page of the ballot,or who cast two votes for candidates for the same office because they did realize that candidates for the same office appeared on different pages.but with names on each side and the chads the places in the ballot that the voter punches out in order to vote in the middle,it was easy to punch the chad of the candidate on one of the facing pages meaning to vote for the candidate on the opposite page.apparently a significant number of voters did just that intending to vote for al gore,they voted for patrick buchanan.with fewer candidates,the butterfly design and resulting confusion would have been avoided.
less obviously,candidates would themselves be harmed if there were no barriers to including such candidates on the ballot.it is to the libertarian party advantage that if nader challenge fails,its candidate will be the only independent candidate for president on the ballot.if there were independent candidates,none could hope for a nontrivial vote.
so there have to be hurdles to getting on the ballot and the requirement of submitting a minimum number of nominating petitions is a standard one.in a state the size of illinois the population exceeds million,of whom more than million are registered v
