residents of bowling green,ohio,including students at bowling green state university bgsu all collectively referred to herein as plaintiffs,initiated the present action against,the city of bowling green,ohio,and various city officials collectively referred to herein as the city,alleging that the city voting apportionment scheme violated their rights under the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause.after a bench trial,a magistrate judge found that the city apportionment plan deviates from absolute population equality by at least that the city had set forth a rational state policy for the deviation that the plan advanced the articulated policy and that,the articulated policy notwithstanding,the population deviation exceeded constitutional limits.the magistrate judge ordered the city to develop and submit to the court for its review and approval a constitutionally permissible reapportionment plan.the district court affirmed the judgment of the magistrate judge in its entirety,and the city now appeals,assigning error to the magistrate judge determinations that bowling green is subject to the requirements of ohio revised code the population deviation among the city wards was not mitigated sufficiently by the city provision of representation the city must develop a reapportionment scheme,without guidance from the court,as to the appropriate population base to be used the statistics generated by the united states department of housing and urban development were unsupported by sufficient facts,thus requiring the parties to rely upon the federal census population figures and,although the city policies upon which the present apportionment plan is based are rational,the legislative plan is nevertheless unconstitutional.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the order of the district court in its treatment of the five assignments of error.we reverse the judgment of the district court to retain jurisdiction over this case for the purpose of reviewing the constitutionality of the city proposed reapportionment scheme.
background 
bowling green,ohio,is centered at the crossroads of route and route.these bisecting highways establish a natural division of the city into four geographic quadrants,which,since the city inception in,have constituted four legislative wards.the bowling green city charter charter provides that bowling green city council shall consist of three members selected at large based upon the total number of votes received,and one council member selected from each of the city four wards.this apportionment scheme was incorporated into the charter on october,when the municipality became a city.
although routes and form a natural geographic division of the city,they do not divide the city into quadrants containing proportional numbers of the city population,due in part to the student population of bgsu,which is situated in precinct of ward.the city maintains that it,like other college towns with significant populations of students,properly substitutes the number of registered voters in the specific campus precincts for the populations when reviewing district representation,effectively counting only registered voters in areas of bgsu students.of the residents of ward,of them are registered to vote.the city argues that when adjusted for numbers of registered voters,the population figures reveal that ward contains of the total population,ward contains,ward contains,and ward contains,resulting in a constitutionally permissible population deviation from ideal district size 
in early,plaintiffs challenged the apportionment scheme as a violation of the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause and sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the city.on september,a magistrate judge granted plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment,finding that plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of discrimination,and leaving for trial only resolution of the question whether the city stated reasons for maintaining the ward boundaries provided a rational and constitutionally permissible justification for the population deviations.at an october,bench trial before the magistrate judge,plaintiffs argued that the city plan violated the maximum population deviation standard of among legislative districts as required by voinovich quilter,d noting that a prima facie case of discrimination is established upon a showing that an apportionment plan has a maximum total deviation from ideal district size in excess of.after testimony by various city officials,the magistrate judge found that plaintiffs had alleged a prima facie case of discrimination,irrespective of whether one used the population figures or the population numbers for student precincts in ward.although the magistrate judge also found that the state policy justifying the population adjustments advanced by the city was rational,she nevertheless concluded that the resulting population disparity rendered the city present apportionment scheme constitutionally defective.the court ordered the city to develop a reapportionment plan and retained jurisdiction to review and approve the new apportionment scheme.we granted the city motion for leave to appeal.this appeal follows.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court interpretation of the relevant law,but review its factual findings for clear error only.see thornburg gingles,d see also cousin mcwherter,cir a district court factual findings regarding section violations and the determination of whether vote dilution has occurred are ordinarily reviewed for clear error.citing.a.
iii.discussion 
charter city 
bowling green,a charter city subject to article xviii,section,of the ohio constitution is governed by a charter that provides in pertinent part that 
t he legislative power of the city shall be vested in a city council which shall be a continuing body consisting of members at large and one member from each of such even number of wards which shall be established by council by ordinance enacted not later than january of the year in which the first election for members of council from wards as established by such ordinance is to be held.
ohio law provides that the legislative authority of a city shall subdivide the city into wards,equal in number to the members of the legislative authority to be elected from wards and delineates the manner in which a city is to carry out this directive.ohio ann.anderson.relying on the language of,the magistrate judge found that a city council has the continuing authority and duty to redivide the city into proper wards pursuant to law when an increase in population occurs.
the city seizes upon this statement,arguing that the magistrate judge erroneously concluded that a city is required to establish a ward system and that the city hybrid system is,therefore,impermissible as a matter of law.citing pesek city of brunswick,for the proposition that a charter city subject to home rule may enact a provision that is in conflict with state law,the city argues that,because the charter provision allowing a hybrid system is in direct conflict with requirement that a city establish a ward system of representation,the magistrate judge erred by requiring the city to adopt a ward system.
the city argument is without merit.in the first instance,the magistrate judge did not make a finding that the system was prohibited by nor did she conclude that the city could not adopt an system.rather,she found that,even when taking representation into account,the deviation from ideal did not pass constitutional muster.second,and more important,pesek does not create legal authority for the city to avoid the reach of.while it is true that t he general rule is that in matters of local,if there is a conflict between a charter provision and a statute,the charter provision prevails,the city has shown no conflict between its charter and the statute.state ex rel.bardo city of lyndhurst,ohio,ohio.the charter requires and direct ward representation merely directs the legislative authority of a city that employs a ward system of representation to subdivide the city into wards neither the organization provisions of nor the magistrate judge order requires any particular form of apportionment scheme.thus,there is no conflict that would require this court to determine which provision must prevail in this case.even assuming there were in fact a conflict,the rule of charter supremacy applies only where the conflict appears by the express terms of the charter and not by mere inference.lyndhurst,at emphasis added.the city argument necessarily relies upon inference and must be rejected.
elected officials 
it is that when examining legislative redistricting,a reviewing court must take into account the presence of representation.see board of estimate of city of new york morris,d.the city contention that the magistrate judge erred in failing to give due regard to the city and direct representation system finds no support in the record.it is clear that the magistrate judge did consider the existence of the city ward system in examining the overall voting scheme.the magistrate judge made an express finding that a deviation as high as is not constitutionally permissible even though that deviation is offset by the existence of three council positions.
even if this court were inclined to look beyond the plain language of the magistrate judge opinion,we would nevertheless find that the deviation in this case is unconstitutional.in morris,the supreme court held that,in determining the deviation among districts,the relevant inquiry is whether the vote of any citizen is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen,the aim being to provide fair and effective representation for all citizens.at.quoting reynolds sims,d.although the morris court concluded that the lower courts erred in failing to determine the deviation from ideal with the representation factored into the analysis,it refused to find reversible error,because the city had conceded a population deviation of.see id.at.
in the instant case,the magistrate judge found a deviation as high as.the city does not assert that the magistrate judge failed to calculate the deviation from ideal,nor does it assert that the deviations found by the magistrate judge were within per se constitutional limits.it can not.even assuming the magistrate judge failed to consider the presence of representation in the city,the united states supreme court has suggested that a deviation as high as that at issue in this case might be per se unconstitutional.id.at.we note that no case of ours has indicated that a deviation of some could ever be justified.given the evidence that the magistrate judge did consider the system in calculating the population deviation from ideal,and given the city failure to show that this figure is inaccurate,we conclude that the magistrate judge findings were not clearly erroneous.
hud estimates 
the city contends that the district court improperly rejected use of the united states department of housing and urban development hud population estimates as unsupported by sufficient facts.use of the hud estimates,the city argues,would have resulted in a constitutionally permissible deviation of.the city argument is without merit.after hearing the testimony of the city administrator,which called into question the source and accuracy of the hud estimates,the magistrate judge concluded that use of the census figures would provide a more reliable population base for determination of the deviation from ideal.we do not find that the magistrate judge determination was clearly erroneous,particularly in light of the fact that,unlike that of the hud estimates,there was no question as to the accuracy of the census figures,to which even the city stipulated.
population base 
although the magistrate judge found that the city system of counting ward residents was point that neither party concluded that,g iven that either method of calculating population deviation exceeds constitutional limits,the court determines that it is unnecessary to reach the issue of whether the reduction of population by registered voters in only one ward is an acceptable method of calculating population.more important,in striking down the city apportionment scheme,the magistrate judge properly refused to state whether,in developing a reapportionment scheme,the city would be required to rely upon the census figures or the figures.such a question was not properly before the district court,and any statement as to the appropriate population base on which to base a reapportionment scheme would have amounted to nothing more than an impermissible advisory opinion.see north carolina rice,d reiterating that federal courts have no power to issue advisory opinions church of scientology of hawaii united states,cir t he court does not render advisory opinions or decide abstract propositions.minnesota united states steel,cir the legal questions should not be considered in the abstract.
legislative plan 
it is that a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of dilution by demonstrating a population deviation in excess of.see quilter,at.such a showing shifts to the state or municipality the burden of justifying the deviation,which requires it to articulate a rational state policy that may justify the deviation to explain how the apportionment plan may reasonably be said to advance the rational state policy and to demonstrate that the resulting deviation does not exceed constitutional limits.mahan howell,d accord quilter,at.while it is true that the magistrate judge found that the city proffered of the efficient and economic delivery of city services in bowling green was a rational state policy,and that the city apportionment plan advanced that policy,she nevertheless concluded that a population deviation as high as exceeded constitutional limits,irrespective of the underlying policy reasons for that deviation.
the city maintains that the magistrate judge erred by concluding that the city legislative plan was unconstitutional after first finding that the municipal policies underlying the scheme were rational and justified.the city does not dispute the accuracy of the magistrate judge finding of a population deviation of.rather,it seems to argue that a policy that is shown to be rational and advanced by a municipality apportionment scheme must necessarily be constitutional,regardless of the attendant population deviation,and that a reviewing court may not conclude,as the magistrate judge did in this case,that a population deviation of is per se unconstitutional.the city fails to recognize that the first two prongs of the mahan test do not exist to substantiate the third.while it is true that a state has a legitimate interest in maintaining boundaries,see howell,at,such an interest in no way justifies every deviation from ideal.apportionment schemes that are motivated by rational and otherwise justifiable polices may nevertheless result in population deviations that exceed constitutional limits.
the city reliance on brown thomson,d,to support its argument is misplaced.brown never dealt with the question of constitutionally permissible population deviations.rather,it addressed whether wyoming plan for preserving boundaries justified the additional deviations from population equality resulting from a particular county representation,focusing on the appellants challenge to representation of that particular county and not on the deviations from ideal.see id.at.the brown court stated 
here we are not required to decide whether wyoming nondiscriminatory adherence to county boundaries justifies the population deviations that exist throughout wyoming representative districts.appellants deliberately have limited their challenge to the alleged dilution of their voting power resulting from the one representative given to niobrara county.the issue therefore is not whether a average deviation and an maximum deviation,considering the state apportionment plan as a whole,are constitutionally permissible.rather,the issue is whether wyoming policy of preserving county boundaries justifies the additional deviations from population equality resulting from the provision of representation to niobrara county.
in the present action,the magistrate judge properly limited brown to its facts and concluded that the
