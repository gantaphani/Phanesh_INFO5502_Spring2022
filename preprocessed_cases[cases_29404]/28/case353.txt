standard of review 
a district court determinations on questions of law and on mixed questions of law and fact that implicate constitutional rights are reviewed de novo.dittman,cir.a district court decision granting summary judgment is also reviewed de novo.devereaux abbey,cir en banc.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.oliver keller,cir.
in order to prevail on this facial challenge to the restriction,cogswell must meet a high burden of proof he must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the restriction would be valid.the fact that the restriction might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid.myers,city county of san francisco,cir quoting united states salerno,d.
law applicable to a limited public forum 
the parties agree that the voters guide constitutes a limited public forum and we accept the parties classification of the type of forum involved.see kaplan county of los angeles,cir holding that california voters pamphlet constitutes a limited public forum because california created the pamphlets for the specific purpose of allowing a limited class of speakers,the candidates,to address a particular class of topics,statements concerning the personal background and qualifications of each candidate.a limited public forum is a of a designated public forum that refer s to a type of nonpublic forum that the government has intentionally opened to certain groups or to certain topics.hopper city of pasco,cir quoting diloreto downey unified sch.dist.bd.of,cir alteration in original.
in limited public fora,a lenient reasonableness standard applies to determine the validity of governmental regulations.see cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d hopper,at.under this reasonableness test,the state can restrict access to a limited public forum as long as the restriction does not discriminate according to the viewpoint of the speaker,and the restriction is reasonable.perry,at.see also good news club milford cent,d rosenberger rector visitors of the of,d cornelius,at.
ii.the restriction is not viewpoint discriminatory 
it is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys.rosenberger,at.citing police dep t mosley,d.the principle that has emerged from supreme court cases is that the first amendment forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others.lamb chapel ctr.moriches union free sch,d citing city council of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,d.
thus,d iscrimination against speech because of its message is presumed to be unconstitutional.rosenberger,at.when the government targets not subject matter,but particular views taken by speakers on a subject,the violation of the first amendment is all the more blatant.id.at.holding that the university of virginia denial of funding to a student newspaper because of its christian editorial viewpoints where the school funded other editorial viewpoints was viewpoint discriminatory.
in order to preserve the limits of a limited public forum,however,the state may legitimately exclude speech based on subject matter where the subject matter is
