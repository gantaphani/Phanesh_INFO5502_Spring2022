the american federation of state,county municipal employees,local local or the union,appeals the district court denial of its motion to dismiss.the district court was persuaded,first,that political affiliation was a cognizable class under and,at least for purposes of a motion to dismiss,that the union had conspired with appellee roberta farber employer,the city of paterson,to deprive her of her first amendment rights on the basis of her political affiliation.the court was also persuaded that farber claim that the union breached its duty of fair representation in refusing to pursue a grievance on her behalf had been timely filed.we will affirm in part and reverse in part.
background and procedural history 
we have before us a classic example of political patronage.democrat jose torres defeated republican incumbent mayor martin barnes in the may mayoral election in paterson,new jersey,and subsequently declared his intent to terminate city employees who supported the former mayor.farber,a city employee and admitted supporter of barnes and his policies,was terminated from her administrative,position on june,after approximately eleven years on the job.she was informed of her termination in a letter from the city assistant personnel director,marge dipasquale,whose niece,farber claims,was later hired to fill her position.
after her termination,farber asked the union to file a grievance on her behalf against the city for allegedly breaching the collective bargaining agreement that governed her employment.a meeting was held between the union and city representatives,but ultimately the union rejected farber request,citing the fact that she was a provisional employee who could be terminated at will farber alleges that the union president,manuel ojeda,a political ally of newly elected mayor torres,was thereafter appointed as the city director of public works.
farber filed suit against the city and the union,among others,alleging,inter alia,that the city and the union conspired to deprive her of her first amendment rights because of her political affiliation,in violation of and that the union breached the duty of fair representation it owed to her under the new jersey constitution and the new jersey relations act,stat.ann.
the union moved to dismiss farber and duty of fair representation claims pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that discrimination based on political affiliation can not support a claim,and that the duty of fair representation claim was.that motion was denied.see farber city of paterson,d.relying on perez cucci,aff,cir,the district court determined that political affiliation is a cognizable class for purposes,and that farber pled sufficient animus when she alleged that defendants conspired against her because she is a republican.farber,d at.the district court also determined that,despite the new jersey public employment relations commission exclusive power to prevent unions from engaging in unfair practices under stat.ann.c,a litigant may bring a duty of fair representation claim under the relations act in court without first resorting to the commission.id.at.the district court then rejected the union argument that the statute of limitations applicable to unfair practice charges before the commission should also apply to a duty of fair representation claim at law.it held,instead,that new jersey general limitations period for actions alleging tortious injury to the rights of another,stat.ann,applied.d at.
the union moved under b for an interlocutory appeal of the denial of its motion to dismiss.the district court granted the motion,certifying two issues

which statute of limitations applies to a claim brought in court for a union breach of the duty of fair representation that is enunciated in the new jersey relations act 
we granted the union petition for leave to appeal.our review of the denial of the union motion to dismiss is plenary.the facts alleged in the complaint and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those facts are accepted as true for purposes of this review.
section permits an action to be brought by one injured by a conspiracy formed for the purpose of depriving,either directly or indirectly,any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws,or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.in a line of cases beginning with griffin breckenridge,d,the supreme court has made clear what a plaintiff must allege to state a claim under a conspiracy for the purpose of depriving,either directly or indirectly,any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws,or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws and an act in furtherance of the conspiracy whereby a person is injured in his person or property or deprived of any right or privilege of a citizen of the united states.united of carpenters joiners scott,d citing griffin,at.
section was initially part of section of the ku klux klan act of,an act passed to give the federal government a weapon against the wave of anarchic and violent civil resistance to reconstruction that marred the war south.see novotny great am.fed.sav.loan ass n,cir,vacated on other grounds,d keating carey,cir.it does not create any substantive rights,but permits individuals to enforce substantive rights against conspiring private parties.see,marino bowers,cir howard state dep t of highways,cir.
due to restrictive,supreme court decisions,including one that held that only reached public conspiracies,was not utilized for about years.in griffin,however,the court reversed course and held that a claim can reach private as well as public conspiracies that seek to deprive a class of equal protection of the laws or equal privileges under the laws.at.thus,plaintiffs were permitted to use to sue their racially motivated white attackers for violating their constitutional right to travel.id.at.
despite its application to private conspiracies,was not intended to provide a federal remedy for all tortious,conspiratorial interferences with the rights of others,or to be a general federal tort law.id.at.the griffin court emphasized that because requires the intent to deprive of equal protection,or equal privileges and immunities,a claimant must allege some racial,or perhaps otherwise,invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators action in order to state a claim.id.at.third emphasis added.the phrase invidiously discriminatory animus would 
confine the authority of this law to the prevention of deprivations which shall attack the equality of rights of american citizens that any violation of the right,the animus and effect of which is to strike down the citizen,to the end that he may not enjoy equality of rights as contrasted with his and other citizens rights,shall be within the scope of the remedies of this section.

there are two distinct aspects to the invidiously discriminatory animus which,we now know,will support a first is defined by form,and the second by function.thus,a plaintiff must allege both that the conspiracy was motivated by discriminatory animus against an identifiable class and that the discrimination against the identifiable class was invidious.see aulson blanchard,cir.
farber claim that the union and the city conspired against supporter s of the former administration fails to allege discriminatory animus against an identifiable class.but even if it,for example,she alleged discriminatory animus against registered such animus would not trigger protection.for one thing,the frequent mention of republicans in the act legislative history,in and of itself,does not mean that congress intended to reach conspiracies bottomed on political affiliation.for another,unlike discrimination against a class on the basis of race,sex,or mental retardation,discrimination on the basis of political affiliation is not,as a matter of law,discrimination so invidious such that would apply.in sum,farber has failed to state a claim under.we proceed to discuss,in more detail,why that is so.
farber fails to satisfy the identifiable class requirement 
it bears repetition that a claimant must allege some racial,or perhaps otherwise,invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators action in order to state a claim.griffin,at.regardless of the alleged basis for discrimination,however,and whether that basis is invidious or not,the allegation of a animus naturally presumes that there is a specific,identifiable class against whom the defendants can have discriminated.see aulson,at.at a minimum,griffin s use of the word class 
unquestionably connotes something more than a group of individuals who share a desire to engage in conduct that the defendant disfavors.otherwise,innumerable tort plaintiffs would be able to assert causes of action under by simply defining the aggrieved class as those seeking to engage in the activity the defendant has interfered with.

thus,defendants must have allegedly conspired against a group that has an identifiable existence independent of the fact that its members are victims of the defendants tortious conduct.this independent existence is necessary to preserve the distinction between two of the requirements of a claim that the conspirators be motivated by invidiously discriminatory animus and that the plaintiff be the victim of an injury he or she seeks to remedy by means of.if merely alleging the latter could satisfy the former,the requirement of animus would be drained of all meaningful content,aulson,at citing bray,at,and would transform into the general federal tort law congress did not intend to enact.see bray,at.
in order to ensure that a class has an independent identifiable existence,a reasonable person must be able to readily determine by means of an objective criterion or set of criteria who is a member of the group and who is not.aulson,at.for example,women,or registered republicans,may constitute an identifiable class as opposed to a more amorphous group defined by conduct that the defendant disfavors,such as women seeking abortion,see bray,at,or persons who support political candidates,see aulson,at.
in bray,the supreme court held that abortion clinics and organizations that support abortion and have members who may wish to use abortion clinics failed to state a claim against an organization whose conspiratorial efforts to obstruct access to abortion clinics allegedly deprived women seeking abortions of their right to interstate travel.at.the court explained that,while women generally constituted a class that might substantively qualify for protection the subgroup of w omen seeking abortion is not a qualifying class because the class can not be defined simply as the group of victims of the tortious action.id.at.quoting scott,at.blackmun,dissenting.
in aulson,a local public officeholder brought a claim against an incumbent group of old guard politicians who controlled town politics,alleging that he faced illegal searches and sham prosecutions because he was a member of a political group which supports candidates who oppose the politics of the old guard.at alteration in original.the court of appeals for the first circuit found that the plaintiff failed to allege discrimination by an identifiable class because 
this group is wholly indeterminate.it might include all the voters in georgetown,or it might include only voters who have spoken out against incumbent selectmen,or it might include only the two individuals featured in the complaint,or it might include anyone whose inclusion would benefit the plaintiff at any given time.there is simply no way to characterize this group as an identifiable segment of the community by reference to any objective criteria,and,hence,it can not serve as a cognizable class within the purview of.

in our own jurisprudence,we have often addressed the second question involved in the griffin an identified class has been invidiously discriminated against such that one injured may avail himself or herself of without the need to address the predicate question of whether an objectively identifiable class existed in the first place,because the answer was obvious.in novotny,for example,we held that extended to women,who constitute an objectively identifiable class,while noting that griffin s invidiously discriminatory animus requirement works to screen out claims where no class exists at all,citing,among others,our decision in jennings shuman,cir novotny,at.similarly,we concluded,in lake arnold,that the scope of is sufficiently broad to protect the mentally retarded as a class,assuming,albeit implicitly,that the mentally retarded constitute an objectively identifiable class in the first place,cir.simply put,some groups,particularly those deemed to be distinguishable from others by immutable characteristics,such as,women,and the mentally retarded,are so clearly accepted as objectively identifiable that no extended analysis is needed.as the court in bray demonstrated,however,it is not always a simple matter,particularly when what is at issue is a putative class defined,as here,by mutable characteristics such as opinion or conduct.
the district court erred when it concluded that farber pled sufficient animus when she alleged that defendants conspired against her because she is a republican.farber,d at emphasis added.not only does farber not allege in her complaint that she is the victim of discrimination because she is a republican,she does not allege that she is a republican and does not even allege that the conspiracy was motivated by a desire to discriminate against republicans.farber only alleges that she was terminated because she was affiliated with and a supporter of the administration of former mayor martin barnes,who,at another point in her complaint,she identifies as a republican.indeed,farber does not even argue that her support for mayor barnes,or her resulting injury,was founded on his status as a republican.
when determining whether an independently identifiable class exists,there are differences between being discriminated against because of membership in a political party and being discriminated against because of support for the policies of a politician who also happens to be a member of the party.we need not discuss those differences,however,for the class farber attempts to assert is so subjectively defined and wholly indeterminate that t here is simply no way to characterize it as an identifiable segment of the community by reference to any objective criteria,and,hence,it can not serve as a cognizable class within the purview of.see aulson,at 
discriminatory animus directed at a class based on political affiliation is not invidious 
even were we to ignore or forgive the pleading deficiencies and assume that farber adequately alleged that the conspiracy was motivated by discriminatory animus aimed at a class based on political affiliation,that type of discrimination is not so invidious as to qualify for protection.
we begin our analysis with what the supreme court has made clear the victim of a conspiracy motivated by race discrimination may bring a claim,griffin,at,while the victim of mere commercial or economic animus may not.scott,at.the court has never found that a criterion other than race can serve as the basis for a qualifying class,but neither has it foreclosed that possibility,and we have held that victims of discriminatory animus directed at women,see novotny,at,and the mentally retarded,see lake,at,may state a claim.
admittedly,we have sent mixed signals as to whether discriminatory animus directed at a class based on political affiliation can also so qualify.compare perez cucci,political affiliation qualifies as a class,aff,cir,with palisades park,rejecting claim because defendants merely conspired against plaintiff because of his political association,aff,cir,stephens kerrigan,wl.may,dist.lexis,at political affiliation can not support a claim,aff on other grounds,cir,and deblasio zoning bd.of adjustment,rejecting claim based on p laintiff allegation that he was discriminated against because he was not a political insider,aff in part,rev in part,cir.
our sister courts of appeals are split on the issue and,although it is still an open question in the supreme court,the court,albeit in,suggested how it would rule if squarely faced with the issue.in scott,construction workers,who were attacked and beaten because of their status,alleged that their attackers had the requisite invidiously discriminatory animus for a conspiracy claim.the court of appeals for the fifth circuit agreed,reasoning that the employees were akin to a political group,and that political groups are protected by because,given its reading of the legislative history of the ku klux klan act,a cause of action was intended not only to protect but also their republican supporters from the conspiratorial activities of the ku klux klan.at.
the supreme court,however,was unpersuaded,and explained that 
it is a close question whether was intended to reach any animus other than animus against negroes and those who championed their cause,most notably republicans.the central theme of the bill proponents was that the klan and others were forcibly resisting efforts to emancipate negroes and give them equal access to political power.the predominant purpose of was to combat the prevalent animus against negroes and their supporters.the latter included republicans generally,as well as others,such as northerners who came south with sympathetic views towards the negro.
despite its skepticism that was intended to reach any group other than and those who championed their cause,the court found it unnecessary to decide that does not reach,politically motivated animus,and instead held only that it did not reach the type of economic or commercial animus implicated by the violence against the workers in that case.id.at.
congress acknowledgement in that republicans were victims of klan violence does not mean that was intended to give victims of political discrimination a cause of action 
despite the dicta in scott,the district court chose to follow the decision of a district court holding that reaches politically motivated conspiracies,a case that itself relied upon the court of appeals for the second circuit decision in keating carey,cir.farber,d at citing perez,emphasizing the repeated statements of the congress that ku klux klan hostility towards republicans must end,keating held that was intended to provide all victims of political animus with a cause of action.at see also life ins.of am.reichardt,cir section congressional debates evinced concern for all groups subject to the organized lawlessness of the ku klux klan,including republicans.keating reasoned that while today the klan is seen primarily as a racist organization,in it was also a political organization intent on establishing democratic hegemony in the south.at.therefore,not only were blacks the victims of klan violence,but so 
were carpetbaggers or men of union sentiment,in a word,republicans.black or white,the victims whose property is destroyed,whose persons are mutilated,whose lives are sacrificed,are always republicans.cong.globe,sess,remarks of congressman roberts.the dead and the wounded,the maimed and the scourged,are all,all republicans.id.at,remarks of congressman mckee.every victim of ku klux outrage has been a republican.id.at,remarks of congressman cobb.the klan object is the defeat of republicanism.id.at app,remarks of congressman snyder.
id.from this,the court concluded that congress did not seek to protect only republicans,but to prohibit political discrimination in general,arguing that to hold otherwise would be to turn history on its head and exclude from protection the group that seems to have been foremost in the mind of congress.id.at.
based on scott and our own reading of the text of and its legislative history,we disagree.it is certainly true that and republicans were victims of the klan violence that prompted the enactment of.as to both groups,however,the invidiously discriminatory animus behind the klan actions was motivated by racial hatred,not by its victims political party affiliation.see scott,at.keating,at meskill,concurring and dissenting novotny,at but see keating,at.that many victims of racially motivated klan violence happened to be republicans does not mean that the discriminatory animus they faced was because they were republicans.in bray,for example,the supreme court found that because the victims of a conspiracy motivated by opposition to abortion were all women did not mean that the discriminatory animus they faced was because they were women.at.the plaintiff status as a republican or as a woman was incidental to the motivating factor behind the defendants discriminatory animus.
thus,the repeated statements in the legislative history that would serve to protect republican,often white,victims of klan violence,see novotny,at,does not mean that was intended to reach discriminatory animus directed at a class based on political affiliation or that,more specifically,republicans victimized by animus directed against republicans can ride the coattails of republicans victimized by animus directed against.instead,the legislative history underscores the view that a plaintiff need not be a member of the class against which a conspiracy directs its invidiously discriminatory animus,even if in practice this is most often the case.we long ago held that this is so.see richardson miller,cir finding that a victim of racially discriminatory animus can state a claim and,as we explained in novotny,where we held that a male victim of sexually discriminatory animus directed at women could state a claim,the text 
provides a cause of action in any instance where in furtherance of the object of a proscribed conspiracy an act is done whereby another is injured in his person or property.by its terms,the statute gives no hint of any requirement that the other must have any relationship to the person or class of persons which the conspiracy seeks to deprive of equal protection,privileges or immunities.
in order for victims of discrimination based on political affiliation to state a claim,it must be independently determined that discrimination on that ground is invidious in the same way that discrimination directed at is invidious.we address that issue next.
ii.discrimination against a class based on political affiliation is not invidious for purposes of 
the supreme court has explained that 
t he nature of the invidiously discriminatory animus griffin had in mind is suggested both by the language used in that phrase invidious tending to excite odium,ill will,or envy likely to give offense,unjustly and irritatingly discriminating,webster second international dictionary and by the company in which the phrase is found there must be some racial,or perhaps otherwise,invidiously discriminatory animus,griffin,at.emphasis added.
bray,at.the court then concluded that the goal of preventing abortion,in itself does not remotely qualify for such harsh description,and for such derogatory association with racism,and,thus,the victims of discriminatory animus resulting from a conspiracy to prevent abortion could not sue under.id.at.if the goal of preventing abortion does not qualify,then surely neither does the goal of replacing,with one own,members of an opposing political party in an exercise of classic political patronage.
in the past we have emphasized the irrational and odious nature of discrimination motivated by a class immutable characteristics because such characteristics are determined by the accident of birth and bear no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society.novotny,at citing frontiero richardson,d.thus,we have found discrimination directed toward women to be invidious.id.at.following novotny,we have also held that discrimination based on mental handicap,like that based on gender,often rests on immutable characteristics which have no relationship to ability.where this is the case,we are convinced that the discrimination is invidious lake,at.while we do not hold that discrimination motivated by a mutable characteristic can never be invidious,political
