plaintiffs appeal from the district court dismissal of their claims against defendant doris hollan,county clerk for boyd county,kentucky.plaintiffs allege that because they supported defendant opponent in her election,defendant failed to reappoint them to positions as deputy county clerks in violation of their first amendment rights of free speech and free association and in violation of their fourteenth amendment rights.finding that the district court improperly granted defendant hollan qualified immunity with respect to certain plaintiffs claims against defendant hollan,we affirm the judgment of the district court in part,and reverse it in part.
background 
plaintiffs teresa caudill,cheryl fields,and patty conlin are all former boyd county,kentucky,deputy county clerks.all three had served as deputy county clerks for several years,but they were not reappointed to their positions after hollan won election in and took office in.plaintiff lynn butler is the former boyd county,kentucky,county clerk.she was a former deputy clerk who was appointed to that office after the death of the previously elected clerk.she never sought election to the office of county clerk either before or after her appointment.during the election,plaintiffs supported hollan opponent.
after winning the primary and the election,defendant received a memo,dated december,that the county attorney circulated to all county executives.the memo specifically warned new county executives not to use patronage dismissals.defendant provided written notice to plaintiffs of her decision not to rehire them on january.
plaintiffs filed suit pursuant to,claiming that they were not rehired a constructive discharge in violation of their first amendment rights of free speech and free association,as applied to state actors through the fourteenth amendment,because they had supported defendant hollan opponent.defendant filed a motion to dismiss and for summary judgment.defendant hollan denied that she failed to reappoint plaintiffs for political reasons.she also argued,in the alternative,that had she engaged in patronage dismissals as plaintiffs alleged,she deserved qualified immunity,because the law regarding patronage dismissals of kentucky deputy county clerks was not clearly established.
on august,the district court dismissed plaintiff butler claims against defendant hollan,reasoning that as the former county clerk,butler did not have any expectation of continued employment or of being rehired.the court also dismissed all of plaintiffs claims against defendant hollan in her individual capacity,relying primarily on this court decision in cope heltsley,cir.
the parties conducted discovery on the deputy county clerk plaintiffs remaining claims.on august,in a second opinion,the district court dismissed the remaining claims against defendant hollan in her official capacity as county clerk.the court held that plaintiffs had presented no evidence that the office of the county clerk had final authority to establish county policy with respect to hiring matters.the court held that such a finding would be a necessary prerequisite to plaintiffs recovering against defendant hollan in her official capacity.the opinion also directed that judgment be entered for defendants plaintiffs appeal.their appeals have been consolidated.plaintiffs argue that the district court should not have granted summary judgment to hollan in either her individual or official capacities.
jurisdiction 
although neither party raised the issue,before we address the merits of plaintiffs appeals,we must determine,sua sponte,whether we have jurisdiction over all aspects of those appeals.h whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter,the court shall dismiss the action.in their notice of appeal,the deputy clerk plaintiffs failed to appeal from the judgment.the appeal was taken from the memorandum opinion and order entered in this action on august.in the august order,the district court directed the entry of final judgment in the case.it also disposed of the deputy clerks claims against defendant hollan in her official capacity as clerk.in their briefs on appeal,however,plaintiff deputy clerks also contest the district court august,opinion and order on their claims against defendant hollan in her individual capacity federal rule of appellate procedure c b requires that a notice of appeal designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.the question that confronts us,then,is whether we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the august,order dealing with individual liability,which is not mentioned in the notice of appeal.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that we can reach all relevant aspects of the deputy clerk plaintiffs appeal.it has long been the rule that an appeal of a final judgment draws into question all prior rulings and orders.mclaurin fischer,cir.we hold that the notice of appeal sufficiently complies with fed.to give us jurisdiction in that the opinion of august,which plaintiffs do list,ordered the entry of the final judgment in the case.an appeal referencing an order that directs entry of judgment in a case is a sufficient equivalent to appealing the judgment itself,even though the judgment is entered as a separate document.in the alternative,if the notice of appeal was technically deficient,we hold that such a technical deficiency should not prevent us from reaching the merits of the appeal,nor does such a technical deficiency divest us of jurisdiction to hear the appeal.to rule otherwise would be to rely on an overly technical reading of fed.c.several decisions support finding jurisdiction under analogous situations.
in mclaurin,the plaintiff notice of appeal referred solely to the district court order,which embodied the jury verdict on a federal age discrimination claim.id.the plaintiff sought to challenge,however,earlier dismissals of state law claims and an earlier grant of a directed verdict motion,in addition to the order specifically mentioned in the notice of appeal.id.the defendant argued that because the plaintiff only mentioned the order relevant to the federal age discrimination claim on appeal,the panel could address only that issue and not the other issues.id.this court disagreed with the defendant,holding 
in this case,by appealing from the district court final order,mclaurin effectively preserved for review all of the district court rulings and orders,including the directed verdict and state law claim rulings.furthermore,even assuming that the notice of appeal failed to properly preserve these issues for appeal,fischer has failed to demonstrate any prejudice due to the alleged error consequently,any error committed by appellant is harmless.
id.at italics added for emphasis.
in boburka adcock,cir,this court allowed a defendant to appeal a court grant of a directed verdict in favor of the plaintiff despite the fact that his notice of appeal specified only that the defendant was appealing from the district court order denying his motions for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial.id.at.the notice of appeal did not mention either the final judgment or the directed verdict.id.this circuit,relying on peabody coal local union numbers,cir,and the clear intent of the defendant,found that although s trictly construed,the notice of appeal does not preserve the denial of the directed verdict issue,the notice of appeal adequately preserved for appeal all the issues he raises before this court.id.
in crawford,et roane,et,cir,plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal that sought review of the order denying their motion for summary judgment and granting defendant motion for summary judgment.id.at.in their brief,however,the plaintiffs also discusse d the trustees failure to furnish information and ma de clear that the plaintiffs also s ought review of the district court denial of their motion for leave to file an amended complaint.id.the court held that,because the brief put the defendants on notice as to what was being appealed,they suffered no prejudice as a result of the plaintiffs failure to specify that they desired appellate review of the other subjects.id.at.sanabria,d a mistake in designating the judgment appealed from is not always fatal,so long as the intent to appeal from a specific ruling can fairly be inferred by probing the notice and the other party was not misled or prejudiced.citations omitted.
our decision in united states universal mgmt,cir,is not to the contrary.in universal,a district court denied summary judgment for the defendants and granted summary judgment to the government.id.at.the district court grant of summary judgment resulted in a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from distributing a medical device they claimed would help alleviate pain.id.the defendants made a motion to reconsider in which they argued that they deserved a new trial due to the malfeasance of their original counsel and because one of the individual defendants could not be personally subject to the injunction.id.at.defendants notice of appeal stated only that they appealed from the district court order denying them summary judgment and granting summary judgment to the united states.id.in their briefs on appeal,however,the defendants discussed arguments related to both issues raised in their motion to reconsider.id.the government responded that because it was not prejudiced by the lack of notice,the court of appeals should address the arguments.id.this court held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the items raised in the motion to reconsider because the notice of appeal did not specifically indicate that the defendants appealed from that motion.id.at.the court did,in the alternative,address the merits of the two points and found no errors with respect to either issue.id.at.
universal management services stands for a related but different proposition than the other cases previously discussed.in short,our rule is that we will entertain arguments on all objections and asserted errors prior to the final disposition of a case if a party indicates in its notice of appeal that it appeals either the final judgment or the final order in the case.we will not,however,absent specific mention in the notice of appeal,entertain issues raised in motions if the notice of appeal states only that the appeal is from the final order or the final judgment.this rule is understandable because most decisions made by a trial court are not appealable until the entry of final judgment.to the extent that the motions relate to issues raised before judgment,the appellate court will deal with them anyway,as it did in universal.if the issues raised only in motions were new in that they were arguments not raised prior to a final disposition of the case,then considerations of notice might require the party raising the issues be more specific if it wishes to discuss them on appeal to avoid prejudicing either the trial court or the other party.
in this case,the deputy clerk plaintiffs did not specifically mention the judgment in their notice of appeal.like in mclaurin and boburka,however,they did appeal from the final memorandum and opinion in the case.under the logic of our prior cases,then,the notice of appeal provided by plaintiffs,here,is sufficient.in addition,in this case,the memorandum opinion and order of august,indicates that a judgment in favor of the defendant will be entered contemporaneously herewith.the judgment was entered that same day.thus,in light of the fact that the august memorandum opinion and order ordered the filing of the judgment,meaning that the judgment would not have been filed were it not for the court order,it would appear that by appealing this opinion,plaintiffs intended to appeal the portion of the opinion ordering the entry of judgment.such an appeal is tantamount to having appealed the judgment itself.
if the notice of appeal is technically deficient,it is readily apparent that neither this court nor the defendant have been prejudiced in any way.defendant understood that plaintiffs intended to appeal the august,order because she addressed those arguments in her brief.she suffered no prejudice,and because the parties briefed their arguments,neither did this court.thus,even if the notice of appeal is technically deficient,because no one is prejudiced by that defect,under our precedent,we should address the merits of the appeal.
finally,the supreme court has held that if a clerk does not enter judgment on a separate document in a case,but the parties treat the judgment as if it has become final,a court of appeals may still treat the judgment as final despite the fact that a separate document entering the judgment is normally required.bankers trust mallis,d.while it is true that the facts of this case are not directly related to bankers trust,a useful analogy can be drawn.in bankers trust,obviously,the party appealing did not reference a final judgment in their notice of appeal as no separate document existed.the party apparently appealed from the final order issued by the district court.if the entry of a separate document for a final judgment is unnecessary to allow an appeal in a case like bankers trust,it seems that we are already treating a final court order as synonymous with a separate judgment for the purposes of appeal in some circumstances.if we were to hold,in this case,that a party that references the final order of a court,but does not indicate that it also appeals the judgment,does not appeal the judgment,we would be upholding form for form sake,and would not advance justice in this case,or in general.
while the requirements of fed.c are jurisdictional,torres oakland scavenger et,d united states universal mgmt,cir,our precedent,supreme court precedent and fed.c also require that we construe the jurisdictional requirements of fed.c liberally.see foman davis,d torres,at.thus,our rule is that fed.c is a jurisdictional rule whose requirements should be liberally construed and applied.
patronage dismissal of deputy county clerks 
because we have jurisdiction over this appeal,we now turn to the merits.this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.adams city of auburn hills,cir.for the purposes of this appeal,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs and draw all reasonable inferences in their favor.aiken city of memphis,cir citing matsushita indus,zenith radio,d.we first address the claims of the three deputy county clerk plaintiffs.we then address the claims of former county clerk lynn butler,who seeks to be hired as a deputy clerk.
since the supreme court issued its opinion in elrod burns,d,patronage dismissals,dismissals for failure to support a particular party or candidate have been,in general,unconstitutional the supreme court in branti finkel,d,clarified this rule by affirming that,although patronage dismissals were,in general,unconstitutional,party affiliation may be an acceptable requirement for some types of government employment.id.at.the branti court indicated that the plaintiff must make out a prima facie case that he or she was discharged because of his or her political affiliation.see id.the defendant then must show that the plaintiff job is of the type that would qualify for an exception to the general rule.id.the branti court described the types of positions that would qualify for the exception as policymaking positions.id.this court,in mccloud testa,cir,interpreted branti by outlining four categories that qualified for the branti exception 
category one positions specifically named in relevant federal,state,county,or municipal law to which discretionary authority with respect to the enforcement of that law or the carrying out of some other policy of political concern is granted 
category two positions to which a significant portion of the total discretionary authority available to category one has been delegated or positions not named in law,possessing by virtue of the jurisdiction pattern or practice the same quantum or type of discretionary authority commonly held by category one positions in other jurisdictions 
category three confidential advisors who spend a significant portion of their time on the job advising category one or category two on how to exercise their statutory or delegated policymaking authority,or other confidential employees who control the lines of communications to category one positions,category two positions or confidential advisors 
category four positions that are a part of a group of positions filled by balancing out political party representation,or that are filled by balancing out selections made by different governmental agents or bodies.
id.at footnotes omitted.thus,since,in this circuit,assuming that a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of unconstitutional patronage dismissal,the defendant must show that the job in question falls within one of the four mccloud categories.
in this case,the district court did not address whether a patronage dismissal of a deputy county clerk is a constitutional violation.it chose,instead,to rely on qualified immunity in dismissing the complaint plaintiffs assert that defendant failed to rehire them based on their support of defendant opponent in the election.viewing the deposition evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,there is evidence that plaintiffs supported defendant opponent,that defendant was aware of that support,and that defendant failed to rehire plaintiffs.this evidence raises a triable question of fact as to whether defendant engaged in patronage dismissals and violated plaintiffs constitutional rights.
because plaintiffs have placed sufficient evidence in the record from which a could infer that defendant knew that they supported her opponent,the burden shifts to defendant to prove that plaintiffs positions fall within one of the four mccloud categories.we decide whether the deputy county clerk position is a position subject to political patronage as a matter of law.mumford basinski,cir citing mccloud,at and blair meade,cir.unfortunately,defendant hollan does not indicate which mccloud category should apply to deputy county clerks.
the undisputed testimony on the types of jobs plaintiff deputy county clerks perform reveals that their jobs are essentially clerical.they either do not have,or do not exercise,the type of discretion or authority that one would normally associate with a job subject to patronage dismissal under mccloud.it would,therefore,appear that plaintiffs positions do not fall into any of the mccloud categories however,our analysis does not end here.
the rice cannon requires this court to give some deference to the legislature determination as to whether a particular job is political.see rice ohio dep t of,cir quoting jimenez fuentes torres gaztambide,cir.defendant points to three different statutes as evidence of the kentucky general assembly understanding of the deputy county clerk position.we address each of the statutes discussed by defendant hollan in turn.
first,defendant hollan points to,which makes the office of the county clerk liable for the the acts or omissions of deputy county clerks.in heggen lee,cir,this court found that a statute with almost exactly the same wording as,but which applies to sheriffs,does not convert a deputy sheriff position into a position subject to patronage dismissal.see heggen,at.because we can find no meaningful difference between the two statutes,adopting our reasoning in heggen,we find that the rice cannon is not implicated by this statute 
next,defendant hollan argues that,which states that a county clerk who,by themselves or their deputies,fail s to perform any duty enjoined upon them by any of several various provisions of the kentucky revised statutes shall be guilty of a violation,converts the deputy county clerk position into one subject to patronage dismissal defendant,in essence,argues that by virtue of this statute,a county clerk can be criminally liable for the acts of his or her subordinates,and that this fact requires her to be able to pick politically compatible employees.this statute,however,is no more availing than the first,since eliminates any personal criminal liability that could attach to the individual officeholder and because requires deputy county clerks to reimburse the clerks office for any fines levied on the clerk.
finally,defendant hollan points to,which provides that any duty enjoined by law or by the rules of civil procedure upon a ministerial officer,and any act permitted to be done by him,may be performed by his lawful deputy.although this statute is one of general application in that it does not specifically mention county clerks or deputy county clerks,kentucky courts have held that it can apply to deputy county clerks in the performance of some duties.see hallahan cranfill,a deputy county clerk can participate in the public examination of absentee ballot applications by virtue of see also asher sizemore,a deputy county clerk can administer an oath in his or her own name pursuant to.this statute,however,is not a clear enough expression of the kentucky general assembly wish to convert the position of deputy county clerk into a political position covered by one of the mccloud categories.we,therefore,decline to hold that the kentucky legislature has determined that the position of a deputy county clerk is a political position as opposed to a clerical position.consequently,the rice cannon is inapplicable.
because defendant has not shown that the deputy county clerk position falls under any of the mccloud categories,and because the rice cannon is inapplicable,we hold that patronage dismissals of kentucky deputy county clerks with routine duties violates the constitution.when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,questions of material fact exist as to whether defendant hollan violated plaintiffs constitutional rights by terminating them for political reasons.we now proceed to the second step of our analysis and address whether defendant hollan is entitled to qualified immunity 
qualified immunity 
defendant hollan argues that she deserves qualified immunity because the law concerning patronage dismissals of deputy county clerks was not clearly established,particularly in light of cope heltsley,cir.cope is,at this point,of limited value as precedent.in cope,this court assumed that a constitutional violation was present,but granted qualified immunity on the basis that the law was not clearly established in id.at.in general,it is of little consequence that this court held that a right was not clearly established at an earlier date.see hall tollett,cir.a right not clearly established in the court was dealing with a failure to renew an appointment that occurred in january of,see cope,at,may become clearly established in the intervening time before.thus,relying almost exclusively on a case that held that a right was not clearly established many years ago is not conclusive or persuasive.
under the doctrine of qualified immunity,government officials performing discretionary functions are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.the purpose of the clearly established prong of the qualified immunity analysis is to insure that the officials were on notice that their conduct was unconstitutional.hope pelzer,d t he salient question that the court of appeals ought to have asked is whether the state of the law in gave respondents fair warning that their alleged treatment of hope was unconstitutional.although notice to the official is critical,qualified immunity is an objective rather than a subjective inquiry.cope,at it is important to understand that heltsley own subjective views on the legality of her staffing decisions are essentially irrelevant.whatever she may actually have thought about the constitutional propriety of what she was doing,the pertinent test is an objective one,not subjective.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.rights at issue must be clearly established,not just in the abstract sense,but in a particularized sense.see brosseau haugen,d finding that t he present case was far from the obvious one where graham and garner alone offer a basis for decision,the court therefore turn ed to ask whether,at the time of brosseau actions,it was clearly established in a more particularized sense that she was violating haugen fourth amendment right s.internal quotation marks omitted saucier,at.the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.citations omitted anderson creighton,d the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.citations omitted.the specific act,however,need not have been held unconstitutional for the right to be clearly established.see hope pelzer,d o fficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.anderson,at.this is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,but it is to say that in the light of law the unlawfulness must be apparent.
thus,while it must be clear to the reasonable official that acts would violate the constitution,it is irrelevant what the individual official actually believed about the legality of his or her action.in addition,the specific action of the official need not have been found to have been unconstitutional in a prior decision to hold that official liable pursuant to,but the law must have established with particularity that the conduct complained of violated the constitution before the official engaged in the unconstitutional act.
in hall,this court relied on mccloud testa,cir establishing four categories to attempt to capture the positions that can fall under the branti exception,to hold that the deputy sheriffs duties did not fit into the branti exception.hall,at.we also held that the sheriff deserved qualified immunity due to the absence of a clearly established rule forbidding the termination of deputy sheriffs for political reasons.see id.at.we so held,because in cagle gilley,cir,we had earlier found that it was not clearly established that deputy sheriffs were protected from patronage dismissals under the state of the law in.hall,at.we also determined that after our decision in cagle,but before,when the defendant in hall acted,no further relevant cases had been decided.id.we also noted a split in the circuits.id.with no decision that patronage dismissals of deputy sheriffs was impermissible between and,the defendant in hall was entitled to qualified immunity.id.here,however,defendant had not only our earlier decision in cope,which assumed that the dismissal of deputy clerks was unconstitutional,defendant also had our decisions in hall and in heggen as well as mccloud.
in heggen,in january of,we denied qualified immunity to a kentucky sheriff accused of engaging in patronage dismissals in light of hall.heggen,at.we determined that hall alone was sufficient to make the constitutional right prohibiting patronage dismissals clearly established for kentucky deputy sheriffs.id.
on march,in hager pike county bd.of,cir,a teacher was demoted and reassigned after she supported a different candidate for school superintendent.her duties consisted mainly of providing direct services to students,and the remainder administering the gifted and talented program gtp.she also worked closely with the former superintendent to build and improve the gtp by creating and implementing several new local programs,obtaining additional grants identifying an increased number of eligible students,and conferr ing with the state gtp consultant id.this court determined that a material question of fact existed as to whether the new superintendent had violated her first amendment rights.id.at.
we believe that hall,heggen,and mccloud make the law in this circuit with respect to patronage dismissals of these types of county employees clearly established with the requisite specificity to satisfy the supreme court requirement that the law clearly establish in a more particularized sense that the act was unconstitutional.brosseau.at.
the duties of the deputy sheriffs described in hall are little different from the duties of the deputy clerks here.deputy sheriffs duties were described in heggen as including road patrol,serving arrest warrants and civil papers,taking complaints and working auto accidents,transport ing prisoners,and providing courtroom security.heggen,at.heggen described all of these duties as nonpolicymaking duties.id.at.deputy clerks,whose work is essentially clerical work,also perform nonpolicymaking duties.although deputy sheriffs and deputy clerks engage in different tasks,their respective levels of responsibility and the nature of their jobs are not so different as to cause this court to find that the law with respect to deputy sheriffs is clearly established,but that the law with respect to deputy clerks is not clearly established.in addition,hager duties are also best described as nonpolicymaking duties.it is difficult to understand how a reasonable official could believe that it would be constitutionally permissible to terminate a clerical employee like a deputy clerk through political patronage,when this court has held that it is not constitutionally permissible to terminate a deputy sheriff or a teacher and administrator of a gifted and talented program through political patronage.
furthermore,were this court to hold that hall,heggen,and hager did not make the law clearly established for deputy county clerks,we would be ignoring the supreme court rule that officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.hope,at.were this court to require findings before it found that the law was clearly established,we would be,in effect,requiring a previous finding on the constitutionality of patronage dismissals for every government position before holding that the law was clearly established for that position.such a finding could lead to the result that similarly situated county officials could engage in political patronage dismissals at least once with impunity,unless and until a court ruled on the constitutionality of political patronage for that particular position.such a result is not warranted by logic or precedent.
finally,the memo circulated to new executives by the county attorney that specifically warned defendant against patronage dismissals appears to be relevant to the question of notice in this case.it is,of course,irrelevant what defendant hollan believed the state of the law to be indeed,the record is silent as to whether she believed that she could constitutionally discharge her employees for political reasons.the very fact,though,that the county attorney sent her the memo indicates that she was on notice that patronage dismissals were,in general,prohibited under clearly established law,even if the memo did not go into detail about whether she as county clerk could engage in patronage dismissals.a reasonable county official,having received that memo,would have been on notice that patronage dismissals were,in general,prohibited.
in sum,by virtue of mccloud,heggen,and hager,defendant had sufficient notice that patronage dismissals in kentucky were constitutionally suspect.these cases alone are enough to find that the rule prohibiting patronage dismissals of deputy county clerks was clearly established.the memo from the boyd county attorney warning new county executives against patronage dismissals further solidifies our holding that a reasonable official would be on notice that patronage dismissals would violate the constitutional rights of county employees in most circumstances.
in cope,judge nelson asked would it have been possible,at the end of,for a reasonable person,a kentucky county clerk,to believe that the law entitled her to take political compatibility into account in deciding whom to retain as her deputy clerks the answer,we think,is yes.cope,at.in view of the cases subsequent to cope,the fact that cope assumed a constitutional violation,and the county attorney memo,the answer,we think,to that same question,in,was clearly no.thus,the district court erred in granting defendant hollan qualified immun
