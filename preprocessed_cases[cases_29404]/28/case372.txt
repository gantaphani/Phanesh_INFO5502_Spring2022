we enter again the turbulent and at times turbid waters of voting rights litigation.four american indian plaintiffs appeal the district court judgment in favor of defendant officials of the state of montana on the plaintiffs claim under section of the voting rights act.the district court held that the plaintiffs had standing to allege native american vote dilution only with respect to the house and senate districts where they resided.also,the court held that the plaintiffs had not shown vote dilution in the house and senate districts where they resided.finally and alternatively,the district court held that,even if the plaintiffs had shown vote dilution,their claim failed because of the state imminent redistricting and because any remedy would impermissibly disrupt the elections.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.concluding that the district court did not clearly err in determining that the totality of circumstances did not establish vote dilution in the districts where plaintiffs resided,we affirm on that ground.
the four indian plaintiffs,earl old person,carol juneau,joe macdonald,and jeannine padilla,are before us again in appeal of the district court rejection after bench trial of their challenge to montana districting scheme under section of the voting rights act the plaintiffs live on the flathead and blackfeet indian reservations,which are located in the area including flathead,lake,glacier,and pondera counties in northwest montana.defendants bob brown and judy martz are officials of the state of montana,with responsibilities relating to elections.
montana is divided into house districts and senate districts.each senate district is composed of two house districts there are house districts and senate districts.one representative is elected from each district.the current plan contains five house districts and one majority indian senate district.state senators serve terms,whereas members of the state house of representatives serve terms.according to the census,on which montana current districting plan was based,native americans comprise about of the state population.the census indicates that the population of the state has increased but that the native american population has increased in greater proportion than the white population.montana will automatically redistrict under its laws in.
in the first trial,the district court entered judgment for the defendants after a bench trial.the district court rejected the plaintiffs claims that montana redistricting plan the plan had been adopted for a discriminatory purpose and that the plan impermissibly diluted the voting power of native americans.old person i,at.
we affirmed the district court rejection of the first claim relating to discriminatory legislative motive but reversed the district court judgment on the second claim of vote dilution.we held that the district court erred in relying on the electoral success of indians in house districts when evaluating the extent of white bloc voting,and in concluding that native americans were proportionally represented as a result of the plan.id.we remanded,directing the district court to evaluate further whether vote dilution had occurred under the totality of the circumstances.
on remand,the district court heard additional evidence relating to the and elections.only four out of the eleven plaintiffs who had been before us remained in the case.these four live in house districts hd and,and senate districts sd and.the district court held that the plaintiffs had limited standing and to prevail had to show,but did not show,vote dilution in the specific legislative districts where they resided.also,the district court held that even if the plaintiffs had shown vote dilution,their claim failed because of the unavailability of an adequate remedy.the district court reasoned that the state would be redistricting in,and the elections the last elections to be conducted under the plan were fast approaching.this appeal by the plaintiffs followed.
we set forth the standard of review in old person i

in gingles,the supreme court stressed that a finding of vote dilution should be reviewed under the test because the examination of a claim is peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case and requires an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of the contested electoral mechanisms.gingles,at.quotation marks and citations omitted.the supreme court has also stated that a district court factual findings in a case represent a blend of history and an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of the voting district in the light of past and present reality,political and otherwise.rogers lodge,d quoting white regester,d.
old person i is the law of the case.under the law of the case doctrine,a court is ordinarily precluded from reexamining an issue previously decided by the same court,or a higher court,in the same case.richardson united states,cir.the law of the case is a discretionary doctrine,which is 
founded upon the sound public policy that litigation must come to an end.an appellate court can not efficiently perform its duty to provide expeditious justice to all if a question once considered and decided by it were to be litigated anew in the same case upon any and every subsequent appeal.this doctrine also serves to maintain consistency.

the district court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing to allege dilution beyond the house and senate districts where they reside.we need not reach that issue.as our analysis makes clear,even if the plaintiffs had standing to allege vote dilution outside of their own legislative districts,that would not affect our holding that,under the totality of the circumstances,it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to determine that there was no vote dilution.
to evaluate the district court findings,we must address the elements of a claim and the type of evidence that is relevant in assessing it.
in,congress amended section of the voting rights act to eliminate any intent requirement with respect to claims.section as amended is set forth in 
a no voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,practice,or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any state or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the united states to vote on account of race or color,as provided in subsection b.
b a violation of subsection a is established if,based on the totality of circumstances,it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection a in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.the extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the state or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered provided,that nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.
in thornburg gingles,d,the supreme court held that three preconditions must be satisfied before a plaintiff can proceed to a challenge 
first,the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district.if it is not,as would be the case in a substantially integrated district,the multimember form of the district can not be responsible for minority voters inability to elect its candidates.second,the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive.if the minority group is not politically cohesive,it can not be said that the selection of a multimember electoral structure thwarts distinctive minority group interests.third,the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable the absence of special circumstances,such as the minority candidate running to defeat the minority preferred candidate.
gingles,at.citations and footnotes omitted.
although gingles involved a challenge to voting districts,the court in johnson de grandy,d,held that plaintiffs seeking to challenge a districting scheme under section of the voting rights act must meet the three threshold requirements laid out in gingles.also,de grandy reasoned that,especially in challenges to districts,the gingles preconditions must not be viewed as sufficient alone to support a finding of dilution.id.at.
after a plaintiff has satisfied the gingles preconditions,a court resolves a claim that a minority group has had less opportunity to participate in the political process,and to elect representatives of their choice,by evaluating the totality of the circumstances,as is required by the statute in section b.such an evaluation,in turn,is to be guided by the factors identified in the senate judiciary committee majority report,which accompanied the bill amending section in.these are 
the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state or political subdivision that touched the right of the members of the minority group to register,to vote,or otherwise to participate in the democratic process 
the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized 
the extent to which the state or political subdivision has used unusually large election districts,majority vote requirements,shot provisions,or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group 
if there is a candidate slating process,whether the members of the minority group have been denied access to that process 
the extent to which members of the minority group in the state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education,employment and health,which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process 
whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals 
the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.
additional factors that in some cases have had probative value as part of plaintiffs evidence to establish a violation are whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group.
whether the policy underlying the state or political subdivision use of such voting qualification,to voting,or standard,practice or procedure is tenuous.

de grandy added proportionality to the factors included in the totality of circumstances.de grandy,at.the supreme court explained that proportionality looks to the political or electoral power of minority voters rather than to the success of minority candidates.id.at.
this established law guides our review of the district court finding that vote dilution did not occur based on the totality of the circumstances.
relying on the law of the case doctrine,the district court readily adopted old person i conclusion that the gingles preconditions had been satisfied.the district court concluded that a contrary determination was not necessary to avoid a manifest injustice.we agree.the determination that all three threshold preconditions in gingles were met is not clearly erroneous.
we next consider the factors set out in gingles and de grandy as having probative value in evaluating a claim to the extent they were generally not contested.we defer to a later section our discussion of the more controversial issues.
in old person i,we said that t here was a history of discrimination by the federal government and the state of montana from the until as recently as.american indians have a lower status than whites in montana these social and economic factors hinder the ability of american indians in montana to participate fully in the political process.old person i,at.we also said that elections in some of the districts at issue were characterized by racial polarization,and that there had been overt or subtle racial appeals in two recent elections.id.the district court adopted and gave weight to these conclusions,all of which are in the plaintiffs favor.we consider each in turn.
the defendants argued that recent events showed progress in reducing discrimination against native americans in montana,but the district court properly held that an inquiry into the history of discrimination against a minority group focuses on a prior history of discrimination and that here,our holding constitutes the law of the case.
the district court accepted our determination that some elections in the districts at issue were racially polarized,and the court found that the evidence adduced on remand also supported this finding.the district court relied on both the plaintiffs and defendants statistical experts in reaching this conclusion.nothing in the record shows that the district court conclusion about racial polarization was clearly erroneous.
there was no new evidence concerning native americans status in montana,and we had previously upheld the district court finding that american indians have a lower status than whites in montana,hindering the ability of indians there to participate fully in the political process.old person i,at.the district court noted that no evidence had been presented showing that a particular change of district lines would cause indians to fare any better.
the absence of a proposed remedy is not a full answer to analysis of this factor.status hindering election participation is merely one factor in a total circumstances analysis of whether vote dilution has occurred.whether or not new boundaries are suggested,this factor weighs in favor of a finding of vote dilution.the district court reasoning shows tacit recognition of this,along with the not unsurprising observation that a redrawing of district lines would not fundamentally alter status of indians in montana.
similarly,there was no new evidence concerning the use of racial appeals in elections.we had previously upheld the trial court finding that there were racial appeals in at least two recent elections in lake county,which is within the plaintiffs legislative districts.see old person i,at.this factor,too,weighs in favor of a finding of vote dilution.
the district court also considered factors that weigh against a finding of vote dilution.the district court noted that our prior holding upheld the trial court finding that montana had not used voting practices that may enhance discrimination,and that the parties had presented no new evidence on this factor.the district court recited that,as we noted in old person i,montana has no slating process,and again,there was no contrary evidence we must conclude that native americans have not been denied access to such a process.old person i,at.the district court adhered to its prior conclusion,also previously affirmed by us,that montana officials are generally responsive to the needs of native american voters.again,the district court said that no evidence introduced on remand would lead it to change the prior finding of responsiveness.but the district court,echoing our prior views,thought this of limited relevance under a rather than test.old person i,at.the district court also found,in accord with our prior determination upholding the district court prior finding,that the policy underlying the creation of the existing district boundaries was not tenuous.on this point,again,nothing new was presented.all these findings weigh against vote dilution.there was no error in any of these findings,for all were the law of the case,and none fell within the limited exceptions to that doctrine,particularly absent supervening evidence to the contrary.
we next consider the factor of proportionality,which de grandy taught was relevant.this issue generated some controversy in the district court,and because of unsettled law,it poses challenges in analysis.
as the supreme court has explained,proportionality,a word not expressly used in the operative language of section,involves a comparison between the percentage share of legislative districts in which the population of the protected class has a majority and the protected class percentage share of the relevant population.de grandy,at the district court,doubtless affected by its ruling on standing,limited the frame of reference for proportionality to the legislative districts where the plaintiffs reside,and it looked at the number of candidates who had been elected in those and adjacent districts.the district court did not evaluate the share of districts in which the protected class of indians constitutes a majority,as contrasted with the indians overall share of population in the broader relevant area.
though the supreme court in de grandy and we in old person i were not crystal clear in explaining how to assess the relevant geographic area for assessing proportionality,and the district court reasoning was understandable,we now conclude that the district court method of assessing proportionality was not sufficiently precise and we seek to clarify our law on the calculation of proportionality.
the supreme court has suggested that proportionality is an aid to evaluate equality of opportunity,not a guarantee of electoral success for candidates.id.at.we have not determined what geographical frame of reference should be used to analyze proportionality,whether it is by district,county,or state,and the supreme court has not resolved this issue.in view of our disposition,we do not determine all pertinent issues today.however,we consider whether the frame of reference for proportionality may be limited to the legislative districts where the plaintiffs reside.
while in this case it might favor the state to limit the frame of reference to the house and senate districts where the plaintiffs reside it might do the opposite and promote manipulative litigation if we were to adopt a rule that limits the proportionality analysis in this manner to look at proportionality only for the districts where plaintiffs reside would encourage litigation with selection of particular plaintiffs living in districts where the statewide minority does not have a majority.if success in those cases led to redistricting to enhance minority voting power,there would be a resulting injustice to other voters because the districting scheme would have minimized consideration of districts where the statewide minority had effective majority control.as the de grandy court explained,
it would be absurd to suggest that the failure of a districting scheme to provide a minority group with effective political power significantly above its numerical strength indicates a denial of equal participation in the political process.failure to maximize can not be the measure of.
de grandy,at.footnote omitted.
as the frame of reference expands from one legislative district or a set of legislative districts to a county or a set of counties or to the entire state,it becomes correspondingly more difficult to select plaintiffs in clusters that misrepresent their group share of the overall population.we conclude that limiting the frame of reference to the plaintiffs legislative districts would allow for an inaccurate proportionality calculus that may interfere with the goals of the voting rights act.to hold otherwise would be to promote a result that the sixth circuit has correctly deemed to be impermissible under the voting rights,to enable future litigants to carve up successively smaller areas of the state until they are able to maximize the number of legislative districts.rural.affairs council sundquist,cir citing de grandy,at.as rural west shows,it does not follow that a statewide frame of reference is always preferable to one that is limited to a county or several counties.however,we do not need to resolve the question of when it is appropriate to focus on a county rather than the entire state.it is enough to conclude that a frame of reference that is limited to certain legislative districts is impermissibly narrow.
here,the plaintiffs argue that proportionality must be determined either by looking to the entire state or to the region that includes the flathead and blackfeet indian reservations.our holding that proportionality analysis could not here be limited to the districts of the plaintiffs residence does not require us to choose between the state or the four counties as frame of reference.in either case,there is a lack of proportionality 
the district court,focusing on the four legislative districts where the plaintiffs reside,concluded that because candidates have been elected to the montana legislature from both of the house districts at issue and from one of the two senate districts at issue in this case,the proportionality factor is satisfied.the district court should have used a broader frame of reference,and instead of considering the number of candidates who had been elected the district court should have considered the indians share of districts.because that share is not proportional under either a or a statewide frame of reference,the proportionality factor weighs in favor of a finding of vote dilution.
the district court also considered,and gave considerable weight to,the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office.the district court found that indians make up of the population in the area that includes the flathead and blackfeet indian reservations,and that out of,or,of the legislators representing those districts are indian.the district court concluded that proportional representation of american indians exists.
while we do not look at proportionality in this sense,it is clear that the factors to be considered under section in assessing vote dilution include the success of indian or candidates in elections.while the district court looked solely to the plaintiffs own legislative districts to analyze proportionality in the de grandy sense,the court looked more broadly to the area to determine representation in public office by indian candidates.both proportionality and success in elections are to be considered as part of the totality of the circumstances,and both help us to understand the ability of members of the minority to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.it necessarily follows that the same frame of reference should be used for both inquiries.the supreme court has not expressly announced such a rule,and neither have we,in our prior decisions.however,courts that have analyzed proportionality in the de grandy sense have been consistent in using the same frame of reference for that factor and for the factors set forth in gingles.see,de grandy,at.analyzing proportionality only for dade county,and not statewide,where the plaintiffs passed up the opportunity to frame their dilution claim in statewide terms and instead applied the gingles factors to hispanics in the dade county area rural west,at using the same frame of reference to examine proportionality and all of the gingles factors solomon liberty county comm rs,cir using the same county as a frame of reference in analyzing all factors.voting rights legal defense fund,villa,cir using all wards of the city of louis as the frame of reference for analyzing both proportionality and the gingles preconditions.
in old person i,we used a statewide frame of reference to consider success in elections,and we concluded that the number of american indians elected to the state legislature was roughly proportional to the american indians share of the voting age population in montana.old person i,at.in the first trial,the district court made extensive findings on success of candidates,which findings were upheld on appeal in old person on remand,the district court adhered to its prior conclusions about indians success in elections,and also further considered evidence concerning the election of a native american candidate to hd,discussed below.there was no error in the district court conclusion however,as noted above,the court evidence of election success was drawn from the area,not from the entire state.this was appropriate if the same frame of reference is used in the proportionality analysis.
as set forth above,the district court reasoned that percentages of election success by candidates bore some proportion to indian numbers in the four counties.neither we nor the supreme court has held that the same degree of correlation required by de grandy in analyzing proportionality is also required in measuring the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office.but while these two considerations may not involve exactly the same standard,a comparison between share of population and share of elected officers is an obvious and helpful measure of success.it was not clear error for the district court to conclude that where indians constituted of the relevant population and held of the elected offices in the area,the factor of success in elections favored defendants.indeed,we do not read section of the voting rights act to require any precise mathematical calculation of percentages of success in election.such calculations may be misleading or give undue weight to what is only one of many factors listed in gingles.what is important is that the district court consider the success in elections of the protected class.neither the statute,nor the senate report pertinent to its interpretation,nor the supreme court teachings in gingles or de grandy require any particular form for the district court assessment of election success.
in making its finding about election success,the district court stressed evidence concerning the election of joey jayne,a tribal member and an candidate,in hd in the election.plaintiffs argue that this evidence has little weight because jayne ran against a candidate who came close to winning.but elections are not horseshoes,and having a close win is not the same as losing an election.the factor designated by the gingles court,success in elections,favors defendants when the protected class has had success that determination is not the sole basis for evaluating the minority group political power it is one of the factors that make up the totality of the circumstances.the district court properly concluded that while jayne election does not show that there is no bloc voting in the four districts at issue,her election could be considered in determining the extent to which minority candidates have been elected to office.
the district court found that factors indicating vote dilution included the history of official discrimination in the state racial polarization of elections factors hindering political participation and use of racial appeals in elections.factors weighing in the other direction included the absence of voting practices that would enhance discrimination absence of denial of access to a slating process state officials responsiveness to the needs of indian voters the absence of a tenuous policy underlying the creation of the existing district boundaries and the election of native americans to public office.lack of proportionality,which the district court included on the second list,in our analysis should have been added to the factors weighing in favor of vote dilution.
after weighing all pertinent factors,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of establishing vote dilution.the district court analysis of proportionality was erroneous,as we see it,because the proportionality analysis had to be made for a broader area than the districts where the plaintiffs reside.of course,that analysis would only be one factor in the overall assessment,based on total circumstances,of whether there was vote dilution in the districts where plaintiffs resided.the court assessment of success in elections by indian candidates was not clearly erroneous.
we must face the ultimate question as to whether our disagreement on proportionality analysis requires reversal.it is not an easy task for a district court to assess vote dilution.the language of the statute speaks in terms of equal opportunity for protected minority classes to participate in the electoral process.the consideration of a section b vote dilution claim by the statute terms is to be made based on the totality of circumstances.the supreme court in gingles set forth a long line of factors relevant to the assessment,based on the senate report underlying the amendments.initially,as explained in gingles,this did not include proportionality,but the court in de grandy added proportionality as a factor,though without defining its contours precisely.the standards that we today derive from our assessment of de grandy and other relevant considerations are nowhere set forth in explicit statutory language.surely,it would be helpful if congress or the supreme court were to revisit the thorny issue of vote dilution but absent clarification,district courts and we must proceed as carefully as possible based on settled grounds.
there are two things that are absolutely clear in the congress directive of section of the voting rights act and the supreme court guidance on it.one is that an assessment of vote dilution,an insidious form of indirect discrimination,must be made based on the totality of circumstances.whatever factors are to be considered,and indeed they are many and varied as explained by the supreme court,none is talismanic,none alone has controlling weight,none provides safe harbor,and none yields per se violation.
the other point that has been made perfectly clear by the supreme court is that in this unusual sphere of law,where legal principle may necessarily interact with the state or local legislature sense of political practicality,the ultimate legal question whether vote dilution has occurred is to be treated as factual,and reviewed not de novo but rather for clear error.the supreme court direction that we apply this standard,usually reserved for factual decisions based on credibility of witnesses and the like,to a question with at least mixed legal and factual aspects,must surely reflect the supreme court decision that the congressional scheme will work best if the inherently factual issues of vote dilution are resolved by district courts close to the scene,and that the district court decisions be given particular deference.
this is one of those not unusual cases where our decision is controlled by the proper standard of review.on one side of the scale lies a history of official discrimination,the presence of racially polarized elections,the presence of factors limiting indians political participation,the use of racial appeals in elections,and disproportionality.on the other side of the scale we see the absence of discriminatory voting practices,the viable policy underlying the existing district boundaries,the success of indians in elections,and officials responsiveness to native americans needs.we have fully considered the legal issues presented and the detailed factual record with which the district court grappled.we can not say that the district court determination that there was no vote dilution,considered in the totality of circumstances,was clearly erroneous 
the district court erred in alternatively holding that the plaintiffs claims failed,even if they showed vote dilution,because of the district court view that there was no adequate remedy for the alleged voting rights act violation.we conclude that the integrity of the voting rights act requires that a substantive assessment be made,even if the only practical relief available is declaratory relief after an election is held.
the plaintiffs submitted several proposed redistricting plans.the defendants dispute the adequacy of the plaintiffs plans,but the district court did not rule on the plaintiffs proposal,instead holding that the proximity of the next election cycle and of the state own redistricting precluded any remedy.
the eleventh circuit has derived a remedy requirement from the supreme court gingles opinion and other supreme court precedent.see negron city of miami beach,cir en banc.as the court explained in nipper smith,cir 
the absence of an available remedy is not only relevant at the remedial stage of the litigation,but also precludes,under the totality of the circumstances inquiry,a finding of liability.as we note above,a court can not determine whether the voting strength of a minority group has been impermissibly diluted without having some alternative electoral structure in mind for comparison.thus,where there is no objective and workable standard for choosing a reasonable benchmark by which to evaluate a challenged voting practice,it follows that the voting practice can not be challenged as dilutive under.
id.at citations and quotation marks omitted.even if we were to adopt the eleventh circuit view of the remedy requirement,the district court appears to have improperly extended it by focusing,not on whether the plaintiffs provided an adequate redistricting plan,but on how disruptive redistricting would be.we think it correct,as the plaintiffs point out,that redistricting could not be accomplished before the next pending elections.we also reject as unfeasible the plaintiffs contention that the terms of the next state legislators could be shortened to allow another election without vote dilution.injunctive relief of such a nature would be extremely disruptive to states and inconsistent with the relations between the federal government and the states.but to say that the plaintiffs should lose if they have an otherwise valid claim because of disruption would subject them to an impossible burden,and one that would defeat the purpose of the voting rights act if a scheme that controls elections could escape scrutiny on the ground that it can not be corrected in time,the effect would be to ignore a problem that is capable of repetition,yet evading review.moore ogilvie,d quoting southern pac.terminal interstate commerce comm n.
although there will be no further proceedings in this case because of our affirmance of the district court conclusion that there is no voting rights act violation,had there been a finding of violation the district court could have given declaratory relief explaining the nature of the violation and how it might be avoided in the future.because the state has plans to engage in redistricting on a regular basis,any problem could then have been corrected by the future redistricting and a ruling from the district court on the merits may aid those charged with redistricting duties.
we affirm the district court ruling dismissing the voting rights act claim based on the conclusion that there was no vote dilution.
the turbid waters of voting rights jurisprudence conceal shoals that precedent makes difficult to acknowledge 
first.it would appear that the most relevant figures would be the ratio of registered majority and minority voters.if registration is not taken into account,phantoms are compared.no doubt,past discrimination may have discouraged the minority from registering but account should be by how many now have qualified to vote.
second.in any decent democracy,the quality of the candidates has some impact on the voters.not every member of a racial or ethnic group votes blindly for a candidate from the group.if the district judge is to consider the totality of the circumstances,the judge should be free to notice cases where a grossly inferior candidate from the majority was preferred to a much better qualified candidate from the minority or when a grossly inferior candidate from the minority was defeated by a much better qualified candidate from the majority.to be sure,judgment as to superiority or inferiority would require a political judgment from the judge but so do the other factors the judge is required to consider.
third.use of race or ethnicity to defeat racial or ethnic bias is a dangerous remedy,like using a back fire to contain a fire.see ho san francisco unified school district,at cir.every time a federal court acts on the assumption that voters divide and vote on racial or ethnic lines reinforces stereotypes and stimulates thinking on racial or ethnic lines.realistically it is necessary at times to employ this dangerous remedy,but it is a remedy to be used with keen awareness of its potentially inflammatory and reactionary effect.the rights of americans are the rights of individuals,for which,at times,race or ethnicity acts as a surrogate.id.
this case is before us for review for the second time.old person cooney,cir old person i.
in thornburg gingles,d,the supreme court described a claim after the amendments the essence of a claim is that a certain electoral law,practice,or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.
the de grandy court also explained the difficulties in proving vote dilution based on districts plaintiffs challenging districts may claim,not total submergence,but partial submergence not the chance for some electoral success in place of none,but the chance for more success in place of some.when the question thus comes down to the reasonableness of drawing a series of district lines in one combination of places rather than another,judgments about inequality may become closer calls.as facts beyond the ambit of the three gingles factors loom correspondingly larger,factfinders can not rest uncritically on assumptions about the force of the gingles factors in pointing to grandy,at.
normally the protected class is one that is a minority in a relevant geographic area broader than a particular legislative district.
it must be kept in mind that proportionality in this sense is only one factor to be considered in assessing the totality of circumstances to determine if unlawful vote dilution has created an unequal political and electoral opportunity for a protected class.de grandy,at.just as the supreme court in de grandy made clear that proportionality of opportunity can not be a safe harbor precluding section liability which turns on total circumstances,id.at,so too a showing of lack of proportionality is but one factor in the total circumstances analysis.it could not be correct to treat proportionality as but one factor if exculpatory while viewing it as a per se violation if inculpatory.in either case,the supreme court has made clear that the degree of probative value assigned to proportionality may vary with other facts.no single statistic provides courts with a shortcut to determine whether a set of districts unlawfully dilutes minority voting strength.id.at.we also address the significance of that factor in the overall assessment of vote dilution based on totality of circumstances,when we address infra whether the finding of no vote dilution was clearly erroneous.
if the frame of reference were limited in this manner,it would include only four legislati
