the superior court granted a writ of mandate,pursuant to elections code section amending the digest prepared by the ballot simplification committee of proposition a,a revenue bond measure,submitted to the voters of the city and county of san francisco hereafter the city at the november municipal election.the city appeals contending section does not authorize the revision of a digest that provides an impartial summary of the chief purpose and points of the measure and is neither false nor misleading.we shall conclude that the court erred in issuing the writ of mandate,but that the error does not require reversal.
proposition a 
the san francisco board of supervisors submitted proposition a to the voters for the november,election.it asked the voters whether the city should issue revenue bonds,or other forms of revenue financing,in a principal amount not to exceed,to pay for improvements to the city water supply system.the proposition provided that the cost of repaying these bonds would be financed by an increase in water rates.it also provided that the principal amount of the bonds may be reduced if the city board of supervisors determines the greatest economic value to san francisco ratepayers will derive from having the san francisco bay area regional water system financing authority finance,in whole or in part,those projects designed and intended in substantial part to improve the reliability of the city regional water system.if the authority does finance such projects,the public utilities commission puc would also be authorized to impose a surcharge on retail water rates to pay the retail water customer share of the debt service on bonds issued by the authority,and the operating expenses of the authority 
digest prepared by ballot simplification committee 
in accordance with san francisco election law,a voter information pamphlet was prepared for the november election.municipal elections code mec.for proposition a the pamphlet included i the city attorney statement or question for the measure ii the controller financial analysis iii and a digest prepared by the ballot simplification committee.mec,c.this digest consists of four sections the way it is now the proposal a yes vote means and a no vote means.mec,a.
the digest prepared by the ballot simplification committee explained,under the heading,the way it is now,that parts of san francisco existing water supply system were in need of repair or replacements.the proposal portion of the digest stated that proposition a is a revenue bond that would authorize the city to borrow to pay for improvements to its water system.it enumerated the categories of improvement the money would be used for,and stated that r ates charged to water system customers in san francisco would be increased over time to repay these bonds.san francisco landlords could pass on to tenants in units half the increase in water rates resulting from the bond.suburban water system users would finance and pay for their share of improvements to the water system.finally,the digest explained that a yes vote means you want the city to borrow to make water system improvements,to be paid for with increased water rates.a no vote means you do not want the city to borrow for these purposes.
horneff petition and relief 
two months before the november election,michelle horneff filed a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate and injunctive relief pursuant to section.she alleged that the digest was false,misleading,incomplete,unfair and prejudicial,because it omitted any reference to the provisions of proposition a permitting the principal amount of the bonds to be reduced if the board of supervisors determined that it would be more economical to have the authority finance the improvements and authorizing the puc,in that event,to impose a surcharge on retail water rates to pay the retail water customer share of the debt service on bonds issued by the authority and the operating expenses of the authority.the city opposed the petition on the ground that section authorized the court to order an amendment or deletion of election material only upon clear and convincing proof that the material in question is false,misleading,or inconsistent with the requirements of this chapter.the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the city to add the following sentence at the end of the section entitled the proposal 
if in the future the san francisco board of supervisors determines that it is cheaper to pay for water system improvements by joining with suburbs to create a regional water financing authority,then a surcharge will be imposed on san franciscans to pay for the additional costs including to pay for the operating expenses of the authority.
the city complied with the order and filed a timely notice of appeal.proposition a was approved by the voters.
section is a preelection remedy.the city appeal is arguably moot because the election has already taken place and proposition a passed.nevertheless,this court has the discretion to consider the merits if the appeal presents a question capable of repetition,yet evading review ferrara belanger cal d,hammond agran th,d or the issue is of continuing public interest.patterson board of supervisors d.after an election had taken place,this court applied the exception to mootness doctrine,to review writ ordering the deletion of portions of ballot arguments brennan board of supervisors d,fn.hereafter brennan this court applied the same exception to review,postelection,a writ requiring revision of digest prepared by ballot simplification committee.respondent urges us not to apply this exception to the mootness doctrine in this case.she argues that our prior decision in brennan,supra,d.has settled the law concerning the requisite contents of a digest prepared by a ballot simplification committee and the standard to be applied in determining whether a judicially ordered revision is appropriate.we decline to deem the case moot.the issue raised is a matter of continuing public interest,and the arguments in this appeal demonstrate the need to clarify our holding in brennan.
standard to be applied for mandamus relief under section 
brennan,supra,d,was also an appeal of an order in a mandamus proceeding revising a ballot simplification digest.respondent interprets our decision in brennan to stand for the proposition that the trial court has a broad power of judicial review which includes the right of the trial court to modify digests that are not complete.while we did state in brennan that many of the trial court revisions to the digest rendered it more complete,we held that it was error for the court to amend the digest solely for that purpose respondent assertion that the court has broad power to revise a digest prepared by the ballot simplification committee to make it more complete undoubtedly derives from our comparison in brennan of the trial court revisions with the digest.while we agreed that some of the statements in the digest were not complete,and that the court revisions improved it id.at,our analysis was never intended as an endorsement of the proposition that the trial court may revise a digest that is not false or misleading and which fairly and impartially states the chief purpose and points of the measure.rather,our analysis illustrated that,although the revisions should not have been made,the error did not require a postelection reversal because the effect of the revision was only to create a more accurate and thorough summary.id.at.
the correct standard of judicial review in determining whether to grant a request to amend or delete material in a ballot simplification digest is the same as the principles applied to judicial review of challenges to titles and summaries prepared by the attorney general and legislative analyst for statewide initiatives or referenda the test is not whether the digest is complete,but rather whether it contains a statement of the major objectives or chief purposes and points of the measure.brennan,supra,d at.it need not refer to auxiliary or subsidiary matters,nor need it contain a summary or index of all of the measure provisions.within certain limits what
