a federal statute makes it a criminal offense to make or cause the telephone of another repeatedly or continuously to ring,with intent to harass any person at the called number.a d.james tobin was convicted by a federal jury in new hampshire of conspiracy to commit this offense,and of aiding and abetting another to do so,and now appeals.the events leading to the conviction are as follows.
in,tobin was new england regional director of the republican national committee.prior to the november election,tobin traveled to new hampshire to coordinate vip visits to the state.during the visit tobin was approached by charles mcgee,executive director of the new hampshire republican state committee.there ensued a conversation regarding a plan by mcgee to disrupt the operations of the new hampshire democratic party on election day.
during this conversation mcgee asked for the name of someone who might be able to assist in a plan of this sort.tobin provided the name of allen raymond,a longtime acquaintance,who owned a business that coordinated and designed telephone services for candidates and campaigns.tobin and mcgee did not speak again,but tobin made a telephone call to raymond to alert raymond to expect mcgee call.
mcgee and raymond spoke together and each other several more times and agreed upon the means of would inundate specified numbers with the price for it.mcgee asked raymond to check with legal counsel,and raymond thereafter said that he had.none of these calls or any were made known to tobin.mcgee provided raymond with six telephone numbers five were for democratic party phones and one was for the firefighters union,which was offering rides to the polls.
just as the polls were opening on election day,mcgee direct superior,john dowd,ordered the operation called off.mcgee then attempted to contact raymond.however,for approximately minutes,the phones at the targeted numbers rang almost continuously and the six telephone lines were blocked by repeated phone calls made by the firm that raymond had earlier retained.later raymond called tobin to talk about what happened,calling again after being contacted by police about the phone jamming.
on may,a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging tobin with crimes stemming from the phone in new hampshire.the indictment charged a violation of conspiracy to violate civil rights conspiracy under to violate a c,d and aiding and abetting these last two violations,a.
mcgee and raymond each pled guilty to a violation of a c.mcgee served seven months and raymond sentence was reduced to three months after his cooperation at tobin trial.tobin proceeded to trial,which began on december.at trial the government principal witnesses were mcgee and raymond.at the close of the government case,tobin moved for judgment of acquittal.the government then dismissed,with the district court permission,all charges relating to section a c.
on december,the jury acquitted tobin on the first count conspiracy to violate the rights of voters and found tobin guilty of conspiracy to violate and of aiding and abetting a violation of section a d.tobin moved unsuccessfully for judgment of acquittal,arrest of judgment and for a new trial.tobin was sentenced on may,to months imprisonment,two years supervised release,and a fine.
tobin first and most claim of error relates to the proper meaning of section a d intent to harass requirement.from the outset,the district judge was concerned that the government was seeking to extend the statute from one directed at harassment of the called party to one embracing the disruption of telecommunications systems.in the end,the judge adopted a compromise,instructing the jury on the definition of harass as follows 
a person uses the telephone to harass another if he or she intentionally employs the phone in a way that is not meant as a good faith effort to communicate with a person at the number called and is done with an unjustifiable motive.so,for example,it is possible to intentionally cause the telephone of another to ring repeatedly and yet not violate the law if the caller is trying,in good faith,to contact someone at the number called.
if,however,the caller causes the telephone of another to ring repeatedly and the caller is doing so for reasons other than a good faith effort to communicate with someone at the number called,the law deems such conduct to be harassing.so,in the context of this case,the word harass means and describes conduct that is intentionally designed not to communicate,but instead to impede,distract,disrupt or undermine,in a substantial and not a trivial way,the ability of persons at the called numbers to communicate with others and to effectively go about their business.
on appeal,tobin argues that harass,in the present context,means to cause emotional distress in persons at the called number,that the jury should have been so advised,and that the good faith and unjustifiable motive language greatly broaden the statute beyond its permissible meaning the government responds that the attack was not preserved in the district court and is also without merit.
it is true that tobin did not ask the district judge to use the emotional distress language now urged.understandably seeking the narrowest reading,tobin asked the district court in objection to the instructions to define the term harass to mean to threaten or frighten.tobin position on appeal is less restrictive,and wisely so,since nothing in the term harass limits it to threatening or frightening conduct.
this omission,unless the two versions are very close,arguably forfeits this always to the plain error doctrine.compare united states fuchs,cir,with arthur andersen llp united states,d.whether the plain error test could be met need not be decided because we agree with a companion objection to the instruction which tobin fully preserved,namely,that quoting his objection 
the references to an unjustifiable motive and reasons other than a good faith effort to communicate dilute the intent requirement,which is a specific intent to harass,not just any unjustifiable motive or any reason other than a good faith effort to communicate.
we side with tobin on this single issue.the district judge made a creditable effort to make sense of the perplexing statute.but in the end,the district court unjustifiable motive and good faith language,used virtually to define intent to harass,broadens the statute unduly.in considering the objection,we are required to consider just what congress meant by harassment and the problem is not straightforward.
we begin with statutory language.new hampshire hemp council,marshall,cir.black refers to w ords,conduct,or action usu.repeated or persistent that,being directed at a specific person,annoys,alarms,or causes substantial emotional distress in that person and serves no legitimate purpose.black law dictionary ed.this core conception,echoed in other dictionaries,suggests that emotional distress would itself be too narrow a reading 
another shade of usage,which the government points to in defending the instruction,is harass in a more tactical sense,as to trouble by repeated attacks,incursions,as in war or hostilities harry raid.the random house dictionary of the english language,unabridged ed.but even here the word trouble invites attention to the likely reaction of the concern borne out by the examples in the legislative history,cong.rec,statement of staggers think of the person called to the telephone countless times during the day and night only to have the caller hang up when he answers.
the legislative history also suggests that a prime motive of the harassment provisions of the current subsections c and d was harassing calls made to service personnel and their families during the vietnam war.see,cong.rec,statement of kornegay t estimony from the defense department indicates that harassing telephone calls are now being used by a perverted few against the families of our servicemen who are serving overseas,particularly in vietnam.these harassments have included everything from false reports of death or injury,to threats,demands for money for the vietcong,and gloating comment on the actual death in combat of servicemen.these were,of course,calls designed to make the recipients to tie up the telephone.
admittedly,the government offers two examples in the legislative history of a prior unenacted version of the only at washington,but virtually identical to the version later mention the difficulties caused by the tying up of the telephone but both examples concern calls primarily of the ordinary harassment concerned a domestic dispute and the other was directed at an employee though they also disrupted business operations.
the district court bad motive instruction would include harassing conduct so defined but would also include almost anything else of which the jury might disapprove including conduct that was solely designed to interfere with telephone communications.we think that a congress that sought to reach and outlaw attempts wrongfully to disrupt communications would have used quite different language,impede access or use disrupt,along the lines of state statutes that are expressly so aimed it is also hard to think why a congress seeking to protect access to unimpeded telephone communication would have been worried only about disruption caused by ringing as opposed,for example,to cutting the line or sabotaging the gear where the drop cable enters the home.
little circuit precedent exists one way or the other,but the case closest in point is mildly helpful to tobin.in united states bowker,cir,rev on other grounds,d,the sixth circuit construed subsection c note,above,to read harass to have the same meaning as companion terms in the subsection,abuse,threaten.presumptively,subsections c and d should be read together.cohen de la cruz,d.
in sum we think that to equate harassment with any repeat calling done in bad faith is to enlarge the scope of the statute.we read subsection d to require an intent to provoke adverse reactions in the called party and hold that a bad motive of some other kind standing alone is not enough.there might be good reason for a federal statute directed expressly to simple,deliberate disruption but that is a matter for congress to determine.
on our reading,the instruction language was overbroad and clearly prejudicial to tobin.the motive for the calls was unjustifiable,they were made in bad faith,and their effect was in the words of the instruction to prevent in a substantial and not a trivial way the ability of persons at the called numbers to communicate with others.the government does not and could not make a harmless error argument so a remand is required.neder united states,d.
tobin says that instead of a new trial we ought to order an outright acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to permit a rational jury to convict on either of the two counts of conviction.united states,cir.the two counts,conspiracy and aiding and abetting,both relate to the same underlying subsection d offense,but they differ in their elements,and we begin with the conspiracy charge.
the underlying offense requires that someone make or cause the telephone of another repeatedly or continuously to ring,with intent to harass any person at the called number.the conspiracy offense occurs if the defendant agreed with another to commit the crime,whether or not the crime was actually committed.united states feola,d iannelli united states,d.the general conspiracy statute requires as well an overt act,but such acts occurred in this case.united states licausi,cir,cert.denied,d.
tobin argues that if any agreement occurred to commit the offense,it was achieved after all contact between tobin and the others had ceased and that tobin never agreed to the disruption plan that forms the basis for the conspiracy charge.the strength of the argument is that prior to election day,tobin had only one pertinent conversation with mcgee and one with raymond,and only after that did mcgee and raymond work out the concrete details.
but to comprise a conspiracy,a scheme need not be fleshed out.a drug distribution conspiracy exists once two persons agree to obtain cocaine and distribute it,even if the amount,timing,supplier,price and distribution method are all left open.united states,cir.nor need the agreement be explicit the understanding that comprises the agreement can be inferred from the consolidation of efforts.iannelli,at.
there is a sound basis for this minimalist conception of agreement,developments in the law criminal conspiracy,harv,and anyway the law is settled.interstate circuit united states.for us,the issues are whether the evidence in this case permitted a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that a plan to cause the jamming telephone calls was agreed to by tobin and that tobin also shared the necessary intent as to harassment.
mcgee testified that he first considered disrupting the democratic party voter turnout efforts in response to a democratic party protest outside his office in october.vendors he contacted were unhelpful and three or four days before the election,mcgee approached tobin.mcgee testified,i do know how much detail i went into with him,but i think i gave him the essence of the plan or the idea and asked him if he knew somebody who could help me.
the government then asked mcgee,and the essence of the idea was disrupting phone lines yes,mcgee replied.and making telephone calls to disrupt phone lines yes.what does tobin say to you he gives me the name of a gentleman by the name of allen raymond and his phone number.mcgee then testified that tobin said something to the effect that he might be able to help you or he can help you or something like that,adding that if tobin had told him no,he would not have proceeded.
on,the defense easily got mcgee to repeat that he was unsure as to the level of detail and to state that tobin did not agree to participate with mcgee to violate the law.but the level of detail does not control so long as tobin,with the necessary intent to harass,knowingly joined in a venture to cause the ringing of the phones and no express agreement is required for conspiracy.further,as a general rule,ignorance of the law is not a defense to a criminal prosecution.cheek united states,d 
nevertheless,without raymond testimony,it is unclear whether a jury could have found that tobin knew that the expressed to be caused by repeat calls,which would or might tie up the phone lines of the recipient.raymond filled this gap.after explaining that his company was a telemarketing broker who hired others to do automated calls,voter identification calls or voter advocacy calls for election campaigns,he described his call from tobin as follows 
q what does he say 
a he tells me that he like to talk to me about a phone project in new hampshire and then explains the project to me as to what it would entail.
q and what does he tell you 
a he tells me that it would entail jamming,essentially disrupting,democratic party and affiliated democratic organizations efforts to on election day.
q and after he says that,what,if anything,do you say next 
a my response is that anything can be done.yes,we can probably do it.i related to him an example of inadvertent phone jamming which involves sometimes when you have a large volume of calls going into one switch,sometimes you will inadvertently jam the switch,thus essentially jamming the phone lines.so my point there is that if it can be done inadvertently,it can be done intentionally,and then i tell him that we can do it,that anything is possible.
this call by tobin was to introduce mcgee to raymond,and tobin had no further contact with either until the plan had been briefly put into effect.but the testimony allowed a jury to conclude that tobin knew that the disruption was to be caused by multiple phone calls made in order to tie up phone lines.the only remaining question as to agreement is whether a jury could rationally conclude that tobin had so far associated himself with the emerging plan as to make him effectively a party to it.
this is surely a close call.the jamming mechanism described by raymond was slightly different than the final version and tobin never explicitly endorsed the plan.but nothing in the evidence or the cases cited to us by tobin precludes a r
