brent gamble,presiding judge of the district court in harris county and candidate for reelection,asks this court to order the fourteenth court of appeals to vacate its conditional writ of mandamus that compels election officials to omit his name from the republican primary ballot although we disagree with the court of appeals construction of the election code,we do agree judge gamble failed in the trial court to establish his entitlement to be on that primary ballot.as a result,the court of appeals was correct in ordering his name off the ballot.accordingly,we deny this petition for writ of mandamus.but our reasons differ from the court of appeals.
on december,judge gamble filed his application to have his name placed on the republican primary ballot.in that application,he identified the office sought as judge,civil dist.court.yet the petitions accompanying his application identified district judge,judicial district as the elected office he sought.initially,judge gamble was placed on the candidate list as a candidate for the district court.but on january,the day after the filing deadline,kathy haigler,harris county republican party primary director,notified judge gamble that she planned to remove his name from the party candidate list because his application and his petitions did not match up as required by the election code.
on january,judge gamble filed a petition for injunctive relief in the district court in harris county and sought a temporary restraining order against both haigler and the harris county republican party secretary,iris manes he ostensibly sought only to prohibit the party officials from removing his name,but the relief he sought was to require the officials to submit his name as a candidate for the district court on the list of candidates being certified to the texas secretary of state office.his supporting affidavits showed that his political consultant prepared the application form,and that she mistakenly filled in civil dist.court after completing an application for another client who held that office.although judge gamble signed and swore to the truth of the application,he claims that he did not notice that the wrong court had been designated.
the trial court granted immediate relief.it ordered the secretary and primary director of the harris county republican party to refrain from omitting judge gamble name as a candidate for judge of the district court from the list of candidates to be submitted to the secretary of state and others by january,under section of the election code.the court further ordered the party officials to refrain from preventing judge gamble from correcting his application.and as it is required to do,the trial court set the merits of judge gamble claims for a temporary injunction hearing on january,
judge gamble promptly filed a corrected application and the harris county republican party chair included him as a candidate for judge of the th district court on the list of candidates delivered to the secretary of state.after judge gamble was added to the list,he nonsuited his petition rather than proceed to a merits consideration at the january temporary injunction hearing.
tasso triantaphyllis,the democratic candidate for judge of the district court,attempted to intervene,but judge gamble had already taken his nonsuit.triantaphyllis also filed for mandamus relief in the fourteenth court of appeals on january,asking the court to direct jared woodfill,harris county republican party chair,as well as other party officials,to remove judge gamble from the republican primary ballot because of defects in his original application.
the court of appeals agreed that the original application was defective and concluded that judge gamble had no right to amend it after the january filing deadline.the court further concluded that the party chair had a ministerial duty to omit judge gamble from the list of candidates certified for the primary election once he discovered the deficiency in judge gamble application.the court conditionally issued the writ,ordering the election officials to remove judge gamble from the list of candidates,thus omitting him from the republican party primary ballot.
here,judge gamble complains that the court of appeals erred in its construction of the election code and abused its discretion in issuing the conditional writ that removes him from the primary ballot.his argument relies on sections and of the election code.section a provides that a party official shall review the application to determine whether it complies with the requirements as to form,content,and procedure.this review is to be completed within five days after the application is filed unless the application is accompanied by a petition if an application is accompanied by a petition,as was the case with judge gamble application,the review shall be completed as soon as practicable after the date it filed if an application is defective,the election official must reject it and notify the candidate immediately in writing of the reason for the rejection 
judge gamble argues that had party officials promptly notified him that his application and petitions were in conflict,as was their duty under section,he would have quickly remedied the error by amending the application to reflect his desire to be a candidate for the district court.he also argues that he could have corrected the error before the january deadline because he had filed his application on december,well in advance of the deadline.judge gamble submits that because the party officials failed to notify him of the defect until january and,therefore,prevented him from curing the defect before the filing deadline,he is entitled to injunctive relief under section,which provides 
a person who is being harmed or is in danger of being harmed by a violation or threatened violation of this code is entitled to appropriate injunctive relief to prevent the violation from continuing or occurring.
a request for injunctive relief invokes a court equity jurisdiction as is evident,the legislature has specifically called upon the courts to exercise their equitable powers to resolve election code violations.and when exercising such jurisdiction,a court must,among other things,balance competing equities thus,the provision for injunctive relief in section of election code incorporates these principles which,in turn,control the remedy.
judge gamble concludes that one remedy a candidate may obtain under this section is a reasonable extension of time beyond the january deadline to cure a defective application which could have been corrected before the deadline but for the neglect of the party officials to act.judge gamble says that this court has previously recognized remedies for candidates after the expiration of statutory deadlines when necessary to correct a party official statutory violation.we note,though,that in those cases,the candidates were not at fault as judge gamble was here 
the court of appeals in this case reasoned that when the candidate is at fault,the candidate should bear the ultimate responsibility for the error even though a party official shared responsibility for not catching the mistake before the filing deadline the court concluded that after the filing deadline passed,judge gamble had no right,equitable or otherwise,to amend his application to correct the designation of the office he sought.
as a general proposition,a candidate must bear ultimate responsibility for his or her error.but we disagree that a candidate fault automatically precludes his or her right to seek equitable relief.certainly,the candidate has a duty to file a compliant application before the filing deadline but likewise,party officials have a duty to review the application and promptly notify the candidate when the application does not comply 
while section is indisputably designed to assure that candidates are properly qualified to be nominated as a party candidate for the general election,that is not the only reason for the provision.this section also serves as a safety net for candidates who file their applications early in the filing period,assuring that individuals willing to commit to public service will receive the assistance of party officials in complying with the myriad and technical requirements for becoming a party candidate.there would be no purpose to the duty to notify the prospective candidate of defects in his or her application if the intent was not to allow an opportunity to cure those defects,particularly if the defects can be corrected before the filing deadline thus,a party official failure to follow the application review and notice requirements of section in a timely manner is also significant and is a consideration for a court called upon to hear a candidate claim for equitable relief.to be sure,the candidate own fault is a consideration when weighing the right to equitable relief,but mistakes on an application are not an absolute bar to equitable relief.
in the end,a court power to fashion equitable relief in an election case is not unrestrained.while a court may order equitable relief from a statutory deadline,its action is constrained by the election schedule itself.generally,courts will not exercise equitable powers when their exercise may delay the election further,while extending the statutory deadline is one example of equitable relief,it is an extraordinary departure from the careful planning of the legislature,and not to be invoked lightly.
in this case,judge gamble contends that the only defect in the application is a clerical one,appearing on its face that party officials should have noticed and called to his attention well before the filing deadline expired.such facts,if true,state a claim for equitable relief.triantaphyllis may,of course,disagree with judge gamble allegations or have other evidence which demonstrates that equitable relief should not be granted.whether judge gamble is entitled to equitable relief,therefore,can only be decided after a hearing on the merits where interested parties have an opportunity to be heard.
although we agree that equitable remedies may be fashioned and that,under limited circumstances,statutory deadlines may be extended to correct an official violation of a statutory duty,we have no basis to grant the relief requested by judge gamble in this case.the only order supporting judge gamble entitlement to equitable relief is a temporary restraining order which is not a decision on the merits.it issued here without opposing arguments or challenge,and while we are concerned with its use as a tool for affirmative relief in this case,that is not the focus of our attention.rather as a matter of law,the order,because it was a temporary restraining order,provided only interim relief it got judge gamble name on the list certified to the secretary of state,but regardless,it could not assure him a place on the ballot.that because he did not pursue the matter to a determination on the merits that would entitle him to be on the ballot.the temporary restraining order had limited life,and it did not survive judge gamble nonsuit 
which brings us to triantaphyllis petition for writ of mandamus in the court of appeals.on january,when this action was brought,judge gamble application on file at the filing deadline was defective.there was no court decision entitling judge gamble to amend his application after the statutory deadline.triantaphyllis mandamus petition,which attacked the original application,had a basis in law for being granted.accordingly,the court of appeals did not abuse its mandamus authority when it ordered judge gamble name removed 
the petition for writ of mandamus is denied.
this is an election mandamus.the issue is whether the election code the code permits a party officer to allow a candidate who filed a defective application before the filing deadline to amend his application after the deadline so the party chair can place the candidate on the ballot.the code and texas law answer this question no.consequently,i agree with the court judgment denying mandamus relief.but i can not join in the court opinion because it wholly contradicts texas election law.
background 
the following facts are undisputed.judge brent gamble is the presiding judge of the district court in harris county.on december,judge gamble filed an application to have his name placed on the republican party primary ballot.his application stated that the office he sought for election was judge,civil dist.court.judge gamble contends that he intended to file for the district court,the court he currently presides over.indeed,the petitions accompanying judge gamble application identified the district court as the office he seeks.
the day after the january,filing deadline,kathy haigler,the harris county republican party primary director,notified judge gamble that she intended to remove his name from the party candidate list.haigler advised judge gamble that she could not list him as a candidate for the district court because his application stated that he was running for judge of the district court.
on january,judge gamble filed an original petition that requested a temporary restraining order against haigler and the harris county republican party secretary,iris manes.see.judge gamble petition alleged that haigler and manes did not properly review his application and notify him of a defect within five days of the date he filed it.see.b.consequently,judge gamble requested the trial court to order haigler and manes to allow judge gamble to correct his application and to refrain from excluding judge gamble from the candidate list.
judge gamble submitted affidavits to support his application for a tro.they show that his political consultant prepared his application and inadvertently wrote district court rather than district court.judge gamble did not notice the error and signed the application with a sworn statement that he intended to run for district court.haigler stated in her affidavit that before the filing deadline she reviewed judge gamble petition,which stated that he was running for the district court.at that time,haigler assumed judge gamble application also correctly listed the office he sought.therefore,she did not carefully review the application when gamble first filed it,and she did not notice the error until the day after the filing deadline.
the trial court granted a tro on january.the tro ordered haigler and manes to refrain from omitting judge gamble from the party list as a candidate for the district court.moreover,the tro ordered haigler and manes to refrain from preventing judge gamble from correcting his application.the next day,judge gamble filed a corrected application with haigler.then,on january,haigler filed the republican party candidate list,which included judge gamble as a candidate for the district court.
on january,judge gamble nonsuited his injunction petition.thus,the hearing,which the trial court set for that day,never took place.the democratic candidate for the district court,tasso triantaphyllis,attempted to intervene in judge gamble suit,but he could not do so because judge gamble had nonsuited.
on the same day judge gamble nonsuited his injunction action,triantaphyllis filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the court of appeals.he asked that court to compel various respondents collectively the party chair to refrain from certifying judge gamble as a candidate on the primary election ballot and to remove his name from the candidate list.triantaphyllis argued that the code did not authorize the party chair to allow judge gamble to correct his application after the filing deadline so the party chair could put him on the candidate list.
the court of appeals granted triantaphyllis mandamus relief on january.it concluded that,after the filing deadline,judge gamble had no right,equitable or otherwise,to amend his application to correct the designation of the office he sought.at.it also determined that the the party ultimately responsible for filing a correct application before the filing deadline.accordingly,the court of appeals held that the party chair must exclude judge gamble name from the candidate list for the district court.at.
judge gamble now petitions this court for a writ of mandamus directing the court of appeals to vacate its conditional writ.judge gamble seeks to have his name placed back on the republican party primary election ballot for the district court.
ii.the arguments 
judge gamble concedes that his original application did not comply with section of the code because it misidentified the office he sought.however,he argues that he had the right to seek equitable relief in the trial court under section of the code to fix the alleged clerical mistake.judge gamble asserts that equitable relief was the only avenue for him to achieve the just and reasonable result the legislature intended when it enacted the code.see in re bell,wl orig.proceeding courts must construe the code according to the code construction act.
moreover,citing section a and e of the code,judge gamble contends that the party chair had a duty to review his application to determine whether it complied with the code and to notify him immediately if it did not.judge gamble argues that he established in the trial court that had the party chair followed her alleged statutory duty to review his application and notify him about its defect,he would have timely corrected the mistake.thus,judge gamble contends,the trial court tro was proper,and the court of appeals erred in determining he could not correct his application after the filing deadline.
in response,triantaphyllis argues that the court of appeals correctly concluded that the candidate bears the ultimate responsibility to ensure his application complies with the code.further,triantaphyllis contends that the court of appeals correctly determined that a candidate can not amend his application after the filing deadline.triantaphyllis reasons that the code mandates that an application contain specific information,including the office the candidate seeks,or the party chair must reject it as defective.see.c,d.
additionally,triantaphyllis points out that the petition is the only document,apart from the application,that could possibly be used to determine the office judge gamble sought.however,the code expressly prohibits using the petitions to correct an error in the application.c.
iii.applicable law 
the code mandates that a candidate application for a place on the ballot provide specific information.see.such information includes,among other things,the office sought,including any place number or other distinguishing number.c.the code imposes a mandatory duty on a candidate to file a correct application on or before january.see.a.if a candidate application does not comply with the code requirements,the party chair must omit the candidate name from the list submitted to the secretary of state.d.
the code specifies the party chair duties upon receiving an application for a place on the primary ballot.see.after a candidate files an application for a place on the ballot,the party chair shall review the application to determine whether it complies with the requirements as to form,content,and procedure that it must satisfy for the candidate name to be placed on the ballot.a.the party chair must review an application no later than the fifth day after the candidate files the application.b.but if a petition accompanies the application,the party chair shall complete the review as soon as practicable after the date the candidate files the application and petition.c.if the party chair determines an application complies with the code,this does not preclude a later determination that the application does not comply.d.moreover,if the application does not comply with the code requirements,the party chair shall reject the application and immediately deliver to the candidate written notice of the reason for the rejection.e.
texas courts have consistently held that the the party primarily responsible and accountable for properly completing and timely filing an application for a place on the ballot.brown walker,orig.proceeding in re gibson,orig.proceeding escobar sutherland,paso,orig.proceeding bejarano hunter,paso,orig.proceeding jones mather,dist,orig.proceeding jaime patlan,antonio,orig.proceeding leach fischer,worth,orig.proceeding.these courts acknowledge that,even if the party chair conduct misled the candidate or the party chair failed to fulfill certain ministerial duties,the candidate has the ultimate responsibility to ensure the application complies with the code.
moreover,the filing deadline is absolute,and no party official can alter it.painter shaner,orig.proceeding.if a candidate application does not comply with the code requirements,the party chair has no discretion but to reject the application and remove the candidate name from the candidate list.e,d escobar,at.under limited circumstances,the code provides a candidate means for relief if his efforts to obtain a place on the ballot are thwarted.specifically,the code provides that a person who is being harmed or is in danger of being harmed by a violation or threatened violation of the code is entitled to appropriate injunctive relief to prevent the violation from continuing or occurring.
this court recently stated that courts must construe the code in light of the code construction act guidance that the legislature intended a just and reasonable result when enacting statutes.see in re bell,at,wl at.courts must also consider the object sought to be attained.in re bell,at,wl at.
iv.analysis 
judge gamble concedes that he filed a defective application with the party chair on december.because the application listed the district court that application was not facially defective.the party chair reviewing the accompanying petition that listed the district court,another existing court,would have shown that the application and petition did not comply with the code.see.consequently,the code required the party chair to notify judge gamble about the defect and to remove judge gamble as a candidate on the ballot.e,d.the party chair did notify judge gamble and did exclude his name from the list.but the party chair then permitted judge gamble to correct his application after the filing deadline so his name could be placed back on the candidate list.
no code provision allows the party chair to accept an untimely amended application to correct a mistake on an application.rather,the code expressly requires that the party chair reject a defective application and omit the applicant name from the candidate list.e,d.judge gamble contends that the party chair properly accepted his amended application after the filing deadline,because the party chair did not timely notify him of the defect under section so he could correct the problem before the filing deadline.but judge gamble gives section more meaning than its plain,unambiguous language demonstrates.
subsections a,b,and c only require that the party chair review an five days or as soon as practicable if filed with a ensure it complies with the code requirements.a,b,c.if the application does not comply with the code,then subsection e requires the party chair to immediately notify the candidate about the reason for the rejection.e.
certainly,if the party chair notifies a candidate about an error before the filing deadline,the applicant may attempt to timely correct the application.see escobar,at.however,section does not,as judge gamble contends,enable the party chair to accept an amended application after the filing deadline.rather,the party chair duties under section are limited and purely ministerial.see escobar,at bejarano,at.the code requires a party chair to reject a defective application regardless of whether the party chair notices the defect before or after the filing deadline.see.e,d.thus,it remains the candidate responsibility to file a timely,correct application for a place on the ballot.see brown,at in re gibson,at escobar,at bejarano,at jones,at jaime,at leach,at.
judge gamble relies on section and the trial court tro to argue that the party chair properly accepted his amended application and placed his name on the candidate list.however,judge gamble misplaces his reliance on the tro for three reasons.first,the tro was based on judge gamble faulty allegation that the party chair had to review his application within five days from when judge gamble filed it.see.b.but because a petit
