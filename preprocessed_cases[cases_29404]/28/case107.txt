amy brought suit pursuant to against the democratic caucus of the pennsylvania house of representatives the caucus,state representative ted harhai,and scott brubaker,director of staffing and personnel for the caucus.alleged that she was discharged from her position as a legislative assistant to harhai in violation of her first and fourteenth amendment rights.the caucus filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the basis of common law legislative immunity.c.the caucus argued that it was entitled to absolute legislative immunity as was employed as a legislative assistant,and her firing was therefore necessarily within the sphere of legitimate legislative authority.tenney brandhove.
the district court denied the caucus rule c motion,holding that the caucus did not exercise a legislative function when it terminated.the caucus contends that application of a functional test,derived from the supreme court opinion in forrester white,d,was error.the caucus argues for an alter ego test that would look to the duties of the discharged employee,not to the nature of the personnel action taken.
we reject the caucus argument.we will apply forrester functional test to claims of absolute legislative immunity,and will affirm the district court decision that the caucus is not entitled to immunity in this case.the alter ego test lacks precedential support from the supreme court,from our own court,or from other courts of appeals.its adoption would open a circuit split.the alter ego approach is also a poorer reflection of the purposes of legislative immunity than the functional approach.though this is a question of first impression before this court,our own jurisprudence regarding municipal personnel actions strongly suggests that the caucus should not be shielded by legislative immunity.we will affirm the district court denial of the caucus rule c motion.
facts and procedural history 
ted harhai is an elected democratic representative in the pennsylvania house of representatives.john harhai,representative harhai brother,ran for a seat on the city council of monessen,pennsylvania in the democratic primary.john harhai lost by seven votes to jeffery gagatko,then filed a petition to recanvass in the court of common pleas of westmoreland county,pennsylvania.pursuant to pennsylvania law,the petition included affidavits from qualified electors alleging fraud or irregularities.each of these affidavits was notarized pursuant to state law.recanvassing yielded a nine vote victory for harhai.

ii.discussion 
the doctrine of legislative immunity flows from english common law and the many centuries of struggle between the english crown and parliament.see tenney brandhove.various english monarchs condemned parliamentarians to prison for proposing or supporting bills they found unhelpful.id.the glorious revolution ended this practice by codifying legislative immunity t hat the freedom of speech,and debates or proceedings in parliament not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of parliament in the english bill of rights of.id.
a century later,the framers included a similar clause in the articles of confederation,and then in article i,section of the united states constitution f or any speech or debate in either house the members shall not be questioned in any other place.const.art.i,cl.see tenney,at.the tenney court aptly summed up the purposes of the speech and debate clause,stating that legislators must be immune from deterrents to the uninhibited discharge of their legislative duty,not for their private indulgence but for the public good.at.
the speech and debate clause does not,by its terms,extend any protection to state legislators or officials.nevertheless,the tenney court extended legislative immunity to state legislators and officials as federal common law,extensively referencing the immunity deep common law origins.id.at.the supreme court has similarly extended common law legislative immunity to local legislative officials,see bogan,d extending legislative immunity to members of a city council,and to legitimately engaged in a legislative function.see supreme court of consumers union of the united states,d extending legislative immunity to virginia supreme court justices in promulgating a code of professional responsibility.
the supreme court has often stated that the purpose of common law legislative immunity is to reinforce the separation of powers and safeguard legislative independence.see,eastland servicemen fund,d united states brewster,d.legislative immunity may protect an official exercising a legislative function from inquiry into legislative acts or the motivation for actual performance of legislative acts,brewster,at,from the burden of defending certain suits,dombrowski eastland,d,and from the consequences of litigation results.id.
the supreme court rejected in brewster the view that the speech and debate clause protects all conduct related to the due functioning of the legislative process.brewster,at.the court stated that,w e would not think it sound or wise,simply out of an abundance of caution to doubly insure legislative independence,to extend the privilege beyond its intended scope,its literal language,and its history,to include all things in any way related to the legislative process.id.at.on the same day that it decided brewster,the court took a broad view in gravel united states of who could invoke legislative immunity,holding that a legislative aide could invoke immunity if a legislator could invoke the immunity under the same circumstances,d.as to what actions were protected by legislative immunity,the court took a narrow view,stating that the heart of the clause is speech or debate in either house,and that i nsofar as the clause is construed to reach other matters,they must be an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by which members participate in committee and house proceedings with respect to the consideration and passage or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect to other matters which the constitution places within the jurisdiction of either house.id.at.
this court has held that the federal common law immunity is coterminous with the federal constitutional legislative immunity,see larsen senate of the commonwealth of,cir,though the supreme court has expressed particular reluctance about extending a common law immunity.see forrester white,d describing the court absolute official immunity jurisprudence as quite sparing.
the pennsylvania constitution contains a speech and debate clause that tracks the federal clause,but it can not shield a legislator from a violation of federal law.see.const.art.ii.
a.the functional test is appropriate for legislative immunity 
the caucus contends that the district court erred in applying a functional approach,in which immunity hangs on whether an action serves the due functioning of the legislative process.united states brewster,d.the supreme court applied this functional approach to a personnel decision in forrester white,d.
the caucus,however,argues for an alter ego test for the application of legislative immunity.under this approach,the court should determine if the person fired,demoted,or otherwise affected by the legislator decision was so closely linked to the legislative process that any actions taken towards them were,in effect,legislative.
the caucus contends that the district court application of the forrester functional test was error for several reasons.the caucus contends that forrester concerned a personnel decision made by a judge and should not therefore be applied to legislative immunity,and that a circuit split exists on the question of which test is appropriate.we reject the first contention.the second is simply wrong.
forrester has been applied to legislative immunity by every court of appeals to consider the issue 
the caucus contends that the functional test laid out by the supreme court in forrester should be limited to judicial immunity,as forrester concerned a state judge claim of immunity after firing a probation officer.we reject this sharp limitation of forrester.the court opinion in forrester strongly suggests that it intended the functional test to be applied broadly.forrester white,d.every court of appeals to consider the issue has followed the court suggestion and applied the forrester test to legislative immunity.
in forrester,an illinois state judge demoted,then discharged,a female adult probation officer.id.at.the discharged officer alleged that she had been discriminated against because of her sex,in violation of the fourteenth amendment.id.the judge argued that this personnel action was protected by absolute judicial immunity.id.the forrester court unanimously rejected this claim.id.at.
the forrester court noted that d ifficulties have arisen primarily in attempting to draw the line between truly judicial acts,for which immunity is appropriate,and acts that simply happen to have been done by judges,and that h ere,as in other contexts,immunity is justified and defined by the functions it protects and serves,not by the person to whom it attaches.id.at.emphasis added citing many cases concerning legislators and executive officials.the court noted that r unning through our cases,with fair consistency,is a functional approach to immunity questions other than those that have been decided by express constitutional or statutory enactment.id.at.the court responded to the threat of vexatious lawsuits by former employees by pointing out that this factor in no way serves to distinguish judges from other public officials who hire and fire subordinates.id.at.the forrester court did not perceive its decision as announcing a new test,but rather restating and clarifying a functional approach that it had articulated in prior cases,many of which concerned legislative immunity.id.
the court most recently applied the functional approach to a claim of common law legislative immunity from a personnel action claim in bogan,at.absolute immunity for local legislators under finds support not only in history,but also in reason.the bogan court clarified that the functional inquiry is purely objective,holding that,w hether an act is legislative turns on the nature of the act,rather than on the motive or intent of the official performing it this leaves us with the question whether,stripped of all considerations of intent and motive,petitioners actions were legislative.id.at.the court unanimously held that the city officials who had eliminated plaintiff position by passage of a new budget had acted legislatively as acts of voting for an ordinance were,in form,quintessentially legislative.id.at.observing that introduction of a budget and signing into law an ordinance are formally legislative and integral steps in the legislative process.
we have applied forrester outside the context of judicial immunity.see schrob catterson,cir stating that the supreme court has outlined a functional approach to immunity issues,and applying forrester to prosecutorial immunity internal quotes omitted.other courts of appeals have uniformly adopted this view of forrester and expressly applied the case to legislative immunity.see kamplain curry county bd.of comm rs,cir in order to determine whether defendants should be cloaked in legislative immunity,we look to the function that the board members were performing when the actions at issue took place and we examine the nature of those actions.chateaubriand gaspard,cir to determine whether legislative immunity applies,courts look to the nature of the function performed,not the identity of the actor who performed it.alexander holden,cir under forrester white,the functions of the brunswick county commissioners determine whether their actions are legislative or administrative for purposes of immunity.hansen bennett,cir we look only to the function mayor bennett was performing when he ejected hansen.we apply this functional approach even when evaluating conduct that takes place within a meeting which includes some legislative business.gross winter,applying forrester to a firing by a washington,city council member.no court to have considered the issue has limited forrester in the manner the caucus proposes.
the caucus urges a radical limitation on the functional test that is unsupported by supreme court or lower court precedent.we reject this proposed narrowing of the forrester test.
the alter ego approach to legislative immunity has been rejected by every court of appeals to consider the issue 
the caucus repeatedly states that a circuit split exists as to whether the alter ego or functional test applies to legislative immunity for personnel actions.the caucus relies on two cases,agromayer colberg and browning house of representatives,of the first circuit and circuit,respectively,to support this proposition.see agromayer colberg,cir browning house of representatives.no such split exists.the court of appeals for the first circuit has repeatedly undermined or ignored agromayor and the court of appeals for the circuit recently repudiated browning in an en banc decision that unanimously rejected the alter ego approach.see fields office of eddie bernice johnson.
agromayor is no longer applied in the first circuit 
the first circuit held in agromayor that the politically motivated refusal to hire a member of the opposing political party as a legislative press officer was protected by common law legislative immunity.agromayor colberg,cir.the agromayor court held that an employee dealing with the deliberative and communicative processes must be of direct legislative importance.id.citing gravel united states,d internal quotes and citations omitted.the court stated that,in applying the immunity we decline to inquire deeply into the functions performed by a particular personal legislative aide,inasmuch as such an inquiry itself threatens to undermine the principles that absolute immunity was intended to protect.agromayor,at.the court held that personnel actions concerning employees with enough opportunity for meaningful input into the legislative process should be immunized.id.
the agromayor court relied on chief justice burger dissent in davis passman for this approach.id.at citing davis passman,d burger,dissenting.the davis court declined to reach the legislative immunity issue raised by a united states congressman who fired a female aide,allegedly on account of her sex.davis,at.however,justices burger,powell,and rehnquist wrote separately to argue that the court should have reached the issue and that it should have been decided in favor of immunity.id.at.the dissent stated that a 
member of congress has a right to expect that every person on his or her staff will give total loyalty to the political positions of the member,total confidentiality,and total support lead ing a member to employ a particular person on a racial,ethnic,religious,or gender basis thought to be acceptable to the constituency represented,even though in other branches of in the private selection factors might be prohibited.
id.chief justice burger concluded that concepts of separation of powers dictate,for me,that until congress legislates otherwise as to employment standards for its own staff,judicial power in this area is circumscribed.id.
the first circuit court of appeals began to move away from the agromayor approach even before forrester called the decision into question.a year after agromayor,the first circuit turned toward a more functional analysis in cutting muzzey,in which the court held that a town board imposition of outrageous conditions on a subdivision proposal was not protected by legislative immunity,st cir.the cutting court laid out a two part test for distinguishing between legislative and administrative activity.id.at.the court asked first whether the decision was based on legislative facts,generalizations or considerations of policy,and second,whether the decision had a legislative impact,extending prospectively and beyond one person or a small group.id.
the first circuit continued to apply this strain of functional analysis after forrester.the court stated in that,u nder current legal theory,immunity attaches or does not attach depending on what kind of action was performed rather than on who performed the action,referring to a decision to eliminate several civil service positions occupied by political opponents,cir.the court then explicitly applied the cutting legislative effects test to the firing of a legislative librarian,extensively referencing forrester in the process,cir the issue is thus whether defendants were acting in a legislative or administrative capacity when they discharged negron.the court reiterated its commitment to a functional test in a case concerning various personnel actions against civil service employees,stating that e mployment decisions generally are administrative except when they are accomplished through traditional legislative functions such as policymaking and budgetary restructuring that strike at the heart of the legislative process,cir internal quotes omitted.see also,cir acts that are administrative in nature do not give rise to absolute immunity from liability in damages under.quoting forrester,at.ass of social workers harwood,cir because immunity is defined by the functions it serves,even legislators themselves are not immune for actions taken in an administrative capacity.quoting forrester,at.
the first circuit has never explicitly overturned agromayor.it has,instead,abandoned altogether the alter ego approach to legislative immunity.
ii.the circuit unanimously rejected the alter ego approach in fields johnson 
the caucus relied on the circuit decision in browning house of representatives as a second case demonstrating a circuit split over which test should govern legislative immunity.see browning house of representatives.however,that court unanimously and explicitly overturned browning in its en banc decision in fields office of eddie bernice johnson,and unanimously applied forrester functional test to personnel actions.
the circuit held in browning that the standard for determining speech or debate clause immunity is best expressed as whether the employee duties were directly related to the due functioning of the legislative process.browning,at.the court concluded that the official reporter for the house was directly related to the legislative process and,therefore,his firing was shielded by absolute legislative immunity.id.
the fields decision reconsidered browning in light of forrester.see at.fields was the consolidated appeals of two congressional employees seeking redress for firings allegedly based on racial and disability discrimination.id.at.the discharged employees availed themselves of the congressional accountability act of,which,by its terms,does not displace speech and debate clause immunity.fields,at.the circuit noted that forrester cast doubt on browning.id.at.the court stated that its decision in gross winter had narrowed browning,as the court had found that forrester,not browning,controlled in a personnel action by a council member.id.see gross winter,observing that browning is unquestionably in tension with forrester,which accords no weight to the duties of the employee.the court noted with dismay that the tenth circuit decision in bastien had created a circuit split.fields,at.see bastien office of senator ben nighthorse campbell,cir.in explicitly rejecting the browning test,the bastien court held that speech and debate clause immunity protected a senator in a personnel action only when the plaintiff questioned the conduct of official senate legislative business.bastien,at.
the fields court stated that many personnel actions lack even some nexus to a protected legislative activity and that,f iring an aide for falsifying expense reports,or disciplining an assistant for harassing others in the office is not,by any conceivable interpretation,an act performed as a part of or even incidental to the role of a legislator.at quoting united states brewster,d.the majority opinion written by judge randolph overturned browning 
we now see that an employee duties are too crude a proxy for protected activity.our holding in browning presumes that a personnel decision with regard to an employee whose duties are directly related to the due functioning of the legislative process,is always an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes.but the presumption is,at a minimum,overinclusive and therefore inconsistent with the court practice of being careful not to extend the scope of the protection further than its purposes require.any number of reveal as much a legislative aide may be discharged because of budgetary cutbacks a staff member may be demoted solely for consistent tardiness a person seeking a staff position might be rejected for having a poor college transcript and so forth.that the person targeted by the personnel decision performs duties directly related to the legislative process,is not must be part of,not merely related to,the due functioning of the legislative process to be protected by the speech or debate clause.at best,that an employee duties are directly related to the legislative process establishes merely some nexus between the personnel decision and that process.we therefore reject browning test for determining when a legislator personnel decision is protected by the speech or debate clause.
id.at internal citations omitted.the court then rejected the argument that d irecting one alter is,legislative aides with duties directly related to the legislative is an integral part of the processes of achieving one legislative goals,because of the duties such employees perform.id.at internal quotes omitted.the court noted that t he speech or debate clause protects conduct that is integral to the legislative process,not a member legislative goals,and that many activities that are integral to legislative goals,such as sending newsletters or delivering speeches to constituents,are political,not legislative,and are therefore beyond the scope of legislative immunity.id.the court also noted that,a nother problem with the formulation lies in its assumption that a member only directs his alter egos with regard to constitutionally protected activities.id.the fields court emphasized gravel conclusion that simply because a senator performs certain duties in his official capacity does not make those duties legislative.id.citing gravel united states,d.the fields court held that,l egislative aides are no different.fields,at.
the fields court was splintered on some issues,but not,as judge tatel pointed out in his concurrence,on the issues discussed above.fields,at i take some solace from the fact that the commonalities of our opinions exceed their differences.tatel,concurring.the principal concurrence,authored by judge brown,focuses on who may invoke derivative legislative immunity,arguing that only alter ego s of the representative may do so.id.at brown,concurring.this line of debate is not germane to the instant case,as judg
