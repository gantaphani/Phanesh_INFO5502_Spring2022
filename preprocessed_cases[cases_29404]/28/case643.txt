this is an original proceeding in which the attorney general petitions this court for a declaratory judgment determining the validity of house joint resolution apportioning the legislature of the state of florida.we have jurisdiction under article iii,section c of the florida constitution,which provides 
judicial review of apportionment.within fifteen days after the passage of the joint resolution of apportionment,the attorney general shall petition the supreme court of the state for a declaratory judgment determining the validity of the apportionment.the supreme court,in accordance with its rules,shall permit adversary interests to present their views and,within thirty days from the filing of the petition,shall enter its judgment.
on march,the legislature passed house joint resolution,which apportions the florida senate and house of representatives based on the population figures established in the census.the attorney general filed this declaratory judgment petition on april,and this court invited all those interested to submit briefs and comments in support of or opposition to the plan and to participate in oral argument before the court.
we begin our analysis by addressing the scope of this court review in the instant proceeding.our review afforded under article iii,section c is extremely limited.in our first opinion examining the jurisdictional basis of article iii,section c,florida constitution,after its adoption,we observed 
at the outset,we emphasize that legislative reapportionment is primarily a matter for legislative consideration and determination.judicial relief becomes appropriate only when a legislature fails to reapportion according to federal and state constitutional requisites.if these requisites are met,we must refrain,at this time,from injecting our personal views into the proposed reapportionment plan.even though we may disagree with the legislative policy in certain areas,the fundamental doctrine of separation of powers and the constitutional provisions relating to reapportionment require that we act with judicial restraint so as not to usurp the primary responsibility for reapportionment,which rests with the legislature.
in re apportionment law senate joint resolution,regular session,so d.we explained that in this review we would only pass upon the facial validity of the plan and not upon any challenges.see id.at.the claims we could review included adherence to the,constitutional requirement,see id.at,and the state constitutional requirement that the districts contain contiguous,overlapping,or identical territory.see id.at.we made clear that we are without authority to declare a legislative apportionment plan invalid unless it violated some prohibition in the constitution.see id.at.importantly,we noted that the requirements under the florida constitution are not more stringent than the requirements under the united states constitution.see id.at.we adhered to the limited nature of our facial review in the case,see in re apportionment law appearing as senate joint resolution e,special apportionment session,so d and again in the case.see in re constitutionality of senate joint resolution,special apportionment session,so d.
we are aware that in,we performed a rights act review.see id.at.subsequent to that decision,however,the supreme court has continuously recognized that section voting rights act claims are generally claims.as discussed below,the confines of article iii,section c,adopted as part of the revision to florida constitution,do not allow for a review within our window.
also in contention in various comments and at oral argument is the presumptive validity of the joint resolution of apportionment and the amount of deference this court gives to the joint resolution of apportionment.the opponents generally argue that the legislature joint resolution of apportionment is not presumptively valid like a statute because the joint resolution is not subject to gubernatorial veto.our opinion addressed this issue.see in re apportionment law,so d at.to clarify this issue,consistent with the discussion in the case,we hold that the joint resolution of apportionment identified in article iii,section,florida constitution,upon passage is presumptively valid unless it can be shown that the joint resolution of apportionment facially violates some provision of the united states constitution or the florida constitution,this court may not declare the joint resolution invalid.see id.at.
turning to the merits of our review,we first address the constitutional validity of the plan under the equal protection standard of.see in re senate joint resolution,so d at.this court has held that the equal protection clause requires that state legislatures be apportioned in such a way that each person vote carries the same is,that each legislator represents the same number of voters.id.citing reynolds sims,d.we make this determination by analyzing the population figures in each district.
house joint resolution apportions the state into house districts and senate districts florida population is therefore,the ideal population per house district is.the most populous house district is district,with a total population of from the ideal population by persons,or.the least populous house district is district,with a total population of from the ideal population by persons,or.therefore,the maximum percentage deviation between the largest and smallest number of people per representative statistical overall range is.
the ideal population per senate district is.the most populous senate district is district,with a total population of from the ideal population by persons,or.the least populous senate district is district,with a total population of from the ideal population by persons,or.therefore,the maximum percentage deviation between the largest and smallest number of people per representative statistical overall range is.
even though the districts do not comply precisely with the ideal population per district,we have recognized that mathematical exactness is not a requirement in state apportionment plans.in re senate joint resolution,so d at citing reynolds,at.t he equal protection clause requires that a state make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts as nearly of equal population as is practicable.id.quoting reynolds,at.in white regester,d,the supreme court held that minor population deviations among state legislative districts do not substantially dilute the weight of individual votes in larger districts so as to deprive individuals in these districts of fair and effective representation.the supreme court subsequently held as a general matter an apportionment plan with a maximum population deviation under falls within the category of minor deviations.voinovich quilter,d quoting brown thomson,d see also connor finch,d 
common cause florida and the florida league of women voters argue that the advances in technology,namely the advent of the florida redistricting system freds used to develop the reapportionment plan,affords the legislature the opportunity to design districts each in exactly the same numerical size this notion,however,overlooks the fact that the supreme court has made it clear that the goal of achieving population equality among districts is not paramount 
we have recognized that some deviations from population equality may be necessary to permit states to pursue other legitimate objectives such as maintain ing the integrity of various political subdivisions and provid ing for compact districts of contiguous territory.as the court stated in gaffney cummings,d,a n unrealistic overemphasis on raw population figures,a mere nose count in the districts,may submerge these other considerations and itself furnish a ready tool for ignoring factors that in operation are important to an acceptable representation and apportionment arrangement.
brown thomson,d citation omitted some alterations in original moreover,as the supreme court stated,a ny standard,including absolute numerical equality,involves a certain artificiality e ven the census data are not perfect,and the restlessness of the american people means that population counts for particular localities are outdated long before they are completed.karcher daggett,d.
given that the statistical overall ranges for the house and senate districts,and respectively,each fall well under the deviation that the supreme court and this court have recognized as constitutionally valid,we find that the legislature has achieved a mathematical preciseness in the districts that complies with the equal protection requirements of both the florida and united states constitutions.see regester,at.upholding constitutionality of texas state reapportionment despite total deviation between largest and smallest districts of gaffney cummings,d holding that numerical deviations from population equality in a connecticut legislative apportionment plan failed to make out a prima facie violation of the equal protection clause where maximum population deviations for the house and senate were and,respectively even if the advent of redistricting software has lowered the maximum permissible deviation,we conclude that the relatively minor deviation before us in this case does not lead to the conclusion that either the house or senate plans are facially in violation of the,requirement.
the next issue for our resolution is the constitutional requirement that the legislative districts be either contiguous,overlapping or identical territory.art.iii,a.const.in in re senate joint resolution,we explained 
this court has defined contiguous as being in actual contact touching along a boundary or at a point.in re apportionment law,senate joint resolution e,so d,quoting webster new collegiate dictionary.a district lacks contiguity when a part is isolated from the rest by the territory of another district or when the lands mutually touch only at a common corner or right angle.id.
although a contiguous district has been defined as one in which a person can go from any point within the district to any other point without leaving the district,such definition does not impose a requirement of a paved,dry road connecting all parts of a district.contiguity does not require convenience and ease of travel,or travel by terrestrial rather than marine forms of transportation 
t he presence in a district of a body of water without a connecting bridge,even if it necessitates land travel outside the district in order to reach other parts of the district,does not violate this court standard for determining contiguity under the florida constitution.
so d at.additionally,there is no requirement that district lines follow precinct or county lines.see in re apportionment law,so d at.
the attorney general concedes that the proposed districts satisfy the geographic requirements of the florida constitution.in contrast,common cause florida and the florida league of women voters assert that newly created senate district is not contiguous.our review of senate district,however,reveals that the district conforms with the state constitutional contiguity requirement.lee county argues that senate district,which connects a population center in lee county with a population center in palm beach county,is not contiguous because it crosses the waters of lake okeechobee without connecting territory on either the lake northern or southern shores.while establishing a district across a body of water as large as lake okeechobee stretches to the limits our language that a district drawn across a body of water does not violate the contiguity requirement,see in re senate joint resolution,so d at,we conclude that senate district is permissible under the state constitutional contiguity requirement.we have reviewed the remaining senate and house districts and find that they also satisfy this constitutional requirement.
next,several parties allege that house joint resolution discriminates against racial or language minorities.in making these claims,the parties rely on both the equal protection clause and section of the voting rights act in previous redistricting opinions,we have attempted to address such claims.see in re senate joint resolution,so d at in re senate joint resolution e,so d at.in fact,in,we specifically rejected the argument that g iven the complex evidentiary standard imposed on those who challenge a redistricting plan under the voting rights act,this court can not possibly consider such a claim at this time.in re senate joint resolution,so d at however,with the advancement of redistricting technology,the continued development of case law in this area,and the unique circumstances presented in the instant case,we determine that we are not in a position to properly address such issues in the present proceeding,especially in light of the constitutional time limitations placed on the court.see art.iii,c.const such claims are better suited for a court of competent jurisdiction where there is an opportunity to present evidence and witness testimony and where the court has the ability to make factual findings based on the evidence presented therefore,we decline to rule on these claims in this proceeding.
several parties raise claims that house joint resolution constitutes partisan gerrymandering.the supreme court has recognized that political gerrymandering claims are justiciable under the equal protection clause.see davis bandemer,d.while a majority of the supreme court did not agree as to the standards that would govern such a claim,a plurality of the court concurred in part iii of the bandemer opinion,which set forth the standard for assessing a claim of political gerrymandering.see id.at.four justices concurring in part iii 
under the bandemer test,a plaintiff raising a political gerrymandering claim must establish that there was intentional discrimination against an identifiable political group and an actual discriminatory effect on that group.see id.at.the plurality opinion candidly recognized that the first determination of intentional discrimination against an identifiable political group would not be difficult to show in most instances because a s long as redistricting is done by a legislature,it should not be very difficult to prove that the likely political consequences of the reapportionment were intended.id.at.
in order to establish that there has been an actual discriminatory effect,the plaintiff must show that the identifiable group has been,or is projected to be,disadvantaged at the polls and by being disadvantaged at the polls,the identifiable group will lack political power and be denied fair representation.see id.at.as the bandemer plurality explained,the mere fact that a particular apportionment scheme makes it more difficult for a particular group in a particular district to elect the representatives of its choice does not render that scheme constitutionally infirm.id.at.this conclusion is premised on the assumption that the power to influence the political process is not limited to winning elections because the elected candidate will still be responsive to the voters in his or her district.id.at.w ithout specific supporting evidence,a court can not presume that those who are elected will disregard the disproportionately underrepresented group.id.the discriminatory effect of political gerrymandering would only be found when the electoral system is arranged in a manner that will consistently degrade a voter or a group of voters influence on the political process as a whole.id.as the plurality opinion explained,the plaintiff must establish that the discriminated against group has essentially been shut out of the political process.id.at.
in order to mount a successful political gerrymandering claim against house joint resolution,a plaintiff would have to establish a factual basis for the claim of actual discriminatory effect.similar to our discussion of the voting rights act above,this claim is better suited for a court of competent jurisdiction where there is an opportunity to present evidence and witness testimony and where the court has the ability to make factual findings based on the evidence presented.supra at.further,the legislature and other proponents of the redistricting plan must be afforded an opportunity to respond to any evidence of discriminatory effect.the present proceeding before this court is not the proper forum to address such a claim.
several parties also claim that house joint resolution should be declared invalid because the legislature ignored traditional principles of redistricting such as compactness and preservation of communities of interest.however,neither the united states nor the florida constitution requires that the florida legislature apportion legislative districts in a compact manner or that the legislature preserve communities of interest.see,shaw reno,d t raditional districting principles such as compactness and respect for political subdivisions are important not because they are constitutionally are not art.iii,a.const.therefore,we find no merit to this claim.
mayor raul martinez,bishop victor curry,and the southwest voter registration and education project argue that the newly created senate districts are invalid because the legislature changed the numbering of the newly created senate districts from the existing senate districts in order to circumvent the constitutional legislative term limit provisions.see art.vi,b.const.we conclude that the theoretical possibility that some current senators may be able to serve ten years in the florida senate is not a sufficiently important dependent matter arising under article iii,section,florida constitution,that we should address it at this time.see in re senate joint resolution e,so d at.
finally,several parties have questioned the legislature decision not to articulate objective standards that guided its redistricting process.in fact,the attorney general,marion county,and other individuals who have filed comments have requested this court to invalidate house joint resolution and return it to the legislature to allow the legislature to determine objective standards that would then guide its subsequent reapportionment common cause florida and the florida league of women voters have offered four objective standards for the legislature to adopt all districts should have equal population as closely as possible be drawn to be compact and contiguous and respect local political boundaries not dilute the voting strength of any racial,ethnic,or minority group and be drawn neutrally without regard to the incumbent or political party.
the only standards that the legislature is constitutionally required to follow in redistricting are the equal protection standard of,the florida constitutional requirement that legislative districts be either contiguous,overlapping,or identical territory,and the requirement not to discriminate against any racial or language minority or political group.see bandemer,at.in re senate joint resolution,so d at.while the other standards advocated by the opponents have been traditional considerations in the redistricting process,they are not constitutionally required.see shaw reno,at.gaffney cummings,at.hence,we decline the attorney general and other parties requests to return the plan to the legislature to create standards.as explained above,for those standards that can be fully addressed in this opinion,we conclude that the legislature has complied with the requirements set forth by the federal and state constitutions.
accordingly,we conclude that house joint resolution is valid and hereby approve it as the apportionment of the florida legislature.we acknowledge that any interested person should have the opportunity to attempt to raise a equal protection claim,a section claim,or a political gerrymandering claim in a court of competent jurisdiction.therefore,our holding is without prejudice to the right of any protestor to file an challenge to the validity of the plan for these reasons.should such an challenge be filed,issues of standing should be resolved by that court,and our opinion should not be read as conferring standing upon any party involved in this case.no motion for rehearing will be entertained.
it is so ordered.
while i concur with the majority opinion in all respects,based upon the comments,petitions,and responses filed here,i believe it necessary to elaborate upon two issues that may call for further discussion.i write separately to further explore the scope of this court review in this action,and to specifically address concerns with regard to the constitutional contiguity requirement as it may apply here,especially to districts such as senate district.
in considering the extreme structural time limitation imposed,i must initially note that searching the archives for meaningful historical information to assist the analysis has been most troublesome.although some information is available,there are certainly substantial issues concerning the quality and content of that which has been preserved to assist the deliberations of this institution as it fulfills its constitutional responsibilities.after reviewing all available historical material in the limited time period afforded by the structural components of the process outlined in the constitution,see art.iii,c.const.allowing this court thirty days from the filing of the attorney general petition to enter judgment,it is clear that many floridians simply perceive the extent of this court responsibility and authority quite differently.this is also reflected in the earliest redistricting decision of this court in,which was resolved only by a four justice majority with three dissenting opinions.see in re apportionment law appearing as senate joint resolution,so d.the concerns voiced here,with regard to the various issues advanced,have been well and intellectually articulated by both proponents and opponents of the proposed plan.the course which florida has followed,however,has steadfastly followed the constitutional structural time limitations even as the scope and nature of redistricting challenges have expanded in depth and complexity.
first,a review of the historical context surrounding the drafting and eventual adoption of the reapportionment provisions contained in the constitution reveals important principles that do much to explain and guide the scope of the court review in this action.the historical basis was only very briefly discussed by this court in.see generally in re apportionment law appearing as senate joint resolution,so d.in,the florida legislature apportionment plan was challenged in federal court based upon charges of severe inequities in representative proportionality.thereafter,on june,the united states supreme court reversed the judgment of a federal district court panel upholding the redistricting template,and directed the district court to reconsider the case in light of the court opinion in reynolds sims,d.see swann adams,d.the florida legislature subsequently reapportioned the state legislative districts.when this plan was also challenged in federal district court,the court held that the new plan failed to meet the requirements of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution,but,notwithstanding such infirmity,approved the plan on an interim basis.on appeal,however,the united states supreme court reversed,finding no basis for perpetuating what all concede to be an unconstitutional apportionment for another three years.swann adams,d.
in,the legislature adopted still another reapportionment plan,which was,again,promptly attacked in the federal district court.the united states supreme court also invalidated this plan,reasoning that it unconstitutionally contained population deviations in excess of thirty percent among senate districts and forty percent among house districts,and observing that the legislature had not offered any justification for the deviations.see swann adams,d.on remand,the district court finally assumed full responsibility for the process,and proceeded to redistrict florida itself.see swann adams.
concurrent with this highly publicized litigation,florida statutory constitution revision commission undertook the task of significantly rewriting our state constitution.a comprehensive study of the available correspondence,reports of hearings,and records of proceedings of both the commission and the legislature reveals the motivations and goals of these bodies in crafting what is today article iii,section,and somewhat explains the structural time limitations.first,it is absolutely clear that the commission was attempting to remove litigation regarding proportional representation from the federal courts system.as stated by commission member and a principal drafter john mathews,in response to questions by robert ervin,another member of the commission 
ervin do you feel that that handiwork of yours will solve the problem of actual accomplishment of apportionment in the state of florida 
mathews not being a prophet or son of a prophet,all i can do is have faith and hope that it will.i hope that we get to the situation where we never have to go to court ordered apportionment again.i do know.but if we continue,then i want our own state court to do it,rather than a federal district court.
ervin let me ask you why you offered the plan 
mathews so that if we get into the mess of having to have judicial apportionment,that those of us who believe so firmly in states rights will have the opportunity to have your state court take the first crack at it.
constitution revision commission,convention proceedings,available at.dep t of state,bureau of archives records management.state archives,series,carton,tallahassee.obviously,a primary impetus for the enactment of that which became article iii,section of the florida constitution was the desire to remove the bulk of redistricting litigation from the federal courts and place it directly in the state court system.
the second historical aspect surrounding the enactment of the constitution reflected in the limited available material relates to the drafters views of the scope of this court review in actions such as that before us today.my examination of the commission archival documents reveals that the only matter beyond the consecutive numbering and territorial requirements enunciated in section a of article iii that the drafters truly anticipated and structured the organic parameters for this court to resolve in its review was the one person,one vote principle required by the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.the foundation of a structure sufficient to explore the depth and complexity of the issues implicated today simply was not discussed or designed into the ultimate constitutional provision which now mandates such a severe structural time limitation for a determination by this institution.
this is only logical,because,as discussed above,the constitution was drafted in the era in which three successive reapportionment plans had been invalidated by federal courts on equal protection grounds.the majority of the debates regarding article iii,section,before the commission and legislature were centered upon how to structurally address the constitutionally mandated apportionment of legislators among explosively growing metropolitan areas.it is clear,therefore,that the drafters may not have fully anticipated,nor did they have fully presented essential information necessary to predict,that challenges to legislative redistricting plans would allege wrongs of such depth and complexity as to present a breadth of landscape far beyond the prior confrontations which were somewhat limited in scope with regard to proportional representation,as we see it today.
when discussing this court role in the redistricting process at a july public hearing,chesterfield smith,the chairman of the constitution revision commission,made the following statement 
i have become convinced that there should be no formula except that the only formula there should be a very general one,of one man,one vote.
the supreme court of the united states has,i think,properly refused to delineate the boundaries,and yet we have found the solutions,and this is what this does and it puts it over into the florida supreme court to review,as you suggest,if the legislature does do it 
finally,if the review does accomplish what it is supposed to do,it is put in the outside agency which again happens to be the supreme court to actually do it,but within the equal protection of the law formula,if not otherwise,i feel that when you start pouring down formulas into the concrete we may be drifting away from these broad general principles which you and i believe are so important in most areas and getting too specific,if we get into formulas beyond the sole words equal protection of the law,which the supreme court says means one man and one vote.
constitution revision commission,public hearings july,available at.state archives,series,carton,tallahassee.similarly,representative john ware made the following request at a public hearing on the revisions i urge you to make the constitution flexible enough so that we do require any specific form of apportionment other than equal representation for all of the people.constitution revision commission,legislative committee july,available at.dep t of state,bureau of archives records management.state archives,series,carton,tallahassee.finally,during the commission deliberations regarding article iii,john mathews,and davis,had the following exchange 
davis senator mathews,is it true under the present draft regarding the apportionment problem that the question of districting is left entirely to the discretion of the legislature 
mathews no,sir.it is left to the discretion of the legislature subject to the judgment of the supreme court of florida,first,and the overriding opinion of the supreme court of the united states as to whether you have to have districting in order to accomplish equitable apportionment.
constitution revision commission,convention proceedings.clearly,these comments reveal the thoughts of those who actually performed the drafting of our state organic law.it may be observed that the drafters designed the structural time limitation to have this court review encompass the direct equal protection principle of one person,one vote,without an expansive,complex,and proceeding,along with consideration of the explicit constitutional requirements of district territorial shape and numbering.
clearly,the structure for redistricting plan review contained in article iii,section of the florida constitution is a direct consequence of the drafters prior litigation experience and expectations regarding the nature of probable challenges to redistricting plans in the future.because this court was expected to review the more limited type of one person,one vote,territorial shape,and numbering issues,a judgment could reasonably be expected within thirty days from the filing of the attorney general petition.art.iii,c.const.based upon the knowledge and expectations of the drafters,there would be no need for this court to engage in the acceptance and adversarial testing of evidence,fact finding,or any other significant factual examinations of reapportionment plans.
in truth,this court is not designed,nor is it structured,to engage in these types of activities.this court would first examine the numbering and shapes of districts.then,in accordance with federal law mandating proportional representation,we would review any asserted disparities between legislative districts,and render a judgment as to the plan facial validity.these are the underlying principles which have consistently directed the redistricting decisions of this court in the past in,and.see generally in re apportionment law appearing as senate joint resolution,so d in re apportionment law appearing as senate joint resolution,so d in re constitutionality of senate joint resolution,so d.
the issue today,therefore,is how this court should address the collision of the framework of limited review enacted by the drafters of the constitution,and the factual depth and complexity of the challenges brought by the opponents of the reapportionment plan.certainly,the opponents claims are based upon allegations of extraordinarily involved,wrongs effected by the legislature in drawing the proposed legislative districts.to be sure,advancing technology has also driven the process.this court,however,is constrained by the limitations and parameters of article iii,section c.due to the time restrictions and structural limitations imposed by the florida constitution,and a
