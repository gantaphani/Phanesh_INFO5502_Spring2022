daniel lewis lewis appeals the district court order denying sanctions against the three attorneys who represented his political rival,james peer peer.although lewis filed numerous motions for sanctions during the pendency of this case,he only appeals the disposition of two of these motions his july,motion for sanctions against peer original counsel,richard rosenbaum rosenbaum,pursuant to rule,and the court inherent power and his october,motion for sanctions against barry roderman roderman and scott greenbaum greenbaum pursuant to rule.
on appeal,lewis argues that rosenbaum conduct is sanctionable because he knowingly filed a baseless fair credit reporting act fcra claim in federal court.similarly,lewis contends roderman and greenbaum violated rule by representing peer in his meritless federal suit.rosenbaum claims that he had a reasonable basis to file suit because there was suspicious access which showed on peer credit report,lewis filed his state court complaint with,which mentioned peer credit report,and lewis refused to disclose the source of his information in interviews with the miami herald and the digest newspapers.roderman and greenbaum did not respond to lewis appeal or appear at oral arguments.for the reasons stated below,this court will affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
this case arises from yet another contentious florida election.initially,jim naugle,the incumbent mayor,and lewis were the only candidates in the city of fort lauderdale mayoral race,which,according to lewis,increased lewis chance of success in the election.peer entered the mayoral race on january.lewis sought to have peer disqualified because lewis felt a three way race would benefit the incumbent mayor 
lewis state court complaint 
on january,lewis filed a state court claim challenging peer fort lauderdale residency and seeking to have peer disqualified as a candidate.in paragraph of his state court complaint,lewis stated,what is more,an october,credit report by transunion,one of the three major credit bureaus,reported that defendant peer current address is charter drive,wilmington,north carolina.
on february,the state court held a hearing on lewis complaint and dismissed the complaint for ineffective service of process.at this time,lewis was represented by robert malove,and peer was represented by rosenbaum.after the state court hearing,there was a heated discussion in the hallway of the courthouse,and malove and his law clerk told rosenbaum and peer that of lewis complaint was inaccurate because peer address was obtained from a westlaw people finder report,and not peer credit report later that same day,malove amended lewis state court complaint to delete reference to any credit report and served the amended complaint on peer.sometime on february or february,peer met with rosenbaum to discuss lewis amended state court complaint and determine whether to bring a claim under the fair credit reporting act.videotaped dep.of christopher peer,docket,ex,at.on february,peer obtained a copy of his credit report and faxed this report to rosenbaum.peer credit report showed that lewis never accessed it.id.at.
peer fcra claim in federal court 
the next day,february,peer,with rosenbaum acting as his attorney,filed suit against lewis in federal court for a violation of the fair credit reporting act.rosenbaum prepared and filed peer complaint based on of lewis state court complaint and suspicious activity on peer credit report.lewis counterclaimed for abuse of process.
between february and june,rosenbaum conducted very little discovery.on june,lewis retained counsel to represent him in this federal suit.six days later,rosenbaum withdrew from his representation of peer for medical reasons and a breakdown in the relationship.peer then retained roderman and greenbaum as substitute counsel in,and peer was deposed on july.immediately prior to the start of peer deposition,roderman gave lewis counsel a copy of peer february,credit report.in his deposition,peer testified that he knew before he filed his federal complaint that lewis had amended his state court complaint to delete reference to a transunion credit report.
on august,lewis moved for summary judgment on peer complaint,arguing that peer claim lacked any evidentiary support.peer responded to this motion on september.that same day,lewis counsel complied with rule c safe harbor provision by notifying roderman and greenbaum that lewis would file a rule motion for sanctions unless they withdrew the response.on october,lewis filed his motion for rule sanctions.roderman sought leave to withdraw as counsel on october,and his motion was granted on october.greenbaum did not withdraw,and after failing to respond to numerous court orders,was sanctioned for reasons other than pursuing a frivolous case.
on june,the district court struck peer complaint and answer to lewis abuse of process counterclaim as a sanction for greenbaum disregard for the court orders.thirteen days later,on july,lewis moved for sanctions against rosenbaum pursuant to rule,and the court inherent power.
on october,the district court commenced a four day jury trial on the issue of damages for lewis abuse of process counterclaim.the jury returned a special verdict against peer in the amount of in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.jury verdict,docket.peer moved to renew his motions for a directed verdict pertaining to compensatory and punitive damages,and legal fees.peer also moved for a new trial or judgment as a matter of law.
on may,the district court denied peer motion for a new trial or judgment as a matter of law,and denied peer renewed motion for a directed verdict pertaining to legal fees.additionally,the district court granted in part and denied in part peer motions for a directed verdict regarding compensatory and punitive damages.omnibus order on rule and,docket.the district court reduced the jury award of compensatory damages to and the award of punitive damages to.lewis appealed the reduction,and this court affirmed the district court order.see peer lewis.lexis cir.
while the appeal was pending,the district court addressed the collateral matters of lewis october,and july,motions for sanctions against rosenbaum,roderman,and greenbaum.the district court denied lewis motions for sanctions on january,holding that rosenbaum had a good faith basis to file the complaint,and rosenbaum did not act in bad faith.the district court did not address the merits of lewis rule motion against greenbaum and roderman.lewis now appeals the district court denial of these motions.
ii.standard of review 
a court decision to deny sanctions under rule,and the court inherent power is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see,cordoba dillard,cir baker alderman,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard,follows improper procedures in making the determination,or bases the decision upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.cordoba,at citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
the purpose of rule is to deter baseless filings in district court and thus streamline the administration and procedure of federal courts.james moore et,moore federal practice ed citing cooter gell hartmarx.when an attorney files a pleading in federal court,the attorney signs the pleading to certify that,among other things,the pleading is not being presented for an improper purpose the legal contentions are warranted by existing law or a nonfrivolous argument to change existing law and the factual contentions have evidentiary support or will likely have evidentiary support after discovery.b.
in assessing the propriety of rule sanctions,this court asks whether the party claims are objectively frivolous,and whether the person who signed the pleadings should have been aware that they were frivolous.byrne nezhat,cir citing baker alderman,cir.the advisory committee notes on the amendments to rule aid the court in interpreting and applying this rule.for example,the advisory committee note of states that rule was amended to emphasize the duty of candor by subjecting litigants to potential sanctions for insisting upon a position after it is no longer tenable.advisory committee note of.the commentary specifically notes that if evidentiary support is not obtained after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery,the party has a duty under the rule not to persist with that contention.id.finally,t he court is expected to avoid using the wisdom of hindsight and should test the signer conduct by inquiring what was reasonable to believe at the time the pleading,motion,or other paper was submitted.advisory committee note of see also jones int l riding helmets,cir stating that the prohibition against using hindsight to determine whether a pleading had a reasonable basis when filed is intended to protect parties who file pleadings which appear when filed,but which discovery or subsequent investigation reveals to be meritless.
rosenbaum conduct 
at the time rosenbaum filed peer complaint in federal court on february,rosenbaum knew the following facts on february,lewis counsel told rosenbaum that in the state court complaint was inaccurate because peer address was obtained from a westlaw people finder report,and not peer credit report on february,lewis amended his state court complaint to delete reference to any credit report and served peer with this amended complaint on february,peer obtained a copy of his credit report and faxed this report to rosenbaum peer credit report showed that lewis never accessed it and peer,the client,testified that on february or february,he met with rosenbaum to discuss lewis amended state court complaint and whether to bring an fcra claim in federal court.peer claim against lewis was filed by rosenbaum on february.
when an attorney signs and files a pleading,the attorney is certifying that every requirement in rule b is satisfied a violation of any one of these requirements is sufficient to support a motion for sanctions.b c.based upon a review of the entire record and the parties submissions related to the rule motion for sanctions,the district court found that 
at the time the complaint was filed counsel had some good faith basis to believe that the claim was not objectively frivolous.although his claim was based on a misunderstanding of fact and had little chance of success from the outset,plaintiff counsel advanced a tenable or plausible legal position,based on his client belief,that was not completely and utterly baseless.
omnibus order on pending fee,docket,at.
this finding was clearly erroneous.the five facts cited above are all of the facts in the record relating to rosenbaum entry into this case.rosenbaum knew lewis amended his state court complaint to delete reference to a transunion credit report before rosenbaum filed peer suit in federal court.moreover,neither the miami herald nor the digest newspaper article relied upon by rosenbaum to justify his filing the fcra claim states that lewis obtained peer credit report,states that lewis was concealing the identity of an individual who did obtain the report,or was published before peer filed his complaint in federal court.def.notice of filing exs.in supp.of def.mot.for sanctions,docket,exs.finally,rosenbaum claim of suspicious activity on peer credit report was unsubstantiated speculation.
peer fcra claim was thus objectively frivolous at the time of filing because there were no facts to support peer contention that lewis accessed his credit report,nor was there any chance that discovery would uncover evidentiary support where rosenbaum already possessed peer credit report.furthermore,these same facts show not only that rosenbaum should have been aware that peer claim was frivolous,but that rosenbaum was aware that peer claim was frivolous.
rule,however,does not permit the imposition of sanctions against rosenbaum because lewis motion was untimely.proceedings under rule can be initiated either by motion of a party or sua sponte by the court.here,lewis july,rule motion asked the district court to impose sanctions against rosenbaum on the court own initiative.by definition,a court responding to a motion is not acting sua sponte.therefore,the court will analyze lewis motion as a motion for sanctions under rule c.
the advisory committee note on the amendments to rule states that o rdinarily the motion should be served promptly after the inappropriate paper is filed,and,if delayed too long,may be viewed as untimely given the safe harbor provisions in rule c,a party can not delay serving its rule motion until conclusion of the case or judicial rejection of the offending contention.advisory committee note of.the rationale for this rule is simple if the court disposes of the offending contention within the period after service,it becomes impossible under the provision of rule c to file the motion or otherwise present it to the court.james moore et,moore federal practice c ed.
here,although lewis knew the claim was frivolous from the outset,lewis finally had convincing proof that rosenbaum knowingly filed a frivolous claim when peer produced his credit report at his deposition on july.at this point,lewis had all the pertinent information and should have moved for sanctions.but lewis did not do this.instead,lewis filed a timely rule motion for sanctions against roderman and greenbaum on october,and then waited nine months to file a motion for sanctions against rosenbaum.
lewis filed his motion for sanctions against rosenbaum on july,thirteen days after the district court struck peer complaint as a sanction for greenbaum and peer misconduct.lewis motion for rule sanctions was thus untimely because the district court had already rejected the offensive pleading at the time lewis moved for sanctions.therefore,the court must affirm the judgment of the district court regarding rosenbaum conduct under rule.see fed.citing collier stanbrough,how.stating that if the judgment of the lower court is proper for the reasons given by the court below,or on other grounds manifestly appearing of record it is our duty to affirm it.
greenbaum and roderman conduct 
in its opinion,the district court failed to address lewis rule motion for sanctions against greenbaum and roderman.because the abuse of discretion standard is designed to provide deference to the decisions of a district court,the court will remand this issue to the district court for consideration in the first instance.see macklin singletary,cir stating that b ecause our scope of review is narrower and a district court range of choice broader under the abuse of discretion standard,we should be more reluctant to address in the first instance issues to which that standard of review applies.see also mckusick city of melbourne,cir same.
lewis also appeals the district court denial of sanctions under section is directed at the unreasonable and vexatious multiplication of proceedings.unlike rule,which is aimed primarily at pleadings,under section attorneys are obligated to avoid dilatory tactics throughout the entire litigation.byrne nezhat,cir see also lasalle bank first.holding group,llc,cir stating that sanctions under are intended to deter an attorney from intentionally and unnecessarily delaying judicial proceedings emphasis in original.
to justify an award of sanctions pursuant to section,an attorney must engage in unreasonable and vexatious conduct this conduct must multiply the proceedings and the amount of the sanction can not exceed the costs occasioned by the objectionable conduct.schwartz millon air,cir.an attorney multiplies the proceedings unreasonably and vexatiously only when the attorney conduct is so egregious that it is tantamount to bad faith.amlong amlong,denny,cir citation omitted.bad faith is an objective standard that is satisfied when an attorney knowingly or recklessly pursues a frivolous claim.id.at.
as discussed above,rosenbaum knew that peer claim was frivolous before the complaint was filed in federal court.rosenbaum thus acted in bad faith.see amlong,at.however,sanctions are not appropriate under section because rosenbaum did not delay the judicial proceedings after he filed the complaint.here,rosenbaum filed a complaint,an answer to lewis countercl
