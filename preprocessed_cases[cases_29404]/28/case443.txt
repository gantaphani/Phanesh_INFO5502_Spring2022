during the presidential campaign,the larouche committee received in federal matching funds.the committee spent the bulk of these funds for advertising and services by seven vendors that larouche and several of his political associates created in the to provide and distribute material advocating larouche political,philosophical,and scientific views larouche was the vendors sole client.some of these vendors had provided services to larouche,and presidential campaigns.
there were three components to the larouche committee payments to the vendors during the campaign an amount resulting from an activity ratio applied to baseline costs fixed monthly fees ranging from to and a to the activity ratio amount the first two components are not at issue here.the payments are.

on march,the fec issued its repayment determination and ordered the larouche committee to repay.the figure consisted of a of public funds used by the larouche committee for payments that were not qualified campaign expenses and b in matching funds received in excess of larouche entitlement both components of the repayment result from the fec determination that the vendor were not qualified campaign expenses.
the fec set forth six factors that influenced its determination the larouche committee did not provide any verifiable basis for the charges it used many of the indirect costs cited by the committee to justify the would appear to have already been captured by the activity ratio the probability of default was low given the committee history with the vendors,a factor that would refute the need for a charge the committee failure to provide records to explain and support its general categorical descriptions of unidentified and hidden vendor costs the committee failure to produce any document by which the fec can either quantify the charges or determine the reasonableness of charges proffered and the committee inability to justify the original,frontloaded,and structure.
the committee petitioned the fec to reconsider its order on two grounds.first,it contested the fec calculation of the amount of the repayment.the fec granted rehearing on this issue and affirmed its order that the committee repay.second,the committee sought an adjustment of the repayment amount based on repayments requested from its vendors in the wake of the fec order.the fec denied reconsideration of this issue.the committee petitions this court for review of the fec repayment order and the denial of the motion for reconsideration.we deny the petition for review with respect to the repayment order and dismiss,for lack of jurisdiction,the challenge to the fec denial of the motion for reconsideration.
