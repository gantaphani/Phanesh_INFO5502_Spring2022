this appeal involves a challenge to the ward redistricting amendment act of the ward redistricting act or the act,which redrew the boundaries of the district of columbia eight electoral wards following the census.see supp.shortly before the new ward boundaries took effect,appellants kingman park civic association kpca and chevy chase civic association ccca brought suit in the district court against mayor anthony williams the mayor in his official capacity and the members of the council the council in their official capacities,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.appellants claimed that the act dilutes voting strength in ward six and citywide in violation of of the voting rights act of voting rights act,and violates various provisions of law governing ward redistricting.
the mayor and the council moved separately to dismiss,or in the alternative,for summary judgment.the district court first dismissed the complaint against the council,holding that they are entitled to legislative immunity from suit in connection with their legitimate legislative activity in drafting and adopting the act.the court then dismissed the voting rights act counts of the complaint against the mayor for failure to state a claim,and dismissed the pendent law claims pursuant to.appellants challenge these rulings on appeal,renewing their voting rights act and law claims solely as to wards three and six and alleging,for the first time,that the act racially gerrymanders ward boundaries in violation of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.
we affirm the judgment of the district court.we do so,however,on different grounds than those relied on by the district court.we hold that,although it was error for the district court to dismiss the voting rights act counts of the complaint for failure to state a claim,the mayor is nonetheless entitled to summary judgment on those counts on the record before us.appellants have made no showing that minority voters in the relevant wards are politically cohesive or that the wards are characterized by racially polarized voting.they therefore fail to establish a triable issue as to at least two of the three conditions essential to a prima facie case of vote dilution under.we decline to reach appellants fourteenth and fifteenth amendment claims,which were not raised before the district court and were therefore waived.having resolved the federal claims in the mayor favor,we affirm the district court dismissal of the pendent law claims against him.finally,we dismiss appellants claims against the council for lack of a substantial federal question.it is undisputed that appellants federal claims against the mayor and the council are identical.the merits of these claims having been resolved dispositively against appellants,there remains no federal question requiring decision.we therefore dismiss the suit against the council without addressing their assertion of legislative immunity.
background 
the district of columbia is governed in part by a popularly elected mayor and a popularly elected council,the latter being composed of five members elected at large and eight members elected from wards.see et,et.law requires that the council,by act after public hearing,adjust the boundaries of the city eight electoral wards as necessary following each decennial census.a,b.the resulting wards must be compact,contiguous,and approximately equal in population,and must conform to the greatest extent possible to census tract boundaries.see c,e.the population of each ward must be within five percent of the mean ward population,unless the deviation results from the limitations of census geography or from promotion of a rational public policy,including but not limited to respect for the political geography of the district,the natural geography of the district,neighborhood cohesiveness,or the development of compact and contiguous districts.f.law prohibits the adoption of any redistricting plan or amendment to a redistricting plan with the purpose and effect of diluting the voting strength of minority citizens.g.
the census results revealed a marked disproportion in the population of the district eight electoral wards,attributable to population growth in the western wards wards one,two,and three and a corresponding decline in the population of the eastern wards wards four,five,six,seven,and eight.see compl.for declaratory ex.map based on census bureau data showing population changes from to see also district of columbia population by single race and hispanic origin by prepared by the office of data center from census bureau data hereinafter ward population by race,reprinted in joint appendix c first am.
in june of,the council adopted and the mayor signed the ward redistricting act,which adjusted the district ward boundaries in light of the census results.after review by both houses of the congress,the act became law on october,and the ward boundary changes took effect on january.see supp legislative history.the act adjusted ward boundaries to bring the population of every ward to within five percent or less of the mean ward population.see june,final redistricting summary table,reprinted in c first am.in so doing,the act transferred several neighborhoods or portions of neighborhoods from one ward to another and altered the racial composition of several wards.see sewell chan,proposed lines divide residents.post,may,at,reprinted in c first am.
of particular importance for this litigation,the act transferred approximately residents of the predominantly neighborhood of kingman park from ward six,located on the west side of the anacostia river,to ward seven,which otherwise is located completely on the east side of the river.this boundary change allegedly was recommended by the ward six redistricting task force,appointed in the spring of by sharon ambrose,the council member representing ward six.the kingman park transfer,in conjunction with other boundary changes,reduced the proportion of the ward six population from to.compare ward population by race,supra,with district of columbia population by single race and hispanic origin by amended plan h prepared by the office of data center from census bureau data hereinafter ward population by race,reprinted in c first am.the proportion of the population in ward seven,into which the kingman park residents were moved,changed from to.see id.
the act also moved a significant portion of the chevy chase neighborhood,located on the western side of rock creek park,from ward three to ward four.ward four is considered by some to be the heart of the city upper and black establishment,and,prior to redistricting,was located completely on the eastern side of rock creek park.see chan,supra,at.the proportion of the ward three population was reduced from to.see ward population by race,supra,and ward population by race,supra.
on december,five days before the new boundaries took effect,appellant kpca brought suit against the members of the council in their official capacities and the mayor in his official capacity.on july,the complaint was amended to include appellant ccca as a.kpca is an unincorporated neighborhood association established in the.it has approximately active members,all of whom were registered voters of former ward six and appear now to be divided between wards five,six,and seven.see first am.compl,reprinted in c tr.of motions hearing at,kingman park civic ass williams,civ.action hereinafter tr.of motions hearing,reprinted in ccca is a recently established unincorporated neighborhood association with less than active members,all of whom are registered voters in ward three.first am.compl.b,reprinted in 
the gravamen of appellants complaint is that the transfer of the kingman park residents from ward six to ward seven diluted voting strength in violation of of the voting rights act.the complaint alleged,in addition,that the act diluted voting strength throughout the city by reducing majorities in wards with a significant white minority and packing voters into wards with an supermajority.appellants further claimed that the act violated provisions of law prohibiting adoption of redistricting plans with the purpose and effect of diluting minority voting strength,and requiring that wards be compact,approximately equal in size,and conform to census tracts.appellants initially alleged that the kpca and its members were excluded from participation in the ward six redistricting task force in violation of the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments,but withdrew this claim prior to the district court decision.kingman park civic ass williams,civ.action,slip op.at,reprinted in 
the council and the mayor moved separately to dismiss,or in the alternative,for summary judgment.the district court dismissed the complaint against the council members on the ground that they were entitled to absolute legislative immunity from suit for their official actions in connection with the adoption of the act.id.at.the court went on to dismiss all of appellants claims against the mayor.as to the claim of vote dilution in wards six and seven,in which appellant kpca members reside,the court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim under of the voting rights act.id.at.the court held that appellants lacked standing to challenge citywide vote dilution outside of wards six,seven,and three,but concluded that,even if they did have standing,they failed to state a claim under the voting rights act.having dismissed appellants federal claims,the court dismissed the pendent law claims pursuant to.id.at.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
appellants maintain two claims on appeal.first,they renew their claim that the act dilutes voting strength,in violation of of the voting rights act,by transferring residents of kingman park from ward six to ward seven and by transferring residents of chevy chase from ward three to ward four.second,they assert,for the first time on appeal,that the act results in racially discriminatory gerrymandering in violation of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.we hold that the mayor is entitled to summary judgment on the first claim,and that the second claim is not properly before this court because it was not raised below.
threshold issues 
a threshold concern is presented by the mayor assertion that he is entitled to legislative immunity from suit,because his authority and actions in connection with the ward redistricting act are strictly legislative in nature.we decline to reach the merits of this argument.in proceedings before the district court,counsel for the mayor disavowed any claim to legislative immunity in this action insofar as the mayor was sued in his official capacity.tr.of motions hearing at.therefore,the legislative immunity claim was expressly waived and can not be resurrected on appeal.
we likewise decline to address the merits of the mayor claim,raised for the first time on appeal,that the district of columbia is not a state or political subdivision to which of the voting rights act applies.see.it is the general rule,of course,that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.singleton wulff,d.the mayor claim raises a pure question of law,which is within our discretionary authority to address.see roosevelt du pont de nemours.the issue presented,however,is of sufficient public importance and complexity to counsel strongly against deciding it in this posture.appellants had no opportunity to address this defense prior to filing their reply brief.see texas rural legal aid,legal servs,stating that,in exercising its discretion as to whether to hear an issue not raised below,the court will look to whether the issue has been fully briefed by the parties.we need not resolve this question,moreover,because we decide the voting rights act claims in the mayor favor without turning to this untimely raised defense.
voting rights act claims 
dismissal for failure to state a claim 
this court reviews de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim,accepting plaintiffs factual allegations as true,and giving plaintiffs the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.browning clinton,internal quotation marks and citation omitted sparrow united air lines,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
we find that the district court erred in dismissing appellants voting rights act claims against the mayor under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.a rule b motion is intended to test the legal sufficiency of the complaint.browning,at.but the complaint need only set forth a short and plain statement of the claim,fed.civ.a,giving the defendant fair notice of the claim and the grounds upon which it rests.conley gibson,d.such simplified notice pleading is made possible by the liberal opportunity for discovery and the other pretrial procedures established by the rules to disclose more precisely the basis of both claim and defense and to define more narrowly the disputed facts and issues.id.at.at.in light of these liberal pleading requirements,a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.id.at.at.
section a of the voting rights act provides,in relevant part,that n o voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,practice,or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any state or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the united states to vote on account of race or color a.a violation of this prohibition is established 
if,based on the totality of the circumstances,it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection a of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.
in order to survive a motion to dismiss under rule b,appellants were required only to allege that the ward redistricting act dilutes minority voting strength such that minority voters in the relevant wards have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.see sparrow,at because racial discrimination in employment is a claim upon which relief can be granted,i was turned down for a job because of my race is all a complaint has to say to survive a motion to dismiss under rule b.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.appellants were not required on the face of their complaint to allege every legal element or fact that must be proven in a vote dilution claim.see id.at krieger fadely,c omplaints need not plead law or match facts to every element of a legal theory.internal quotation marks and citation omitted atchinson district of columbia,a complaint need not allege all that a plaintiff must eventually prove.
appellants complaint clearly passes this test.counts i,ii,and iii of the complaint allege that the defendants manipulated ward boundaries with the purpose and effect of packing voters into supermajority wards and decreasing the proportion of the overall and population in every ward in which the white proportion of the population was or greater.see first am.com pl,reprinted in c.the complaint specifically alleged that the act resulted in the reduction of the proportion of the ward six population from to,in part by transferring voters from kingman park to ward seven,a supermajority ward.see id.no more was necessary to withstand a rule b motion.
we acknowledge that it is possible for a plaintiff to plead too much that is,to plead himself out of court by alleging facts that render success on the merits impossible.sparrow,at.appellants did not do so here.although appellants complaint alleges that african americans remain an absolute majority in ward six and in every other ward in which they were a majority prior to redistricting,this does not suffice to place it beyond doubt that the plaintiff s can prove no set of facts in support of their claim which would entitle them to relief.conley,at.a
