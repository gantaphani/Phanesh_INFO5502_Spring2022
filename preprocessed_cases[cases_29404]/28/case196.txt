this appeal requires us to consider the application of the federal mail fraud statute to a case involving state election fraud.loren glenn turner was indicted on charges arising from his involvement in two kentucky state elections.the first was the may election of donnie newsome as knott county judge executive.the second was the november election for pike county district judge,involving candidate john doug hays.the alleged election fraud included the use of vote hauling checks to buy votes unlawfully the use of straw contributors who fraudulently donated money to the hays campaign on behalf of one of hays prominent backers so as to avoid kentucky maximum individual contribution limits the direct payment of cash to voters on election day to buy votes the structuring of cash withdrawals used to repay straw contributors from bank accounts in the knowing attempt to avoid federal credit transaction reporting ctr requirements and unlawful direct cash payments to a candidate of amounts far above the maximum contribution allowed by kentucky law.
a jury convicted turner of mail fraud in connection with the newsome campaign and conspiracy to commit mail fraud in connection with the hays campaign.turner convictions were based on two alternate theories first,that turner participated in a scheme to defraud the citizens of kentucky of the honest services of a candidate newsome or hays for public office the honest services theory and second,that turner participated in a scheme to defraud the citizens of kentucky of money or,the salary and emoluments of the public office sought by newsome or hays the salary theory.
we reverse the judgment of the district court because turner conduct,as alleged in the indictment,may not be prosecuted under the mail fraud statute using either the honest services theory or salary theory of prosecution.
turner,a kentuckian,worked as an employee for ross harris,a wealthy and successful coal operator who had a reputation of having significant influence in regional politics in the fall of,john doug hays ran as a candidate for pike county district judge.although harris had been noncommittal early in the district judge race,he eventually backed hays.at some point during the hays campaign,a local resident named linda white contacted the pikeville office of the federal bureau of investigation concerning the activities of her,tom varney,who was at that time working for the hays campaign.white had been secretly recording her telephone conversations with varney,and she turned tapes of those conversations over to the fbi.during the conversations,varney bragged about harris involvement in the hays campaign and his own relationship with harris.of interest to the fbi,varney also discussed the use of vote hauling checks in the campaign.varney repeatedly promised white two vote hauling checks but did not discuss any legitimate arrangement for her to transport voters.varney said on the tapes that he gave a third check to his daughter so that she could buy a coat.varney described vote hauling as a figure of speech and warned his daughter not to tell anyone that the check is for buying votes.based on the tapes,the fbi began an investigation into alleged misconduct in the hays and newsome campaigns.
as a result of that investigation,a federal grand jury returned a indictment charging ten defendants with violations relating to the two kentucky elections.relevant to this appeal,the indictment charged turner with conspiracy,pursuant to,to buy votes in violation of c,and conspiracy,pursuant to,to commit mail fraud in violation of and,in connection with the hays campaign.turner was also charged with mail fraud in violation of and,in connection with the newsome campaign.with regard to the hays campaign,the indictment alleged a conspiracy.first,the defendants devised a scheme to avoid the limit on personal campaign contributions under which straw contributors wrote personal checks for to the hays campaign and were then reimbursed by harris in cash.harris was also alleged to have given unreported cash directly to hays,who spent it as his own personal money in the election.according to the indictment,turner participated in the scheme by assisting harris in using straw contributors.the indictment alleged that the hays campaign mailed to the kentucky registry for election finance the registry a campaign finance report falsely reporting that the campaign had received contributions from each of at least contributors when in fact the contributions were concealed donations from harris.as the second part of the scheme,in an effort to utilize the contributions from harris,the hays campaign issued and distributed checks in the amount of to potential voters.although the checks were ostensibly labeled vote hauling checks,their purpose was to influence voters.the checks were distributed with sample ballots showing voters how to vote for hays,and the persons distributing the checks instructed voters to vote for hays.the hays campaign also gave cash directly to voters on election day.the hays campaign also allegedly mailed the registry a report of expenditures falsely claiming that people had been paid fifty dollars for vote hauling,when in fact the money had been used to influence voters.with regard to the newsome campaign,the indictment alleged that harris,with turner assistance,funneled to newsome.in an election finance statement delivered through the mails,the cash contribution was hidden from the registry when newsome falsely reported that the source of the money was loans and personal contributions.
before trial,turner moved to dismiss the mail fraud charges in the indictment,arguing that the conduct alleged could not be prosecuted under either the honest services theory or salary theory of mail fraud.the district court denied his motion and allowed the prosecution to proceed on both theories.following trial,the jury found turner guilty of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud on both the honest services theory and salary theory in connection with both the hays and newsome campaigns turner was found not guilty of conspiracy to buy votes in connection with the hays campaign.turner was sentenced to months imprisonment,three years supervised release,and a fine this appeal followed.
the federal mail fraud statute,prohibits use of the mails by any person having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises before,was used to prosecute a wide range of schemes to defraud individuals of intangible rights in addition to more typical schemes to defraud individuals of money or property.see cleveland united states,d.defendants whose schemes involved deprivations of intangible rights included public officials who deprived citizens of their right to the official honest services,private persons with clear fiduciary duties who defrauded their employers or unions by accepting kickbacks or selling confidential information,elected officials and campaign workers who deprived the citizenry of its right to an honest election,and defendants who defrauded individuals of their rights to privacy and other nonmonetary rights.see mcnally united states,d stevens,dissenting noting various cases for each category.
in mcnally united states,however,the supreme court invalidated the use of to prosecute deprivations of intangible rights,concluding that the mail fraud statute was limited in scope to the protection of property rights.at.if congress intended to protect intangible rights,the court stated that it must speak more clearly than it has.id.congress responded by quickly passing what has been called the mcnally fix section,which defines scheme or artifice to defraud as including a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.
the first question we address is whether the election fraud alleged in the indictment falls within the scope of the intangible right of honest services protected under.in order to do so,we must consider whether the enactment of revived the line of cases that allowed for prosecutions of election fraud using the mail fraud statute.
in interpreting a statute,this court looks first to its plain language.see cowherd million,cir.the plain language of supports appellants position that the statute does not cover the conduct outlined in the indictment.while candidates may be dishonest in seeking election,such dishonesty does not deprive anyone of any right to honest services for the simple reason that candidates,unlike the elected officials that they hope to become,provide no services to the public.in the context of,however,our analysis can not start and stop with the plain language of statute.section was a specific,targeted legislative response to mcnally and congress utilized the honest services terminology of cases that preceded mcnally.as the supreme court has said 
it is a rule of construction that w here congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under the common law,a court must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms.nationwide mut.ins.darden,d quoting community for creative reid,d see standard oil of united states.w here words are employed in a statute which had at the time a meaning at common law or in the law of this country,they are presumed to have been used in that sense.
neder united states,d see also riley kurtz,cir.because congress employed a legal term of art when enacting the statute,the critical inquiry is what congress understood the intangible right of honest services to mean based on prior caselaw,rather than what a dictionary definition of the term services might yield.see united states frost,cir accordingly,we must review sixth circuit precedent issued before mcnally in order to discover the precise contours of the right in this circuit.accord united states rybicki,cir we would,we think,labor long and with difficulty in seeking a clear and properly limited meaning of scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services simply by consulting a dictionary for the literal,plain meaning of the phrase.we therefore turn to the question of whether the intangible right of honest services,as that phrase is used in,includes the honesty of candidates for public office.
prior to mcnally,both the right to the honest services of elected officials and the right to the honest candidacy of an individual running for elected office were accepted applications of the mail fraud statute.as we have noted,the classic application of the intangible right to honest services doctrine has been to a corrupt public servant who has deprived the public of his honest services.frost,at.although the classic application related to an officeholder,it had generally become accepted that candidates for public office could be prosecuted under the mail fraud statute for fraudulent election schemes.see,united states girdner,cir candidate for state legislature united states odom,cir sheriff united states clapps,cir party chairman united states states,cir candidates for city office.a review of the prominent election fraud cases,however,reveals that none referred to the harm flowing from election fraud as a deprivation of a right to honest services.indeed,most of these cases recognized that the application of the statute to election fraud was a modification of the intangible right of honest services,defined as a right to an honest election.see clapps,at states,at.likewise,justice stevens,in his mcnally dissent,categorized the intangible rights cases and expressly separated honest services and honest election cases.see mcnally,at.stevens,dissenting.
against this precedential backdrop,by its terms,did not restore the application of the mail fraud statute to all intangible rights.instead,restored the applicability of the statute to deprivations of only the intangible right of honest services.the supreme court,in cleveland united states,d,recognized that was a limited revival of intangible rights 
congress amended the law specifically to cover one of the intangible rights that lower courts had protected under prior to mcnally the intangible right of honest services.abuse act of,a.significantly,congress covered only the intangible right of honest services even though federal courts,relying on mcnally,had dismissed,for want of monetary loss to any victim,prosecutions under for diverse forms of public corruption,including licensing fraud.
id.at.emphasis added.thus,expressly limited application of the mail fraud statute to those cases involving deprivations of the intangible right of honest services,as distinguished from the intangible right to an honest election.our previous statement,in frost,that has restored the mail fraud statute to its scope is not to the contrary.at.in frost,we explicitly recognized that the scope of the statute would be defined according to previous opinions interpreting the intangible right to honest services.id.emphasis added see also id.congress intended the provision to reinstate the doctrine of intangible rights to honest services.emphasis added.thus,in accordance with frost,we now hold that the right to honest elections was separate and distinct from the right to honest services before mcnally.
the legislative history of further confirms that the statute revived the honest services cases to the exclusion of cases.in response to mcnally,representative john conyers introduced the fraud amendments act of which would have defined fraud or defraud as including defrauding another of intangible rights of any kind whatsoever in any manner or for any purpose whatsoever.cong.rec,wl daily ed,statement of conyers.the following year,the act of was proposed.according to senator joseph biden,the bill contained a provision that addresses election fraud section b of the bill makes it a criminal violation to deprive or defraud,or attempt to deprive or defraud,by any scheme or artifice,the inhabitants of a state,or political subdivision of a state,of a fair and impartially conducted election process.cong.rec,wl daily ed,statement of biden.neither the fraud amendments nor acts were ever enacted,however.
the abuse act of enacted as public law on november,included an amendment to according to representative conyers,this amendment restores the mail fraud provision to where that provision was before the mcnally decision cong.rec,wl daily ed,statement of conyers.in reference to this bill,senator biden stated that t he intent is to reinstate all of the caselaw pertaining to the mail and wire fraud statutes without change.cong.rec,wl daily ed,statement of biden.however,unlike the fraud amendments and acts,the amendment,as included in the abuse act,did not expressly reference election fraud.for that reason,senator biden reintroduced the act the following year,acknowledging that the prior congress had amended the mail and wire fraud statutes only to define fraud to include a scheme to deprive a person of the intangible right to another honest services.cong.rec,wl daily ed,statement of senator biden.senator biden called the amended provision only a stopgap,temporary fix,and partial solution.id.the amendment had allowed the government to resume prosecution of public corruption cases involving the honest services of public officials,as well as some commercial bribery and other serious breaches of fiduciary duty.id.however,according to senator biden,current law does not permit prosecution of election fraud because such offenses do not involve anyone honest services.id.
in sum,the plain terms of the statute,the supreme court discussion of the statute in cleveland,and the legislative history of the statute all demonstrate that congressional enactment of did not revive those cases involving prosecutions under the mail fraud statute for deprivations of the intangible right of honest elections 
nor may turner be prosecuted under because the alleged scheme involved a deprivation of honest services as that term was understood before mcnally.the district court assumed that,even though congress did not explicitly restore election fraud cases,turner conduct could still be prosecuted under an honest services theory so long as it fit within the honest services cases existing before mcnally and thereby expressly revived by.attempting to fit this election fraud case under the honest services framework would circumvent congressional intent to revive only the honest services cases and not election fraud cases.moreover,obvious problems inhere in any attempt to recast this election fraud case as involving a deprivation of honest services.
this circuit honest services precedents,as examined in frost,require the finding of a fiduciary duty owed by the defendant to the victim see at analyzing united states gray,cir,rev mcnally,d united states runnels,cir runnels i united states runnels,cir en banc runnels ii.in order to determine whether a defendant who did not hold a public office nevertheless owed the public a fiduciary duty,the district court should have applied the two measures of fiduciary status as adopted in gray and reaffirmed in frost.see frost,at.this analysis includes a reliance test,under which one may be a fiduciary when others rely upon him because of a special relationship in the government,and a de facto control test,under which a person who in fact makes governmental decisions may be held to be a governmental fiduciary.gray,at quoting united states margiotta,cir.hays and newsome,as mere candidates,can not satisfy these tests.taking the de facto control test first,there was no allegation that hays or newsome in his role as candidate controlled any governmental decisions similarly,in terms of reliance,because by definition candidates do not yet control governmental decisions,the public does not rely upon them.see margiotta,at.finding a fiduciary duty owed by candidates under these facts would require finding that all job applicants owe a fiduciary duty to their potential employers.in short,applying controlling precedent,we hold that hays and newsome,as candidates,did not owe the public a fiduciary duty.
instead of applying the framework of gray,the district court decided that candidates for public office were fiduciaries of the public for two reasons first,there is some likelihood that election fraud will turn into public corruption once the candidate obtains office and second,kentucky has enacted a host of laws to regulate state elections.we find neither basis for finding a fiduciary duty persuasive.the potential for a subsequent breach of an actual fiduciary duty once a candidate takes office can not create a fiduciary duty before a candidate is even elected.aside from the speculative nature of this proposition,it ignores the fact that honest services fraud is anchored upon the defendant misuse of his public office for personal profit.gray,at.with regard to kentucky regulation of elections,individual conduct regulation does not transform the individual into a fiduciary.each citizen is subject to a host of statutory requirements,but that does not make the individual a fiduciary.neither rationale offered by the district court demonstrates that mere candidates owe the public fiduciary duties.
the district court also reasoned that frost suggests that the intangible right of citizens to fair and honest government is included in the definition of the intangible right of honest services.according to the district court,the right to fair and honest elections is axiomatically included in the right to fair and honest government.thus,putting the two together,it follows that honest elections are protected by frost.we disagree with this reasoning on both levels.frost reference to a right to fair and honest government quotes a passage from runnels i that reviewed the history of the intangible rights doctrine before mcnally.see runnels i,at.we are not persuaded that frost or runnels i suggested that the right to fair and honest government is necessarily included in the right to honest services as that term is used in.the additional inference that,assuming there is a right to fair and honest government,the right to honest elections is included therein is also unwarranted.ultimately,this line of reasoning invites generalization beyond the terms of.
because evinces congressional intent to revive only prosecutions for deprivations of the right to honest services,not honest elections,it would contradict such intent to try to recharacterize an election fraud case as a honest services case.moreover,to attempt to do so quickly highlights why the right to honest services and the right to an honest election constituted distinct intangible rights in the first instance candidates for office do not owe the public a legally cognizable fiduciary duty.for these reasons,the district court should have dismissed the charges in the indictment that were based on the honest services theory of mail fraud 
our decision that the conduct alleged in the indictment can not be prosecuted under an honest services theory does not end our inquiry into the district court application of the mail fraud statute to turner conduct.turner was also indicted and convicted on the theory that he participated in a scheme to fraudulently obtain money or,the salary of the elected positions sought by hays and newsome.
the salary theory of mail fraud originated as an effort to limit the effects of mcnally.because mcnally did not question the use of the mail fraud statute generally to prosecute frauds devised to obtain money or property in his dissent,justice stevens suggested that some deprivations of intangible rights could be recharacterized as deprivations of money or property 
p rosecutions of corrupt officials who use the mails to further their schemes may continue in the wake of mcnally since it will frequently be possible to prove some loss of money or property when a person is being paid a salary for his loyal services,any breach of that loyalty would appear to carry with it some loss of money to the is not getting what he paid for.additionally,i f an agent receives anything as a result of his violation of a duty of loyalty to the principal,he is subject to a liability to deliver it,its value,or its proceeds,to the principal.this duty may fulfill the court money or property requirement in most kickback schemes.
at.stevens,dissenting text and footnote merged internal quotation marks and citation omitted.although justice stevens footnote discusses only fraud by salaried officials and kickback schemes,the justice department apparently believed that this approach extended to election fraud,instructing prosecutors that the salary theory of mail fraud remains a viable option in many cases of state election fraud.see federal prosecution of election offenses,at mcnally does not entirely foreclose use of the mail fraud statute to address election fraud.if a pecuniary as money or sought through the scheme,the mail fraud statute still applies.
despite these instructions,there have been few federal prosecutions of election fraud cases using the salary theory of mail fraud since mcnally was decided and very few since the.the acceptance of the salary theory in election cases has also not been uniform.compare united states ratcliff,d,rejecting salary theory united states george,wl,at,rejecting salary theory ingber enzor,rejecting salary theory,with united states webb,accepting salary theory united states schermerhorn,accepting salary theory.to our knowledge,no other circuit has ruled on the viability of the salary theory in a case of election fraud 
before mcnally,schemes to defraud involving state and local elections were not viewed as money or property cases.instead,analysis of election fraud cases before mcnally focused on whether the conduct resulted in a deprivation of intangible rights.see girdner,at categorizing election fraud as involving intangible political rights clapps,at involving a scheme to deprive an electoral body of its political rights to fair elections free from dilution from the intentional casting and tabulation of false,fictitious or spurious ballots states,involving a scheme by the appellants to deceive and defraud the public and the board of election commissioners of certain intangible political and civil rights.therefore,with the exception of the two aforementioned district court cases,applying the mail fraud statute to a case of election fraud based on a theory that the candidate attempted to obtain money in the form of a salary would be a novel application of the mail fraud statute.
turner position is that a scheme to deprive the public of a fair election,which was prosecuted under an intangible rights theory before mcnally,can not be recharacterized as a scheme involving money or property.turner primary argument parallels the reasoning of the eleventh circuit in united states goodrich,cir.in that case,an indictment issued before mcnally charged the defendant with defrauding the citizens of their right to the honest,faithful,and disinterested services of some county commissioners in connection with a bribery scheme.id.at.after mcnally invalidated the government theory of prosecution based on the intangible right of honest services,a superseding indictment was returned charging the defendant with defrauding the citizens of the salaries,emoluments,and services of county commissioners.id.the eleventh circuit rejected the government position,holding that 
the property interest alleged to have been denied the victim the government contends the county paid salaries for but did not the honest and faithful services of the county commissioners,an interest mcnally held to be unprotected by the mail fraud statute.thus,this property interest is indistinguishable from the intangible right to good government described in mcnally and can not sustain the mail fraud count.
id.at.this reasoning was adopted by two of the three district courts that ultimately rejected the salary theory of prosecution.see ratcliff,d at finding that the alleged object of the mail fraud,the salary and benefits,is indistinguishable from the intangible right of honest services described in ingber.at rejecting salary theory because the scheme to get the salary and perquisites of office was essentially the same thing as the scheme to defraud the public of its right to a fair election.yet,while persuasive,this rationale is not determinative of the issue.conduct that may be prosecuted under an intangible rights theory could conceivably also be prosecuted under a money or property theory.in general,a defendant may violate the mail fraud statute in several different ways.see united states miller,d.moreover,a single scheme may involve obtaining money by false and fraudulent representations and also involve depriving another of the right to honest services.see united states caldwell,cir united states harvard,cir.thus,the mere fact that the scheme was alleged to deprive the victim of an intangible right does not categorically preclude a finding that the same scheme was also designed to deprive the victim of a property right 
turner proffers a second theory,namely,that allowing an election fraud prosecution to proceed under a salary theory would circumvent congressional intent not to revive election fraud cases when enacting.we disagree.although congress chose not to reincorporate election fraud into revival of one of the intangible rights,the enactment of can not be understood to have modified traditional prohibition of frauds involving money or property.therefore,if election fraud was prosecutable under a money or property theory before mcnally,then such a theory remains viable irrespective of.similarly,turner argues that courts and prosecutors would not have used the far more controversial intangible rights approach if a straightforward money or property approach was available.this reasoning has numerous problems.first,contrary to turner suggestion,there was little controversial about intangible rights prosecutions before mcnally,a decision which reversed every federal circuit to have reached the issue of whether the mail fraud statute protected intangible rights.see buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health and human,d recognizing that the holding of mcnally contradict ed the unanimous and longstanding interpretation of lower federal courts.second,as already discussed,the mere fact that prosecutions of election fraud under the intangible rights theory before mcnally were more common than prosecutions under a money or property theory does not necessarily mean that the prosecutions could not have proceeded under a money or property theory.third,it is obvious from a practical standpoint that there may be great difficulties in prosecuting an election fraud case under the salary theory,not the least of which is proving that the intent of the fraud was to obtain money.interestingly,the two district courts that accepted the salary theory in an election fraud setting both explicitly recognized the difficulty of procuring a conviction based on an intent to obtain a salary.see webb.at it is now the responsibility of the united states to prove that these defendants intended to acquire this tangible property of the commonwealth of kentucky.if the united states can not do so,its prosecution will fail.schermerhorn.at whether the government can actually prove in this case that the object of the defendant alleged scheme was to take the salary and monetary benefits that inure with election as a state senator is a matter that will take some work.in short,there may have been obvious advantages for prosecutors in using an intangible rights theory,thus explaining why there were no salary theory prosecutions.
because turner arguments do not provide a fully satisfactory answer to whether his election fraud may be prosecuted under a salary theory,we undertake a closer analysis of the issue.mail fraud consists of a scheme or artifice to defraud use of mails in furtherance of the scheme and intent to deprive a victim of money or property.see united states daniel,cir united states prince,cir in the context of election fraud,the government and citizens have not been deprived of any money or property because the relevant salary would be paid to someone regardless of the fraud.in such a case,the citizens have simply lost the intangible right to elect the official who will receive the salary.see george,wl,at without regard to the outcome of the election,the county by statute was to be paid a salary and reimbursed for expenses.simply put,the citizenry lost no money or property but only the intangible right legally to elect their county.ingber.at describing the salary as a routine and budgeted expenditure see also goodrich,at t he indictment does not allege that the purported mail fraud caused the county to incur any expenses over and above the cost of conducting commission business.of course,the mail fraud statute does not require an actual loss of property because success of the scheme is not an element of the offense.see united states merklinger,cir t he mail and wire fraud statutes do not require proof that the intended victim was actually defrauded the actual success of a scheme to defraud is not an element of either or.united states ames sintering,cir the government need only charge that the defendant intended to defraud the victim of money or property,not that the victim was actually deprived of money or property.erwin united states,cir.but if the scheme is successful,its effect must be to deprive the victim of money or property.successful election frauds have no such effect.
the district court reasoned that,even if the election fraud could not deprive the commonwealth of any money in the sense that the salary would be paid to some officeholder regardless of the fraud,the citizens had nevertheless been deprived of the benefit of their bargain.because the essence of fraud is often that the victim obtains something of lesser value than the price paid,the district court reasoned that it is immaterial that the expenditure was already budgeted.see webb.at schermerhorn.at.the district court presumed that election fraud results in payment of the budgeted salary to a person of lesser integrity and quality than that originally desired.see schermerhorn.at should it be proven that defendant engaged in the fraudulent election scheme here alleged,we think a presumption arises that the citizenry could have secured a better state senator.on appeal,turner challenges this reasoning and argues that the benefit of the bargain theory of fraud is inapplicable
