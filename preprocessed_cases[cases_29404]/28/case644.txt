we have on appeal department of state,division of elections martin,so d dca,in which the first district court of appeal declared section,florida statutes,unconstitutional.we have mandatory jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.the issue in this case is whether section,which gives the department of state absolute discretion to allow a candidate to withdraw after the day before an election,violates the separation of powers principle set forth in article ii,section of the florida constitution.we affirm the first district and hold that section is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers under article ii,section because the legislature has impermissibly delegated to the executive branch absolute,unfettered discretion to determine whether to grant or deny a candidate request to withdraw after the day before an election.
facts and procedural history 
james stork qualified with the department of state,division of elections the department as the democratic party candidate for the florida congressional district seat in the november,general election.on september,forty days before the election,the department received a sworn notice from stork seeking to withdraw as a candidate.on september,the department,relying on section,notified stork that in the interest of avoiding disruption and confusion,his request to withdraw would be denied.martin,so d at.this in effect left the democratic party without the ability to substitute a candidate in his place prior to the election.thereafter,members of the congressional district democratic party executive committee executive committee,the appellees in this case,sought a mandatory injunction requiring the department to declare that a vacancy had been created by stork withdrawal and to comply with section b,florida statutes.this provision requires the department to place on the ballot the name of a replacement candidate that is provided by the party executive committee at least days before the election.
at the hearing on the executive committee request for injunctive relief,the department acknowledged that on or before the day prior to an election,withdrawal of a candidate is a matter of right under section.the department argued,however,that when a candidate seeks to withdraw after the day before an election,it has the absolute discretion under section to grant or deny a request for withdrawal.in rejecting the department arguments,the trial court stated that t o read section as the department urges would essentially render section b meaningless.martin dep t of state,div.of elections,order at cir.order filed.because section b was enacted after section,the trial court concluded that the legislature intended that section b control the procedure for allowing a candidate withdrawal and filling a vacancy in nomination.the trial court therefore entered a final order granting injunctive relief in favor of the executive committee.
the department appealed the trial court order to the first district in affirming the trial court order,the first district held that section unconstitutionally delegates legislative authority in violation of article ii,section.the first district concluded that section does not provide any criteria or standards to guide the department in the exercise of the power delegated under the statute,but rather vests unbridled discretion in the department to determine whether a candidate should be permitted to withdraw where the sworn notice was received fewer than days before a general election.martin,so d at.the first district determined that severing the offending portion of subsection from the statute would create an irreconcilable conflict between the remaining portion of subsection and subsection,and possibly between subsection and section b as well.id.thus,the first district declared section unconstitutional in its entirety.see id.
the issue before the court is whether section violates article ii,section of the florida constitution.we review de novo a district court decision declaring a statute unconstitutional.dep t of children families,so d.in resolving this issue,we begin by reviewing whether and to what extent sections and b relate to and may be reconciled with one another.next,we review article ii,section of the florida constitution,as well as case law addressing the constitutionality of statutory provisions under the nondelegation doctrine of article ii,section.we then analyze the constitutionality of section.finally,we decide whether the unconstitutional portion of section may be severed from the remainder of the statute.
interplay of sections and b,florida statutes 
in,the legislature first enacted statutory requirements governing placement of a candidate name on an election ballot.see ch,laws of this statutory provision eventually became section.see ch,laws of.section governs those instances in which a candidate name will not be printed on an election ballot and provides 
no candidate name,which candidate is required to qualify with the department of state for any primary or general election,shall be printed on the ballot if such candidate has notified the department of state in writing,under oath,on or before the day before the election that the candidate will not accept the nomination or office for which he or she filed qualification papers.the department of state may in its discretion allow such a candidate to withdraw after the day before an election upon receipt of a written notice,sworn to under oath,that the candidate will not accept the nomination or office for which he or she qualified.

section was enacted in,and relates to filling vacancies in governmental offices.see ch,laws of.the statute was amended by the legislature in,see ch,at,laws of florida,for the sake of clarity and to cover certain vacancies which had not been addressed previously.comm.on,cs for sb staff analysis june,available at.dep t of state,state archives,ser,carton,tallahassee.the amendment to section resulted in the statutory language set forth in section b section governs the procedure for filling vacancies resulting from the death,resignation,withdrawal,or removal of a candidate.see a.stat.section b addresses vacancies that occur later than september or less than days prior to an election,and provides in full 
if the vacancy in nomination occurs later than september,or if the vacancy in nomination occurs with respect to a candidate of a minor political party which has obtained a position on the ballot,no special primary election shall be held and the department of state shall notify the chair of the appropriate state,district,or county political party executive committee of such party and,within days,the chair shall call a meeting of his or her executive committee to consider designation of a nominee to fill the vacancy.the name of any person so designated shall be submitted to the department of state within days of notice to the chair in order that the person designated may have his or her name printed or otherwise placed on the ballot of the ensuing general election,but in no event shall the supervisor of elections be required to place on a ballot a name submitted less than days prior to the election.if the vacancy occurs less than days prior to the election,the person designated by the political party will replace the former party nominee even though the former party nominee name will be on the ballot.any ballots cast for the former party nominee will be counted for the person designated by the political party to replace the former party nominee.if there is no opposition to the party nominee,the person designated by the political party to replace the former party nominee will be elected to office at the general election.for purposes of this paragraph,the term district political party executive committee means the members of the state executive committee of a political party from those counties comprising the area involving a district office.

both sections and b relate to florida election process.the doctrine of in pari materia is a principle of statutory construction that requires that statutes relating to the same subject or object be construed together to harmonize the statutes and to give effect to the legislature intent.see forsythe longboat key beach erosion control,so d,where possible,courts must give full effect to all statutory provisions and construe related statutory provisions in harmony with one another.in addition,we must construe sections and b consistent with the important constitutional rights that are involved t he right of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs,and the right of qualified voters,regardless of their political persuasion,to cast their votes effectively.reform party of florida black,so d,quoting williams rhodes,d alteration in original.
the first district determined that section governs when and how a candidate may seek to withdraw,whereas section b governs the process to be used to fill a vacancy that results when either the candidate submits a timely request to withdraw or the department,in its discretion,grants an untimely request to withdraw.see martin,so d at.therefore,the first district concluded that the department does have discretion to deny withdrawals after the day before an election.however,the first district concluded that the lack of standards to guide the department discretion concerning a request for withdrawal rendered section unconstitutional.the department agrees with the first district conclusion as to the interplay of sections and b.the department disagrees,however,that section is unconstitutional.
we conclude that reading section together with section b supports the first district interpretation of the interplay of these statutory provisions.construing the statutes in any other manner renders section meaningless.see hechtman nations title ins.of new york,so d,it is an elementary principle of statutory construction that significance and effect must be given to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of the statute if possible and words in a statute should not be construed as mere surplusage.state goode,so d,a basic rule of statutory construction provides that the legislature does not intend to enact useless provisions,and courts should avoid readings that would render part of a statute meaningless.the trial court interpreted section b as eliminating the department discretion under section to deny withdrawals after the day before an election.however,if the department does not have discretion to deny withdrawals after the day,there is no need for the legislature to state in the first sentence of section that withdrawals must be allowed if received on or before the day before an election because withdrawals would have to be granted regardless of when a candidate request is received.see.stat.no candidate name shall be printed on the ballot if such candidate has notified the department of state on or before the day before the election emphasis supplied.accordingly,we conclude that section clearly intended to give the department discretion to grant or deny a request for withdrawal and that section b comes into play only when withdrawal is allowed.
ii.separation of powers 
article ii,section of the florida constitution 
having concluded that section intended to give the department discretion,we must determine whether the grant of the discretion is so broad as to violate the separation of powers doctrine of article ii,section.article ii,section creates the three branches of government and prohibits one branch from exercising the powers of the other two branches 
branches of powers of the state government shall be divided into legislative,executive and judicial branches.no person belonging to one branch shall exercise any powers appertaining to either of the other branches unless expressly provided herein.
this court has traditionally applied a strict separation of powers doctrine,state cotton,so d,which encompasses two fundamental prohibitions.chiles children a,b,c,d,e,f,so d.the first is that no branch may encroach upon the powers of another.the second is that no branch may delegate to another branch its constitutionally assigned power.id.citation omitted.in bush schiavo,so d,cert.denied,d,we recently addressed this second prohibition and explained 
the legislature is permitted to transfer subordinate functions to permit administration of legislative policy by an agency with the expertise and flexibility to deal with complex and fluid conditions.microtel.public serv.comm n,so d.however,under article ii,section of the constitution the legislature may not delegate the power to enact a law or the right to exercise unrestricted discretion in applying the law.sims state,so d.this prohibition,known as the nondelegation doctrine,requires that fundamental and primary policy decisions be made by members of the legislature who are elected to perform those tasks,and that the administration of legislative programs must be pursuant to some minimal standards and guidelines ascertainable by reference to the enactment establishing the program.askew cross key waterways,so d,see also avatar dev.state so d,citing askew with approval.in other words,statutes granting power to the executive branch must clearly announce adequate standards to guide in the execution of the powers delegated.the statute must so clearly define the power delegated that the executive is precluded from acting through whim,showing favoritism,or exercising unbridled discretion.lewis bank of pasco county,so d.
id.at alterations in original.the requirement that the legislature delineate adequate standards enables courts to perform their constitutional duties.the failure to set forth adequate standards precludes a court from determining whether the executive branch is acting in accord with the legislature intent.see askew,so d at when legislation is so lacking in guidelines that neither the agency nor the courts can determine whether the agency is carrying out the intent of the legislature in its conduct,then,in fact,the agency becomes the lawgiver rather than the administrator of the law.
delegation of legislative authority 
in several decisions,we have ruled unconstitutional laws that delegated legislative authority with insufficient standards guiding the exercise of this authority by the executive branch.in lewis,this court held that a statute allowing bank or trust company records to be made public upon the consent of the comptroller,as head of the department of banking and finance,constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in violation of article ii,section.see so d at.the statute at issue in lewis provided in pertinent part as follows 
division records.
all bank or trust company applications,investigation reports,examination reports,and related information,including any duly authorized copies in possession of any banking organization,foreign banking corporation,or any other person or agency,shall be confidential communications,other than such documents as are required by law to be published,and shall not be made public unless with the consent of the department,pursuant to a court order,or in response to legislative subpoena as provided by law.
id.at quoting.stat.emphasis omitted.in holding section unconstitutional,this court approved the reasoning of the circuit court judge who found that t here are no restrictions,limitations,or guidelines provided in the statute to limit or regulate the action of the department in granting or withholding consent.id.at.
similarly,in orr trask,so d,the court concluded that a proviso authorizing the governor to reduce the number of deputy commissioner positions violated article ii,section.the proviso in question stated that 
f unds and positions in specific appropriation contemplate the elimination of one deputy commissioner by july,and three deputy commissioners by december,one from district j and three from district 
id.at alteration in original.the court determined that the proviso was unconstitutional because it furnished no guidance to the governor as to the criteria to be used in reducing the number of deputies,but rather,left the selection of which deputies should be eliminated entirely to the unbridled discretion of the executive branch.id.at.
more recently,in schiavo,this court held that chapter,laws of fl
