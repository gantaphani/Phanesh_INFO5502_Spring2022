background 
this case concerns the position of recreation director of the city of lafollette the recreation director.what constitutes the job duties of the recreation director is a factual matter,the resolution of which is necessary to deciding the issues presented in this appeal it is also a factual matter that plaintiff and defendants dispute.for the purpose of this appeal,information about the recreation director job duties comes from three sources the charter of the city of lafollette,tennessee the city charter,the city of lafollette employee handbook personnel policies the employee handbook,and the parties affidavits.
the structure of the city government is detailed in the city charter.article ii of the city charter vests broad general powers in the city council,and identifies many specific responsibilities of the city council.at.article v addresses the responsibilities of the city administrator,whose duties include supervis ing and coordinat ing all administrative activities of the affairs of the city under the city council.at.article v also enumerates nine specific duties of the city administrator.information relevant to the position of recreation director is located in articles vi and vii of the city charter.the city charter does not,however,define the responsibilities of the recreation director.article vi of the city charter addresses other city officers.article vi states in relevant part 
section.appointment of officers.the city council shall elect by majority vote the following officers city clerk,city attorney,city judge,treasurer,chief of police,public works director,street and sanitation operations manager,codes enforcement officer,recreation director,animal control officer,and fire chief.such officers shall serve at the pleasure of the city council.

it shall be unlawful for any candidate for office or any candidate for appointed office to give or promise any person,either directly or indirectly,any office,position,employment benefit,or anything of value for the purpose of influencing or obtaining the political support,aid,or vote of any person.
article vii addresses administration and finance.article vii states in relevant part 
section.administrative organization.the city council shall determine the powers and duties to be performed by each department,shall prescribe the powers and duties of all officers and employees,and may require an officer or employee to perform duties in any number of departments.the administrative organization,under the supervision of the city administrator,shall be organized into the following departments department of finance department of public safety department of public works and department of recreation.
the city council shall have the power to change the departmental organization by ordinance upon recommendation from the city administrator.
additionally,the parties support their positions by reference to the employee handbook.the employee handbook contains a policy statement informing the employee that e mployment with the city of lafollette is at will.at.the employee handbook also provides an overview of the government of the city 
the mayor and city council establish policy and enact ordinances and resolutions for the development of the entire community.as elected officials,the mayor and city council set the policies by which the city of lafollette government functions.
the city administrator is the chief administrative officer of the city of lafollette and is responsible for handling the administrative affairs of the city government within the framework of the city charter and policies adopted by the mayor and city council.
the employee handbook also contains a section entitled miscellaneous policies,subsection a of which addresses political activity.subsection a states in relevant part 
no person in the service of the city of lafollette or seeking admission thereto,shall be appointed,reduced,removed,or in any way favored or discriminated against because of political opinions or affiliations.
nothing in this section is intended to prohibit any municipal government employee from privately expressing political views or from casting vote in all elections.
also included in the employee handbook is an organizational chart of the city.according to the chart,the city council holds the highest position in the city.the city administrator answers directly to the city council.beneath the city administrator,and answering to the city administrator,are the city safety coordinator,city attorney,and city judge,who are each on the same organizational level.the recreation director is on the same organizational level as nine other offices,which are located below the safety coordinator,city attorney,and city judge,but nevertheless answer directly to the city administrator.these nine other offices are police chief,administrative services,city treasurer,city clerk,public works,library,animal control,codes enforcement,and fire chief.
in addition to the documents describing the city,the parties submitted affidavits addressing the job functions of the recreation director.while the parties give starkly different descriptions of the position,no party describes the actual duties of the recreation director with significant detail.defendants do not uniquely address the responsibilities of the recreation director,but instead address the job functions that they contend are common to each director of the four departments enumerated in article vii of the city charter.according to defendants,department directors,including the recreation director,submit annual budgets,formulate policies,and set the goals,responsibilities and functions for their departments.at.the department directors also advise the city council on policy and personnel matters,including employment decisions involving promotion,demotion,termination and hiring members of their department.at.this includes determining when subordinates have committed a policy infraction or have engaged in misconduct,and conducting periodic workload assessments to ensure that the departments are adequately staffed.at.moreover,the department directors,including the recreation director,possess the authority to employ all discipline measures short of unpaid suspension and termination without the consent and approval of the city council.at.the department directors are responsible for the operation of their department,and this involves handl ing routine administrative tasks with respect to the operation of their department and the management of the employees situated there under sic.at.finally,defendants allege that the city council and the mayor rely upon the heads of the department sic to promote and effectuate the policy of the city council,and said department heads assist and advise the city council with respect to the formulation and implementation of said policy decisions and program development.at.
plaintiff disputes this characterization.without providing specific details,he asserts that the position of recreation director does not involve policymaking.he alleges that the mayor and the city council establish policy and enact ordinances,and that he did not make any policy or have discretion as to how to implement the policies set by the mayor and the city council.plaintiff contends that he did not advise the city council or assist the city council in implementing the policies of the recreation department.plaintiff concedes that he would recommend employees within his department for promotions and pay raises,but he states that the ultimate decision on employment matters rests with the city council.lastly,plaintiff notes that the hiring of employees is done by the city administrator and the hiring of employees is done by the city council.
in contrast to the dispute over the duties of the recreation director,the events leading up to this litigation are comparatively straightforward.plaintiff was hired as the recreation director on august.at the time that plaintiff was hired,lucy lobertini was the mayor of the city.lobertini ran for reelection against defendant cliff jennings in the november,election.plaintiff supported lobertini during his personal time away from the office.in the runup to the election,defendant jennings allegedly threatened to remove plaintiff unless plaintiff ceased supporting lobertini.defendant jennings won the election.additionally,in the same election,defendant hatmaker was reelected as a city councilman defendant fannon position as city councilman was not up for reelection in the election.prior to plaintiff termination,in a workshop before the city council,defendant jennings allegedly stated that he was recommending that plaintiff be terminated for political reasons.on january,defendants voted to terminate plaintiff employment.they hired johnny byrge as recreation director,who allegedly had less experience and education than plaintiff.
on march,plaintiff filed a complaint in the eastern district of tennessee.plaintiff complaint alleged five causes of action.the first cause of action alleged that defendants,acting in their official capacities,violated by depriving plaintiff of a property interest in his position as recreation director without due process of law,because they terminated him on account of his political opinions.plaintiff second cause of action alleged that defendants,acting in their official capacities,deprived plaintiff of his right to equal protection under the law by terminating him on account of his political opinions,in violation of.plaintiff fourth cause of action alleged that defendants,acting in their individual and official capacities,violated plaintiff right to freedom of speech and association by terminating him in retaliation for political activity,in violation of.plaintiff third and fifth causes of action alleged violations of the tennessee constitution.plaintiff included the city as a defendant in each cause of action.
on february,defendants,acting in both their individual and official capacities,filed a motion for summary judgment.the city filed a motion for summary judgment on february.the district court issued an opinion and order granting the city and defendants motions in part and denying the city and defendants motions in part on june.lane city of lafollette,wl.june,unpublished.the district court held that factual disputes existed as to whether plaintiff was terminated on account of his political beliefs,and therefore summary judgment could not be granted in favor of the city or defendants on the ground that plaintiff termination was not in retaliation for protected speech.id.at.the district court also found that defendants and the city had not sufficiently supported their position that plaintiff employment was of a type that could be terminated for political reasons.id.at.furthermore,the district court held that qualified immunity was inappropriate,because the sixth circuit had denied qualified immunity to similarly situated defendants in the past.id.at citing heggen lee,cir caudill hollan,cir.
the district court rejected defendants argument that they could not be held liable in their official capacities,holding that the minutes of city council meetings demonstrated that defendants had the authority to establish official policy for the city.id.at.the district court also rejected defendants and the city claim that,because plaintiff was an employee,plaintiff could be terminated for cause or no cause.id.at.although conceding that plaintiff was an employee,the district court concluded that plaintiff could not be terminated for exercising his first amendment rights.id.however,the district court granted the city motion for summary judgment with respect to plaintiff claims arising under the tennessee constitution,holding that the tennessee constitution did not provide a private cause of action.id.
defendants filed a timely notice of appeal on june.the basis for defendants interlocutory appeal was the district court denial of qualified immunity.the city also gave notice of appeal,alleging that the issues associated with plaintiff claims against the city were inextricably intertwined with plaintiff claims against the individual defendants.see tucker city of richmond,cir the exercise of pendent jurisdiction,while discretionary,is appropriate where the appealable and issues are inextricably intertwined.internal quotations removed quoting brennan twp.of northville,cir.
discussion 
claims against defendants in their individual capacity 
defendants brought this interlocutory appeal challenging the district court denial of their defense of qualified immunity.the denial of a claim of qualified immunity is an appealable final decision for the purpose of,which vests the courts of appeals with jurisdiction over final decisions of the district courts,but only to the extent that the claim of qualified immunity turns on an issue of law.mitchell forsyth,d.if the denial of qualified immunity turns on an issue of fact,this court has no jurisdiction to resolve the claim.johnson jones,d.whether a particular job is entitled to first amendment protection from patronage dismissals and the related question of whether the law was sufficiently unclear to entitle defendants to qualified immunity are both legal questions to which this court jurisdiction extends.see sowards loudon county,cir whether political affiliation is an appropriate consideration for a government position is a question of law.mccloud testa,cir holding that whether the law was sufficiently clear was a question of law.
under the doctrine of qualified immunity,government officials performing discretionary functions are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.heggen lee,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.qualified immunity involves a inquiry.saucier katz,d.first,the court must ask whether,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the official conduct violated a constitutional right id.at.if the party asserting the injury was deprived of his constitutional rights,then the court must go on to ask whether that right was clearly established.the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable official that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.
plaintiff claims arise under.in order to establish a violation of,plaintiff must show that defendants deprived him of his rights secured by the constitution while acting under color of state law.see waters city of morristown,cir.since the supreme court issued its opinion in elrod burns,d,patronage dismissals,dismissals for failure to support a particular party or candidate have been,in general,unconstitutional.caudill,at.this rule represents the outcome of the supreme court application of the strict scrutiny required by the first amendment to the interests promoted by the party patronage system.see mccloud,at.allowing the government to deny a benefit to an individual because that individual exercised his first amendment rights presents two principal dangers.first,the inevitable tendency of a system of party patronage is to coerce employees into compromising their true political beliefs.branti finkel,d.the second danger,which is related to the first,is that the denial of a government benefit on account of a person political beliefs is in effect a penalty for holding those beliefs permitting the state to impose such a penalty would constitute an unconstitutional condition that would allow the state to indirectly interfere with an employee constitutional rights in a manner that it could not accomplish directly.id.at.see also perry sindermann,d e ven though a person has no right to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons,there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely.
despite the costs of patronage dismissals,the court in elrod recognized that party affiliation may be an acceptable requirement for some types of government employment.branti,at.while these positions have been referred to as policymaking or confidential,whether those labels appropriately fit the position under consideration is not the ultimate inquiry.id.at.instead,the test is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.id.in answering this question,the court looks not to the position as it was performed by the terminated employee,but instead to the inherent duties of the position,and to the duties that the new holder of that position is expected to perform.faughender city of olmsted,cir.
the first step in analyzing a claim of patronage dismissal requires asking whether the party asserting that he was wrongfully terminated has produced sufficient evidence for a jury to find that he was discharged because of his political beliefs or affiliations.caudill,at.if the terminated party makes this showing,then the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the terminated party job was one for which political affiliation was an appropriate requirement.id.
defendants first argue that,as the recreation director,plaintiff served at the pleasure of the city council and could be dismissed for good cause,bad cause,or no cause at all.defendants br.at quoting shelby delta air lines,aff,cir.this contention can be dismissed out of hand.the supreme court squarely rejected this argument in truck service city of northlake the court has rejected for decades now the proposition that a public employee has no right to a government job and so can not complain that termination violates first amendment rights a state may not condition public employment on an employee exercise of his or her first amendment rights,d see also id.at.government officials may indeed terminate relationships without cause but it does not follow that this discretion can be exercised to impose conditions on expressing,or not expressing,specific political views.if plaintiff can demonstrate that he was terminated on account of his political beliefs,then the fact that he was an employee who could have been terminated for other permissible reasons is irrelevant to the ultimate question of defendants liability.
plaintiff has produced sufficient facts to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether his termination was politically motivated.plaintiff alleges that defendant jennings threatened him in an attempt to convince plaintiff to cease supporting lobertini in the mayoral election.plaintiff also contends that defendant jennings stated in a workshop before the city council that his recommendation to terminate plaintiff was political.the temporal proximity between defendant jennings assumption of power and plaintiff termination also bolsters plaintiff allegations.defendant jennings became the mayor on december,and plaintiff was terminated on january.plaintiff has created a genuine issue of fact as to defendants motives for terminating him it is therefore immaterial that plaintiff was an employee.
for the first time at oral argument,defendants fannon and hatmaker argued that,even if the record contained evidence that defendant jennings terminated plaintiff for political reasons,summary judgment should be granted in favor of defendants fannon and hatmaker because plaintiff has not produced evidence that their decision to terminate plaintiff arose from a motive to retaliate against him for his political activity.as an initial matter,we note that defendants fannon and hatmaker have waived this argument by not including it in their brief.see dillery city of sandusky,cir.
in any event,plaintiff has produced sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment.plaintiff allegation that defendant jennings stated in a workshop before the city council that the recommendation to terminate plaintiff was political implies that defendants fannon and hatmaker,whose votes were necessary in order to terminate plaintiff,were aware of defendant jennings opinion that plaintiff should be terminated for his political beliefs.at.plaintiff also alleges that defendants fannon and hatmaker voted to terminate plaintiff from his position as recreation director due to plaintiff political beliefs and association.at.moreover,defendant hatmaker states that i t has been the custom,practice and policy of the city council of lafollette to replace renew all department heads after each city election at,defendant fannon contends that w hen the new administration began new department heads or cabinet level individuals were selected who would best serve the city council in promoting,coordinating,and assisting to formulate and implement the policies for the city government.at.while certainly not conclusive,these statements each suggest that political considerations were the impetus for plaintiff termination,a fact which,if true,strengthens plaintiff claim that he was terminated on account of his political beliefs.these facts suffice to allow a reasonable jury to find that defendants hatmaker and fannon voted to terminate plaintiff in retaliation for protected first amendment conduct.
the closer question in this appeal is whether defendants have carried their burden of demonstrating that recreation director is a position for which political party affiliation is an appropriate consideration.see branti,at.we conclude that,on the record before us,factual disputes prevent us from resolving this question as a matter of law.the nub of the problem is that the record discloses neither the inherent duties of the recreation director,nor the duties of the position as envisioned by defendants.see faughender,at.
in his affidavit,plaintiff baldly asserts that his position was not a policy making position he claims that he did not make any policy or have discretion implementing the policies set by the mayor and city council,advise the council on policies,or assist the city council in formulating or have discretion in implementing the policies for the recreation department.at.standing alone,plaintiff conclusory allegations,which provide no guidance as to what the recreation director actually does,might not carry significant weight.but plaintiff allegations do not stand alone his position is reinforced by the city charter and the employee handbook.
under the doctrine announced in rice ohio department of transportation,the legislature decision as to whether a particular job should be classified as political or nonpolitical is at least entitled to some deference,cir quoting jimenez fuentes torres gaztambide,cir en banc.here,the st
