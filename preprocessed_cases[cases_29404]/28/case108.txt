plaintiffs,a group of minor political parties and minor party nominees for office challenged the constitutionality of section of the pennsylvania election code.stat.b,as applied to minor political parties and their candidates.they moved for a preliminary injunction against pedro cortes,secretary of the commonwealth of pennsylvania.the district court denied the motion and plaintiffs appealed.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
under pennsylvania law,a political body is qualified as a political party when one of its candidates obtains a level of support in the preceding general election.specifically.stat.a defines a political party as 
any party or political body,one of whose candidates at the general election next preceding the primary polled in each of at least ten counties of the state not less than two per centum of the largest entire vote cast in each of said counties for any elected candidate,and polled a total vote in the state equal to at least two per centum of the largest entire vote cast in the state for any elected candidate,is hereby declared to be a political party within the state.
pennsylvania law further distinguishes between political parties major political parties and minor political parties.minor political parties are political parties with registered membership of less than of the registration for all political parties 
political parties,at present the republican and democrat parties,place their candidates on the general election ballot via a primary system.stat.to appear on the ballot for the primary election,the republican and democrat candidates must get a prescribed number of signatures from individuals who are members of their respective parties.for example,a candidate for governor must obtain signatures.the winner of a plurality of votes in the primary is placed on the general election ballot as the candidate of his or her respective party.
minor political parties,as well as political bodies not recognized as parties,place their candidates,and independent candidates place their names,on the general election ballot by nomination petitions.stat.to be placed on the general election ballot by a nomination petition,the candidate must obtain the signatures of a prescribed number of registered voters regardless of party.the number of signatures must be equal to of the vote total of the candidate who obtained the highest number of votes for office in the previous election 
candidates have approximately five months to circulate nomination petitions.for the november general election,petitions can be circulated from march,until august.a signatory must be a qualified elector of pennsylvania who has registered to vote either on or before the day he signs the nomination petition.a signatory need not be a member of a political party.a signatory may sign a minor party candidate nomination petition even if he has signed a nomination petition in support of a republican or democrat or voted in a major party primary,but a signatory may sign a nomination petition in support of only one candidate for each office for which there is a vacancy.
unfortunately for minor political parties,political bodies and independent candidates,bob casey,soundly defeated his challenger for state treasurer in in the biggest voter turnout in pennsylvania history.consequently,the largest entire vote cast for any elected candidate in the state at large is larger this cycle than in previous election years,based on casey high total.as such,of that total,the number of required signatures,is,compared to previous years in which the number generally ranged between and 
plaintiffs are challenging the constitutionality,as applied to minor political parties,of the variable threshold requirement of b for a candidate to be placed on the general election ballot.the feature which distinguishes plaintiffs argument from previous attacks on b is that plaintiffs are challenging the combination of a precondition to qualify as a political party and b signature requirement that a minor political party must obtain in order for its candidates to be placed on the general election ballot.plaintiffs contend that,having shown the voter support in the previous election,they have shown their necessary modicum of support and should not have to petition to place candidates on the ballot.
plaintiffs brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to on the grounds that b violates both the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution and the minor political parties right of freedom of association under the first amendment.for relief,plaintiffs have asked the district court to enter an order allowing their parties nominees to be placed on the general election ballot if they obtain the same number of signatures that candidates for the republican and democrat parties need to be placed on the primary ballot.alternatively,plaintiffs have proposed other schemes to allow minor political party candidates to be placed on the general election ballot after demonstrating a lesser level of support.plaintiffs also urge that minor political parties ought not to be subject to any signature requirement in light of the fact that they have already qualified as a political party.
the parties jointly stipulated to the applicable facts.on april,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction on the ground that b was constitutional.at the same time,the district court strongly urged the pennsylvania general assembly to reconsider the threshold in light of the signatures needed this cycle.this timely and expedited appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction under a noting that the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from interlocutory orders of the district courts of the united states granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.
ordinarily,we use a standard to review a district court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction.child evangelism fellowship of new jersey,stafford twp.sch,cir.the district court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,the district court conclusions of law are evaluated under a plenary standard,and the ultimate decision to grant the preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion id.
the test for preliminary relief is a familiar one.a party seeking a preliminary injunction must show that it has a likelihood of success on the merits,it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied,granting preliminary relief will not result in even greater harm to the nonmoving party,and the public interest favors such relief.id.quoting kos,andrx,cir.generally,a panel entertaining a preliminary injunction appeal decides only whether the district court abused its discretion in ruling on the request for relief and does not go into the merits any further than necessary to determine whether the moving party established a likelihood of success.id.here,however,we are not required to take this narrow approach because the appeal from the denial of the preliminary injunction presents a question of law the facts are either established or of no controlling relevance.id.in such a case,we may decide the merits of the claim.id.
iii.discussion 
a.the district court decision 
in denying plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction,the district court found that b did not impose a severe burden upon the plaintiffs constitutional rights.consequently,the court applied the familiar rational basis test to the statute to determine its constitutionality.as to the burden to minor political parties,the district court noted that the threshold of actual votes cast for a candidate was lower than the threshold of eligible voters upheld after rational basis review by the supreme court in jenness fortson,d.also,the district court observed that minor political parties may obtain the needed signatures from the entire population of registered voters in pennsylvania regardless of the voters party affiliation and that,otherwise,the nomination papers process is not overly burdensome.see generally storer brown,d remanding to the district court to determine the burden on meeting the signature requirement while laying out a list of relevant factors for the district court consideration.next,the district court found that pennsylvania interests in decreasing ballot clutter and ensuring that only viable candidates are placed on the general election ballot justified the threshold found in b and the corresponding burdens on minor political parties rights.
in addition,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs equal protection claim that the plaintiffs had based on the difference in treatment between minor political parties and major,republican and democrat,political parties.the district court noted that,in jenness,the supreme court held that there are legitimate reasons for states to treat minor and major party candidates differently.at.furthermore,the district court opined that pennsylvania law actually treats major party candidates more harshly than their minor party colleagues by requiring major party candidates to poll a plurality of their party votes to be placed on the general election ballot,which in all likelihood is a higher absolute number than the signature requirement for minor party candidates.for these reasons,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.
anderson and the levels of scrutiny 
at oral argument before us,the parties were questioned about the applicable level of scrutiny and whether anderson celebrezze,d,annuls,or otherwise changes,the familiar strict scrutiny,intermediate scrutiny,and rational basis classifications as applied to ballot access cases.first,we note that this court,as well as others,has been unclear whether the anderson balancing test applies to ballot access claims brought under the equal protection clause,given that anderson is a first amendment case.see belitskus pizzingrilli,cir.we clarify here that the anderson test is the proper method for analyzing such equal protection claims due to their relationship to the associational rights found in the first amendment.in belitskus,we observed that we could not see any basis for refusing to so apply anderson.see also reform party of allegheny allegheny.dep of elections,cir assuming that burdens require the same level of scrutiny in an equal protection analysis that they do in an associational rights analysis.likewise,our sister circuits have applied anderson to similar claims under the equal protection clause.see,fulani krivanek,cir republican party of arkansas faulkner,cir in election cases,equal protection challenges essentially constitute a branch of the associational rights tree.as such,we conclude that anderson sets out the proper method for balancing both associational and equal protection concerns and the burdens that the challenged law creates on these protections as weighed against the proffered state interests.
what then is the import of anderson on the traditional three tiers of scrutiny although we appreciate that the strict scrutiny,intermediate scrutiny,and rational basis categories represent a convenient and familiar linguistic device by which courts,including our court have characterized their review under anderson,we note that anderson promulgated a less categorical system of classification.see burdick takushi,d noting that the full court agreed in anderson that a more flexible standard applies.put another way,ballot access cases should not be pegged into the three aforementioned categories.rather,following anderson,our scrutiny is a weighing process we consider what burden is placed on the rights which plaintiffs seek to assert and then we balance that burden against the precise interests identified by the state and the extent to which these interests require that plaintiffs rights be burdened.only after weighing these factors can we decide whether the challenged statute is unconstitutional.anderson,at.consequently,we will look at the nature of the rights involved here and the burdens imposed by pennsylvania election law on minor political parties in order to determine if the burden is justified.
equal protection 
ballot access is recognized as an important aspect of voting rights.see bullock carter,d laws that affect candidates always have at least some theoretical,correlative effect on voters.nevertheless,using the standard,not every limitation or incidental burden on the exercise of voting rights is subject to a stringent standard of review.id.citing mcdonald board of election,d.we interpret this standard to mean that the right to ballot access,although important in both first amendment and equal protection contexts,may be limited in accord with appropriate state interests,and that limitations imposed in furtherance of such interests need not be the most narrowly drawn as long as they are nondiscriminatory and reasonable in light of the relevant burdens.see anderson,at.t he state important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions.
the state interests here are avoiding ballot clutter and ensuring viable candidates.these interests have long been recognized as valid ones.see jenness,at.the burden is the signature requirement.this burden is not unreasonable.in light of the more obtrusive law upheld in jenness,it is beyond dispute that pennsylvania signature requirement for ballot access is facially valid.the patriot party of mitchell,perry grant,two percent is not an inherently unreasonable or unduly burdensome signature requirement.indeed,plaintiffs do not seriously contest the facial validity of the state proffered legitimate ballot clutter and ensuring viable candidates.see generally munro socialist workers party,d noting that states do not have to prove actual ballot overcrowding.furthermore,in storer the supreme court noted that gathering signatures in days would not appear to be an impossible burden.at.here,the burden on minor parties is significantly less,both in terms of the number of signatures and the time allowed to obtain them.also,the fluctuations in the total do not present constitutional issues.perry.at the fact that the total number of signatures required fluctuates with election results does not render it unconstitutional.
given that courts have held that signature requirements at a percentage rate even greater than the number involved here are reasonable,and in view of the acknowledged state interest in imposing this burden,we conclude that b is not unconstitutionally burdensome on its face.moreover,weighing the nature of the right involved and the burden imposed,the state is not limited in imposing this burden to the least restrictive methods of doing so.
this conclusion,however,is not the end of the analysis.see the patriot party of.at noting that the supreme court has on two separate occasions invalidated facially valid ballot access laws because of their application to a political party.in this regard,plaintiffs contend that the level of support that minor political parties must have previously demonstrated to be labeled a political party pursuant to a is a sufficient modicum of support to fulfill any of the state legitimate interests.see jenness,at.in effect,plaintiffs are arguing that the combination of the level of voter support requirement for minor party status in a plus the signature requirement necessitated by b combine to form a constitutional violation.in making this argument,the plaintiffs rely heavily on a maryland case,decided under maryland law,that found that a similar arrangement violated the equal protection guarantees found in article of the maryland declaration of rights.see maryland green party maryland bd.of elections,despite maryland green party,however,plaintiffs argument fails.
although plaintiffs point to the distinction in ballot access between the major political parties,which place their candidates on the ballot via a primary,and minor political parties,which have to use the nomination petition system,they do not seriously challenge this distinction,and under jenness,alternate ballot access rules for major a
