california council,cplc challenges certain provisions of california political reform act pra,including the pra definition of contribution and the recipient committee requirements imposed on a organization,such as cplc.on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees collectively referred to as california and denied cplc motion for summary judgment.because strict scrutiny applies and cplc conceded the existence of a compelling governmental interest in the disclosure of the information at issue,we focus on the narrow tailoring inquiry,concluding that the definition of contribution is narrowly tailored,and the additional recipient committee requirements are not.
background 
cplc,a corporation under c,is a nonpartisan,nonsectarian,educational organization dedicated to educating the public on abortion,infanticide,and euthanasia.cplc is the state affiliate of the national right to life committee nrlc,one of the nation most powerful lobbying and interests groups.according to cplc,its major purpose is not the nomination or election of candidates or the passage or defeat of ballot measures,but rather to educate californians regarding the value of life.in keeping with its expressed purpose,cplc periodically generates mass mailings,ranging from to in excess of in number.
the purpose of the pra is to inform voters of the identity of individuals organizations who expend money in support of or in opposition to ballot measures.the information collected pursuant to pra disclosure requirements is accessible to the public via the secretary of state website.in,there were documented hits on this site,in documented hits,and in documented hits.
cplc filed a amended verified complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,alleging that particular provisions of the pra violate the first and fourteenth amendments.because cplc disseminated voter guides before the primary and general elections and the primary election,expending in excess of,it would be deemed a recipient committee under the act.although it would like to provide similar information to the general public in the future,as long as the pra remains in effect,cplc asserts that it will refrain,due to the requirements imposed upon a recipient committee and the consequent penalties for failure to comply.
counts communications,measures,regarding candidates,regarding ballot measures,and facial challenge were dismissed by the district court.counts vagueness and vagueness were also dismissed to the extent that they were directed at regulation of communications involving candidates and mere discussion of ballot measure initiatives.the counts were not dismissed to the extent they were directed at express ballot measure advocacy.thereafter,the parties stipulated to the dismissal without prejudice of counts major purpose,major purpose,and major purpose,all claims relating to state regulation of groups as committees without regard to their major purpose.
in,we remanded this case to the district court to determine whether california informational interest is sufficiently compelling to justify its regulation of groups like cplc and,if so,whether the pra regulations are closely tailored to advance this interest.california council,getman,cir.although we noted a lack of clarity regarding the appropriate level of scrutiny,we applied strict scrutiny.id.at.
upon remand,the district court concluded that the regulatory scheme imposed on cplc and groups like cplc who engage in express ballot measure advocacy is the least restrictive means available for california to achieve its compelling interest in fully informing voters and preventing organizations from disguising their involvement in express ballot measure advocacy.cplc filed a timely appeal.
although we agree with the district court that strict scrutiny applies and that the definition of contribution is narrowly tailored,we hold that the additional recipient committee requirements are not.
ii.standard of review 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.qwest communications,city of berkeley,cir citation omitted.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.olsen idaho state bd.of medicine,cir citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
for purposes of summary judgment,cplc can not rely on factual presuppositions.
cplc argued to the district court that the factual framework for th e remand is that provided by the panel decision in getman.this argument raised several issues whether cplc was relieved of its duty to present evidence if not,whether cplc presented sufficient admissible evidence to raise an issue of material fact if cplc failed to present sufficient evidence,whether its failure to do so is fatal to its appeal whether a district court is bound by the remand instructions from an appellate court and in the context of a motion under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure frcp,whether the district court was bound by the factual underpinnings of the remand order.
cplc was not relieved of its duty to present evidence.
contrary to cplc position that it could rely on factual presuppositions of the prior panel decision,the getman panel noted that a more fully developed record was needed to resolve the compelling interest and narrowly tailored inquiries.see at.the panel decision in no way relieved cplc of its duty to present evidence to support its summary judgment motion or to challenge california motion.
cplc failed to present sufficient admissible evidence to raise an issue of material fact.
cplc contends that its amended verified complaint qualifies as an affidavit for summary judgment purposes we disagree.
a verified complaint may serve as an affidavit for purposes of summary judgment if it is based on personal knowledge and if it sets forth the requisite facts with specificity.moran selig,cir citation omitted emphasis added.the verified complaint in this case was signed by brian johnston,the executive director of cplc.during his deposition,johnston lack of personal knowledge regarding cplc was apparent.a series of questions was asked regarding cplc political action committees pacs and johnston responded that he did not know to nearly every inquiry.his knowledge regarding how cplc funds are spent was also scant.as could be expected in view of johnston lack of personal knowledge,the verified complaint was impermissibly heavy on legal conclusions and light on facts relevant to the summary judgment motion.lew kona hospital,cir,as amended.
cplc failure to present sufficient evidence to raise an issue of material fact is not fatal to its appeal.
even though we conclude that cplc failed to present sufficient admissible evidence in support of its motion for summary judgment or in opposition to california motion for summary judgment to raise a material question of fact,this determination is not dispositive.we must still determine whether the undisputed facts entitle california to summary judgment as a matter of law.see tellis godinez,cir.this leads us to an examination of the remand order.
a district court is bound to follow the instructions of an appellate court upon remand.
a district court,on remand,has a duty to follow this court instructions as to how the case is to proceed.united states montgomery,cir citation omitted.c lear direction to the district court on how to proceed continues to be binding precedent operating engineers pension trust charles minor equip.rental,cir.
the district court was bound by the getman panel instructions on remand,the district court should determine whether california informational interest is sufficiently compelling to justify its regulation of groups like cplc and,if so,whether the pra regulations are closely tailored to advance this interest.getman,at.the getman panel described cplc as a group whose major purpose is not campaign advocacy,but who occasionally make s independent expenditures.id.at citation omitted.
in the specific context of a frcp b motion,no factual determinations were made that would bind the district court on remand.
in reviewing a motion to dismiss under frcp b we assume all facts alleged in the complaint are true sacks office of foreign assets control,cir citation omitted.because of the assumption that all facts in the complaint are true,there is no need for judicial factfinding.see frcp a findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions under rule.indeed,the court is not faced with any factual issue.adams united states,cir.as the getman panel was not faced with any factual issues,its passing statement regarding cplc major purpose could not reasonably be construed as making a factual determination 
therefore,although cplc had a duty to present evidence,its failure to present relevant admissible evidence is not fatal to its appeal because we must still consider whether the undisputed facts entitled california to summary judgment as a matter of law.moreover,because in a motion to dismiss under frcp b,we assume all facts to be true,the district court was not bound by our passing statement regarding cplc major purpose.
strict scrutiny applies in this case 
this case was remanded to the district court for application of strict scrutiny to its analysis of the pra.see getman,at.nonetheless,because mcconnell federal election commission,d,was decided subsequent to the getman remand,the parties dispute the applicable standard 
as noted,we are bound to apply strict scrutiny.see getman,at selecting the strict scrutiny standard.because neither the mcconnell decision nor the supreme court recent decision in wrl,d,called into question the analysis reflected in federal election commission massachusetts citizens for life,mcfl,d,upon which we relied in getman we are not compelled to abandon the standard adopted in getman.see hart massanari,cir once a panel resolves an issue in a precedential opinion,the matter is deemed resolved,unless overruled by the supreme court.footnote reference omitted.
applying strict scrutiny,california bears the burden of proving that the pra provisions at issue are narrowly tailored,to serve a compelling state interest.republican party of minnesota white,d citation omitted 
california has a compelling interest in requiring disclosure of contributions to groups who seek to influence voters.
cplc concedes that california has a compelling interest in regulating true contributions gifts to groups like cplc that are made for the purpose of influencing voters.cplc makes a distinction between true contributions and mere donations,which cplc contends are not made for the purpose of influencing voters.citing to mcconnell,at,cplc argues that for california t o justify its required disclosure of mere donations,california had the burden of proving that donations are the functional equivalent of contributions.however,cplc framing of the issue is unsupported by governing law.
california seeks disclosure of contributions of or more.see california government code cgc f.thus,the appropriate inquiry is whether the pra definition of contributions impermissibly classifies donations that were not made for the purpose of influencing voters as contributions.
cplc functional equivalent argument is unavailing.california does not attempt to extend coverage of the disclosure requirements to donations unless the donee expends funds to influence voters.therefore,california does not have to establish that donations are the functional equivalent of contributions.mcconnell,at.concluding that issue advocacy that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy may fall within the statute provisions see also wrl.at,addressing the issue of whether the speech at issue is the functional equivalent of speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office,or instead a genuine issue ad and reiterating the holding in mcconnell citation and alteration omitted.rather,we must determine whether the statute is narrowly tailored to advance california compelling interest in disclosure of those groups who seek to influence voters 
cplc challenge to the narrow tailoring of the statute is valid as to the reporting requirements but not as to the other provisions.
cplc posits that california presumption,described in california code of regulations,tit.ccr b,transmogrifies donations into contributions and thus is not narrowly tailored to california compelling interest in disclosure of information to the electorate and,the resulting recipient committee requirements are not narrowly tailored 
the pra provisions contain three alternatives to determine if disclosure requirements are triggered 
the pra stated purpose is to ensure that r eceipts and expenditures in election campaigns are fully and truthfully disclosed in order that the voters may be fully informed and improper practices may be inhibited.cgc a.
pursuant to cgc,a committee subject to disclosure requirements may be formed in three ways.first,a recipient committee forms if any person or combination of persons receives contributions totaling or more in a calendar year.a.second,an independent expenditure committee forms if any person or combination of persons makes independent expenditures totaling or more in a calendar year b.third,a major donor committee forms if any person or combination of persons makes contributions totaling or more in a calendar year to or at the behest of candidates or committees.c.
pursuant to cgc 
independent expenditure means an expenditure made by any person in connection with a communication which expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate or the qualification,passage or defeat of a clearly identified measure,or taken as a whole and in context,unambiguously urges a particular result in an election but which is not made to or at the behest of the affected candidate or committee.
under cgc a,contribution is a term of art which means a payment,a forgiveness of a loan,a payment of a loan by a third party,or an enforceable promise to make a payment except to the extent that full and adequate consideration is received,unless it is clear from the surrounding circumstances that it is not made for political purposes.emphases added.ccr a defines a contribution as any payment made for political purposes for which full and adequate consideration is not made to the donor 
the pra considers a payment to be made for political purposes if it is f or the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence the action of the voters for or against the nomination or election of a candidate or candidates,or the qualification or passage of any measure ccr a.ccr b further defines contribution to include 
any payment made to a person or organization other than a candidate or committee,when,at the time of making the payment,the donor knows or has reason to know that the payment,or funds with which the payment will be commingled,will be used to make contributions or expenditures.if the donor knows or has reason to know that only part of the payment will be used to make contributions or expenditures,the payment shall be apportioned on a reasonable basis in order to determine the amount of the contribution.
emphases added.this section further presumes that 
the donor does not have reason to know that all or part of the payment will be used to make expenditures or contributions,unless the person or organization has made expenditures or contributions of at least one thousand dollars in the aggregate during the calendar year in which the payment occurs,or any of the immediately preceding four calendar years.
this presumption contained in ccr b is known as the one bite or first bite of the apple rule.according to the california fair political practices commission,once an organization makes expenditures or contributions of at least,this is considered the first bite.california fair political practices commission,diane fishburn advice letter no.fishburn advice letter at june.for the remainder of the year after the or more contribution expenditure and the following four years,any donor to the organization would presumably know or have reason to know that funds with which the donations will be commingled may be used for political purposes.id.thus,
i f a subsequent contribution or expenditure of or more is made by the organization during the applicable period current year plus following years,the organization becomes a recipient committee,and any donations or membership fees it receives after the first bite contribution or expenditure of or more has been taken,are deemed to have been received for political purposes,and the sources of any funds used by the organizations to make those contributions would be subject to disclosure on a reasonably apportioned basis.
id.emphasis added 
within ten days after a person or group of persons qualifies as a recipient committee,a statement of organization must be filed.cgc a see also,describing the contents of the statement of organization.the committee must have a treasurer.it shall be the duty of each candidate,treasurer,and elected officer to maintain detailed accounts,records,bills,and receipts necessary to prepare campaign statements,to establish that campaign statements were properly filed,and to otherwise comply with the provisions of this chapter.a recipient committee must file statements,a.
the required contents of a campaign statement are listed in f.in pertinent part,subsection f requires 
if the cumulative amount of contributions including loans received from a person is one hundred dollars or more and a contribution or loan has been received from that person during the period covered by the campaign statement,all of the following must be reported 
his or her full name.
his or her street address.
his or her occupation.
the name of his or her employer,or if,the name of the business.
the date and amount received for each contribution received during the period covered by the campaign statement and if the contribution is a loan,the interest rate for the loan.
the cumulative amount of contributions.
f.to determine whether a particular donor or member contribution was or more for any given calendar year,a amount may be used for reporting purposes 
according to carla wardlow,chief of the technical assistance division of the california fair political practices commission,d uring years,cplc may be required to file up to four campaign reports two reports prior to the primary election and two reports prior to the general election,if the committee makes contributions or independent expenditures totaling or more during the period covered by the statement.cgc specifies the time for filing statements.for example,pursuant to b,statements for the november election should be filed no later than october.for those contributions received after the applicable date,a committee like cplc would have to file a late contribution form,a.however,according to wardlow,most campaign disclosure reports are required only when cplc engages in campaign activity.if cplc has no activity,only two reports are required each statements affirming that cplc is conducting no campaign activity 
thereafter,if a recipient committee wishes to terminate,it must file a notice of its termination pursuant to cgc.by terminating,the committee insure s that it will have no activity which must be disclosed.
california satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the definition of contribution is narrowly tailored to advance its compelling governmental interest in disclosure of groups who seek to influence voters.
in determining whether legislation is narrowly tailored,we consider whether the restriction promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation,and does not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate interests.kuba agriculural ass n,cir quoting ward rock against racism,d alteration and internal quotation marks omitted 
a.other methods of defining what payments must be disclosed do not advance california informational interest.
cplc argues that california compelling interest only justifies the disclosure of those payments that are expressly made for political purposes for which full and adequate consideration is not made to the donor,ccr a.california counters that 
by simply discouraging donors from earmarking their donations for expenditures on express campaign advocacy or by commingling earmarked contributions with other funds,any group could escape classification as a recipient committee under cgc section a,and thereby avoid the duty to disclose its contributors regardless of the size of the contribution or the level of its political activity.
supreme court precedent supports a definition of contribution broader than that advocated by cplc.in mcfl,at,the court upheld the disclosure requirements in c.in that statute,contribution was defined as any gift or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office.a i emphasis added.the court did not question the constitutionality of these disclosure provisions,what is meant by to influence elections or when the corporation will know that there is a contribution.the fact that california has more explicitly defined contribution does not weaken its legislation.garza county of los angeles,cir noting that while more frequent apportionment was not constitutionally required,it would be constitutionally permissible,and even practically desirable internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in addition to a pure earmarking system,california considered the system applicable to pacs,under which all receipts are reported as contributions.california noted that such a system is more restrictive and more burdensome than the current reporting requirements of the pra.consideration of alternatives and selection of a less burdensome alternative that furthers california compelling interest supports a conclusion of narrow tailoring.kuba,at considering alternatives in assessing narrow tailoring.
section b presumption,used to identify those payments that qualify as contributions,is permissible 
citing to riley federation of the blind,d,and virginia black,d,cplc postulates that california presumption violates the first amendment.it also urges us to conclude that presumptions can not be applied to it,because it is not a pac.cplc argument fails because both cases it relies on are distinguishable.
in riley,at,the supreme court considered the constitutionality of a north carolina statute in which a fee to a professional fundraiser exceeding wa s presumed unreasonable,but the fundraiser could rebut the presumption the court stated that using percentages to decide the legality of the fundraiser fee is not narrowly tailored to the state interest in preventing fraud.id.at.
in black,at,the supreme court considered the constitutionality of a virginia statute providing that burning of a cross shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate a person or group of persons.citation omitted.the provision was held to be unconstitutional because it would create an unacceptable risk of the suppression of ideas.id.at.citation omitted.t he provision chills constitutionally protected political speech because of the possibility that the commonwealth will potentially engaging only in lawful political speech at the core of what the first amendment is designed to protect.id.
in both cases,the supreme court was concerned with the chilling of speech.although cplc implies that california presumption may cause a group to give up its right to express itself to avoid designation as a recipient committee,there is no evidence in the record suggesting that such a chilling effect has occurred 
contrary to cplc contentions,the record reflects that the presumption in b is rebuttable,thus providing flexibility for a group like cplc to adopt a reasonable method for identifying donors who are on notice of the existence of qualifying contributions 
cgc a defines contribution as a payment unless it is clear from the surrounding circumstances that the payment is not made for a political purpose.emphasis added.additionally,ccr b specifies that when a donor has reason to know that its donation may be used for political purposes,the recipient committee may apportion the payment on a reasonable basis in order to determine the amount of the contribution.thus,in the event that a donation was made during a calendar year but before cplc made the expenditure that would put donors on notice,cplc would not have to disclose those donations,because it is not reasonable to assume the donors had notice of the potential use of their donations for political purposes.pursuant to cgc,the circumstances would convey that the donation was not meant to be a contribution.cplc represents that a presumption based on what the payee has done made expenditures or contributions of or more during the lookback period,not what the payor knows,that is applied even where the payor knows nothing of the payee activity is not narrowly tailored to an interest in the disclosure of gifts made for the purpose of influencing voters.this argument is unpersuasive because it is based on an erroneous interpretation of the pra provisions.as discussed above,the presumption is rebuttable.to the extent it can be shown that the donor had no knowledge of the organization activities,then the organization need not disclose the donation.in addition,according to cgc,if it is clear from the surrounding circumstances that the donor did not intend for the donations to be for the purpose of influencing voters,no disclosure is required.
cplc asserts that california scheme is also underinclusive and thus not narrowly tailored.according to cplc,california considers donors to be on some level of constructive notice after a group makes an initial expenditure during the current calendar year or the previous four calendar years but asserts no interest in disclosure during this period.for example,because the reachback period is only for the calendar year,it would not reach a large donation on december of the prior year,even if the second,triggering independent expenditure occurs on the following day on january of the present year.however,cplc itself demonstrates why its argument does not establish underinclusiveness,recognizing that of course,if that gift on december of the prior year were really made for the purpose of influencing voters,it would already be captured as a disclosable true contribution and the recipient group would properly be a recipient committee.thus,the scheme is not underinclusive because to the extent that the hypothetical payment on december were made for the purpose of influencing voters,it would be necessarily disclosed.
accordingly,we conclude that the presumption in b is narrowly tailored.to be narrowly tailored,a statute need not be the least restrictive means of furthering the government interests,but the restriction may not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further the interests.menotti city of seattle,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.california has demonstrated why other alternatives fail to advance its compelling informational interest.moreover,as interpreted by california,b does not burden substantially more speech than necessary and serves to advance the compelling informational interest.see arizona right to life political action committee bayless,cir in determining whether a statute is narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest,we look to the fit between the state regulation and the stated purposes.citation omitted.
and the articulated exception for organizations with other funds further demonstrate that the definition of contribution is narrowly tailored.
a recipient committee is only required to disclose those contributions that on a basis are or more.according to california,advances its compelling governmental interest because t he greater the organization political involvement and the greater the size of the contribution,the greater the disclosure.
cplc counters that the is not narrowly tailored because the larger a group receipts,the smaller the chance that a donation will be disclosed as a contribution.contrary to this assertion,the approach actually demonstrates california attempt to narrow the statute and capture only those payments made for the purpose of influencing voters,because a donation is disclosed only to the extent that the donee corporation participates in ballot measure advocacy.
cplc asserts that there is a resulting underinclusiveness because the same donation made to two groups with the same lack of any communicated purpose to influence voters would be disclosable as a prorated contribution if made to one but not the other.cplc explains that the california scheme permits the group to first count any proceeds it has from sales toward the expenditure,so if a group has offsetting proceeds from sales it does not need to report any contributions.however,this challenge is based on a misinterpretation of how the pra provisions operate.in fact,the provision applies only if the organization contributions or expenditures are made solely from that source fishburn advice letter,at explaining that this provision addresses circumstances where an organization has sufficient income from sources other than donations or membership dues and its contributions or expenditures are made solely from that source emphasis added.
california examined alternatives and reasonably determined that the alternatives do not advance its compelling interest or were more restrictive.additionally,cplc failed to establish that the presumption was impermissibly overinclusive or underinclusive.therefore,the pra disclosure provisions meet the narrowly tailored requirement.
california has not satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the political action requirements imposed on a group like cplc are narrowly tailored to california compelling informational interest.
in addition to requiring disclosure of contributions,the pra imposes political action requirements on a group like cplc,a organization.california makes two primary arguments in support of these requirements.first,the constitution permits california to require cplc to form and use a pac for its political activities,treating all its donations as contributions.second,cplc is not the kind of organization exempted from reporting obligations under the teaching of mcfl.
california arguments ignore the distinction between candidate and ballot measure elections.instead,california relies on its observation that the federal counterpart to the pra has required all groups organized in corporate form,including corporations,to channel express campaign advocacy through pacs,to which all donations are,of course,contributions.the following language in mcconnell is specified in support of this proposition 
since our decision in buckley,congress power to prohibit corporations and unions from using funds in their treasuries to finance advertisements expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates in federal elections has been firmly embedded in our law.the ability to form and administer separate segregated funds authorized by feca has provided corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy.that has been this court unanimous view,and it is not challenged in this litigation.
id.citing mcconnell,at.citation and footnote reference omitted emphasis added.however,california reliance on mcconnell and its interpretation of the federal statute are both mistaken.
mcconnell supports the required use of a separate segregated fund when the organization is expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates at.emphasis added.the reasoning of mcconnell extends no further.see also mcfl,at.interpreting to cover expenditures made directly to candidates as well as on behalf of candidates.this reading is further supported by the language of a making it unlawful for any corporation to make a contribution or expenditure in connection with any election to any political office,or in connection with any primary election held to select candidates for any political office a emphasis added.contribution is defined as any gift,subscription,loan,advance,or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office.a i emphasis added.expenditure is defined as any purchase,payment,distribution,loan,advance,deposit,or gift of money or anything of value,made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office.a i emphasis added.federal office is defined as the office of president or vice president,or of senator or representative in,or delegate or resident commissioner to,the congress.thus,the requirement of a separate segregated fund pursuant to appears to only be in the context of contributions or expenditures to or on behalf of candidates.
california citation to bellotti does not salvage its argument.in bellotti,at,the supreme court considered a state criminal statute that for bade certain expenditures by banks and business corporations for the purpose of influencing the vote on referendum proposals the court held the statute to be unconstitutional,noting t he risk of corruption perceived in cases involving candidate elections,simply is not present in a popular vote on a public issue.id.at.citations and footnote reference omitted.california contends that t he statute at issue in bellotti did not provide corporations with the pac option that buckley found to be a constitutionally sufficient opportunity for corporations wishing to engage in political speech.california asks us to conclude that the supreme court would have upheld the statute reviewed in bellotti had such an option existed.however,the court decision simply does not support that conclusion.
the weakness of california first argument undermines its second argument.based on the fact that mcconnell recognized an exception from the requirement for corporations,see mcconnell,at,california contends that because cplc does not qualify as an corporation,it is not entitled to an exemption from requirements that it disclose the sources of money actually spent on ballot measure advocacy.however,as discussed above,it is not at all certain that the supreme court would apply the same criteria to ballot measure advocacy as it did when election of candidates was involved.
in addition to these two primary arguments,california presented testimony demonstrating that a group such as cplc could form a pac to simplify reporting.however,the court in mcfl discounted that fact in analyzing the disclosure requirements.see at and.
california also argues that the reporting,registration,and notice requirements imposed on cplc or groups like cplc are necessary and reasonable,because the burdens enumerated by cplc have all been upheld by the supreme court and could constitutionally be imposed on cplc by california.however,this argument is again unpersuasive because mcconnell dealt solely with disclosures in the candidate context.see at.
in mcfl,the federal election commission argued that the inapplicability of to mcfl would open the door to massive,undisclosed political spending by similar entities,and to their use as conduits for undisclosed spending by business corporations and unions.mcfl,at.the court responded that it s aw no such danger.even if is inapplicable,an independent expenditure of as little as by mcfl will trigger the disclosure provisions of c.id.these reporting obligations provide precisely the information necessary to monitor mcfl independent spending activity and its receipt of contributions.the state interest in disclosure therefore can be met in a manner less restrictive than imposing the full panoply of regulations that accompany status as a political committee under the act.see also bellotti,at.invalidating a massachusetts statute that restricted corporations from contributing to ballot measure referenda.
cplc has failed to establish overbreadth.
to prevail on its overbreadth challenge,cplc must demonstrate that the overbreadth of the statute is not only real,but substantial as well,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.broadrick,at.
cplc argues that the reason to know presumption contained in ccr b is irrebuttable and thus overbroad.cplc contends that i f a donor makes a gift to a group like cplc for the earmarked purpose of building a new office and the transmogrifying presumption engages,there is no exception in the pra regulations that permits the group to exclude that gift from being considered a prorated contribution california insists that it was made for the purpose of influencing voters.this argument fails because as discussed above,the presumption may be rebutted.see cgc a,ccr b.
cplc also asserts that its associational rights are violated.in naacp alabama,d,the supreme court invalidated compelled disclosure of membership in an organization because the naacp made an uncontroverted showing that on past occasions revelation of the identity of its members has exposed these members to economic reprisal,loss of employment,threat of physical coercion,and other manifestations of public hostility.the court in mcconnell clarified that for compelled disclosure to be unconstitutional as in naacp,the evidence must demonstrate a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of a party contributors names will subject them to threats,harassment or reprisals from either government officials or private parties.mcconnell,at.citation omitted.cplc made no such showing.
thus,california has met its burden of demonstrating that the definition of contribution is narrowly tailored to its compelling informational interest,and cplc may be required to disclose contributions,as defined by the pra.
conclusion 
we hold that california has demonstrated the existence of a compelling governmental interest and that the pra definition of contribution is narrowly tailored to promote its compelling informational interest.however,california has failed to demonstrate how the additional political requirements are narrowly tailored to advance its compelling governmental interest.
