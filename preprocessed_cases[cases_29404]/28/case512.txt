as part of a program intended to ensure the integrity of california elections,debra bowen,in her official capacity as the california secretary of state the secretary,decertified and then immediately recertified a number of voting systems in use throughout the state.as a condition of recertification,the secretary imposed a comprehensive system of postelection manual ballot tallying on local elections officials.in this appeal,we consider a challenge raised by plaintiffs county of san diego and deborah seiler,in her official capacity as registrar of voters for the county of san diego,and interveners the counties of kern,riverside and san bernardino collectively,the counties to these requirements the counties contend that the secretary does not have the authority to impose the tallying requirements and that even if the secretary does possess such authority,she was required,but failed,to act pursuant to the mandates of the administrative procedures act the apa.
as we explain below,we disagree with the counties on the question of the secretary authority to issue the ballot tallying requirements.we agree,however that the secretary issuance of the requirements was subject to the apa.consequently,regardless of the wisdom of,or necessity for,the postelection manual ballot tallying requirements,they are void under california law due to the secretary failure to adhere to the procedures set forth in the apa.
in,the secretary retained the university of california and a team of computer security experts to evaluate the security,reliability and accessibility of voting systems approved for use in california.upon completion of this review,on august,the secretary withdrew her approval of the voting systems studied by the review team,including certain diebold,sequoia and hart intercivic voting systems.the secretary simultaneously issued a conditional reapproval of each of the voting systems that set forth approximately preconditions to their use.
one of the conditions common to each of the reapprovals indicated that the secretary would impose,and the counties would be required to follow,manual count auditing requirements,in addition to those already required by statute the conditional reapprovals were amended on october,with the postelection manual count condition revised to state this point more precisely elections officials must comply with requirements as set forth by the secretary of state in the document entitled manual tally requirements and any successor document.that same day,the secretary issued a document entitled manual tally requirements the pemt.
the pemt sets forth a fairly comprehensive postelection manual tally procedure.of particular importance to this appeal,the pemt requires that i elections officials shall conduct a manual tally of of randomly selected precincts for any contest where the margin of victory is less than one half of one percent ii in contests that span multiple jurisdictions,statewide contests,if the margin of victory within a given jurisdiction is more than,but the overall margin is less than,then each jurisdiction involved in the contest shall conduct a manual tally of of the precincts in which voters cast ballots for that contest in the jurisdiction and iii the tallies must be completed within the canvass period established by elections code and.see defining official canvass,defining semifinal official canvass.
on december,the county of san diego and deborah seiler,in her official capacity as the registrar of voters for the county of san diego county of san diego,filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court,asking the court to void the pemt.county of san diego argued that the secretary had overstepped her statutory authority in issuing the pemt and that,even if she possessed the authority to issue the pemt,she could only do so pursuant to the apa.in january,the parties stipulated to permitting the counties of kern,riverside and san bernardino to intervene in the case.
on january,the trial court denied the counties request for relief.the court concluded that the secretary had acted within her legislatively delegated authority in issuing the challenged requirements,and that because the pemt did not constitute a regulation,the secretary was not required to comply with the apa.the counties appeal 
discussion 
the counties challenge the secretary issuance of the pemt on two separate and independent grounds.first,the counties contend that the secretary exceeded her statutory authority by imposing the ballot tallying requirements contained in the pemt.second,the counties argue that the pemt is invalid because it is a regulation that was not adopted in accordance with the apa.we address each of these arguments separately below.
the issuance of the pemt is within the secretary statutory authority 
the counties first contend that the pemt is void as a matter of law because the secretary lacks authority to enact postelection manual tally requirements.more specifically,they argue that because the legislature already has established postelection tallying requirements,the secretary lacks any authority to enlarge the scope of the existing manual tally.
the counties argument touches on two separate limitations on agency action.first,agency action must be within the scope of authority conferred by the legislature,and can not be inconsistent with its authorizing statutes,see agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,agnew it is well established that the rulemaking power of an administrative agency does not permit the agency to exceed the scope of authority conferred on the agency by the legislature ontario community foundations,state bd.of equalization cal d,there is no agency discretion to promulgate a regulation which is inconsistent with the governing statute.second,even if an agency action is consistent with its authorizing statutes,the action may still be deemed void if it conflicts with another statute.agricultural labor relations bd.superior court cal d,agricultural labor relations bd.administrative regulations that violate acts of the legislature are void see also tolman underhill cal d,regulation may also be invalid where it attempts to impose additional requirements in a field which is fully occupied by statute.
thus our analysis has two parts.first,we must determine whether the secretary issuance of the pemt falls within the authority granted to her by the legislature.if,as we will conclude,the legislature did grant the secretary sufficient statutory authority to issue the pemt,we must then evaluate whether the exercise of that authority in the instant case conflicts with existing statutory manual tallying requirements 
a.the legislature broad delegation of authority to regulate voting systems includes the authority to condition voting system use on postelection tallies 
the first question we address is the secretary statutory authority to issue the pemt tallying requirements.
our analysis begins with the sweeping grant of authority provided by the legislature to the secretary with respect to the conduct of elections generally.government code section states in part the secretary of state is the chief elections officer of the state,and shall administer the provisions of the elections code.the secretary of state shall see that elections are efficiently conducted and that state election laws are enforced.the secretary also is empowered by this provision to adopt regulations to assure the uniform application and administration of state election laws.ibid.
of particular relevance to the instant appeal,there also are numerous statutory provisions that grant the secretary specific authority over the use of voting systems.elections code section provides that n o voting system,in whole or in part,shall be used unless it has received the approval of the secretary of state,subd.a see also,subd.b no jurisdiction may purchase or contract for a voting system,in whole or in part,unless it has received the approval of the secretary of state.section states that the secretary shall study and adopt regulations governing the use of voting machines,voting devices,and vote tabulating devices.section provides 
the secretary of state shall establish the specifications for and the regulations governing voting machines,voting devices,vote tabulating devices,and any software used for each,including the programs and procedures for vote tabulating and testing.the criteria for establishing the specifications and regulations shall include,but not be limited to,the following 
a the machine or device and its software shall be suitable for the purpose for which it is intended.
b the system shall preserve the secrecy of the ballot.
c the system shall be safe from fraud or manipulation.
the secretary also is directed to review voting systems periodically to determine if they are defective,obsolete,or otherwise unacceptable and may withdraw his or her approval previously granted under this chapter of any voting system or part of a voting system should it be defective or prove unacceptable after such review.
given the broad delegation of powers described above,it can not seriously be disputed that the secretary possesses sufficient statutory authority to issue the pemt.
at a minimum,the secretary broad authority to approve voting systems,and to establish the specifications for and the regulations governing voting devices and the procedures for vote tabulating and testing,includes the authority to condition approval of the use of particular voting machines on certain procedural safeguards,including a postelection manual tally.this is all that the secretary has done in issuing the pemt 
b.the pemt does not conflict with section 
the counties largely recognize that,standing alone,the legislative authority described in the preceding section would authorize issuance of the pemt.they contend,however,that the pemt is invalid because it conflicts with existing statutes,primarily the statewide percent manual postelection tally already required by the legislature in section 
section directs that during the official canvass of every election in which a voting system is used,the official conducting the election shall conduct a public manual tally of the ballots tabulated by those devices,including vote by mail voters ballots,cast in percent of the precincts chosen at random by the elections official,subd.a.
the counties argue that section represents a legislative policy declaration that postelection manual tallying of percent of the precincts is both necessary and sufficient to ensure the accuracy of the vote.consequently,they contend,the secretary regulations countermand or,at least,vary the terms of section by imposing additional manual tallying requirements.the counties further assert that the secretary actions have significant consequences because postelection tallying is time and labor intensive and imposes substantial financial costs.
as we have noted,a dministrative regulations that violate acts of the legislature are void.agricultural labor relations,supra,cal d at.the counties,however,overstate this prohibition with repeated assertions that the secretary could not enhance the statutory postelection manual tally requirements because a state agency may not increase,enlarge or vary the terms of a statute.the applicable limitation on agency action is not nearly as sweeping as the counties suggest.
the authority of an agency to alter or enhance the scope of existing statutory law is primarily a question of legislative intent.the legislature may delegate authority to an agency to,by regulation,enhance or alter existing statutory pronouncements.agency regulations that result are not void,but rather constitute an indirect manifestation of legislative intent.see,agricultural labor relations,supra,cal d at,upholding agency regulation that created an exception to the criminal trespass statute.as explained by our supreme court,t he legislature can surely accomplish indirectly that which it could do directly.ibid.if the legislature can thus depart from its existing dispositions on a given topic,it can authorize an administrative agency to do so on its behalf.
thus,the question in this appeal is not whether the pemt enlarges or varies the existing tally requirements imposed by section.rather,it is whether,in issuing it,th secretary exceeded her statutory authority.agricultural labor relations,supra,cal d at,an administrative agency may not usurp the legislative function.
to answer this question we first turn to the text of section.allen,supra,cal th at,d,statutory language is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.section appears on its face solely to be concerned with assuring the accuracy of the vote,not with limiting unnecessary vote tallying.indeed,the explicit intent of section,as expressed in a companion statute,is to verify the accuracy of the automated count.the statute does not state that elections officials should manually tally no more than or only percent of the precincts similarly,it does not state that it will be sufficient to tally percent of the precincts.rather the statute simply provides that local elections officials must perform a percent tally in every election as the statute does not appear to impose any limit on tallying,there is,contrary to the counties contention,no facial conflict between section and the pemt 
in addition,related statutory provisions provide abundant support for the secretary issuance of manual tallying requirements that enhance the existing statutory framework.people jefferson cal th,d,recognizing the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part as a valid indicator of legislative intent.these provisions discussed below demonstrate a legislative awareness that the secretary might condition voting system use on procedural requirements including tallying requirements that were more exacting than those already imposed by statute,and evidence a legislative intent to authorize such enhanced requirements.agricultural labor relations,supra,cal d at,legislature can implicitly authorize agency to enact regulations that alter existing statutory framework.
section states,in no uncertain terms,that if there is any conflict between the provisions in division and other provision s of this code relating to the same subject matter,the provisions of division shall be controlling.the secretary authority to issue regulations governing voting systems such as those contained in the pemt is contained in division of the elections code.the official canvass requirements imposed by section are contained in other provision s of the elections code,division.consequently,the statute expresses a legislative intent to permit a regulation promulgated under division to alter or enhance other elections code provisions,and to preclude courts from invalidating such a regulation on the basis of a challenge such as that raised here.see agricultural labor relations,supra,cal d at,relying on analogous provision in permitting agency regulation that altered scope of statute george arakelian farms,agricultural labor relations bd.cal d,explaining that i f there is any conflict between code of civil procedure section and the regulations of the board,the latter prevail due to provision granting precedence to statutory section authorizing issuance of regulations.
the legislative intent with regard to any discrepancy between section and the secretary regulation of voting systems is made even clearer in section.that section states in part elections officials shall adopt semifinal official and official canvass procedures to conform to the applicable voting system procedures that have been approved by the secretary of state.section is part of official canvass procedures imposed on local elections officials.see during the official canvass of every election in which a voting system is used the official canvass includes the performance of the manual tally of percent of all precincts.the pemt percent tally requirements imposed as a condition of the use of certain voting systems constitute a voting system procedure approved by the secretary of state.allen,supra,cal th at,d,courts look to the usual and ordinary meaning of statutory text and the plain meaning of the language governs defining v oting system as any mechanical,electromechanical,or electronic system and its software,or any combination of these used to cast or tabulate votes,or both.consequently,the import of section is plain.in the event of any inconsistency,local elections officials implementation of section must conform to the requirements of the secretary voting system regulations issued under division of the elections code,the requirements contained in the pemt.this enactment,like section,demonstrates that the legislature granted the secretary authority to enhance existing canvass procedures,and intended that the secretary regulations,if otherwise authorized,would not be invalidated on the ground that they altered this existing statutory framework 
the counties acknowledge that under sections and,local elections officials must adopt procedures for the official canvass during which the manual tally occurs,and those procedures must conform to other procedures approved by the secretary of state.they contend,however,that the secretary authority to approve use procedures is different from the authority to impose a new substantive standard the characterization given by the counties to the pemt we are unconvinced by this argument.the pemt requirement that local elections officials manually count a certain percentage of ballots in close elections to ensure the accuracy of specified voting systems fits comfortably within the usual and ordinary meaning allen,supra,cal th at,d,of the term procedure,a particular way of doing or going about the accomplishment of something.webster new internat.dict.consequently,the plain meaning of the language governs,and the counties argument that the postelection tally requirements is somehow not a procedure fails.allen,at,d.
apart from the arguments noted above,the counties muster little authority to counter the express statutory pronouncements of legislative intent in sections,and.they rely primarily on a statement in the legislative counsel digest concerning a amendment to section the statute itself dates back over three decades that implies some recognition on the legislature part as to the costs of manual tallying this proves little.
we can readily accept that the legislature understood that increasing election tallying requirements imposes financial costs although,in point of fact,the secretary has directed that the costs of the pemt be borne by voting system vendors.nevertheless,this understanding sheds no light on whether the legislature intended by enacting section in to preclude the imposition of any additional costs even when,in the secretary opinion,such costs are necessary to ensure an accurate election tally for particular voting systems.the legislative history cited by the counties adds nothing to the analysis.
in sum,there is nothing in the statute or the extrinsic aids to statutory interpretation to suggest that the legislature intended section to constitute a limitation on postelection manual tallies.to the contrary,there is abundant evidence of the legislature intent to grant the secretary broad authority to impose conditions on the use of voting systems,including conditions such as a manual tally that alter the existing postelection canvass requirements.further,to the extent any conflict exists between voting system regulations issued by the secretary and section,the legislative intent is equally clear.the secretary prevails.
the counties similar argument that the pemt is void because it is tantamount to an order directing a recount is equally unconvincing.while recounts are specifically provided for under existing statutory law,there is nothing in the pemt that undermines or conflicts with those statutory recount procedures,et further,the legislature has expressed an intent that the secretary participate not only in adopting regulations for each voting system approved for use in the state but also in specifying the procedures for recounting ballots using those voting systems,italics added.thus,as with the postelection manual tally in section,there is no conflict between the pemt and the statutory recount procedures.even if the pemt can be viewed as imposing additional recount procedures,the legislature has expressly authorized such action in section 
the pemt is a regulation 
the counties argue in the alternative that even if the secretary possessed statutory authority to issue the pemt,she was required,but failed,to follow the requirements of the apa in doing so.we conclude that this argument is meritorious.
the government code provides that no state agency shall issue,utilize,enforce,or attempt to enforce any guideline,criterion,bulletin,manual,instruction,order,standard of general application,or other rule,which is a regulation as defined in section,unless it does so pursuant to the apa,subd.a.the requisite procedures under the apa include providing public notice of the proposed regulatory action issuing a complete text of the proposed regulation with a statement of the reasons for it granting interested parties an opportunity to comment on the proposed regulation responding in writing to public comments and forwarding a file of all materials on which the agency relied in the regulatory process to the office of administrative law,which reviews the regulation for consistency with the law,clarity and necessity.morning star state bd.of equalization cal th,d,morning star.the apa includes an exception and streamlined procedure for enacting an emergency regulation.it is undisputed that in issuing the pemt,the secretary did not follow the requirements of the apa,or issue the tallying requirements as an emergency regulation.consequently the dispositive question for this appeal is whether the pemt is a regulation.
the apa defines regulation very broadly.tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d,tidewater.
regulation means every rule,regulation,order,or standard of general application or the amendment,supplement,or revision of any rule,regulation,order,or standard adopted by any state agency to implement,interpret,or make specific the law enforced or administered by it,or to govern its procedure.
whether an agency action constitutes a regulation is a question of law that we review de novo.grier kizer d.
our supreme court in tidewater identified two principal identifying characteristics that distinguish regulations from other agency proclamations.tidewater,supra,cal th at,d.first,a regulation must be intended to apply generally,rather than in a specific case.see also winzler kelly department of industrial relations d.winzler kelly.second,a regulation must implement,interpret,or make specific the law enforced or administered by the agency,or govern the agency procedure.tidewater,at,d,quoting former,subd.g,now.
the secretary contends that the pemt fails to satisfy either of the two prongs of the tidewater test.first,she argues that the pemt is not a standard of general application because it does not apply to every voting system in use in california.specifically,the secretary contends that there are three counties lake,madera and sonoma that use voting systems that do not trigger the pemt requirements,and two other jurisdictions los angeles and san francisco that are covered by additional,more stringent,manual tallying requirements 
we find the secretary argument on this point unconvincing.while there may be a few exceptions to the pemt broad coverage,a rule need not apply universally to satisfy the first tidewater prong a rule applies generally so long as it declares how a certain class of cases will be decided.tidewater,supra,cal th at,d,roth department of veterans affairs d.the word general means pertaining to all of the members of a class,kind,or order.here,the pemt establishes a rule that decides a class of cases tidewater,at,d,by mandating that the vast majority of counties,by virtue of their use of the most common voting systems,comply with specific postelection manual tally requirements.in effect,the pemt mandates a comprehensive and virtually uniform scheme of manual ballot tallying throughout california.such a scheme applies generally,rather than in a specific case.ibid.
further,the counties dispute,with some force,the contention that the pemt does not,in fact,apply universally.the two jurisdictions los angeles and san francisco that the secretary contends are covered by more stringent requirements than the pemt appear,at least at the present time,to also be subject to the pemt.thus,only the counties of lake,madera and sonoma appear to be exempt from the pemt requirements,and the counties assert,without dissent from the secretary,that these counties make up only percent of the state voting population.finally,the pemt appears to place certain manual tallying requirements on even those three counties.in any election that is decided by less than percent of the votes cast,the pemt purports to require all counties,regardless of the voting system in place,to engage in a percent manual recount 
in sum,given the pemt establishment of essentially uniform statewide tallying requirements,the document meets the threshold for a standard of general application,rather than a pronouncement of the agency conclusion as to a specific case.tidewater,supra,cal th at,d,morning star,supra,cal th at,d,concluding that department of toxic substances control unwritten determination that all companies with or more employees use or conduct activities related to hazardous materials was a regulation,as it applied generally,rather than in a specific case.
we recognize,as the secretary emphasizes,that the pemt grew out of an individualized review of specific voting systems.these origins,however,can not change the ultimate effect and impact of the pemt.winzler kelly,supra,d at.the pemt,through incorporation into various voting system reapprovals and by its own terms,constitutes a broad statement of policy applicable to local elections officials throughout the state.ibid.whether the action of a state agency constitutes a regulation does not depend on the designation of the action,but rather on its effect and impact on the public.such a pronouncement of policy is indistinguishable from an announcement by the secretary that all counties excepting three henceforth must follow the manual tallying procedures contained in the that would indisputably constitute a standard of general application.
having determined that the pemt has sufficient general applicability to satisfy the first prong of the tidewater test,we turn to the second prong.for a rule to constitute a regulation under the second prong,the rule must implement,interpret,or make specific the law enforced or administered by the agency,or govern the agency procedure.tidewater,supra,cal th at,d,quoting former,subd.g,now.this requirement is easily satisfied here.
the pemt makes concrete various provisions of the elections code that authorize the secretary to act primarily through the adoption of regulations to ensure the reliability of electronic voting systems.the secretary argues,and we agree,that her authority to issue the pemt requirements is found directly in elections code sections,and,as well as within other areas of the elections code these cited sections,however,do not specify any particular tallying requirements.consequently,it can hardly be disputed that the pemt make s specific the law enforced by the agency.tidewater,supra,cal th at,d.
the secretary disagrees that tidewater second prong is satisfied,arguing somewhat obtusely that the pemt requirements were issued pursuant to the secretary of state direct authority to act.italics in original.the contention,while relevant to the argument we addressed in part i ante,has no significance here.it is not the case,and the secretary cites no authority for the proposition,that an agency can avoid the requirements of the apa by establishing that it issued a regulation pursuant to its direct authority to act.indeed,if the agency lacked the authority to act,there would be no issue as to whether the agency should have proceeded under the apa,as its promulgation would be invalid on other grounds.
the sole authority cited by the secretary to support its contention that the pemt fails tidewater second prong is a federal district court opinion.in that opinion,a district court ruled that the secretary of state decertification of certain voting systems was not a regulation under the apa.american of people with disabilities shelley d,aapd declining to issue an injunction to directives of the secretary of state that decertified and withdrew approval of the use of certain direct recording electronic dre voting systems.the aapd decision is not binding as it was rendered by a federal court and is,as noted below,easily distinguished.howard contracting,macdonald construction th,d federal decisional authority is neither binding nor controlling in matters involving state law.
we would readily accept that the decertification of particular voting systems based on concerns about their reliability as in aapd,supra,d would not constitute a regulation under the apa.see tidewater,supra,cal th at,d,interpretations that arise in the course of adjudication are not regulations,though they may be persuasive as precedents in similar subsequent cases,subd.i a regulation that is directed to a specifically named person or to a group of persons and does not apply generally throughout the state.decertification,however,is a far cry from the sweeping manual tally rules established by the pemt.the pemt is not a simple decertification,or even a recertification of a particular voting system with conditions.rather,the pemt is a document that,as a condition of use of virtually all types of voting machines employed in the state,requires local elections officials to comply with uniform postelection manual tally procedures.this type of agency pronouncement,unlike the decertification of a specific voting system,falls squarely within the definition of a regulation under california law.
in sum,the pemt satisfies both prongs of the definition of a regulation under california law.the secretary does not contend that she is otherwise exempted from the requirements of the apa,or that she satisfied those requirements.consequently,the pemt is void,morning star,supra,cal th at,d,recognizing that where both indicia of a regulation exist,the department should have complied with the apa,unless an exception applies.the trial court ruling to the contrary is,therefore,erroneous,and we reverse.

the statutory constraints on an agency ability to adopt regulations apply with equal force to more informal agency action because a n agency may not exceed the limits of its authority by adopting and enforcing a policy which would not be permitted as a formally adopted regulation.agnew,supra,cal th at,d.
as our high court has explained the doctrine has been most frequently invoked to strike down administrative regulations in conflict with the statute which created the agency or which the agency is authorized to administer.citations.but the principle is equally applicable when the regulation contravenes a provision of a different statute.agricultural labor relations,supra,cal d at.
there is often a third part of the analysis.agency action pursuant to legislativ
