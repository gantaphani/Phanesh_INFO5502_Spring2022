the plaintiff is the sponsor of a petition to recall a michigan state legislator from office.in june,michigan secretary of state terri lynn land,invoking the provisions of,declared that the plaintiff had not obtained the required number of votes to put the recall issue on the ballot.the plaintiff then filed this civil rights action asserting that violated the first amendment.she also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction ordering secretary land to the recall petitions without applying the challenged state statute.representative andrew dillon,the subject of the recall petition,was permitted to intervene,as were wayne county clerk cathy garrett and the wayne county election latter two being responsible for the final preparation of the ballot in the state legislative district represented by dillon.
on august,the district court granted a preliminary injunction directing secretary land to the submitted petitions without applying,and,if she found that the plaintiff had submitted sufficient signatures,to certify the recall initiative for placement on the november general election ballot.secretary land and the intervenors hereinafter collectively referred to as the appellants filed notices of appeal and moved this court for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal.this court denied those motions in an order of september.secretary land subsequently completed her of the submitted petitions and certified the recall initiative for placement on the general election ballot.that ballot has now been prepared and sent to the printers.
in light of the above developments,the plaintiff now moves for the dismissal of all three appeals on the ground of mootness.the plaintiff argues that secretary land has fulfilled all of the obligations required of her under the preliminary injunction,that her actions are irrevocable,and that this court can no longer render relief in the immediate appeals.the appellants oppose such dismissal by arguing that this court could still award relief to them through the november election and until such time as the ballots are tabulated and certified as final.the wayne county intervenors also argue that there is still time to inform voters that the recall initiative has been removed from the ballot or to program scanning equipment not to count any votes cast on the recall initiative.
all parties agree that the specific steps required by the preliminary injunction have been completed and that those steps can not be undone at this time.the concerns expressed by our dissenting colleague appear to us to fall outside the scope of the preliminary injunction,which we do not view as revocable simply because the future course of the litigation could alter its effects.dismissal of these appeals,of course,does not render moot the underlying district court litigation.should there be a dispute as to further steps in the election process that were not addressed in the preliminary injunction,the parties are free to seek interim relief in the district court.should the district court enter further orders or a judgment in the action pending before it,an adversely affected party or parties may seek further review in this court as permitted by the normal appellate process.
furthermore,the appellants argument that their appeals are not moot is based solely on the possibility that this court may render,before the date of the general election,an opinion that will negate the preliminary injunction entered by the district court.this hypothetical opinion would presumably require the appellants to take measures affecting the voting process or the tabulation of votes such that the recall vote would have no effect.the appellants,however,have thus far sought only a stay of the preliminary remedy this court denied in its order of september.they did not seek reconsideration of that order and did not move for expedited consideration of their appeals or request expedited briefing schedules.as a result,the briefing necessary for full appellate review in this matter will not have been completed until well after the general election has taken place and the votes tabulated.what may be possible in theory does not conform to the realities of the situation before us.we therefore conclude that the pending appeals are moot.
it therefore is ordered that the motions to dismiss are granted.
just three weeks ago,this court resorted to legal technicalities to deny appellants emergency motions seeking to stay the district court preliminary injunction.in my opinion,that decision improperly deprived representative dillon and secretary of state land of their right to have their claims considered on the merits.today,the court adopts that same approach,and in doing so once again improperly deprives the litigants,and indeed the citizenry of the state of michigan,of a forum for the proper consideration of these important issues.
according to the majority,these appeals are now moot because appellants have not yet requested expedited consideration of their appeals and thus their opposition to the present motion rests merely on the possibility that this court may render,before the date of the general election,an opinion that will negate the preliminary injunction entered by the district court.in other words,the majority finds these appeals moot because,absent expedited consideration,the normal course of briefing provided for in rule will not be completed before the election.but that can not be the legal test for determining mootness.mootness is a jurisdictional question that serves to define the reach of the federal courts.mootness thus turns on the nature of the claims presented and whether the courts can offer meaningful relief to the parties,not on guesswork regarding what course briefing may take in a case.this court jurisdiction to hear an appeal certainly does not turn on whether the briefing schedule provided for in rule can be followed.
contrary to the characterization of the majority,appellants are not arguing that it is the possibility that this court may issue an opinion before the november election that defeats mootness here,but rather the capability of this court to still render meaningful relief up until that time.at this point,the court simply does not know whether appellants will seek expedited briefing or choose to pursue other legal maneuvers to have their claims considered before the election.but what we do know is that appellants papers make clear that meaningful relief may still be had up until the election has occurred and the results have been finalized.until such time as meaningful relief is no longer available,dismissing these appeals as moot would be premature.at a minimum,the court should either request further briefing on the availability and practicality of alternative relief,or at least advise appellants that the court is inclined to dismiss the appeals unless expedited briefing is requested immediately.
because the majority dismissal order is predicated on an overly narrow understanding of the mootness doctrine and apparent guesswork regarding the future course of briefing,i respectfully must dissent.
representative andrew dillon represents the house district in the michigan house of representatives.he also is the speaker of the house.rose bogaert is a resident of the house district.on october,representative dillon voted in favor of an increase in the state income tax and to extend the state sales tax to certain services.based on this vote,plaintiff initiated a campaign to recall representative dillon.

based on her review of the submitted signatures,and after considering representative dillon various challenges,the secretary concluded that the petition was support by only valid signatures less than the number required to place the recall on the ballot,and thus rejected the petition on june.in particular,the secretary determined that signatures were invalid under because they were collected by petition circulators who were not registered to vote in the district specifically,the secretary determined that circulators were not registered to vote in the district and other circulators registered sometime after they began collecting signatures.plaintiff claims that her own signature in support of the recall petition was among the signatures rejected by the secretary under.
one day later,on june,plaintiff filed an emergency motion in the michigan court of appeals seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the secretary to reexamine the petition signatures she found facially invalid under.in an order issued on june,the michigan court of appeals denied without comment plaintiff mandamus motion.plaintiff immediately sought leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court.on june,the michigan supreme court denied plaintiff application for leave to appeal,stating only that the court was not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this court.bogaert sec y of state.on june,the michigan supreme court issued a second order again denying leave to appeal and reiterating that the court was not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this court.bogaert sec y of state.
with the state courts having washed their hands of the issue,plaintiff filed the instant action on july,in the united states district court for the western district of michigan.plaintiff moved pursuant to for a preliminary injunction to compel terri lynn land,in her official capacity as the michigan secretary of state,to reexamine the contested signatures and to certify all signatures that she determined to be otherwise valid.plaintiff motion rested primarily on the claim that violates the first amendment.representative dillon moved to intervene,as did wayne county clerk cathy garrett and the wayne county election commission collectively the wayne county intervenors.without awaiting a response from plaintiff,the district court granted the motions for intervention.bogaert land,wl.jul.
after receiving full briefing from the parties,the district court held a hearing and permitted argument on july.after that hearing,the district court informed the parties that it would accept supplemental briefing on the issue.the parties submitted supplemental briefs two weeks later.on august,the district court granted plaintiff a preliminary injunction based on its conclusion that likely violated the first amendment.bogaert land,d,wl.the injunction ordered the secretary to reexamine the signatures at issue,and to certify any of those signatures that were not invalid for other reasons.id.at,at.because the secretary previously determined that of the signatures submitted by plaintiff in support of the recall petition were valid,the district court order obviously held the potential to require the secretary to reinstate more than the additional signatures necessary to place the special recall election on the november ballot.
on august,representative dillon filed an emergency rule b motion for reconsideration challenging the court conclusions.representative dillon motion also raised a due process claim challenging whether the contested signatures could be reexamined without also permitting him time to make additional challenges to their validity under a.the secretary then moved in the district court to stay the injunction,but only if the district court grant ed in whole or in part representative dillon motion for reconsideration.on august,the district court denied representative dillon b motion,holding that michigan law does not guarantee that state representatives will be given a second opportunity to challenge recall petitions.bogaert land,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.having denied representative dillon motion for reconsideration,the district court dismissed the secretary conditional motion to stay as moot.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
on august,the secretary filed a notice of appeal to this court.on september,representative dillon also filed a notice of appeal.neither party,however,moved for expedited consideration.instead,representative dillon and the secretary filed separate emergency motions in this court seeking to stay the preliminary injunction.significantly,however,neither the secretary nor representative dillon first moved in the district court for a stay of the injunction.on september,despite the extraordinary circumstances of this case and the fact that the secretary motion specifically explained why moving in the district court first would have been impracticable,this court,over my objection,denied the motions for failure to comply with rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure.
a week later,plaintiff filed the instant motion seeking to dismiss the pending interlocutory appeals as moot on the grounds that the secretary now has fully complied with the terms of the district court preliminary injunction order and,critically,that the secretary actions are irrevocable the secretary and the wayne county intervenors oppose the motion to dismiss,arguing that the effect of the secretary certification is not irrevocable until the election is completed and the results are tabulated and certified.
shortly after the district court denied representative dillon b motion and the secretary conditional motion to stay the injunction,the secretary began the reexamination of the previously stricken recall petition signatures.on september,the secretary of state director of elections informed representative dillon that the reexamination had been completed and that the secretary had determined that of the contested signatures were deemed valid.adding these signatures to the total,the secretary concluded that the recall petition is supported by valid signatures,more than necessary to place the recall on the november ballot.pursuant to,the secretary declared that the recall petition was supported by sufficient signatures,and thus directed that the special recall election of representative dillon be placed on the november ballot.
