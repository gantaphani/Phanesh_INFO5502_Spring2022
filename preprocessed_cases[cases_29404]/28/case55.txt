opinion en banc 
in february,the rhode island legislature adopted a redistricting plan in response to the census and a state constitutional amendment reducing the number of seats in both houses.based on the allegations in the complaint,it appears that are about percent of rhode island population,but more than half live in providence.prior to redistricting,state senate district in providence was percent and percent hispanic.until redistricting,an,charles walton,had represented district for many years.
under the redistricting plan,much of the same african american population now lies within the new district,which allegedly is percent and percent hispanic.in the primary after redistricting,a latino challenger defeated walton and went on to win the election.well before the primary,in may,a number of individual voters and related organizations brought the present suit under section of the voting rights act,to challenge the redistricting plan.
in september,the district court granted a motion under.b to dismiss the complaint,metts almond,d,holding that the claim failed two of the three threshold tests for a section case under thornburg gingles,d.on appeal,a divided panel of this court reversed,remanding for further proceedings.metts murphy,wl cir.
we granted the defendants petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel opinion.metts murphy.lexis cir.we now review and vacate the district court judgment of dismissal and remand for further proceedings.the reason for our remand is to allow a fuller development of the evidence,and further legal analysis based on that evidence,before any final determination is made.
section,adopted as part of the voting rights act of,forbids measures that deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race or color.under a amendment,a violation is established if,based on the totality of circumstances,it is shown that members of a class of citizens have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.b.
the delphic language of the amendment can be understood only against the background of its legislative history and subsequent supreme court interpretation.the former tells us that discriminatory intent is not a necessary element in a violation and that congress intended a broad range of factors to be taken into account.these points,and the relevant citations,are developed in gingles,the first decision on section by the court and still the leading authority.at.
however,gingles was primarily concerned with the use of districts,which have an obvious potential to submerge the electoral power of even a substantial and cohesive minority bloc.at nn.if such a group represents a majority of votes in a single member district but a numerical minority when combined with an adjoining district or districts,the combining of those districts into one district can easily eliminate the minority ability to elect one of their own to any of the seats.
in gingles,the supreme court set up a test,ruling that section would ordinarily not be violated by districts unless three conditions were met that the minority challenging such a district would be a majority in a compact single member district that the minority was politically cohesive so it would bloc vote in such a district and that the majority voted as a bloc so it would usually defeat the minority candidate in a district.gingles,at.if satisfied,these preconditions would not end the case but would raise a presumption of a violation.vecinos de barrio uno city of holyoke,cir see also johnson degrandy,d gingles preconditions necessary but not sufficient to establish claim.
gingles was directed to a particular the court suggested was particularly problematic,at.growe emison,d,and the decision did not purport to offer a general or exclusive gloss on section for all situations,gingles,at.but the concreteness of the gingles test,set against the vagueness of the statute and plethora of criteria,has made it a focus in subsequent cases dealing with quite different problems.indeed,the supreme court has said several times that gingles applies to vote dilution claims directed against single member districts,see,voinovich quilter,d growe,at,but it has effectively qualified this statement in two different ways.
first,several supreme court opinions after gingles have offered the prospect,or at least clearly reserved the possibility,that gingles first a racial minority must be able to constitute a majority in a extend to a group that was a numerical minority but had predictable support from other groups.degrandy,at.voinovich,at.t he first gingles precondition,the requirement that the group be sufficiently large to constitute a majority in a single district,would have to be modified or eliminated when analyzing the claim we assume,arguendo,to be actionable today.further,the court has so far reserved judgment on a question whether dilution of a minority racial group influence,as opposed to the power to elect,could violate section position that would require substantial modification of gingles majority precondition.growe,at.vecinos de barrio uno,at.
second,where single member districts are at in our have increasingly emphasized the,inquiry that congress intended for section claims.voinovich,at.of course,the gingles factors can not be applied mechanically and without regard to the nature of the claim.degrandy,at.same.to say that gingles applies as a precondition to section liability may not tell one very much if gingles itself is no longer to be mechanically applied.gingles was in its original incarnation a mechanical evaluation for a particular problem,so its rationale is not easily adapted by lower courts to a different set of problems.
the present case concerns not districts but a redrawing of district boundaries.in one key district this has produced a modest in the proportionate sizes of the two large minority a readjustment that certainly can affect who wins the election.so far the parties argument has been about whether and how to squeeze this case into the gingles difficult questions about whether the majority requirement in gingles is a numerical majority or an effective majority that could be constructed out of votes how rigidly the gingles preconditions apply when moving away from districts and how to apply gingles when no racial group makes up more than percent of the district.
it is no accident that most cases under section have been decided on summary judgment or after a verdict,and not on a motion to dismiss.this caution is especially apt where,as here,we are dealing with a major variant not addressed in gingles single member one with a relatively unusual history.as courts get more experience dealing with these cases and the rules firm up,it may be more feasible to dismiss weaker cases on the pleadings,but in the case before us we think that the plaintiffs are entitled to an opportunity to develop evidence before the merits are resolved.
we are thus unwilling at the complaint stage to foreclose the possibility that a section claim can ever be made out where the population of a single member district is reduced in redistricting legislation from to percent.yes,one would ordinarily expect the consequences to be small,but not always,and arguably not here based on past history.at this point we know practically nothing about the motive for the change in district or the selection of the present configuration,the contours of the district chosen or the feasible alternatives,the impact of alternative districts on other minorities,or anything else that would help gauge how mechanically or flexibly the gingles factors should be applied.
on the other hand,the plaintiffs can not prevail merely by showing that an alternative plan gives them a greater opportunity to win the election,degrandy,at.failure to maximize can not be the measure of,or that an otherwise justified boundary change happened to cost a seat.this would convert section test into the far more stringent test of section,which imposes rigorous requirements on covered states to prevent redistricting plans with retrogressive consequences for african amer
