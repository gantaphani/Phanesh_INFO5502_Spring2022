the presidential election was one of the closest in our nation history.polls in the weeks before election day showed a statistical dead heat,see election,and george bush eventually prevailed even though al gore received a plurality of the national popular vote.the election also featured candidates on both the left and right ends of the political spectrum respectively,green party nominee ralph nader and reform party nominee pat buchanan.although nader and buchanan ultimately combined to receive only percent of the national popular vote,their importance was magnified by the closeness of the election.bush and gore supporters worried that swing states might be tipped one way or another by votes for candidates.see,james dao,democrats hear thunder on left,and try to steal some of nader,times,at.the public attention also became particularly focused on the peculiarities of the american electoral system,under which small numbers of votes can prove decisive in closely contested states because of their rules for the allocation of presidential electors,and a candidate can win the presidency despite losing the national popular vote.see,michael kranish,electoral college count looming larger this year,boston globe,at.systems allocate all of a state electoral votes to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in that state,even if his share of the vote is less than an outright majority.almost all states employ this system only two,maine and nebraska,allocate electoral votes on a basis.
it was in this highly charged political atmosphere that appellants created two websites.com and,that encouraged people to swap their votes and provided mechanisms for doing so.the mechanisms enabled supporters in a swing state such as florida or ohio to agree to be paired with supporters in a safe state such as massachusetts or texas,whereby the users would promise to vote for the candidate and,in exchange,the users would promise to vote for the candidate.the point of the swaps,at least when agreed to by nader and gore supporters,was to improve gore odds of winning the electors in the swing state without reducing nader share of the national popular vote which needed to exceed five percent in order to qualify his party for federal funding in future elections.
four days after their website began operation,the owners of were threatened with criminal prosecution by secretary of state,bill jones,for alleged violations of various state election and penal code provisions.they immediately disabled the website mechanism,as did the owners of upon learning about that threatened prosecution.shortly thereafter,appellants filed this action,alleging that jones threatened prosecution violated the first amendment and the dormant commerce clause and exceeded the scope of his authority under california election code they sought damages as well as injunctive and declarative relief.
the district court twice found this case to be recently because of an informal letter from former secretary of state kevin shelley to the california legislature asking for clarification of the state election code provisions.because the letter does not assure that california will not threaten to prosecute websites in the future,we conclude that this appeal is not moot.on the merits,we hold that jones violated appellants first amendment rights.the websites mechanisms as well as the communication and vote swaps they enabled were constitutionally protected.although california certainly has valid interests in preventing election fraud and corruption,and perhaps in avoiding the subversion of the electoral college,these interests did not justify the complete disabling of the mechanisms.because we conclude that jones actions were not sufficiently tailored to advance the state legitimate interests,we do not reach appellants further claims that those actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint,violated the dormant commerce clause and were ultra vires under state law.finally,we hold that jones is entitled to qualified immunity from damages because the constitutionality of halting vote swapping was not clearly established in.the district court decision is therefore affirmed in part and reversed in part.
background 
factual history 
on october,less than two weeks before the upcoming national presidential election,william cody created a website called.the website goal was t o maximize the percentage of the popular vote that nader receives,yet allow gore to win the national election.to this end,the website contained links to various articles discussing the election and urging people to swap votes so that gore would become president and nader would receive at least five percent of the popular vote.more relevant here,the website also included a matching system that put people who described themselves as nader voters in swing states in contact with people who described themselves as gore voters in states.once paired,the individuals could exchange and agree to trade their votes.as the website put it,the original gore voter will vote for nader,boosting his national popular totals,while the nader voter will vote for gore,which will hopefully prevent a bush victory in that state.
only nader supporters and gore supporters were intended to swap votes on.states were categorized based on recent polling data,and people who did not identify themselves as nader supporters or gore supporters could not be paired with other users however,did not seek to verify any person state or even country of residence,nor could the website prevent people from being dishonest about their voting intentions or swapping votes multiple times by entering multiple addresses because of these limitations,suggested that i t is ideal to swap with someone you know and trust,and recommended that anyone who decided to employ its mechanism u se your own good judgement sic to determine if the person you are matched with is legitimate,and be aware that some people will try to abuse this system.a separate page within the website,entitled a word of caution,instructed users,i f at any stage of this process something does feel right,we suggest you stop and not continue.
in total,people were matched by the database.it is unknown,however,how many nader and gore votes were actually swapped after users were paired.given secret balloting,whether either or both of the parties to a agreement followed through on their commitments could not be verified.there was therefore no assurance for users of that their counterparts voted in the manner they promised beyond the counterparts word.as the website told paired individuals,remember that this is just a friendly agreement,and you are taking their word that they will follow through.
on october,alan porter and anand ranganathan separately created a website called.like,explained the dilemma facing supporters in swing states,and advocated a solution whereby v oters in a swing state who wish to vote for a third party candidate could swap their vote with voters in safe states who would normally vote for a leading party candidate.also as with,users of were given the address of an appropriate partner after identifying their own state of residency and voting intentions at that point,these two people could contact each other and satisfy each other that they could trust each other to vote the other preferences.however,unlike,was not intended solely to match nader supporters with gore supporters instead,any supporter in a swing state could be matched with an appropriate supporter in a safe state.finally,included a warning that t here is no way to be absolutely definitely certainly sure that a vote swap was actually consummated.while trust ing in the innate goodness of people,the website recommended that users take some reasonable measures to insure that you could trust the other person.
on october,four days after began operation and eight days before the election,the website owners received a letter from bill jones,then secretary of state of california,informing them that their site was engaged in criminal activity.the letter continued 
your website specifically offers to broker the exchange of votes throughout the united states of america.this activity is corruption of the voting process in violation of elections code sections and as well as penal code section,criminal conspiracy the right to free and fair elections is a cornerstone of american democracy.any person or entity that tries to exchange votes or brokers the exchange of votes will be pursued with the utmost vigor as the chief elections officer of the state of california,i demand that you end this activity immediately.if you continue,you and anyone knowingly working with you may be criminally prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
immediately after receiving jones letter,the owners of disabled their website mechanism,barred internet users outside california from accessing the website,posted a notice on the website about what had happened and all people who had been matched about the potential illegality of vote swapping these actions satisfactorily resolve d the issue as far as jones was concerned.even though they did not receive an analogous letter,the owners of also disabled their website mechanism as soon as they found out about the letter.both websites owners claim that the threat of prosecution was stressful and frightening cody,in particular,alleges that he developed back problems and had to visit a chiropractor shortly after receiving jones letter.
was the only website that jones threatened with prosecution.was never brought to jones attention before it ceased operation,though its vote swapping mechanism was very similar to that of no action was taken against websites that advocated vote swapping but did not actually include mechanisms.websites that were the subject of complaints were reviewed by the secretary of state on a basis,with each review process being very fact intensive.
procedural history 
cody,porter,patrick kerr and steven lewis appellants filed the present lawsuit on november,five days before the presidential election.kerr is a california citizen who supported nader but was worried about contributing to a bush victory in his state lewis is a massachusetts citizen who supported gore but would have considered swapping his vote with a nader supporter.both kerr and lewis were interested in using the voteswapping mechanisms offered by and,but were unable to do so after those mechanisms were disabled.appellants complaint sought damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.jones was sued for damages in his individual capacity,whereas debra bowen,california current secretary of state,is a defendant in her official capacity.given the turnover in the office of the secretary of state,we refer to appellees as secretary unless the context requires naming the particular incumbent.
the district court initially denied appellants application for a temporary restraining order that would have allowed them to continue operation of their websites until the election.the court subsequently dismissed appellants damages claim on the ground that they had failed to satisfy the heightened pleading standard for constitutional tort actions,and stayed their claims for prospective relief under the abstention doctrine of comm of pullman.we reversed the district court in a published decision.see porter jones,cir porter i.we held that this case was not moot,that it was ripe for decision,that the eleventh amendment barred neither appellants claims for prospective relief nor their damages claims against jones in his individual capacity and that pullman abstention was inappropriate.see id.at.
notwithstanding our decision in porter i,the district court on remand granted summary judgment for the secretary on appellants claims for prospective relief on the ground that those claims had become moot.the district court relied on a new letter from of state kevin shelley to of the assembly herb wesson.in that letter,shelley request ed legislative clarification of the state election code provisions that his predecessor,jones,had invoked against the operators of,citing the general nature of the language of these sections,and the constitutional issues implicated here.until such legislative clarifications are made,shelley added,i will not seek to prevent the operation of websites such as and.according to the district court,the shelley letter clearly and unequivocally indicated that the laws will not be enforced in the same manner against future conduct by plaintiffs or others until the legislature provides further clarification.it was therefore inappropriate for the court to grant injunctive relief,because there was no showing that there exists a present,existing and ongoing prohibition against plaintiffs activities.
in a separate order,the district court granted summary judgment for jones on appellants damages claims.the court ruled that jones was entitled to qualified immunity because the law regarding the constitutionality of prohibiting internet voteswapping is far from clearly established.the court added that jones position that sections and of the california election code applied to the activities of and was objectively reasonable in light of supreme court authority and the potential of such trading to corrupt the elections process.the court also noted that the secretaries of state of two other states had reached the same conclusion as jones about the applicability of statutes to websites facilitating.
judgment was entered in march and appellants timely appealed.
ii.standard of review 
a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.hunt dental dep t,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact,and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.here neither party claims that there is a genuine issue of material fact we therefore need review only the district court application of the relevant substantive law.
iii.discussion 
we address at the outset the district court ruling,based entirely on the shelley letter,that appellants claims for prospective relief are moot.see coral constr.king county,cir ordinarily,a contention of mootness must be resolved as a threshold matter,since the court would lack jurisdiction to decide a moot case.it has long been established that the m ere voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not moot a case if it did,the courts would be compelled to leave t he defendant free to return to his old ways.united states concentrated phosphate export ass n,d second alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.only if subsequent events have made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,and interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation,los angeles county davis,d,may a case be found moot because the defendant has ceased the conduct.moreover,the burden of demonstrating mootness is heavy and must be carried by the party claiming that the case is moot.see coral construction,at.
we conclude that the secretary fails to carry the heavy burden of establishing that it is absolutely clear that california will not threaten to prosecute the owners of and if they create websites in the future to begin with,the shelley letter does not suggest that it is binding on the secretary of state,nor would a letter addressed to the speaker of the assembly typically create legal obligations.shelley also no longer occupies the position of secretary of state,and the current incumbent,secretary bowen,could initiate the prosecution of websites at her discretion.lawrence berkeley,cir defendants have neither asserted nor demonstrated that they will never resume the conduct emphasis added.finally,the secretary has maintained throughout the nearly seven years of litigation in this case that jones had the authority under state law to threaten appellants with prosecution in position in tension with the shelley letter statement that the relevant statutory provisions are drafted in general terms and require legislative clarification.bourgeois peters,cir case not moot where t he city has argued for over two years that its search policy is constitutional in the face of ongoing litigation.
we therefore reverse the district court ruling that appellants claims for prospective relief were mooted by the shelley letter.accordingly,we proceed to the merits of appellants appeal 
first amendment 
appellants principally contend that jones threatened criminal prosecution of the owners of and was not sufficiently tailored to the advancement of the state legitimate interests and thus unlawfully burdened constitutionally protected speech and conduct.because we agree with appellants,we do not reach their further arguments that jones actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint and violated the dormant commerce clause.we also do not address whether jones actions exceeded the scope of his authority under california state election law even if they were,we would still need to decide their constitutionality in order to determine whether jones is entitled to qualified immunity.see saucier,at.
protected speech or conduct 
the first issue we must resolve is whether jones actions burdened any constitutionally protected speech or conduct.that is,did appellants have a first amendment interest in and voteswapping mechanisms or the communication and vote swaps that the mechanisms enabled beginning with the voteswapping mechanisms themselves,we hold that they are entitled to at least some first amendment protection.the mechanisms conveyed useful information to users by providing them with the addresses of appropriate counterparts with whom they could swap votes.also offered data about states political leanings,ballot situations and electoral systems as soon as users of the mechanism identified their states of residency.see village of schaumburg citizens for a better env t,d communication of information is speech interest within the protection of the first amendment giebel sylvester,cir b ecause giebel handbill was designed to convey information,it constitutes a form of speech protected by the first amendment.
as appellants argue,the mechanisms also expressed a reasonably clear message of support for candidates and concern that systems might allow a candidate to receive all of a state electoral votes even though he was opposed by a majority of the state voters as measured by the popular vote any person who sought access to the mechanisms would have turning a blind eye to the text and hyperlinks that surrounded them on the their creators supported third parties and were seeking to create options that were otherwise foreclosed by most states electoral procedures.a user of mechanism who as a gore supporter,for example,would have been asked to provide his or her name and address,and would have seen the following language on the online page you are a gore supporter from a state who will agree to vote for nader in exchange for someone in a swing state voting for gore.this statement certainly communicated,position,as well as its fear that bush would win swing states electoral votes despite the opposition of a majority of the states voters.see spence washington,d expressive conduct requires intent to convey a particularized message and likelihood that is great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it vlasak superior court,cir protester bull hook at circus was expressive conduct colacurcio city of kent,cir same for nude dancing at nightclub 
looking next at the communication and vote swaps that the mechanisms enabled between paired users,we agree with appellants that they too constituted protected speech or conduct as discussed above,after being matched by the websites mechanisms,users were encouraged to contact each other by.it is reasonable to assume that the users ensuing messages would have concerned their political preferences and,if the users reached a meeting of the minds,resulted in agreements to swap votes on election day.this kind of communication is clearly protected by the first amendment.t here is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs,including discussions of candidates.mills alabama,d see also meyer grant,d i nteractive communication concerning political change is appropriately described as core political speech.buckley valeo,d discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are afford ed the broadest protection.
any agreements that paired users may have reached about swapping votes were also constitutionally protected.such the that preceded people opinions on campaigns for political office,which are precisely where the first amendment has its fullest and most urgent application.monitor patriot roy,d.agreements whereby a supporter and supporter pledged to trade votes also would have expressed those voters support for a particular candidate or support for a particular candidate,as well as their concern that unless action was taken,the electoral system could result in the will of the swing state majority being overridden.
whatever the wisdom of using agreements to communicate these positions,such agreements plainly differ from conventional and illegal vote buying,which conveys no message other than the parties willingness to exchange votes for money or some other form of private profit.the supreme court held in brown hartlage,d,that vote buying may be banned without trenching on any right of association protected by the first amendment.vote swapping,however,is more akin to the candidate pledge in brown to take a pay cut if elected,which the court concluded was constitutionally protected,than to unprotected vote buying.like the candidate pledge,vote swapping involves a promise to confer some ultimate benefit on the voter,qua citizen or member of the general public,another person agreement to vote for a particular candidate.id.at.and unlike vote buying,vote swapping is not an illegal exchange for private profit since the only benefit a vote swapper can receive is a marginally higher probability that his preferred electoral outcome will come to pass.id.at.emphasis added marc john randazza,the other election controversy of core first amendment values and political coalitions,there can be no serious assertion,that anyone entered into a arrangement for private profit or any other form of enrichment.
both the websites mechanisms and the communication and vote swaps that they enabled were therefore constitutionally protected.at their core,they amounted to efforts by politically engaged people to support their preferred candidates and to avoid election results that they feared would contravene the preferences of a majority of voters in closely contested states.whether or not one agrees with these voters tactics,such efforts,when conducted honestly and without money changing hands,are at the heart of the liberty safeguarded by the first amendment.brown,at.buckley,at.monitor patriot,at.mills,at.
we do not decide,however,whether the mechanisms and the communication and vote swaps they made possible were pure speech or expressive conduct.the distinction between the two concepts is often difficult to discern.see,fair.at considering law schools policies toward military recruiters first as speech and then in the alternative as expressive conduct.it is also a distinction that makes no practical difference here,because our conclusion would be the same under the strict scrutiny that applies to restrictions of pure speech as it is under the intermediate scrutiny applicable to the burdening of expressive conduct that we employ below 
intermediate scrutiny under united states 
a government action that burdens expressive conduct is subject to intermediate scrutiny,and is upheld if it is within the constitutional power of the government it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and the incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.united states,d.the government bears the burden of proving that the elements of the test are satisfied.preferred commc ns,city of los angeles,cir.applying this framework,we hold that the state legitimate interests did not support jones threatened criminal prosecution of the owners of and 
the secretary asserts three interests to justify any alleged burdening of appellants protected activity preventing corruption,preventing fraud and preventing the subversion of the electoral college because the concepts of corruption and fraud are related although distinct,we consider california interest in preventing elections from being tainted by illicit financial transactions under the corruption rubric,and its interest in preventing deceptive campaign practices under the fraud rubric.see fed.election comm conservative political action comm.ncpac,d the hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo dollars for political favors.buckley,at.t he appearance of corruption stem s from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.see also illinois ex rel.madigan telemarketing,d equating fraud with public deception.regardless of how they are categorized,these interests embody the secretary understandable unease,as chief elections officer of california,with novel online applications that were perceived as threatening state and national electoral procedures and appeared to be susceptible to fraudulent activity.
beginning with the first prong,we have no doubt that jones had the constitutional authority to threaten the websites owners with prosecution.california police power plainly authorizes state officials to send letters to websites that are believed to be in violation of an otherwise valid statute,and to prosecute the websites owners for their offenses.see united states turkette,d states are free to exercise their police powers to the fullest constitutional extent in defining and prosecuting crimes within their respective jurisdictions.
the second prong,whether jones actions furthered important or substantial government interests,presents a question with mixed answers.preventing corruption and preventing fraud have both been repeatedly recognized as weighty government interests.see,fed.election comm wisconsin right to life,wrtl,d wrtl t he court has long recognized the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption in election campaigns.internal quotation marks omitted village of schaumburg,at.protecting the public from fraud is indeed a substantial interest internal quotation marks omitted.however,as appellants argue,no decision has ever recognized a state interest in preventing the subversion of the electoral college,let alone characterized such an interest as important or substantial.williams rhodes,d rejecting ohio asserted interest under art.ii,of the constitution in keeping minority parties off the presidential ballot.in any event,we need not decide whether preventing the subversion of the electoral college is a legitimate government interest because,as we discuss below,even if it were,it was not furthered by jones actions.
the third requirement,that the state interests be unrelated to the suppression of free expression,is easily satisfied here.the prevention of fraud,corruption and electoral college subversion is conceptually distinct from the abridgement of speech.city of paul,d state compelling interest in preventing election fraud is an interest unrelated to the suppression of ideas.moreover,there is no indication here that jones threatened to prosecute appellants because of their political views,and the fact that he did not send letters to websites that advocated vote swapping but did not include mechanisms suggests strongly that his motivation was not the suppression of speech.
finally,we examine separately each of the secretary three asserted interests to determine whether the fourth and most important prong was the incidental restrictions on first amendment freedoms be no greater than is necessary to further those interests.we conclude that the secretary interests in preventing corruption and preventing the subversion of the electoral college were not furthered at all by the threatened prosecution of the owners of and,and that the state interest was not addressed in a sufficiently tailored manner.
corruption.beginning with the state interest,we reiterate that we construe this interest to encompass only the prevention of illicit financial transactions such as the buying of votes or the contribution of large sums of money to legislators in exchange for political support.see wrtl.at scalia,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment ncpac,at.buckley,at.so defined,this interest was not advanced by the threatened prosecution of the owners of and.the websites did not encourage the trading of votes for money,or indeed for anything other than other votes.actually included a notation that it is illegal to pay someone to vote on your behalf,or even get paid to vote yourself.stay away from the money.just vote emphasis in original.and there is no evidence in the record,nor has the secretary argued,that any website users ever misused the voteswapping mechanisms by offering or accepting money for their votes.
fraud.the state interest was furthered by jones threatened prosecution of the website owners.at least three kinds of fraud could have been perpetrated through those websites mechanisms.people from other states or even other countries could have pretended to be supporters or supporters.regardless of their location,people could have used the websites mechanisms multiple times,thus trading their one vote or zero votes for several other votes.and even people who were truthful about their location and who only swapped votes once could have deliberately misrepresented their voting intentions.threatening appellants websites with prosecution unless they disabled the mechanisms thus served the state interest for the obvious reason that none of the above species of fraud could have been committed through mechanisms that were no longer in operation.
however,the secretary has failed to demonstrate that the burden imposed on constitutionally protected activity by the disabling of the mechanisms was not greater than was essential to the furtherance of the state interest,at.first,the secretary has not called our attention to,nor have we been able to locate,any evidence in the record that fraud actually took place during the brief period that the mechanisms were operational.no website users came forward with either admissions that they committed fraud or worries that their counterparts misrepresented their state of residency or voting intentions.the websites owners also did not notice any suspicious online activity,such as the use of obviously fake or multiple addresses,which stated it would try to eliminate if it occurred.
second,as described above,both websites repeatedly warned users that fraud was possible and advised them to take steps to reassure themselves that they could trust their matched counterparts.told users to u se your own good judgement sic to determine if the person you are matched with is legitimate,and be aware that some people will try to abuse this system.similarly,recommended that users take some reasonable measures to insure that you could trust the other person.the secretary has not explained why these warnings were insufficient,or what kind of language if any would have assuaged the state concerns.
third,the manner in which the mechanisms operated reduced the opportunities for widespread fraud.any fraudster would have had to exchange and come to a agreement separately with each intended victim.there was no way to automate the fraud,that is,to agree to trade votes without first making contact and offering specific representations even if bogus to the other party about the fraudster identity,location and voting intentions.
lastly,the secretary has failed to establish or,indeed,even to argue that the state interest could not have been advanced as effectively through less restrictive means.under our case law,it was the secretary burden to show that the potential types of fraud the secretary suggests might occur could not have been halted through measures less burdensome than the complete disabling of the websites mechanisms.see edwards city of coeur,cir preferred commc ns,at.the secretary,however,did not attempt to make such a showing,even though it was the secretary who invoked the framework to justify shutting down the mechanisms.given the supreme court repeated admonishments that the government interest in preventing fraud does not justify sweeping restrictions on constitutionally protected activity,the secretary failure to establish that jones actions were his only reasonable recourse is fatal to the secretary reliance on.see riley fed of the blind of,d in contrast to the prophylactic,imprecise,and unduly burdensome rule the state has adopted to reduce its alleged donor misperception,more benign and narrowly tailored options are available.village of schaumburg,at.the village legitimate interest in preventing fraud can be better served by measures less intrusive than a direct prohibition on solicitation.naacp button,d broad prophylactic rules in the area of free expression are suspect.precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms.internal citations omitted.
our conclusion is bolstered by appellants offer of at least two suggestions for preventing fraud short of disabling the websites mechanisms altogether,neither of which was addressed by the secretary.first,appellants pointed out that m ore stringent warnings about the danger of fraud could have been posted on the websites,to even more clearly alert users of the need to exercise good judgment in trusting someone known only through the internet.second,the state could have pass ed a law that said you must be who you say you are when you do this,you must be from the state you say you from.if those who utilized the voteswapping mechanism had been required by law or even simply the websites to prove their identity and residency before they could have been matched with other users perhaps by providing information such as a driver license number or the voter registration number that is typically listed on voter identification cards,then the websites could have stopped users from swapping votes multiple times or from misrepresenting their state of residency.although the record does not conclusively demonstrate the feasibility or effectiveness of such verification methods,it was the state burden to rebut appellants suggested lesser alternatives and the secretary did not do so.
electoral college.finally,the state interest in preventing the subversion of the electoral college,assuming it to be a legitimate interest,was not furthered by jones actions.as a technical matter,appellants are correct that the mechanisms did not enable users to cast their votes in states in which they were not registered,nor could the constitutionally prescribed arrangement for selecting the president have been undermined by the mechanisms.more fundamentally,the whole point of and was to prevent the preferences of a majority of a state voters from being frustrated by the systems in place in most states.for example,in a hypothetical swing state with percent bush supporters,percent gore supporters,and percent nader supporters all of whom we hypothesize preferred gore to bush,an election conducted without vote swapping would have resulted in a bush victory even though he was not the first choice of a majority of the state voters.however,if all the nader supporters had swapped their votes with gore supporters in safe states,then was preferred by percent of the state voters to have prevailed.such an outcome would not have represented a subversion of the electoral college,which would have continued to operate precisely as set forth in the constitution.it also would not have undermined the state electoral system,which would have still allocated all of the state electoral votes to the candidate who received a plurality of the state popular vote.all that the vote swapping would have done would have been to offset the anomalies that its advocates believe can result when more than two candidates face off in systems.rushing,supra,at i t is doubtful that the electoral college tenders a compelling state interest for ending vote swapping.
we therefore hold that jones threatened prosecution of the owners of and was unconstitutional under the fourth prong.his actions severely burdened activity protected by the first amendment after october,the websites mechanisms were entirely disabled,and people were entirely unable to communicate or swap votes through the mechanisms.moreover,his actions did not advance california interests in preventing corruption and preventing the subversion of the electoral college,and the secretary has failed to establish that the state interest could not have been furthered as effectively through measures less drastic than the complete disabling of voteswapping mechanisms at issue here we express no opinion on whether less severe as the verification methods suggested by pass muster under.
qualified immunity 
appellants seek not only prospective relief from prosecution on account of their websites mechanisms,but also damages from jones.jones,in turn,argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity.we have already addressed the first element of the qualified immunity inquiry,namely whether jones violated appellants constitutional rights,which he did.see saucier,at.we therefore turn to the second element of the qualified immunity the constitutionality under the first amendment of halting vote swapping was clearly established in.see hope pelzer,d stating the salient question as whether the state of the law gave respondents fair warning that their actions were unconstitutional anderson creighton,d holding that a right is clearly established when its contours are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.
we conclude that the application of first amendment doctrine to vote swapping was not clearly established in or,indeed,until our decision today.first,no court had ever addressed the constitutionality of efforts to halt vote swapping when jones threatened appellants with prosecution.jones therefore had no decision to rely on when he received complaints about appellants websites.second,although it is true that officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances,hope,at,this case does not involve the mere application of settled law to a new factual permutation.to the contrary,we have had to wrestle with difficult and unsettled questions about the first amendment interests implicated by vote swapping and the weight of the countervailing interests asserted by the state.finally,jones was not the only secretary of state to determine that vote swapping was illegal under state law so too did his counterparts in oregon and minnesota,on grounds similar to those cited by jones though the secretaries of state of maine,michigan and nebraska reached the opposite conclusion.
taking these considerations into account,we hold that jones is entitled to qualified immunity.he did not have fair warning that his actions were unconstitutional,id.at,nor would a reasonable official in his position have understood that threatening the owners of websites with prosecution constituted a violation of the first amendment,anderson,at.
iv.conclusion 
we hold that this case is not moot.the shelley letter did not make it absolutely clear that california would not threaten to prosecute the owners of websites in the future.we further hold that jones violated the first amendment when he threatened to prosecute the owners of and.both the websites mechanisms and the communication and vote swaps that the mechanisms enabled were constitutionally protected.the heavy burden jones imposed on this protected activity did not further the state interests in preventing corruption and preventing the subversion of the electoral college,and the secretary failed to establish that the state interest could not have been advanced as effectively through less severe measures.nonetheless,we hold that jones is entitled to qualified immunity because the constitutionality of halting vote swapping was not clearly established in.the partie
