deborah schwier,theodore schwier,and michael craig collectively,appellants filed suit in federal district court against cathy cox cox,in her official capacity as secretary of the state of georgia,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under.the appellants claimed that georgia voter registration procedure and voter registration form violated section of the privacy act of,stat,note,and section of the voting rights act of,a b.the district court found that appellants could not bring a private right of action under for violations of section of the privacy act or section of the voting rights act.for the reasons that follow,we reverse.
background 
prior to the general election of november,deborah and theodore schwier the schwiers attempted to register to vote in walton county,georgia.the schwiers submitted their registration applications without supplying their social security numbers ssns.subsequently,walton county officials notified the schwiers that,unless they supplied officials with their ssns,their voter registrations would be rejected.michael craig craig was unable to vote in gwinnett county,georgia because he also refused to supply officials with his ssn.the schwiers sought and won a preliminary injunction allowing them to vote in the election without providing their ssns in the customary manner discovery focused primarily on how georgia implemented its voter registration statute.
after discovery,appellants and cox filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court granted cox motion for summary judgment on both the privacy act and voting rights act claims.appellants then perfected this appeal.
appellants claim that georgia requirement that they provide their ssns in order to vote and georgia voter registration form the form violate the privacy act.appellants argue that section of the privacy act contains no remedial scheme and that appellants may sue cox for violations of section via.
cox argues that the appellants do not have a private right of action under the privacy act.alternatively,cox argues that georgia voting statute is protected from the prohibitions of the privacy act by the act grandfather provision.cox further argues that if appellants may sue state officials for violations of the privacy act via,then passage of the privacy act exceeded congress authority,and the privacy act is unconstitutional.
because cox argues that if section of the privacy act is enforceable via a private right of action brought under,then section of the privacy act is unconstitutional,the united states the government intervened as a matter of right pursuant to a and rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure.the government argues that the privacy act may be enforced under and that congress did not exceed its authority in passing the privacy act.
appellants also contend that georgia requirement that voters supply their ssns in order to vote violates a b of the voting rights act,which prohibits states from disqualifying potential voters based on their failure to provide information not relevant to determining their eligibility to vote.appellants argue that since its enactment in,has been available to private citizens to enforce the voting rights act.they contend that when congress gave the attorney general the authority to enforce the voting rights act through the enactment of the civil rights act of,congress added a means of enforcing the voting rights act but did not take away the previously existing remedy of private suits via.
cox argues that section of the voting rights act may be enforced only by the attorney general.in the alternative,cox argues that,even if may be enforced by a private right of action under,appellants claim is moot because georgia has modified its voter registration form.

iii.standard of review 
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.hale tallapoosa county,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.
iv.discussion 
whether the district court erred in holding that section of the privacy act does not allow for enforcement by a private right of action against state agencies by a suit under.
the privacy act of contains only two substantive sections,section and section.see stat.at.section of the privacy act applies only to federal agencies and,among other things,delineates an individual right to records of federal agencies and right to be protected from disclosure of records by federal agencies.section contains a comprehensive remedial scheme which includes the right to bring a civil action against a federal agency however,the remedial scheme of section states that it applies only to section.
section of the privacy act bars federal,state,or local agencies from denying any individual any right,benefit,or privilege provided by law because of such individual refusal to disclose his social security account number to the agency section of the privacy act does not contain its own remedial scheme and is explicitly excluded from the remedial scheme of section thus,section has no remedial scheme.
the district court finding that section of the privacy act is a dead letter.
within the privacy act itself,congress stated that section was an amendment to title v,which governs federal administrative agencies.see stat.at.thus,section added a new section to title v and was codified as.id.at.because congress made no such statement about section of the privacy act,the revisor of the placed section in an historical and statutory note following.see note.the district court mistakenly placed great weight on this fact.the district court noted that,although section was part of the privacy act that was passed into law as public law,the fact that section was never codified,and appears only in the historical and statutory notes section of the united states code,made section a mere historical footnote to the privacy act of which congress has never reflected any intention of codifying.the district court apparently believed that public laws have less weight as laws than laws which have been codified.the reverse is true the code can not prevail over the statutes at large when the two are inconsistent.united states welden,d internal quotations omitted.
the district court also stated that section was deleted from the privacy act by the senate government operations committee before the law was codified into the official code.the district court quotes senate report,but the quote demonstrates that the provision that was deleted from the act pertained only to a business entity refusal to enter into a business transaction or commercial relationship with an individual because of his refusal to disclose or furnish his social security number,reprinted in.thus,the court conclusion that section of the privacy act had been deleted was error.the best proof of this is section presence in the statutes at large.see stat.at see also welden,at.at.we therefore conclude that the district court erred in finding that section of the privacy act was a dead letter.
the district court finding that the remedial scheme of section forecloses a private action for violations of section.
in finding that section does not provide for a private right of action,the district court relied on the ninth circuit holding in dittman california,cir,that t he civil remedy provisions of the statute do not apply against private individuals,state agencies,private entities,or state and local officials.at quoting unt aerospace,cir first emphasis added.
in dittman,the ninth circuit relied on two cases which involved only section of the privacy act.thus,when the ninth circuit quoted unt aerospace above,the phrase,the statute,referred to section of the privacy act,not section.unt holding had no relevance to the facts of dittman or to the present case because in unt,the plaintiff was trying to sue a entity for violations of section of the privacy act,which pertains only to federal agencies.unt,at.
in addition,dittman relied on the seventh circuit holding in polchowski gorris,cir.polchowski also had no relevance to the facts of dittman because,again,polchowski involved enforcement of section of the privacy act,rather than section.in polchowski,the plaintiff sought to sue a state agency under for releasing criminal information about him.at.the release of the information would have violated section of the privacy act,but section applies only to federal agencies.thus,the court reasoned,congress,by limiting the scope of section to federal agencies has provided unequivocal and persuasive evidence that it intended to foreclose private enforcement of section against state or local officials who make unwarranted disclosures of statistical information.id.at internal quotations omitted.in other words,the rights created by section of the privacy act do not restrict the activities of state agencies.
in michael convalescent hospital.california,cir,on which dittman also relied,the plaintiffs sought to sue a state agency under section of the privacy act.as in polchowski,the plaintiffs sought to sue a state agency for violating a section of the privacy act which applies only to federal agencies.thus,the ninth circuit dismissed plaintiffs claims.michael,at.
in summary,unt,polchowski,and michael,all relied upon by the ninth circuit in dittman,were distinguishable from dittman and did not support the ninth circuit holding in that case.dittman failed to recognize that the remedial scheme of section applies only to section and has no bearing on section.thus,the remedial scheme of section provides no basis for concluding that congress intended to preclude private remedies under for violations of section.therefore,we conclude that the district court erred in finding that the remedial scheme of section of the privacy act precluded a private right of action via for violations of section of the privacy act.
the district court finding that the tax reform act of limited the scope of the privacy act.
the district court also found that the tax reform act of,which amended the social security act,authorized the states to use ssns for voting.the court finding was due in large part to its reliance on stoianoff commissioner of motor vehicles,d,aff.cir.however,stoianoff and the district court mistakenly relied on committee language which was much broader than the very narrow language of the final version of the tax reform act passed into law.see stoianoff,d at.the final version authorizes states to use ssns only in the administration of any tax,general public assistance,driver license,or motor vehicle registration.c c i.thus,the district court erred in concluding that the scope of the privacy act had been limited by the tax reform act.
the privacy act and.
in gonzaga university doe,d,the supreme court noted that the inquiry into whether a statute contains an implied right of action and the inquiry into whether the statute creates rights enforceable under overlap in that both inquiries must begin with the question of whether congress intended to create a federal right.at.at.here,we ask only whether the privacy act creates rights enforceable under because this is the issue appellants raise on appeal.
section provides a private right of action whenever an individual has been deprived of any constitutional or statutory federal right under color of state law.see see also maine thiboutot,d.in blessing freestone,d,the supreme court noted that they had traditionally looked at three factors when determining whether a particular statutory provision gives rise to a federal right 
first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.second,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.third,the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.in other words,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.
at.at internal citations and quotations omitted however,in gonzaga,the court pointed out that some courts had misunderstood the first factor of blessing to permit a conferred benefit rather than anything short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action brought under,which provides a remedy only for the deprivation of rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.at.at emphasis added.
thus,before we analyze the application of the blessing factors to the privacy act,in keeping with gonzaga,we must first ask whether congress created an unambiguously conferred right in section of the privacy act.at.at see also blessing,at.at in order to seek redress through,a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right,not merely a violation of federal law.
the relevant portion of section states,it shall be unlawful for any federal,state or local government agency to deny to any individual any right,benefit,or privilege provided by law because of such individual refusal to disclose his social security account number.stat.at.we agree with the government that this language,aimed at the denial of rights to individuals,is analogous to language cited by the supreme court in gonzaga as explicit language 
title vi provides no person in the united states shall be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance on the basis of race,color,or national origin.stat,ed.emphasis added.title ix provides no person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.stat,a emphasis added.where a statute does not include this sort of explicit right or language we rarely impute to congress an intent to create a private right of action.
at.at.in contrast,the relevant language of the family educational rights and privacy act of ferpa,which the gonzaga court held not to create personal rights enforceable under provides 
no funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records or personally identifiable information contained therein of students without the written consent of their parents to any individual,agency,or organization.
at.at quoting b.the court explained 
unlike the individually focused terminology of titles vi and ix no person shall be subjected to discrimination,ferpa provisions speak only to the secretary of education,directing that n o funds shall be made available to any educational agency or institution which has a prohibited policy or practice.b.this focus is two steps removed from the interests of individual students and parents and clearly does not confer the sort of individual entitlement that is enforceable under.
at.at quoting blessing,at.at.
admittedly,the language of section falls somewhere in between the language of titles vi and ix and that of ferpa.the subject of the relevant clauses of titles vi and ix is person,whereas the subject of the relevant clause of the privacy act is it.in other words,if the privacy act were worded,no individual may be denied any right,benefit,or privilege provided by law by any federal,state or local government agency because of such individual refusal to disclose his social security account number,the language would be more precisely analogous to that of titles vi and ix.nonetheless,the privacy act clearly confers a legal right on individuals the right to refuse to disclose his or her ssn without suffering the loss of any right,benefit,or privilege provided by law.stat.at.thus,we conclude that congress created an unambiguously conferred right in section of the privacy act.gonzaga,at.at 
as for the factors of blessing,the language of section is clearly intended to benefit individuals,as discussed above is specific rather than amorphous and is clearly mandatory.to read the statute is to see that it easily meets the three criteria of blessing.first,because we have already concluded that congress created an unambiguously conferred right in section of the privacy act,we necessarily conclude that the language is intended to benefit individuals.secondly,the prohibitions of the statute are clear and specific no federal,state or local government agency may deny any individual any right,benefit,or privilege provided by law because of such individual refusal to disclose his social security account number.stat.at.finally,the language,it shall be unlawful is mandatory rather than precatory.these words indicate a clear prohibition of specific behavior by federal,state or local government rather than an aspirational goal or yardstick.see blessing,at.at.
however,e ven if a plaintiff demonstrates that a federal statute creates an individual right,there is only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under.blessing,at.at.to establish that the presumption can not be rebutted,courts must look to whether congress intended to foreclose a remedy under either expressly,by forbidding recourse to in the statute itself,or impliedly,by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under.id.
as the text demonstrates,congress did not explicitly foreclose an action under.thus,the relevant question is whether congress did so impliedly,by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement.id.again,to read the statute is to answer the question.section contains no enforcement scheme at all.and,as we have explained above,although section of the privacy act contains a comprehensive remedial scheme,section specifically states that its remedial scheme applies only to section.thus,the presumption that the rights conferred by section of the privacy act may be vindicated via a suit under stands,and we hold that the rights conferred by section may be enforced under.
b.if the privacy act allows for a private right of action,whether congress exceeded its authority in enacting the privacy act,rendering the privacy act unconstitutional.
cox argues that if appellants may sue a state for violation of the privacy act via,then congress exceeded its authority in passing the privacy act.cox argues that the only possible source of authority for the privacy act was congress commerce clause power.the government argues,however,that congress right to establish the use of ssns arises from the general welfare clause,which authorizes congress to spend money for the general welfare.this power is quite expansive.buckley valeo,d.in addition,the government argues,the necessary and proper clause authorizes congress to adopt measures that bear a rational connection to any of its enumerated powers.united states edgar,cir,cert.denied,d.thus,the government argues,because congress had the authority to authorize the creation of ssns,congress has the authority to safeguard the proper use of social security numbers by prohibiting federal,state,and local governments from conditioning an individual legal rights on disclosure of his social security number.we agree with the government and hold that congress did not exceed its authority in passing the privacy act.
whether georgia qualifies for the grandfather exception of section a b of the privacy act.
section a of the privacy act makes an exception for agencies which maintain ed a system of records in existence and operating before january,but only if such disclosure was required under statute or regulation adopted before january,to verify the identity of an individual.stat.at.thus,to qualify for the grandfather exception,georgia must show that it meets two criteria that it maintained a system of records operating before january,and that the system required the disclosure of an individual ssn to verify the identity of that individual 
because we hold that the rights conferred by the privacy act may be vindicated via a private right of action under,we remand the issue of whether georgia qualifies for the grandfather exception of the privacy act to the district court to address in the first instance.
whether georgia voter registration forms comply with the notice requirements of section b of the privacy act.
appellants argue that georgia voter registration form fails to comply with the notification requirements of section b of the privacy act because the form does not inform voters under what authority the demand for their ssns is made.secondly,appellants argue that the form promises confidentiality and internal use only.cox admits that state law allows the ssns to be disclosed to other georgia state agencies if requested by those agencies.
however,cox notes that the form has been modified to contain citations to and as statutory authority for requiring the ssns.cox also states that the other modification to the card is that it will now explain that internal use only means to identify and verify the identity of voters.if it is true that other state agencies in georgia will have access to georgia voters ssns,this modification would seem insufficient to bring the form into compliance with section b of the privacy act.the district court did not reach this issue because it found that the privacy act could not be enforced by a private right of action.thus,we remand this issue to the district court to consider in the first instance.
whether the district court erred in holding that section of the voting rights act may not be enforced by a private right of action under.
appellants also contend that georgia requirement that voters supply their ssns in order to vote violates a b of the voting rights act,which forbids the practice of disqualifying potential voters for their failure to provide information irrelevant to determining their eligibility to vote.this provision was intended to address the practice of requiring unnecessary information for voter registration with the intent that such requirements would increase the number of errors or omissions on the application forms,thus providing an excuse to disqualify potential voters.see condon reno.for example,one such tactic was to disqualify an applicant who failed to list the exact number of months and days in his age.id.
section c,the provision authorizing the attorney general to sue to enforce,was added to the statute by the civil rights act of.the district court found that congress intended c to foreclose the possibility of a private right of action under.the district court relied on the sixth circuit holding in mckay thompson,cir,that is only enforceable by the attorney general.
in mckay,the sixth circuit relied entirely on willing lake orion community schools board of trustees,which in turn relied entirely on good roy.thus,the extent of the analysis relied on by the sixth circuit is the following from good furthermore,subsection c provides for enforcement of the statute by the attorney general with no mention of enforcement by private persons t he unambiguous language of section will not permit us to imply a private right of action.at.
however,in allen state board of elections,d,and morse republican party of virginia,d plurality opinion,the supreme court found that other sections of the voting rights act,and,respectively,could be enforced by a private right of action,even though those sections also provide for enforcement by the attorney general.
in allen,which dealt with the provision of the voting rights act requiring judicial scrutiny of alterations of voting qualifications o
