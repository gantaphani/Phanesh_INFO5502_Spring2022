there is nothing novel about requiring election campaign committees in this country to file periodic reports,including disclosures of names of contributors and the amount contributed.many judicial decisions have considered whether particular reporting and disclosure requirements can withstand scrutiny under the first amendment.the great bulk of those decisions,however,concern committees that are working for or against candidates for public office.reporting requirements are justified as necessary to police whether anyone is contributing more than allowed to a candidate the contribution limits being justified,in turn,by the need to prevent quid pro quo corruption,and the appearance of corruption and to give the electorate useful information concerning the candidate views and those to whom the candidate is likely to be beholden.
at issue on this appeal is a different type of campaign committee,not one seeking to elect or defeat a candidate,but one seeking to prevail on a ballot initiative.a citizen voting on a ballot initiative is not concerned with the merit,including the corruptibility,of a person running for office,but with the merit of a proposed law or expenditure,such as a bond issue.as a result,the justifications for requiring disclosures in a candidate election may not apply,or may not apply with as much force,to a ballot initiative.disclosure may facilitate ad hominem whatever they are the merits of the ballot initiative but there is no need for concern that contributors can change a law enacted through a ballot initiative as they can influence a person elected to office.
colorado law requires that any group of two or more persons that has accepted or made contributions or expenditures exceeding to support or oppose a ballot issue must register as an issue committee and report the names and addresses of anyone who contributes or more.plaintiffs are residents of parker north,a neighborhood of about homes in an unincorporated part of douglas county,colorado,who opposed the annexation of their neighborhood into the town of parker.plaintiffs had raised less than in monetary and contributions for their cause when supporters of annexation challenged the failure of the opponents to register as an issue committee.
plaintiffs contend that colorado reporting requirements unconstitutionally burden their first amendment right to association.we agree that colorado law,as applied to plaintiffs,has violated their constitutional freedom of association.there is virtually no proper governmental interest in imposing disclosure requirements on committees that raise and expend so little money,and that limited interest can not justify the burden that those requirements impose on such a committee.
background 
colorado law 
the colorado constitution defines issue committee as 
any person,other than a natural person,or any group of two or more persons,including natural persons i t hat has a major purpose of supporting or opposing any ballot issue or ballot question and ii t hat has accepted or made contributions or expenditures in excess of two hundred dollars to support or oppose any ballot issue or ballot question.
const.art.xxviii,a i ii.all monetary contributions received by an issue committee must be deposited in a separate account in the committee name no contribution or expenditure exceeding may be in cash.id.the colorado fair campaign practices act the campaign act requires an issue committee to register with the appropriate officer usually the secretary of state or county clerk before accepting contributions.see.the statement of registration must include the name of the issue committee the name of a registered agent the committee address and telephone number the identities of all affiliated candidates and committees and the purpose or nature of interest of the committee.id.
issue committees also must report all contributions and expenditures,including the name and address of any person who contributes or more,and the occupation and employer of any person who contributes or more.see id.a i ii.reports required to be filed with the county clerk such as the reports in this case,see id.must be filed days before the election,on the friday before the election,and days after the election and annually in years.see id.a ii.they must include the committee fund balance at the beginning of the reporting period,the total amounts of contributions and expenditures during the reporting period,and the name and address of the financial institution used by the committee.see id.b.
the reports are public records and are made available on the secretary of state website.see id.failure to comply with the registration and reporting requirements can result in civil penalties of fifty dollars per day for each day that a statement or other information required to be filed by the constitution or the campaign act is not filed by the close of business on the day due.const.art.xxviii,a,although the secretary or an administrative law judge alj can set aside or reduce a penalty upon a showing of good cause.see id.b,c.
the campaign act directs the secretary of state to promulgate such rules as may be necessary to enforce and administer any provision of the act.the rules are pages long.among other things,the rules require that each contribution or expenditure of or more be listed separately,see ccr,and that any change in the information disclosed in the registration form be reported within five days,see id.the secretary also publishes the colorado campaign and political finance manual,which has pages of text and another pages of appendices that reproduce the applicable constitutional,statutory,and regulatory provisions.the secretary website acknowledges that t he laws and rules governing campaign finances are complex,vol.ii at.the manual states that it provides guidelines and helpful tips for proper compliance with the law.id.at.but it is to be used for reference and training purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for legal advice.id.full capitalization omitted.indeed,if the secretary can not answer a question,he recommends retaining an attorney.see id.at,deposition of christi heppard,head of the department of secretary office.
private citizens can enforce these provisions by filing with the secretary of state a written complaint alleging a violation of the registration or reporting requirements.see.const.art.xxviii,a.within three days of filing,the secretary must refer the complaint to an alj who shall hold a hearing within fifteen days of the referral of the complaint,and shall render a decision within fifteen days of the hearing.id.if the alj determines that a violation occurred,the judge decision shall include any appropriate order,sanction,or relief authorized under article xxviii of the state constitution.id.further,a party in such a proceeding may be entitled to recover its attorney fees from an opposing attorney or party who brought or defended an action without substantial justification.the alj decision shall be final and subject to review by the colorado court of appeals.const.art.xxviii,a.the secretary can enforce the decision but if the secretary does not file an enforcement action within days of the decision,the private complainant may institute a private action for enforcement.see id.the prevailing party in a private enforcement action shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and costs.id.
b.the parker north annexation 
in,parker north resident david hopkins began to gather signatures for a petition seeking the annexation of parker north into the town of parker,colorado.he submitted the petition with the necessary signatures to the parker town council at a meeting on february.after the meeting plaintiff norman feck wrote a letter to parker mayor and council opposing annexation and distributed a copy of his letter to every household in parker north.plaintiffs karen sampson and tom sorg later met with feck and several other neighbors,and joined feck efforts.sorg discovered that residents could remove their signatures from hopkins annexation petition and encouraged neighbors to do so.he also started an discussion group for all parker north residents to debate annexation.several plaintiffs walked the neighborhood to discuss annexation with residents,wrote letters,and developed flyers that they distributed.plaintiff wes cornwell owned a printing shop and printed no annexation signs which he sold to parker north residents at cost.on march the parker town council declared hopkins petition invalid because a sufficient number of residents of parker north had withdrawn their signatures.
in april,hopkins and patsy putnam circulated a second petition to hold an annexation election,this time without language allowing residents to remove their signatures.plaintiffs again began efforts to oppose the petition.about this time hopkins learned of the campaign finance laws governing issue committees and registered the issue committee parker yes online on may.
to persuade their neighbors to oppose annexation,plaintiffs purchased and distributed no annexation signs,mailed to all residents of parker north a postcard summarizing the reasons to oppose annexation,continued to discuss and debate the issue on the internet,and on june submitted to the town council a document opposing annexation that was signed by residents.putnam and hopkins engaged in similar efforts to promote their side of the issue.on june the town council scheduled a meeting for august to decide whether to hold an annexation election.at that later meeting,it voted to hold the election on february.the proposed annexation was defeated to.
c.the complaint 
on july,putnam,with hopkins as her attorney,filed a complaint with the secretary of state alleging that plaintiffs had violated the campaign finance law by failing to register as an issue committee,to establish a committee bank account with a separate tax identification number,and to comply with the reporting requirements of colorado law.among the allegations was that plaintiffs illegal activities expos e all persons who have contacted or obtained campaign materials from plaintiffs with possible investigation,scrutinization and sanctions for campaign finance violations,vol.ii at.
the secretary referred the complaint to colorado office of administrative courts.plaintiffs obtained counsel and on counsel advice,plaintiff becky cornwell registered the issue committee no annexation on july,listing herself as the registered agent.the report,covering november,to july,showed nonmonetary contributions signs,a banner,postcards,and postage totaling from plaintiffs sampson,feck,and wes cornwell 
on july,putnam followed her complaint with a subpoena to produce the following 
all evidence of sales,purchases,gifts or any transfers of any materials concerning annexation of parker north into the town of parker,colorado,including signs,banners or campaign materials,showing the item,the amount contributed or expended,the fair market value of each such item and whether it was sold,gifted or otherwise transferred,listing the type of transfer.
names,addresses and telephone numbers for all persons who are or may be members of plaintiffs issue committee or group.
names,addresses and telephone numbers for all persons sold,gifted,or transferred signs,banners or any campaign information.
all evidence concerning amounts contributed and expended on the issue of annexation of parker north into the town of parker,colorado.
all bank account information concerning contributions,expenditures or campaign materials on the issue of annexation of parker north into the town of parker,colorado.
all issue committee registration information concerning the issue of annexation of parker north into the town of parker,colorado.
all reports made or due to any entity,including the colorado secretary of state,concerning the issue committee of plaintiffs or about the issue of annexation of parker north into the town of parker,colorado.
all communications amongst plaintiffs or anyone else concerning the issue of annexation of parker north into the town of parker,colorado.
examples of information or campaign materials sold,gifted or transferred to anyone concerning the issue of annexation of parker north into the town of parker,colorado.
plaintiffs objected to producing the information.but in a written ruling on august,the alj refused to quash the subpoena except he limited paragraph to include only the names and addresses of all committee members and the identities of all other persons or organizations that have participated with plaintiffs in opposing the annexation in question in any significant way he quashed the request for materials described in paragraph he said that plaintiffs need not produce material described in paragraphs,and that was available on the secretary of state website and he limited the production of materials described in paragraph to all communications amongst plaintiffs and any member of the issue committee and persons who have opposed the annexation in a significant way,vol.iv at.
in the meantime,on july,putnam,through her lawyer hopkins,sent plaintiffs a letter with a offer of settlement,vol.ii at.under the stipulation and guilty plea enclosed with the letter,plaintiffs would admit all charges against them and would either abandon their organized opposition to the annexation including removing all signs and campaign material or follow all laws governing issue committees.the letter gave plaintiffs four days to respond.
plaintiffs did not sign the agreement and a hearing was held before the alj on september.all plaintiffs took off from work to attend.after several hours of testimony by putnam,the parties reached a settlement.it stipulated that assuming,for purposes of the stipulation,that there was a ballot issue on or before june,plaintiffs met the state constitutional definition of an issue committee on that date,and that no fines,attorney fees,or other sanction would be imposed against any party or the attorneys.
plaintiffs lawsuit 
on september,the day before entering into the stipulation in the administrative proceeding,plaintiffs filed suit under in the united states district court for the district of colorado.their complaint alleged that the colorado law regulating committees violated the first amendment because the provision unconstitutionally chills free speech the registration and disclosure requirements unconstitutionally burden the constitutional rights to free speech and association and the disclosure requirements violate the right to anonymous speech and association.plaintiffs requested a declaration that the provision is facially unconstitutional a declaration that the registration and disclosure requirements are unconstitutional,facially,and as applied and a preliminary and permanent injunction against the secretary,prohibiting enforcement.plaintiffs also requested attorney fees and costs.
on september,the district court issued its decision on the parties cross motions for summary judgment.see sampson coffman,wl,unpublished.contrary to the parties contentions that the challenged campaign finance laws became applicable when the petition for annexation received its first signature,the court concluded that the challenged campaign finance laws did not apply to plaintiffs until the town first published notice of the annexation election on december.see id.at.it upheld the constitutionality of the challenged provisions as applied to plaintiffs after that date,although it stated that application of the law to plaintiffs activities before that date would have been unconstitutional.it declined to rule on plaintiffs challenge to the process because the administrative proceedings had terminated in a settlement.it did,however,award attorney fees to plaintiffs under.
on appeal plaintiffs raise the arguments that they presented to the district court.we agree with their first amendment argument,holding that the colorado registration and reporting requirements have unconstitutionally burdened their first amendment right of association.because of that ruling,we need not address their other contentions.the secretary has,arguing that the award was improper because plaintiffs failed to obtain any of the judicial relief requested in their complaint.but that argument is mooted by our disposition of plaintiffs appeal,so we affirm the award.
ii.discussion 
it is unlikely that the colorado voters who approved the disclosure requirements of article xxviii of the state constitution were thinking of the no annexation committee.the language of the article preamble relevant to campaigns explains its purpose as follows 
the people of the state of colorado hereby find and declare that large campaign contributions made to influence election outcomes allow wealthy individuals,corporations,and special interest groups to exercise a disproportionate level of influence over the political process that political contributions from corporate treasuries are not an indication of popular support for the corporation political ideas and can unfairly influence the outcome of colorado elections and that the interests of the public are best served by providing for full and timely disclosure of campaign contributions,independent expenditures,and funding of electioneering communications,and strong enforcement of campaign finance requirements.
const.art.xxviii,emphasis added.it would take a mighty effort to characterize the no annexation committee expenditure of for signs,a banner,postcards,and postage as an exercise of a disproportionate level of influence over the political process by a wealthy group that could unfairly influence the outcome of an election.id.the disconnect between the avowed purpose of the constitutional disclosure requirements and their effect in this case should in itself provoke doubt about whether the burden on the first amendment associational rights of the members of the no annexation committee could be justified.and,as we shall proceed to explain,an examination of first amendment doctrine confirms that doubt.
a.the right to associate and disclosure requirements 
without question,colorado election laws place burdens on the right to associate to support or oppose ballot issues.the colorado constitution restricts the meaning of issue committee to any person,other than a natural person,or any group of two or more persons,including natural persons.id.a.in other words,a single natural person is not subject to the disclosure or reporting requirements imposed on organizations such as the no annexation committee.individuals who expend more than on electioneering communications within a year or make an independent expenditure exceeding to support or oppose a candidate are required to make disclosures,see id,but those requirements do not apply to expenditures for ballot issues,see id.defining electioneering communication.in citizens against rent for fair housing city of berkeley,d,the supreme court held that a city ordinance burdened freedom of association because an affluent person was subject to no limits on spending to support a ballot measure,but contributions made in concert with others were so restricted.the court said there are,of course,some activities,legal if engaged in by one,yet illegal if performed in concert with others,but political expression is not one of them.id.
reporting and disclosure requirements,just as the limits on contributions in city of berkeley,can infringe on the right of association.see buckley valeo,d.as stated by justice brennan for a plurality in federal election commission massachusetts citizens for life,d,detailed and disclosure obligations,along with the duty to appoint a treasurer and custodian of records,impose administrative costs that many small entities may be unable to bear.see citizens united fed.election comm n,d,because of the burdens imposed on pacs,contributing through a pac is an inadequate substitute for direct contributions by the corporation itself.right to life comm,coffman,cir colorado constitutional provision requiring corporations to make independent expenditures only through segregated funds burdens corporate freedom of expression.
nevertheless,not all burdens on freedom of association are unconstitutional.in particular,disclosure requirements in the electoral context may be upheld if they survive exacting scrutiny.doe reed,d.that standard requires a substantial relation between the disclosure requirement and a sufficiently important governmental interest.to withstand this scrutiny,the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on first amendment rights.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether these governmental interests are sufficient to justify the requirements we must look to the extent of the burden that they place on individual rights.valeo,u.at.
when analyzing the governmental interest in disclosure requirements,it is essential to keep in mind that our concern is with ballot issues,not candidates.the legitimate reasons for regulating candidate campaigns apply only partially or perhaps not at all to campaigns.for example,the supreme court has upheld limits on contributions to candidates on the ground that the limits are necessary to avoid the risk or appearance of quid pro quo exchange of a contribution for political favor.see citizens united.at valeo,at limits on independent expenditures are unconstitutional because t he absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate,but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.limits on contributions to committees,in contrast,are unconstitutional because of the absence of any risk of quid pro quo corruption.see mcintyre ohio elections comm n,d city of berkeley,at first bank of boston bellotti,d the risk of corruption perceived in cases involving candidate elections simply is not present in a popular vote on a public issue.elam constr.reg l transp,cir invalidating resolution of governing body that district would not enter into contracts with companies that have contributed more than to referendum campaigns 
as for disclosure requirements specifically,the supreme court has recognized three proper justifications for reporting and disclosing campaign finances.the first is that reporting and disclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering the data necessary to detect violations of contribution limitations.valeo,at.the second is that publicizing large contributions and expenditures can deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption and can facilitate detection of favoritism.id.at.the third justification is an informational interest.disclosure of contributions and expenditures 
allows voters to place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the basis of party labels and campaign speeches.the sources of the candidate financial support also alert the voter to the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive and thus facilitates predictions of future performance in office.
the first and second grounds do not support reporting and disclosure requirements for committees.the the detection of violations of contribution mooted by the prohibition on contribution limitations in the context.and the corruption and its irrelevant because,as our prior discussion has pointed out,quid pro quo corruption can not arise in a campaign.see buckley am.constitutional law,aclf,d mcintyre ohio election comm n,d city of berkeley,at bellotti,at.
thus,the reporting and disclosure requirements for colorado issue committees at least those committees addressing ballot issues must be justified on the third informational interest.we must therefore analyze the public interest in knowing who is spending and receiving money to support or oppose a ballot issue.it is not obvious that there is such a public interest.candidate elections are,by definition,ad hominem affairs.the voter must evaluate a human being,deciding what the candidate personal beliefs are and what influences are likely to be brought to bear when he or she must decide on the advisability of future governmental action.the identities of those with strong financial ties to the candidate are important data in that evaluation.in contrast,when a ballot issue is before the voter,the choice is whether to approve or disapprove of discrete governmental action,such as annexing territory,floating a bond,or amending a statute.no human being is being evaluated.when many complain about the deterioration of public particular,the inability or unwillingness of citizens to listen to proposals made by particular people or by members of particular could wonder about the utility of ad hominem arguments in evaluating ballot issues.nondisclosure could require the debate to actually be about the merits of the proposition on the ballot.indeed,the supreme court has recognized that a nonymity provides a way for a writer who may be personally unpopular to ensure that readers will not prejudge her message simply because they do not like its proponent.mcintyre,at.
the supreme court has sent a mixed message regarding the value of financial disclosure in a campaign.perhaps its view can be summarized as such disclosure has some value,but not that much.although the court has never rejected a first amendment challenge to a requirement in the context,on three occasions it has spoken favorably of such requirements.
first,in bellotti the court invalidated a massachusetts statute prohibiting corporate expenditures in campaigns.at.as previously noted,the court stated that the risk of quid pro quo corruption is not present in such campaigns,id.at,and it observed that the voters are entrusted with the responsibility for judging and evaluating the relative merits of conflicting arguments.id.at.but it went on to say that the people may consider,in making their judgment,the source and credibility of the advocate,id.at,and appended a footnote saying that i dentification of the source of advertising may be required as a means of disclosure,so that people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected,id.at.
second,in city of berkeley the court similarly invalidated a municipal ordinance setting a cap on contributions to committees supporting or opposing ballot measures.see at.in response to the city argument that the contribution cap was necessary to identify those supporting or opposing a ballot measure,the court said that the cap was not necessary because another provision in the ordinance required disclosure.the court wrote,the integrity of the political system will be adequately protected if contributors are identified in a public filing revealing the amounts contributed if it is thought wise,legislation can outlaw anonymous contributions.id.at.
more recently,in aclf the court expressed approval for disclosure requirements when it struck several provisions in a colorado statute regulating the circulation of petitions to place initiatives on the ballot.at.one issue before the court was a statutory requirement to disclose the names of paid circulators and the amounts paid to each circulator.the court,without distinguishing between candidate and campaigns,wrote 
we explained in buckley that disclosure provides the electorate with information as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent,thereby aiding electors in evaluating those who seek their vote.we further observed that disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity t he state and supporting amici stress the importance of disclosure as a control or check on domination of the initiative process by affluent special interest groups disclosure of the names of initiative sponsors,and of the amounts they have spent gathering support for their initiatives,responds to that substantial state interest through the disclosure requirements that remain in place,voters are informed of the source and amount of money spent by proponents to get a measure on the ballot in other words,voters will be told who has proposed a measure,and who has provided funds for its circulation.
id.citations,brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.the court also wrote to inform the public where the money comes from,buckley,at internal quotation marks omitted,we reiterate,the state legitimately requires sponsors of ballot initiatives to disclose who pays petition circulators,and how much.id.at.the disclosure requirements referred to in these passages,however,were not challenged in the case before the court.the disclosure requirements that were disclosure of the names of paid circulators and the amounts paid to stricken because they could not be justified by the benefit they might add to the unchallenged disclosure requirements.see id.at.
thus,in all three cases the statements by the supreme court supporting disclosures in campaigns were dicta.the court has never upheld a disclosure provision for campaigns that has been presented to it for review.of course,this court takes supreme court dictum very seriously.united states serawop,cir we are bound by supreme court dicta almost as firmly as by the court outright holdings internal quotation marks omitted.but the absence of the precise and careful analysis necessary to resolve a particular issue fully presented to the court makes it difficult for us to assess the weight that should be granted the public interest in disclosure when balancing it against the burden on the first amendment right of association imposed by a particular statute in a particular circumstance.the difficulty is especially great when the court has also suggested the limits of the public interest in disclosure in the context.in mcintyre the court meticulously distinguished its precedents affirming disclosure requirements in candidate elections as it overturned a fine for distributing anonymous pamphlets opposing a school tax levy.see at.and it quoted the following passage from a new york court that struck down a similar statute 
of course,the identity of the source is helpful in evaluating ideas.but the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.do underestimate the common man.people are intelligent enough to evaluate the source of an anonymous writing.they can see it is anonymous.they know it is anonymous.they can evaluate its anonymity along with its message,as long as they are permitted,as they must be,to read that message.and then,once they have done so,it is for them to decide what is responsible,what is valuable,and what is truth.
id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted bellotti,at the inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source,whether corporation,association,union,or individual.
we also find it significant that in the recent decision in doe reed,d,the court affirmed a state law requiring disclosure of referendum petitions without reliance on the state asserted interest in providing information to the electorate about who supports the petition.see id.at.rather,the court relied on the utility of disclosure in preserving the integrity of the electoral process.see id.at.the concurring opinion of justice alito pointed out the breathtaking implications of the state contention 
that publicly disclosing the names and addresses of referendum signatories provides the voting public with insight into whether support for holding a vote comes predominantly from particular interest groups,political or religious organizations,or other group s of citizens,and thus allows voters to draw inferences about whether they should support or oppose the referendum.
id.at quoting brief for respondent washington families standing together.he continued 
were we to accept respondents asserted informational interest,the state would be free to require petition signers to disclose all kinds of demographic information,including the signer race,religion,political affiliation,sexual orientation,ethnic background,and memberships.requiring such disclosures,however,runs headfirst into a of our case law,which firmly establishes that individuals have a right to privacy of belief and association.
to be sure,typical laws are not nearly as sweeping as the types of requirements hypothesized by justice alito.they require disclosure of only name and address,and
