the plaintiffs in this case represent visually impaired registered voters in palm beach county,florida who sued theresa lepore,supervisor of elections for palm beach county,under federal and state law in the united states district court for the southern district of florida,for the county failure to make available audio components in voting booths to assist persons who are blind or visually impaired.
the district court entered summary judgment in favor of lepore,finding that the plaintiffs did not have standing to assert their claims and that their claims were also moot after thorough review,we agree that the case is moot,because,on this record,the requested audio components have been furnished by the defendant and will be available in all the county voting precincts in upcoming elections.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of the cause for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the relevant facts are straightforward and largely undisputed.richard troiano,harold cousminer,allen preston,dave evans,and the class of persons they represent are visually impaired individuals who are registered to vote in palm beach county elections.the defendant,theresa lepore,is the palm beach county supervisor of elections,an elected official responsible for administering the election process in the county.palm beach county has approximately registered voters,divided into voting precincts.
after the elections,the state legislature decertified the punch card voting machines that had been used in the county,making it necessary for the county to purchase and install a new voting machine system.on october,lepore signed an agreement with sequoia voting systems,to purchase voting units.with this purchase,special auxiliary devices were also provided at no additional charge.designed by sequoia voting systems,these devices allow visually impaired persons to vote independently for the first time in the history of palm beach county.each machine has a control pad,headphone,and audio component that reads the ballot aloud.after hearing the ballot choices,voters can press the appropriate buttons on the control pad to make their voting selections.thus,the sequoia machines enable visually impaired people to vote without assistance from anyone else.
like all election equipment used in florida,the audio component had to be certified by the florida department of state division of elections before it could be used.due to this requirement,lepore could not use or demonstrate the use of these components,or train poll workers to use the components,until the certification process was completed.certification of the sequoia audio component was not completed until august.
once the audio component was certified,lepore programmed one machine in each precinct to facilitate the use of the audio component,and also sent written instructions to poll workers regarding its use.she also began training poll workers in the use of this equipment before the primary elections in september.lepore hires and trains some poll workers for each election and must begin training four to five weeks in advance of election day.precinct clerks,assistant clerks,and precinct advisors receive a minimum of six hours training,while inspectors and deputies receive at least three hours.as part of this training,poll workers receive a voting manual and view three training videos,one of which instructs poll workers on how to serve persons with disabilities.two poll workers in each of the county precincts are trained to use the audio component.it takes between ten minutes and one hour to train each worker.in all,the supervisor office conducts between and training sessions,six days a week,to provide the necessary training for county poll workers.
to use the audio component,poll workers simply plug in the headphones and keypad and switch the voting machine into audio mode.it takes only seconds to switch the machine into audio mode.no programming is required at the individual precincts by the poll workers,since one machine per precinct was programmed to use the audio component for the september election.
prior to the september election,lepore and representatives from sequoia demonstrated the capabilities of the audio component on the new sequoia voting system and provided information to the coalition for independent living options,the national federation of the blind,and other organizations that provide services to the visually impaired.at the demonstrations,lepore indicated that the audio component would be available for use at each precinct in all future elections,including the september election.
during the september primary election,however,three of the named plaintiffs could not use the audio components,two preston and cousminer because they were told the equipment was unavailable,and one evans because the poll workers could not set up the equipment properly.lepore concluded that there had not been enough time to properly train all the poll workers and instructed the precinct clerks to call her office for instructions in case there were any questions regarding the use of the equipment.a computer programmer from the voting machine company was able to determine that in the september primary election two individuals in palm beach county used the audio component to vote and two others triggered the audio mode,but did not complete the voting process.
the ballot styles were recorded,proofread,and available for the november,election,having been prepared by an independent company.however,after a meeting with her staff,lepore elected to use the audio components only in the four main regional offices rather than in each of the precincts.the ballot for this election was the longest her office had ever dealt with.lepore had members of the staff read the ballot out loud,and concluded that if the audio component was used in every precinct,voters would have to wait too long for the people using the audio component to finish.to inform the public of her decision to limit access to the audio components,lepore sent media announcements to over different groups,including print and electronic media,political parties,and elected officials.the announcement was mailed on october,eight days before the election.lepore also instructed poll workers to announce that the audio components were available at each of the four main regional offices.in addition,she contacted spectran,a transportation service for the disabled,to arrange for transportation to the four polling places,and instructed poll workers to inform voters of this service.
prior to the november,election,plaintiff evans went to the supervisor of elections facility to receive instructions on how to use the audio component equipment to ensure that he could assist the poll workers at his precinct on election day.at the facility,he was informed that he could cast his ballot early using the audio component.however,when he actually tried to vote on november,the poll worker did not know how to switch the machine into audio mode or start the audio voting process,so evans had to wait for someone else to switch the machine into audio mode.the actual switching only took thirty seconds,but it took evans between twenty and minutes to listen to the voting instructions and the entire november,ballot and cast his vote.
on the same day,plaintiff cousminer was told at the polls that there was no audio equipment available at his precinct.poll workers did not inform cousminer that there was audio equipment available at four other locations or that transportation to these locations was available.cousminer tried to use a magnifying glass to read the ballot,but it was inadequate and his wife had to assist him in voting.likewise,plaintiff preston was told that the equipment was unavailable and not informed about the transportation to alternative locations.he too tried to use a magnifying glass,which proved inadequate.preston was forced to use a sample ballot he had prepared before the election and hope that it was in the same order as the actual ballot.
prior to the november election,plaintiff troiano called his polling place to inform them that he was blind.he was not advised that his precinct would not have the equipment available or that it would only be available at four locations.on election day,poll workers told troiano that the precinct was supposed to receive audio equipment but had not.they did not tell him that transportation was available to take him to the alternative locations.instead,two poll democrat,one to read the ballot to him.because they did not want to read the entire text of the amendments,they only read summaries,and troiano cast his vote based only on the summaries.
after the november,election,lepore decided on her own to use the audio component in all precincts in every future election regardless of the length of the ballot.according to lepore,t he whole audio process was new to everybody in the state and we had things that we did know,scenarios that we did know until we actually went through it.although lepore thought that she was not required to provide this equipment until,when local regulations require its use,she decided to provide it earlier because of a professed commitment to provide aid to persons with disabilities.she has averred that even if an election ballot is as long or longer than the november,ballot,she would still use the audio component.
most significantly,since the november election,voting machines actually have been in place in every precinct in every election,including those conducted on february,and on february,shortly after this lawsuit was filed on february,but before lepore was served with process on february.in addition to these two elections,there have been at least five additional municipal elections in which the audio component was available everywhere,including the election conducted on march,which required seventeen different ballots for seventeen different municipal elections.however,there have been no countywide elections since november.
on february,cousminer,evans,preston,and troiano filed a complaint against lepore,based on her failure to make adequately available the auxiliary devices to assist visually impaired persons to vote secretly.in count one,the plaintiffs specifically alleged discrimination in violation of the americans with disabilities act of,et.count two alleged discrimination in violation of the rehabilitation act of.in count three,the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief.finally,in count four,the plaintiffs also claimed that lepore violated.stat,for failing to timely notify voters of the availability of accessible voting machines at alternative locations.on may,lepore moved to dismiss the complaint,which the district court granted as to count four only.thereafter,the district court certified as a class any blind or visually impaired palm beach county residents who are registered to vote,but unable to independently read election ballots.
ultimately,both parties filed for summary judgment,and on november,the court granted defendant lepore motion,concluding both that the case was moot and that the plaintiffs lacked standing.see troiano lepore,slip.op.at.the plaintiffs sought reconsideration,but the application was denied.this appeal ensued.
mootness is the threshold question in this case a moot case is nonjusticiable and article iii courts lack jurisdiction to entertain it.as we have explained 
article iii of the constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to the consideration of cases and controversies.in turn,the case or controversy constraint imposes on federal courts a dual limitation known as justiciability.the doctrine of justiciability prevents courts from encroaching on the powers of the elected branches of government and guarantees that courts consider only matters presented in an actual adversarial context 
the doctrine of mootness derives directly from the limitation because an action that is moot can not be characterized as an active case or controversy.a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.as this court has explained,put another way,a case is moot when it no longer presents a live controversy with respect to which the court can give meaningful relief.if events that occur subsequent to the filing of a lawsuit or an appeal deprive the court of the ability to give the plaintiff or appellant meaningful relief,then the case is moot and must be dismissed.indeed,dismissal is required because mootness is jurisdictional.any decision on the merits of a moot case or issue would be an impermissible advisory opinion.

as we have previously observed,b ecause the judiciary is unelected and unrepresentative,the article iii limitation,as embodied in justiciability doctrine,presents an important restriction on the power of the federal courts.socialist workers party leahy,cir.this requirement goes to the heart of our constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers and the proper role of the judiciary.indeed,the supreme court has said that the case or controversy requirement defines with respect to the judicial branch the idea of separation of powers on which the federal government is founded.the several doctrines that have grown up to elaborate that requirement are founded in concern about the properly of the courts in a democratic society.allen wright,d quoting warth seldin,d.
whether a case is moot is a question of law that we review de novo.christian coalition of cole,cir citing united states.azalea specialists,cir.a district court findings of fact,however,are reviewed for clear error.united states snyder,cir.
the trial court in this case concluded that the case was mooted by events that occurred subsequent to the filing of the,the undisputed availability of the audio equipment in every precinct and for every election.see slip.op.at.the plaintiffs suggest,however,that these actions do not moot the case because provision of the new equipment was a voluntary cessation of objectionable conduct that the defendant could resume at any time after the termination of this suit.
the doctrine of voluntary cessation provides an important exception to the general rule that a case is mooted by the end of the offending behavior.the supreme court has written that m ere voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not moot a case if it did,the courts would be compelled to leave the defendant free to return to his old ways.united states concentrated phosphate export ass n,d quoting united states grant.it long has been the rule that voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case,does not make the case moot.sec y of labor burger king,cir quoting grant,at.at.
however,there is an important exception to this important exception,when there is no reasonable expectation that the voluntarily ceased activity will,in fact,actually recur after the termination of the suit.see grant,at.at the case may nevertheless be moot if the defendant can demonstrate that there is no reasonable expectation that the wrong will be repeated.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.moreover,when the defendant is not a private citizen but a government actor,there is a rebuttable presumption that the objectionable behavior will not recur.see coral springs,city of sunrise,cir g overnmental entities and officials have been given considerably more leeway than private parties in the presumption that they are unlikely to resume illegal activities.ragsdale turnock,cir c essation of the allegedly illegal conduct by government officials has been treated with more solicitude by the courts than similar action by private parties.
indeed,it has been suggested that 
courts are more likely to trust public defendants to honor a professed commitment to changed ways individual public defendants may be replaced in office by new individuals,with effects that have little parallel as to private defendants remedial calcula
