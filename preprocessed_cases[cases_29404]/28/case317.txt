arizona constitution provides no person who is adjudicated an incapacitated person shall be qualified to vote at any election,nor shall any person convicted of treason or felony,be qualified to vote at any election unless restored to civil rights.const.art.vii.arizona statutes give effect to this constitutional provision by suspending the voting rights of any person convicted of a felony.a,and automatically restoring those rights to any person convicted of only one felony,provided he.completes a term of probation or receives an absolute discharge from imprisonment,and.pays any fine or restitution imposed.a.
plaintiffs brought suits challenging arizona disenfranchisement scheme.their first argument was that disenfranchisement for felonies not recognized as such at common law violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.while plaintiffs acknowledged that section of the fourteenth amendment insulates schemes from equal protection challenges to some extent,see richardson ramirez,they argued that section only permits disenfranchisement for felonies.in their view,disenfranchisement for statutory felonies not recognized at common law has no affirmative sanction in section and violates the equal protection clause.
three of the plaintiffs also argued that conditioning the restoration of the right to vote upon the payment of their criminal fines and restitution violates various provisions of the united states and arizona constitutions.particularly,they alleged that this repayment condition violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,the amendment bar against poll taxes,the privileges or immunities clauses in both the federal and arizona constitutions,and the arizona constitution provision mandating free and equal elections.defendants motions to dismiss were granted,and plaintiffs now raise these same arguments on appeal.
we consider each of these arguments and affirm.
this is a consolidated appeal arising from two separate suits one on behalf of debra harvey and catherine beddard harvey plaintiffs,and another on behalf of armando coronado,joseph rubio,michael garza,michele convie,and raymond lewis coronado plaintiffs.
the harvey plaintiffs each have multiple felony convictions for drug or other offenses which were not felonies at common law.amended complaint at.while they claim they would otherwise be eligible to vote,arizona has denied them that right because of their felony convictions.they filed a suit against the governor and secretary of state of arizona,as well as the pima county recorder,challenging arizona disenfranchisement scheme for denial of the vote to plaintiffs and the consequent failure to accord them the equal protection of the laws in violation of the fourteenth amendment.amended complaint at.defendants moved to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim.they argued that section of the fourteenth amendment affirmatively permits the disenfranchisement of felons,that the reach of section is not limited to felonies at common law as plaintiffs suggest,and that the plaintiffs equal protection claims therefore fail.the district court,adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge,granted defendants motion and dismissed the suit.
the coronado plaintiffs also brought a suit against the same defendants plus the maricopa county recorder,alleging that they too were denied the right to vote because of convictions for offenses that,while classified as felonies under state law,did not constitute felonies at common law.coronado and garza were each convicted of one felony drug offense rubio was convicted of one felony count of attempted aggravated domestic violence convie and lewis were convicted of multiple felony drug offenses.they raised the same equal protection argument as the harvey plaintiffs with regard to section.
the coronado plaintiffs who had only one felony conviction coronado,garza,and rubio also challenged arizona scheme for restoring voting rights to felons.the crux of their argument was that,because they had served the entirety of their prison terms for a lone felony conviction,the only thing keeping them from having their voting rights automatically reinstated was their failure to pay the criminal fines and restitution orders included in their sentences.see.a.this,they argued,discriminates on the basis of wealth,conditions the right to vote on the payment of a fee,and violates various federal and state constitutional provisions.their complaint did not allege that any of them were incapable of paying the remainder of the money owed under their sentences.the defendants moved to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim,and the district court granted the motion.
plaintiffs timely filed notices of appeal,and defendants motion to consolidate these appeals was granted.
discussion 
we first address the argument,common to all plaintiffs,that the equal protection clause only permits felon disenfranchisement when the felonies at issue were felonies at common law.
equal protection and the felony theory of section 
section of the fourteenth amendment provides no state shall make or enforce any law which shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend.xiv.section further provides,in full 
representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers,counting the whole number of persons in each state,excluding indians not taxed.but when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states,representatives in congress,the executive and judicial officers of a state,or the members of the legislature thereof,is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state,being years of age,and citizens of the united states,or in any way abridged,except for participation in rebellion,or other crime,the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens years of age in such state.
const.amend.xiv,emphasis added.
section provides an electoral penalty against states that withhold the franchise from otherwise eligible voters.if a state disenfranchises some number of otherwise eligible voters,those disenfranchised persons will count against the state total population for purposes of determining its representation in congress.but section lifts this penalty when disenfranchisement is based on and this is the critical language participation in rebellion,or other crime.plaintiffs argue that this language should be read as participation in rebellion,or other felony.as an initial matter,it is not obvious how the scope of this section language affects a section equal protection claim to understand that issue,we turn to the supreme court opinion in richardson ramirez.
richardson 
richardson involved a group of convicted felons who had served the entirety of their sentences and sought to compel california election officials to register them as voters.they had been barred from voting under a california statute which excluded from the franchise all persons previously convicted of an infamous crime.id.at.the california supreme court sustained their equal protection challenges to the california law,concluding that the disenfranchisement of convicted felons beyond the expiration of their terms of imprisonment violated the equal protection clause.ramirez brown,cal.
in reaching that conclusion,the california supreme court relied primarily upon a supreme court decision striking down tennessee durational residence requirement as a condition on the right to vote.id.at discussing dunn blumstein.in nullifying the tennessee law at issue in dunn,the supreme court held that i t is not sufficient for the state to show that durational residence requirements further a very substantial state interest.i f there are other,reasonable ways to achieve those goals with a lesser burden on constitutionally protected activity,a state may not choose the way of greater interference.dunn,at.the california supreme court followed dunn reasoning and concluded that enforcement of modern statutes regulating the voting process and penalizing its than outright disfranchisement of persons convicted of today the method of preventing election fraud which is the least burdensome on the right of suffrage,and therefore outright disenfranchisement was not a necessary restriction under dunn rationale.ramirez,at.
in richardson,the supreme court reversed this judgment and,in doing so,looked primarily to section of the fourteenth amendment.the court reasoned that section equal protection clause could not be read to prohibit the disenfranchisement of felons because section approves of such disenfranchisement by removing any electoral penalty for it.richardson,at t he exclusion of felons from the vote has an affirmative sanction in of the fourteenth amendment.the court concluded that,in dealing with voting rights as it does,could not have been meant to bar outright a form of disenfranchisement which was expressly exempted from the less drastic sanction of reduced representation which imposed for other forms of disenfranchisement.id.at.today,a litigant bringing an equal protection challenge to a scheme must first face the formidable task of escaping richardson long shadow.but see hunter underwood,invalidating provision in alabama constitution authorizing disenfranchisement for persons convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude,including misdemeanors not punishable by imprisonment,where discrimination against blacks,as well as against poor whites,was a motivating factor for the provision.
plain meaning and contemporary usage of other crime 
plaintiffs proposed route around richardson is to argue that the affirmative sanction in section only extends to the disenfranchisement of persons convicted of felonies,a category that they do not fit into.plaintiffs identify the felonies as those listed by the supreme court in jerome united states,murder,manslaughter,arson,burglary,robbery,rape,sodomy,mayhem and larceny.plaintiffs further posit,with no support,that treason was a common law felony of a special sort,harvey br.at,but that is inaccurate.wharton criminal law torcia,at common law,there were three kinds of offenses treason,felony,and misdemeanor.so plaintiffs proposed reading of section as meaning except for participation in rebellion,or other felony is off to a bad start,because it appears participation in rebellion itself would qualify not as a felony,but as treason.
and plaintiffs interpretation is certainly not a plain reading of section terms,which permit disenfranchisement for participation in rebellion,or other crime without regard to whether the crime was a felony at all,much less one recognized at common law.as noted in richardson,this language was intended by congress to mean what it says.at.
plaintiffs proposed reading also seems to be in direct conflict with richardson,which held that california may exclude from the franchise convicted felons who have completed their sentences,at emphasis added,evincing no concern with whether any particular felony was one recognized at common law.indeed,at least one of the three in richardson was convicted of a crime that was clearly not a felony at common law.see richardson,at felony of heroin possession.still,neither this court nor the supreme court has directly addressed this precise question,so we consider plaintiffs reasons for looking beyond section plain language.
plaintiffs argue that the word crime at the time of the fourteenth amendment drafting and ratification commonly meant felony at common law.contra kentucky dennison,the word crime of itself includes every offence,from the highest to the lowest in the grade of offences,and includes what are called misdemeanors,as well as treason and felony.in support of this argument,plaintiffs cite a dictionary definition and william blackstone commentaries,which preceded the fourteenth amendment ratification by a century.harvey br.at.contemporaneousness aside,neither of these sources supports plaintiffs position that crime was commonly understood as being restricted to felonies.
webster dictionary defined the word crime in as an act which violates a law,divine or human but in a more common or restricted sense,a crime denotes violation of public law,of a deeper and more atrocious nature.noah webster,an american dictionary of the english language goodrich,emphasis in original.and william blackstone observed that in common usage the word crimes is made to denote such offenses as are of a deeper and more atrocious dye while smaller faults and omissions of less consequence are comprised under the gentler name of misdemeanors only.commentaries on the laws of england.
noticeably absent from these definitions is any mention whatsoever of felonies.while a litigant could use these definitions to support the proposition that the word crime in section refers only to serious crimes or felonies such that misdemeanors would not fit within the definition,that is not plaintiffs argument.they instead argue that in crimes meant felonies at common law,and nowhere in any of the definitions is it suggested that the word crimes was so confined.in fact,the cited definitions plainly undermine plaintiffs argument by omitting any reference to the common law.
even if we were to assume arguendo that section is limited to serious crimes or felonies as plaintiffs definitions suggest,a far better reference point for determining whether a crime is serious is to look at how the crime is designated by the legislature that proscribed it,rather than indulging the anachronisms of the common law.indeed,that is precisely the course the supreme court has charted in defining the contours of the right to a jury trial.
the sixth amendment provides in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,by an impartial jury const.amend.vi see also const.art.iii,cl.the trial of all crimes,except in cases of impeachment,shall be by jury.the supreme court has declined to extend this guarantee to petty offenses because such offenses were tried without a jury at common law.see duncan louisiana,cheff schnackenberg.but when determining what qualifies as a criminal prosecution that requires a jury trial,as opposed to the prosecution of a mere petty offense,the supreme court has rejected the rigid categories and instead sought more objective indications of the seriousness with which society regards the offense.blanton north las vegas,quoting frank united states.in that context,the supreme court has explained 
in fixing the maximum penalty for a crime,a legislature includes within the definition of the crime itself a judgment about the seriousness of the offense.the judiciary should not substitute its judgment as to seriousness for that of a legislature,which is far better equipped to perform the task,and is likewise more responsive to changes in attitude and more amenable to the recognition and correction of their misperceptions in this respect.
blanton,at citations,quotation marks,and brackets omitted.
at bottom,plaintiffs provide absolutely no support for the proposition that the word crimes meant felonies at the time of the fourteenth amendment ratification.at most,they have some support for the argument that section should be limited to serious offenses,a proposition which does not help their cause because they have all been convicted of crimes currently classified as felonies.
legislative history and the reconstruction and enabling acts 
with the plain meaning and contemporary usage of the word crime stacked against them,plaintiffs next turn to the legislative history of the fourteenth amendment.they find no support in the immediate drafting history or the debates surrounding the fourteenth amendment,which they argue should not count against them because the supreme court has noted that t he legislative history bearing on the meaning of the relevant language of is scant indeed.richardson,at.but what little history there is regarding inclusion of the word crime in section undermines plaintiffs argument.for instance,representative ephraim eckley of ohio made the following observation in support of section under a congressional act persons convicted of a crime against the laws of the united states,the penalty for which is imprisonment in the penitentiary,are now and always have been disfranchised.cong.globe,sess.like the dictionaries plaintiffs cite,this statement supports the view that crimes might be limited to serious crimes,or crimes the penalty for which is imprisonment in the penitentiary,but both of those categories include the plaintiffs offenses and conflict with their felony theory.
beyond this drafting history,f urther light is shed on the understanding of those who framed and ratified the fourteenth amendment,and thus on the meaning of,by the fact that at the time of the adoption of the amendment,states had provisions in their constitutions which prohibited,or authorized the legislature to prohibit,exercise of the franchise by persons convicted of felonies or infamous crimes.richardson,at citing state constitutions.of the state constitutions that richardson referred to,it does not appear that any of them limited disenfranchisement to persons convicted of felonies.see.const.art.vi,providing for disenfranchisement of persons convicted of bribery,perjury,forgery,or other high crimes or misdemeanors.const.art.vi,bribery,forgery,perjury,duelling,fraudulent bankruptcy,theft,or other offence for which an infamous punishment is inflicted.const.art.iv,convicted of a crime deemed by law a felony.const.art.ii,of any crime which is punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary.const.art.iii,convicted of any infamous offence.it would be remarkable if the many states ratifying the fourteenth amendment intended to nullify their own constitutional provisions,but that is exactly what plaintiffs reading of section entails.
finding no help in the history of the fourteenth amendment ratification,plaintiffs focus their argument on the reconstruction act of march.the reconstruction act was enacted by the congress in months after the very same congress submitted the fourteenth amendment to the states for ratification.section of the act established conditions on which the former confederate states would be readmitted to representation in congress.richardson,at.section of the act provided,in part 
that when the people of any one of said rebel states shall have formed a constitution of government in conformity with the constitution of the united states in all respects,framed by a convention of delegates elected by the male citizens of said state,years old and upward,of whatever race,color,or previous condition,who have been resident in said state for one year previous to the day of such election,except such as may be disenfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony at common law said state shall be declared entitled to representation in congress,and senators and representatives shall be admitted therefrom on their taking the oath prescribed by law,and then and thereafter the preceding sections of this act shall be inoperative in said state.
stat,emphasis added 
similarly,the various enabling acts used to readmit the confederate states to representation in congress provide,in nearly identical language,that a fundamental condition of readmission is that their state constitutions shall never be so amended or changed as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the united states of the right to vote in said state,who are entitled to vote by the constitution thereof herein recognized,except as a punishment for such crimes as are now felonies at common law.stat.emphasis added readmitting north carolina,south carolina,louisiana,georgia,alabama and florida see also stat.readmitting arkansas stat.readmitting virginia stat.readmitting mississippi.plaintiffs conclude that because the reconstruction and enabling acts only permitted disenfranchisement for felonies at common law,so too must section of the fourteenth amendment be read to only permit disenfranchisement for felonies at common law.
but the opposite is true.the reconstruction act reference to felonies at common law only shows that when the congress meant to specify felonies at common law,it was quite capable of using that phrase.that congress used the phrase other crime in section,while specifying felony at common law in a later act,clearly indicates that the two phrases have different meanings and congress was capable of using each when it intended to do so.
plaintiffs is really the driving force of their entire that we must read section and the reconstruction and enabling acts harmoniously and interpret them identically because to do otherwise would mean that the fourteenth amendment is in direct and absolute conflict with the reconstruction and enabling acts.harvey br.at.that is,if we reject plaintiffs argument,the fourteenth amendment would permit what the reconstruction act explicitly prohibits disenfranchisement for statutory felonies.see harvey br.at section,as construed by the district court,affirmatively authorizes disenfranchisement for statutory felonies.the acts prohibit disenfranchisement for statutory felonies.it is hard to imagine a more conflict.
the most glaring flaw with this argument is that the absence of a constitutional prohibition does not somehow bar a statutory one.simply because the fourteenth amendment does not itself prohibit states from enacting a broad array of felon disenfranchisement schemes does not mean that congress can not do so through,of course,that congress has the authority to enact such a prohibition.plaintiffs confusion on this point seems to stem from language in richardson,in which the supreme court noted that felon disenfranchisement is given an affirmative sanction in section of the fourteenth amendment.at.but the affirmative sanction language in richardson only means that the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment does not prohibit felon disenfranchisement because section brings it outside of section prohibition.it certainly does not mean that a certain felon disenfranchisement scheme is constitutionally mandated by section,as plaintiffs would read it.
plaintiffs reliance on the eleventh circuit opinion in johnson governor of florida,cir,is also misguided.johnson held that claims are not cognizable under the voting rights act vra,which proscribes states from enacting voter qualifications or standards that discriminate based on race.id.at.as support for this conclusion,it reasoned that if section of the vra extended to such claims,the vra would prohibit a practice that the fourteenth amendment permits florida to maintain.johnson,at.
the eleventh circuit point was not that the vra would somehow conflict with section of the fourteenth amendment if it were interpreted to bar felon disenfranchisement,but that it would be beyond congress section enforcement power.see const.amend xiv,the congress shall have power to enforce,by appropriate legislation,the provisions of the fourteenth amendment.see also baker pataki,cir opinion of mahoney,a ny attempt by congress to subject felon disenfranchisement provisions to the results methodology of the vra would pose a serious constitutional question concerning the scope of congress power to enforce the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.farrakhan washington,cir kozinski,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc arguing that felon disenfranchisement claims are not cognizable under the vra.the argument in johnson was that a congressional act prohibiting felon disenfranchisement could not be authorized under congress section powers because such an act would not be enforcing the fourteenth amendment,which plainly permits felon disenfranchisement.but see farrakhan washington,cir.
but the reconstruction act was most assuredly not enacted under the section power,as it preceded the fourteenth amendment ratification by more than a year.oregon mitchell,u,harlan,concurring in part and dissenting in part discussing the reconstruction congress power to interfere with state voter qualifications,positing that this power was said to exist in a variety of constitutional provisions,including art.i,art.i,the war power,the power over territories,the guarantee of a republican form of government,and of the thirteenth amendment.johnson,therefore,is inapposite.
finally,
