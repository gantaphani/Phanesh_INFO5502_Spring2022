since,nevada has given its voters the ability to register their disapproval of all the named candidates running for a particular office in statewide and presidential elections by voting for none of these candidates,commonly referred to as notc.the secretary of state must count and report to the public the number of notc ballots cast for each office,but they can not be counted in determining the winner among the named candidates in those races.they do,of course,provide a way for disaffected voters to express themselves other than by simply not voting.in june,plaintiffs challenged this year old state election law by suing in the united states district court for the district of nevada to prohibit the notc option from appearing on the november ballot and any others thereafter.their contention is that unless notc votes are given legal effect in some manner,those voters are disenfranchised and so the notc option can not appear on the ballot at all.although the merits of their arguments are questionable we do not resolve them because we hold that none of these plaintiffs has standing to assert the claims made in this lawsuit.
background 
in,the nevada legislature passed a law permitting voters to register their opposition to all candidates running in statewide or presidential races by casting a ballot for none of these candidates instead of one of the named candidates.see.the statute has three subsections.section mandates the inclusion of a none of these candidates option on every ballot for any statewide office or for president and vice president of the united states.section provides that only votes cast for named candidates shall be counted in determining the winner of those elections.section provides that voters shall be instructed that they may select none of these candidates only if they have not voted for any named candidate in a particular race 
as plaintiffs themselves argue,was enacted with the sole intent of providing voters the opportunity to express their lack of confidence in all of the candidates for elected office to send a message to candidates that they need to clean up their act if they get into office.minutes,assembly election committee,nevada state assembly,see also none of the above,wall,a heavy vote in the notc space would,of course,be a strong expression of displeasure with available choices.tom gardner,candidate none did do as well in the general,reno evening gazette,noting that the bill original intent was to give voters an opportunity to express lack of confidence in a candidate.
in presidential,senatorial and gubernatorial general elections,notc has typically garnered only a few percent of the vote.see nate silver,in nevada,no one is someone to watch,fivethirtyeight,times,http.in primary elections,however,the ballots cast for notc have at times exceeded those cast for one or more named candidates.for example,in the presidential primaries,more voters cast ballots for notc than for ted kennedy,and primary winner jimmy carter only narrowly beat notc.see chris black,the political revolution how to throw the bums out,boston globe,at a,wlnr see also christopher carmichael,proposals for reforming the american electoral system after the presidential election universal voter registration,mandatory voting,and negative balloting,hamline.pol y,identifying several occasions on which notc garnered more ballots than votes received by named candidates.
in june,eleven plaintiffs filed suit against the nevada secretary of state,alleging that disenfranchises voters by disregarding ballots cast for notc in determining the winner of elections.seven plaintiffs are democratic,republican or independent registered voters who intend to vote but have not expressed an intent to cast a ballot for notc in any election.two plaintiffs expressed an intent to cast a ballot for notc.the final two plaintiffs were republican designees for presidential electors for the november general election.the nevada republican party,which expressed its strong interest in ensuring that none of these candidates does not appear as a ballot option,joined this appeal in support of the plaintiffs.
of critical importance,the operative complaint does not challenge subsection of the notc statute that is,plaintiffs do not assert that the requirement that notc appear on the ballot violates federal constitutional or statutory provisions.plaintiffs challenge only subsection of the notc statute.they argue that the state refusal to give legal effect to ballots cast for notc disenfranchises voters who cast such ballots.although plaintiffs challenge only subsection,the remedy they seek is not that the state be ordered to give legal effect to ballots cast for notc.rather,they ask that the state be enjoined from allowing notc to appear on the ballot altogether.
plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the state from allowing notc to appear on any ballot,including the ballot for the november election.the district court granted plaintiffs motion and stated that it would bar the state from allowing notc to appear on the ballot.
the nevada secretary of state and intervenor kingsley edwards immediately appealed and filed emergency motions to stay the district court order a motions panel of this court granted a stay of the injunction pending appeal.see townley miller,cir.notc consequently appeared on the november ballot.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over the district court entry of a preliminary injunction under a.we review de novo questions of article iii justiciability,including standing.see porter jones,cir.
discussion 
to establish standing,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he suffered an injury in fact,an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical that there is a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,such that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and that the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.at the preliminary injunction stage,plaintiffs must make a clear showing of each element of standing.see id.at e ach element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.lopez candaele,cir articulating clear showing as the burden of proving standing at the preliminary injunction stage.
plaintiffs seek injunctive relief,not damages,and a s a general rule,in an injunctive case this court need not address standing of each plaintiff if it concludes that one plaintiff has standing.ass of optometrists opticians lenscrafters,brown,cir we therefore examine whether at least one plaintiff has standing in this case.
non notc voter plaintiffs 
according to the first amended complaint,seven plaintiffs expressed an intent to vote but did not assert an intent to cast a ballot for notc in the november election or any subsequent election.plaintiffs argue that these individuals are harmed by the prospect of their ballots not being counted or given legal effect,depending on whether they cast their ballots for none of these candidates.
the voter plaintiffs have not suffered an that is actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.the proposition that these plaintiffs have standing because they may,at some point,depending on which candidates decide to run in a future election,choose to cast a ballot for notc and therefore be denied a right that they assert exists epitomizes speculative injury.this category of plaintiffs therefore lacks standing.
notc voter plaintiffs 
two plaintiffs,jenny riedl and todd dougan,have asserted a concrete intent to cast ballots for notc.plaintiffs argue that riedl and dougan have standing because c learly,a person who intends to cast his ballot of none of these candidates is a proper party to litigate whether it is proper for secretary miller to present none of these candidates as a ballot alternative,and then disregard ballots cast for it.
we agree with plaintiffs that th
