a group of voters and aspiring congressional candidates challenge the constitutionality of the open primary law,proposition,approved by the voters in june.plaintiffs contest two aspects of senate bill,the legislation adopted to implement the proposition.bill reg.sess,hereafter sb see legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.at issue are elections code section,which precludes candidates from stating on the ballot a preference for a nonqualified political party,and elections code section,which prohibits the counting of votes at the general election for offices covered by proposition.
our review of relevant case law leads us to conclude both statutes are constitutional.the objection to the party labeling restriction on the ballot is essentially the same as the one rejected in libertarian party of california march fong eu cal d libertarian party.the challenge to the vote counting ban rests on the erroneous premise that sb allows votes that can not be counted to be lawfully cast.we therefore affirm the order denying plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of proposition.
background 
proposition and qualified parties 
as defined in the elections code the term party means a political party or organization that has qualified for participation in any primary election.a party qualifies for participation in a primary election by polling a sufficient number of votes at a gubernatorial election percent of the statewide vote,having a sufficient number of voters affiliate with the party percent of the vote at the last gubernatorial election,or by petitioning for qualification with the signatures of a sufficient number of voters percent of the vote at the last gubernatorial election.california currently recognizes six qualified parties american independent,democratic,green,libertarian,peace and freedom,and republican.see http,as of september.

plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of proposition and sb.arguments on the motion confirmed that plaintiffs were raising facial challenges to sb constitutionality.the motion was denied,based primarily on plaintiffs failure to show a likelihood of success on the merits.
ii.discussion 
scope of review 
an appeal from an order granting or denying a preliminary injunction o rdinarily involves a very limited review of the trial court exercise of discretion concerning two factors the likelihood that plaintiffs will ultimately prevail and the interim harm plaintiffs will sustain if the preliminary injunction is denied compared to the interim harm defendant will suffer if the injunction is granted pending a final determination of the merits.citations.occasionally,however,the likelihood of prevailing on the merits depends upon a question of pure law rather than upon evidence to be introduced at a subsequent full trial.this issue can arise,for example,when it is contended that an ordinance or statute is unconstitutional on its face and that no factual controversy remains to be tried.if such a question of pure law is presented,it can sometimes be determinative over the other factor,for example,when the defendant shows that the plaintiff interpretation is wrong as a matter of law and thus the plaintiff has no possibility of success on the merits.citations.hunter city of whittier d,hunter.
this case presents no reason to engage in an analysis of the parties respective hardships.because plaintiffs likelihood of prevailing turns entirely on pure issues of law,we may independently review the trial court determination of the legal issues and pass upon the merits of the case.see citizens to save california california fair political practices com.th,where a case is clear and no fact questions are presented,a determination on the merits is appropriate and becomes law of the case north coast coalition woods d,where t he issue of the validity of the challenged regulations is solely one of law this court is in as good a position to resolve the issue now as the trial court would be after determination of this appeal see also king meese cal d.
party designations on the ballot 
plaintiffs arguments and the applicable statutes 
plaintiffs mackler and martin allege in the first amended complaint that their inability under sb to state a party preference on the ballot for a party violates their constitutional rights.in their briefing they contend that they have the right,at a bare minimum,to identify themselves on the ballot as independent.they submit that sb nonqualified p arty p reference b an violates the first and fourteenth amendments,the free speech clause of the california constitution cal,art.i,subd.a,the federal elections clause,art.i,cl,and the california equal protection clause cal.it is unclear whether plaintiffs fourteenth amendment claim refers to the rights to freedom of speech,freedom of association,and equal protection collectively or only some of them.
plaintiffs first challenge section,subdivision a,which,as amended by sb,reads as follows in the case of candidates for a office in a primary election,a general election,or a special election to fill a vacancy in the office of united states senator,member of the united states house of representatives,state senator,or member of the assembly,immediately to the right of and on the same line as the name of the candidate,or immediately below the name if there is not sufficient space to the right of the name,there shall be identified in roman lowercase type the name of the political party designated by the candidate pursuant to section.the identification shall be in substantially the following form my party preference is the party.if the candidate designates no political party,the phrase no party preference shall be printed instead of the party preference identification.if the candidate chooses not to have his or her party preference list on the ballot,the space that would be filled with a party preference designation shall be left blank.sb,italics added.
section,subdivision a,added by sb,provides a candidate for a office may indicate his or her party preference,or lack of party preference,as disclosed upon the candidate most recent statement of registration,upon his or her declaration of candidacy.if a candidate indicates his or her party preference on his or her declaration of candidacy,it shall appear on the primary and general election ballot in conjunction with his or her name.the candidate designated party preference on the ballot shall not be changed between the primary and general election.a candidate for office may also choose not to have the party preference disclosed upon the candidate most recent affidavit of registration indicated upon the ballot.sb.
plaintiffs and the secretary believe,and we agree,that the term party in sections,subdivision a,and refers to an organization that is a qualified political party as described in section.see elections code definitions govern construction of the code u nless the provision or the context otherwise requires.therefore,a candidate party preference will not be shown on the ballot unless the candidate prefers a qualified party.candidates like plaintiffs mackler and martin who indicate a preference for nonqualified parties like socialist action or reform will be deemed to not have designated a party preference on their declaration of candidacy,and will be identified on the ballot as having no party preference,unless they choose to leave the space for a party preference designation blank,subd.a.
interveners invite us to avoid the constitutional issues plaintiffs raise by construing the term party in sections,subdivision a,and to mean any party a candidate designates,whether qualified or not we acknowledge that courts should,if reasonably possible,construe a statute in a manner that avoids any doubt about its constitutional validity.kleefman vonage holdings cal th,kleefman.if a statute is susceptible of two constructions,one of which renders it constitutional and the other unconstitutional or raises serious and doubtful constitutional questions,the court will adopt the construction which will render it free from doubt as to its constitutionality,even if the other construction is equally reasonable.jonathan superior court th,jonathan.we are also mindful that,in the context of a facial challenge to a statute constitutionality,we should not jump to conclusions about how the statute will be administered.see.state grange.state republican party,d c laims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation,and courts should avoid premature interpretations of statutes in such cases.however,we can be confident that the secretary interpretation will govern here,the secretary administers the elections code,and interveners proposed alternative construction is not as reasonable as the secretary.nothing in the language or context of sections,subdivision a,and suggests that the term party as used there means anything other than a qualified party as defined in section.
constitutional rights and balancing 
restricting the party label a candidate can use on an election ballot implicates the candidate constitutional rights to freedom of speech,freedom of association,and equal protection.see libertarian party,supra,cal d at,party claimed that its candidates inability to identify themselves on the ballot as party members violated rights to associate and equal protection schrader blackwell cir,schrader same rubin city of santa monica cir,rubin candidate argued that inability to identify himself on the ballot as a peace activist violated his right to freedom of speech.t o the extent that party labels provide a shorthand designation of the views of party candidates on matters of public concern,the identification of candidates with particular parties plays a role in the process by which voters inform themselves for the exercise of the franchise.schrader,supra,at,quoting tashjian republican party.
however,s tates may,and inevitably must,enact reasonable regulations of parties,elections,and ballots to reduce election and disorder.timmons twin cities area new party,d timmons.the united states constitution grants states broad power to prescribe the time,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,art.i,cl,which power is matched by state control over the election process for state offices.tashjian republican party,supra,at quoting the federal elections clause.s tates have significant authority to regulate the identification of candidates on the ballot,and those contesting such regulations bear a heavy constitutional burden.schrader,supra,at.
federal constitutional challenges to election laws are resolved with a balancing test.w e weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the state rule imposes on constitutional rights against the interests the state contends justify that burden,and consider the extent to which the state concerns make the burden necessary.citations.regulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs rights must be narrowly tailored and advance a compelling state interest.lesser burdens,however,trigger less exacting review,and a state important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions.timmons,supra,at,quoting burdick takushi,d burdick,and anderson celebrezze,d.the same balancing test is employed to decide election law issues arising under the california constitution.edelstein city county of san francisco cal th,edelstein california follow s closely the analysis of the united states supreme court in such matters.
the libertarian party case is controlling 
the relevant considerations in the balancing analysis we must undertake here were applied over years ago in the libertarian party case.there,two members of the libertarian party qualified for a general election ballot pursuant to the independent nomination procedure then set forth in section et by submitting nomination papers for the offices sought,signed by a sufficient number of voters in their districts.libertarian party,supra,cal d at see current et the libertarian party was not at the time a qualified political party in california.former section,the predecessor to section at issue here,provided that the qualified political party with which the candidate is affiliated would be printed on the ballot next to the name of a candidate,but that i f a candidate has qualified for the ballot by virtue of an independent nomination,the word independent shall be printed instead of the name of a political party id.at,fn.following the statute directive,the secretary rejected the candidates demands to be identified on the ballot as libertarian,rather than independent.
the libertarian party sued the secretary and county election officials,citing its rights to equal protection and due process,and arguing that prohibiting its candidates from having their party identified on the ballot was an unconstitutional impairment of the fundamental rights to associate for political activity and to vote.libertarian party,supra,cal d at.the court reversed a judgment directing that the candidates be designated as libertarian on the ballot,holding that the identification provision of former section imposes an insubstantial burden on the rights to associate and to vote and that the statute serves a compelling state interest to protect the integrity and stability of the electoral process in california.id.at.
in concluding that former section did not substantially burden constitutional rights,the court observed that the statute denies access to the ballot to no one.it merely provides for a ballot designation,party affiliation.libertarian party,supra,cal d at.the court also observed that the libertarian party is in no way restricted in its associational activities or in its publication of the affiliation of its candidates.it is only proscribed,so long as it remains unqualified,from designating the affiliation on the ballot.id.at.
m aintenance of the integrity of the distinction between qualified and nonqualified parties serves a compelling state interest and the restriction of party designation on the ballot set forth in section furthers that interest without substantially impairing the rights of political association and voting.libertarian party,supra,cal d at.the court explained that to become qualified,a party needed to demonstrate a threshold of voter support,either through voter registration equal to percent of the statewide vote at the last gubernatorial election,or a petition signed by voters equaling percent of that vote.id.at.there is surely an important state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization candidate on the ballot the interest,if no other,in avoiding confusion,deception,and even frustration of the democratic process at the general election.id.at,quoting and italicizing jenness fortson,d jenness.
given the importance of the state interest in the integrity of the election process,section did not unlawfully discriminate against nonqualified political parties.there is no question that the designation of party beside the name of the qualified party candidate gives information to voters which is not given as to candidates of the nonqualified parties.that distinction,however,is implicit in and essential to an electoral system that places minimum qualifications upon parties to achieve qualified status.libertarian party,supra,cal d at.
allowing nonqualified parties to be listed on the ballot would cause deception,and even frustration of the democratic process in california.libertarian party,supra,cal d at.until a political party becomes qualified,it is not a party whose access to the ballot is secured under the provisions for nomination of qualified party candidates,and it would be misleading to designate the candidate of that political group as a political party candidate on the ballot.id.at.i f each independent candidate could decide for himself what nonqualified party he should be listed as affiliated with,the significance of qualified party affiliation would be masked.the legislative purpose in giving substance to party affiliation by limiting party ballot designation to qualified parties would be destroyed.id.at.
we discern no material distinction between the issues presented in libertarian party and this case.in libertarian party,as here,constitutional challenges were brought because candidates were unable to use their preferred political party designations on the ballot.under former section,candidates who wished to be associated with nonqualified political parties were identified on the ballot as independent under current section candidates who want to be associated with nonqualified political parties will be identified as having no party preference.in each instance,the statutorily mandated labels are to the same degree both accurate and misleading.the candidates in libertarian party could be termed independent because they had qualified for the ballot through the process of independent nomination.libertarian party,supra,cal d at,noting that fact,and thus in that sense such candidates are independent of qualified political parties.similarly,the candidates here can be described as having no party preference because they have not identified themselves with any qualified political party.but the independent label in libertarian party was misleading insofar at it implied that the candidates there were independent of any party,even though they were in fact members of the libertarian party.the no party preference label here is likewise misleading insofar as it implies that plaintiffs do not subscribe to any political party,even though they identify with parties that are nonqualified.current section is in fact less coercive than former section,because it does not,as plaintiffs claim,force them to state that they have no party preference under section,nonqualified party candidates can choose to leave the space for a party preference designation blank.
accordingly,we conclude that libertarian party is controlling and dispositive of plaintiffs constitutional arguments against the nonqualified party preference ban provided in sb.
plaintiffs argue that libertarian party can not be applied here because the case was based on a qualified party system that proposition and sb dismantled by doing away with partisan primaries.this contention is persuasively refuted in interveners appellate brief,which identifies many rights that continue to be reserved for qualified parties under the proposition and sb open primary system.cal,art.ii,subd.c exclusive rights of qualified parties to nominate candidates for president of the united states,participate in presidential primaries,and limit participation by nonaffiliated voters in presidential primaries exclusive right of qualified party to have letter or party contributor envelope mailed with sample ballot to voters registered as preferring that party state maintains voter registration rolls for qualified parties state conducts elections for qualified parties officers and central committees see also,subd.b exclusive right of qualified parties,under sb,to print endorsements for office in the sample ballot.consequently,we do not agree with plaintiffs that proposition and sb eliminated the distinction between qualified and nonqualified parties that was pivotal to the decision in libertarian party.
subsequent cases support libertarian party holding 
decisions after libertarian party have not called its reasoning into question other than to make clear that the strict scrutiny standard is not applied to review election laws like those here that do not substantially burden constitutional rights.timmons,supra,at.so,even though libertarian party applied a more stringent standard than necessary by identifying compelling state interests that justified a nonqualified party preference ban,the ban survival of such heightened scrutiny in libertarian party only weakens plaintiffs case.apart from clarifying the applicable balancing test,subsequent cases support the libertarian party decision.
the most noteworthy decision,timmons,supra,involved a constitutional challenge to a minnesota law that prohibited a candidate from appearing on the ballot as the candidate of more than one party.the twin cities area new party new party chose as their candidate for state office an individual who was running unopposed for the office in another party primary.ibid.because that individual had already filed as a candidate for the other party nomination,election officials refused to accept the new party nominating petition.the new party arguments against the ban on,or fusion,candidacies were essentially the same as those raised by plaintiffs here the new party contends that the fusion ban burdens its right to communicate its choice of nominees on the ballot on terms equal to those offered other parties,and the right of the party supporters and other voters to receive that information,and insists that communication on the ballot of a party candidate choice is a critical source of information for the great majority of voters who rely upon party labels as a voting guide.id.at.
the court conceded that the minnesota law slightly limited the new party ability to send a message to the voters,but was unpersuaded by the party contention that it has a right to use the ballot itself to send a particularized message to the voters,about the nature of its support for the candidate.ballots serve primarily to elect candidates,not as fora for political expression.timmons,supra,at see also id.at ballot would be transformed from a means of choosing candidates to a billboard for political advertising if candidates could identify themselves with parties such as no new taxes,conserve our environment and stop crime now.the court observed that the new party remained otherwise free to spread its message to all who will listen id.at,and concluded that the fusion ban burden on the party associational rights was not severe id.at.similar reasoning led the court in libertarian party to conclude that california law preventing candidates from using nonqualified party labels on the ballot imposed only an insubstantial burden on constitutional rights.libertarian party,supra,cal d at,law merely limited ballot designations and did not preclude publication of party affiliation.
timmons concluded that the burdens minnesota fusion ban imposes on new party associational rights are justified by correspondingly weighty valid state interests in ballot integrity and political stability.timmons,supra,at.with respect to political stability,the court explained that the states interest permits them to enact reasonable election regulations that may,in practice,favor the traditional system,and that temper the destabilizing effects of and excessive factionalism.the constitution permits the minnesota legislature to decide that political stability is best served through a healthy system.citations.and while an interest in securing the perceived benefits of a stable system will not justify unreasonably exclusionary restrictions citation,states need not remove all of the many hurdles third parties face in the american political arena today.id.at.this reasoning strongly supports the decision in libertarian party,which was based primarily on california compelling interest in distinguishing between qualified and nonqualified parties.libertarian party,supra,cal d at citing,among other things,california interest in the stability of its political system.california restriction of party labels on the ballot is less constitutionally problematic than the one upheld in timmons because it protects a system of multiple qualified parties,not merely the top two.
subsequent federal circuit court cases are also in accord with libertarian party.schrader,supra,like libertarian party,concerned a statute that precluded candidates of nonqualified parties from listing their party affiliations on the ballot.schrader upheld the statute for the same reasons as those identified in libertarian party.schrader,supra,at,quoting timmons,supra,at no severe burden on associational rights schrader,at,quoting jenness,supra,at importance of state interest that party have significant support.rubin,supra,upheld a regulation that prohibited a candidate from listing peace activist as his occupation on the ballot as in libertarian party,the candidate had no constitutional right to his preferred description.id.at declining to separately address candidate equal protection and first amendment claims see also id.at burden of ballot restriction was greatly decrease d by candidate ability to have a candidate statement included in the voter information pamphlet lightfoot march fong eu cir,libertarian party concluded,correctly that inability to identify a candidate on the ballot as libertarian did not infringe on the party freedom of association party was free to associate with the candidate in every way that counts.
plaintiffs case authorities are distinguishable 
plaintiffs cite in support of their position several california cases that preceded the decision in libertarian party stanson mott cal d gould grubb cal d and rees layton d.any light these cases may shed on the issue before us is eclipsed by libertarian party,which is directly on point.the cases are inapposite.stanson mott,supra,cal d at,public agency can not expend public funds to promote a partisan position in an election campaign gould grubb,supra,cal d at incumbents can not automatically be afforded a top position on the ballot rees layton,supra,d at incumbents can not be the only candidates allowed to list their occupation on the ballot.
plaintiffs federal election clause claim is based on cook gralike.d cook,which,in the rubin court words,involved a constitutional provision stand ing in stark contrast to statutes like sb.rubin,supra,at.article viii of the missouri constitution instructed members of the state congressional delegation to support term limits for members of the congress.cook,supra,at.missouri senators and representatives who failed to take one of eight specified legislative acts in support of term limits would have the words disregarded voters instructions on term limits printed in all capital letters adjacent to their names on primary and general election ballots.ibid.nonincumbent congressional candidates who did not pledge to take one of the enumerated legislative acts would be designated with the words declined to pledge to support term limits in all capital letters.
giving candidates such a scarlet letter on the ballot exceeded the state power to regulate the times,places and manner of congressional elections under the elections clause.cook,supra,at,art.i,cl.the elections clause is not a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes,to favor or disfavor a class of candidates,or to evade important constitutional restraints.cook,at.the labels provided in missouri article viii surely place d their targets at a political disadvantage to unmarked candidates id.at.the labels implied that term limits were an important perhaps paramount consideration in the citizen choice,which may decisively influence the citizen to cast his ballot against candidates branded as unfaithful.ibid.article viii thereby disfavored a class of candidates and attempted to dictate electoral outcomes in violation of the elections clause.id.at.
the ballot labels required under proposition and sb are not comparable to those in cook.the designation no party preference is not pejorative or,and furthers the state legitimate interest in maintaining its qualified party system.the designation raises no elections clause issue under the reasoning of cook.
we turn finally to rosen brown cir rosen,and bachrach secretary of commonwealth bachrach,which plaintiffs argue stand for the proposition that they are constitutionally entitled to be listed on the ballot as independent,rather than as having no party preference.as we have explained,we view the issue in the libertarian party case,where a candidate who wanted to identify himself as a libertarian and objected to the independent label,to be the same as the one here,where candidates wishing to identify themselves as members of the socialist action or reform parties object to being described as having no party preference.if a nonqualified party candidate has no constitutional right to avoid the independent label,then he or she has no such right to avoid the no party preference label.nothing in rosen or bachrach persuades us otherwise.
rosen concerned an ohio statute that prevented candidates who qualified for the general election via a nominating petition from having any designation of party affiliation,or lack thereof,on the ballot.one such candidate requested to be identified on the ballot as independent,but the statute required that the space next to his name be left blank in contrast,the ballot would show the party affiliations of candidates from recognized parties,democrats and republicans.the candidate presented evidence that having no label by his name on the ballot put him at a disadvantage against democrat and republican candidates.rosen,supra,at.the evidence included testimony from a marketing expert who stated that ohio ballot scheme is the equivalent of putting an unlabeled product on a shelf next to brand name products in a supermarket.id.at.
based on the evidence,the court concluded that the statute infringes upon the right of supporters of independent candidates to meaningfully vote and meaningfully associate by providing a voting cue to democratic and republican candidates which makes it virtually impossible for independent candidates to prevail in the general election.rosen,supra,at.the opinion further concluded that the justifications advanced by the state for the burdens imposed on independent candidates as a result of the statute were highly questionable id.at,and in fact somewhat specious id.at.the statute appeared to the court to be nothing more than a deliberate attempt by the state to protect and guarantee the success of the democratic and republican parties.ibid.the statute thus unconstitutionally burdened the first amendment right of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs and the right of qualified voters,regardless of political affiliation,to cast their votes effectively.moreover,the statute violate d the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because it place d unequal burdens on independent and candidates and was designed to give democrats and republicans a decided advantage at the polls in general elections.id.at.
rosen does not support plaintiffs claim that they should be able to list their preferences for nonqualified parties on the ballot.the sixth circuit distinguished rosen when it addressed that issue in schrader.schrader,supra,at.rosen is also distinguishable insofar as it bears on the question of plaintiffs alleged right to be called independent on the ballot.unlike the candidate in rosen,plaintiffs have not presented,and state no intention to present,evidence to support their theory that no party preference is a more disadvantageous ballot designation than independent.on their face the labels are equivalent someone who is independent of any political party has no party preference.independent may be the more familiar shorthand term for no party affiliation,but it is not apparent that voters would take no party preference to mean anything other than independent,particularly under the new ballot scheme where,in lieu of the traditional party labels,candidates of qualified parties will be shown as having a preference for that party,my party preference is the democratic party,rather than simply democrat,subd.a.in any event,whether the new label will make any practical difference in voters minds is entirely speculative.
bachrach dealt with massachusetts laws that permitted candidates to use any nonsubversive,political designation they wished on the ballot,other than independent candidates identifying themselves as independent were described on the ballot as unenrolled.bachrach,supra,at.the laws were successfully challenged on first amendment and equal protection grounds by a candidate who won the right to appear on the ballot as an independent.in his campaign literature,the candidate had consistently described himself as independent,the designation which to him best expressed his political views id.at.the laws subjected the candidate to invidious discrimination whereas any other candidate was allowed to use a designation on the ballot conforming to the rubric he used during the campaign,the candidate who chose,quite legitimately,to campaign under the label independent,was singled out and denied that expression on the ballot.id.at.the state argued that it could properly eliminate the one term independent from political discourse,at least on the ballot,on the one hand because it was ambiguous or confusing,and on the other hand because it had a positive aura and hence might give a candidate using the designation an unmerited advantage.id.at,fn.omitted.the court responded that it was hard to take the argument seriously when one looks at the agreed facts and considers what soubriquets unaffiliated candidates were permitted to adopt apart from the word independent.ibid.
the agreed facts were as follows independent had no consistent or uniform meaning except a customary meaning as referring to persons who do not formally affiliate with any political party.many voters assumed individuals designated independent had generally liberal political or ideological beliefs,but many thought such individuals had generally conservative,generally moderate,or generally progressive beliefs.independent had a generally positive connotation.citizens party,which was to appear as a designation of a candidate on the ballot,had no consistent or uniform meaning.the designations against politician raise and the anderson coalition,also to appear as designations on that ballot,did not connote associations with established organizations having structures or traditions of political beliefs.the terms democratic and republican did connote such associations.bachrach,supra,at.the court thought that unenrolled was a less favorable designation than independent,a point the state may have effectively conceded.voters who during the campaign might have been favorably impressed with the candidate as an independent would be confronted on the ballot with a candidate who was called unenrolled.unenrolled is hardly a rallying cry the commonwealth in its brief appears to grant the possibility that the word would have a negative connotation for voters.id.at.
bachrach,like rosen,provides little support for plaintiffs case.unlike the laws in bachrach that narrowly and without justification singled out independents for disparate treatment,the statute challenged here distinguishes broadly and justifiably between qualified and nonqualified parties,a distinction the bachrach court signaled it could support.see bachrach,supra,at,fn.citing jenness,supra,at,and indicat ing that some differential treatment of candidates of established parties and independent candidates is to be expected and is reasonable,and to that extent should raise no constitutional difficulties.and bachrach endorsement of the designation independent over unenrolled does not support favoring independent over no party preference here because in bachrach it was stipulated that independent had a generally positive connotation,and conceded that unenrolled could possibly have a negative connotation.bachrach,supra,at.no evidence,stipulation,or concession in this case establishes that independent would have a more positive connotation than no party preference on ballots for a office much less that the advantage of using one term over the other would be sufficient to raise a constitutional issue.
prohibition on counting write in votes 
plaintiffs premise 
plaintiffs challenge section,added by sb,which provides a person whose name has been written on the ballot as a candidate at the general election for a office shall not be counted.sb.
plaintiffs do not dispute that under burdick,supra,and edelstein,supra,cal th,the state may validly ban voting in a general election.burdick rejected a federal constitutional challenge to hawaii prohibition of votes in all elections.burdick,supra,at.edelstein applied burdick and held that a prohibition against voting in a san francisco mayoral runoff election did not violate california free speech clause.edelstein,supra,cal th at.
however,plaintiffs maintain that sb preserves the right to cast votes in the general election for offices,even though section prohibits those votes from being counted.based on the premise that the casting of votes is permitted,plaintiffs contend that section violates california constitution,article ii,section,which states a voter who casts a vote in an election in accordance with the laws of this state shall have that vote counted.plaintiffs argue that section also violates the first amendment and california free speech clause the federal elections clause and the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions.
our analysis and conclusion 
it would make no sense to authorize the voters to cast votes that can not be counted,and we are not persuaded that sb so provides.a ban on votes in general elections for offices is implicit in section,particularly when that statute is read together with section added by sb,which provides that o nly the two candidates for a office who receive the highest and numbers of votes cast at the primary shall appear on the ballot as candidates for that office at the ensuing general election.see also cal.const,art.ii,subd.a top two compete in the general election.the assembly bill analysis of sb persuasively explained that the measure e liminates the ability of voters to candidates for a office at a general election,and eliminates the ability of candidates to run as candidates for office at a general election.html,as of september.
notably,plaintiffs current reading of sb is contrary to the arguments of the opponents of proposition in the june voter information guide that clearly state votes would be prohibited.the argument against proposition stated the general election will not allow candidates.currently,when a rogue candidate captures a nomination,voters have the ability to the candidate of their choice in the general election.but a hidden provision prohibits write in votes from being counted in general elections if passes.that means if one of the top two primary winners is convicted of a crime or discovered to be a member of an extremist group,voters are out of luck because ends write in voting.ballot,primary june.the rebuttal to the argument in favor of proposition cosigned by plaintiff chessin stated proposition will decrease voter choice.it prohibits candidates in general elections.only the top two vote getters advance to the general election regardless of political party.id.at.
accordingly,we conclude that sb precludes the casting of votes at general elections for offices,just as it prohibits the counting of those votes.this conclusion disposes of plaintiffs argument that section violates california constitution,article ii,section,because that section requires that votes be counted only if they are cast in accordance with the laws of this state.this conclusion resolves plaintiffs other constitutional arguments against section because votes that have been lawfully banned burdick,supra,at edelstein,supra,cal th at need not be counted.our conclusion also distinguishes plaintiffs case authority.united states classic.qualified voters have a constitutional right to cast their ballots and have them counted turner bd.of elections ethics d,failure to count a lawfully cast vote rob s the vote of any communicative meaning whatsoever libertarian party bd.of elections ethics d,having granted citizens the right to cast votes,the district of columbia must confer the right in a manner consistent with the constitution.
plaintiffs statutory arguments 
plaintiffs argue that certain elections code provisions authorize voting at general elections for offices,notwithstanding sections and.we disagree.
in construing a statute,the court fundamental task is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.johnson arvin edison water storage dist.th.the statutes plaintiffs cite must be construed in the framework of the election processes of which they are but a part.libertarian party,supra,cal d at.we must attempt to harmonize them with the section and directives that only the top two candidates from the primary are to appear on the general election ballot,and that votes are not to be counted.mccarther pacific telesis group cal th,the words of a statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.we must also,if possible,construe the statutes in question so as to preserve their constitutionality.kleefman,supra,cal th at jonathan,supra,th at.
plaintiffs rely primarily on section,which was not amended by sb,and which provides each voter is entitled to write the name of any candidate for any public office,including that of president and vice president of the united states,on the ballot of any election.but it is clear from the decision in edelstein that section does not mandate allowance of voting in general elections for offices.the plaintiffs in edelstein argued that section guaranteed voters the right to cast votes in a municipal runoff election.the court rejected that argument and explained that voters in the election had the opportunity to write in the names of candidates once,in the first round of voting they simply did not have the opportunity to do so a second time,in the runoff.this satisfied section,because there was a single election,although there were two rounds of voting.edelstein,supra,cal th at.v oters were not denied an opportunity to cast a ballot for the candidate of their choice.they were only denied the opportunity to cast a ballot twice.id.at.edelstein reasoning applies equally in this case.there is one election,within the meaning of section,for offices,with two rounds of voting the primary and general elections and allowance of votes at the primary satisfies the statute.
plaintiffs reliance on section is also misplaced.section states that a ny name written upon a ballot for a qualified candidate,including a reasonable facsimile of the spelling of a name,shall be counted for the office,if it is written in the blank space provided and voted as specified in subdivisions of the section.this provision is of no assistance to plaintiffs because it is limited by its terms to votes cast for qualified candidates.section states that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,no name written upon a ballot in any election shall be counted for an office or nomination unless the candidate whose name has been written on the ballot has complied with part commencing with section of division.section et sets forth requirements for qualifying as a candidate,and now include section ban on the counting of votes at general elections for offices.we agree with the secretary and interveners that,in view of that ban,no candidate can be qualified for those elections.like the prohibition against casting votes at such elections,a prohibition against qualifying as a candidate in such elections is implicit in sections and.
plaintiffs also cite section,subdivision a,which provides a there shall be printed on the ballot in parallel columns all of the following the names of candidates with sufficient blank spaces to allow the voters to write in names not printed on the ballot.see also under the designation of each office shall be printed as many blank spaces,defined by light lines or rules at least of an inch apart but no more than inch apart,as there are candidates to be nominated or elected to the office.these statutes are among those in section et providing general specifications for the format of all ballots.because sb amended parts of section,but left subdivision a unchanged sb,plaintiffs assert that sb itself requires that every ballot provide space where voters can write in the names of candidates.
the secretary and interveners differ on whether sections,subdivision a,and apply in general elections for offices.interveners argue that these statutes provide specifications for blank spaces on all ballots for offices for which voting is permitted since only the two candidates for a office who receive the highest and numbers of votes at the primary can appear on the ballot at the ensuing general election,there are no candidates,and no blank spaces would be printed below the names of the candidates.however,because voting is still permitted in primary elections,and all presidential,partisan,and local elections,which are often held at the same time as general elections,and continue to provide for the inclusion of spaces to accommodate the names of persons who have qualified as candidates in those elections.
the secretary appellate brief does not discuss these statutes,but the secretary has evidently concluded,after the brief was filed,that the statutes require lines for votes for offices on general election ballots.in a march,memorandum to county clerks and registrars of voters,the chief of the secretary election division advise d that consistent with elections code sections a and,ballots must contain a blank space below the names of the qualified candidates.however,consistent with elections code section,any name that is written on the ballot as a candidate at the general election for a voter nominated office shall not be counted.
the secretary position is also reflected in august emails from a legislative analyst for the secretary to intervener maldonado legislative staff.the emails proposed an sb cleanup bill consisting of technical that would not make any policy changes it not intended to be controversial.it simply intended to ensure that proposition and sb can be implemented clearly and easily and be implemented as the voters,the author,the legislature,and the governor intended w
