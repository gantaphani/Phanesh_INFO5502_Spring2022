the day after his third election to the position of orange county sheriff coroner,michael carona placed on administrative leave william hunt,a former lieutenant officer with the orange county sheriff department ocsd,who had dared to enter the race and campaign against carona alleged culture of corruption.carona then demoted hunt,an action that prompted hunt to file this suit claiming that his placement on administrative leave and subsequent demotion were in unconstitutional retaliation for the exercise of his first amendment rights.the district court concluded that hunt campaign speech was not protected by the first amendment because,based upon special factual findings by a jury,hunt fell into the narrow policymaker exception to the general rule against dismissals.although we determine that the district court erred in this conclusion,we agree with the district court alternative holding that carona is entitled to qualified immunity because a government official in his position reasonably but mistakenly could have believed that political loyalty was required by someone with hunt job responsibilities at the time he ran against carona.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
a lieutenant in the ocsd,hunt was the chief of police services for the city of san clemente,which contracted with the ocsd for police services.in may,hunt announced that he would challenge carona,the incumbent orange county sheriff,in the upcoming june,election.during the campaign,hunt issued public statements,radio addresses,press releases,and campaign literature critical of carona performance as sheriff,including allegations of corruption in the department.carona defeated hunt in the june election and,on june,placed hunt on administrative leave pending a personnel investigation regarding his speech and conduct during the campaign.hunt was served with a notice of pending demotion on october,for failing to perform his duties and responsibilities as a member of the department management team and for violation of department rules prohibiting,among other things,bringing discredit upon the department.the notice catalogued hunt critical campaign communications and concluded that t he department lacks the confidence in hunt abilities to further the mission of this agency.hunt was then demoted three ranks.carona does not dispute that hunt was demoted based on his campaign communications.
hunt filed a complaint against carona,orange county,and other unnamed defendants alleging the violation of his first and fourteenth amendment rights under,as well as several causes of action under state law that were dismissed and are not at issue here.before trial,the district court dismissed orange county as a defendant on the ground that hunt had abandoned his monell municipal liability claim,and there was thus no longer a cognizable claim against the county.
because the question of whether hunt position required political loyalty was critical to whether he fell into the liability exception to the first amendment,the parties tried the nature of hunt responsibilities and ocsd position to a jury.the district court instructed the jury to answer special interrogatories related to hunt position.the jury concluded,among other things,that 
hunt did not have policymaking authority over any area of policy 
hunt did not formulate,substantially influence,or substantially influence modifications to any policy 
hunt did not formulate or substantially influence plans to implement the broad goals of the ocsd 
hunt did not formulate policy that affected san clemente 
hunt did not exercise discretion in setting policy for the ocsd in san clemente hunt did not directly and regularly communicate with carona 
hunt did not usually speak with carona,as hunt generally approached his supervisor or other department officials when confronted with decisions 
hunt did not act as an advisor to carona or the assistant sheriffs 
hunt did not have authority to speak to the media without prior approval of officials 
hunt did not have a vaguely worded job description and 
neither carona,the captains,nor the assistant sheriffs trust and confidence was necessary for hunt to adequately perform his duties.
the jury did conclude that although hunt did not formulate policy,he substantially influenced department policy affecting san clemente and had discretion in how to implement policy in san clemente within the general framework provided by the department.
the district court granted judgment as a matter of law to carona after concluding that hunt occupied a policymaking position for which political loyalty was an appropriate requirement based on the jury special findings,and thus his demotion for political reasons did not violate the first amendment,elrod burns.the district court relied heavily on the nine factors we set forth as relevant to a policymaker determination in fazio city and county of san francisco,cir.concluding that the fazio factors suggested that hunt was a policymaker,the district court ruled that political loyalty was an appropriate requirement of hunt job because he had sufficient authority to thwart or interfere with the sheriff implementation of the policies he set for ocsd in san clemente.alternatively,the district court held that even if hunt was not deemed a policymaker,carona was entitled to qualified immunity for concluding that hunt was.

the question before us is whether hunt falls within the policymaker exception to the first amendment,and thus can not avail himself of any constitutional protection against his demotion on the basis of his political speech.
the first amendment ordinarily prohibits an elected official from firing or retaliating against an employee for his political opinions,memberships,or activities.see branti finkel,u nless the government can demonstrate an overriding interest of vital importance requiring that a person private beliefs conform to those of the hiring authority,his beliefs can not be the sole basis for depriving him of continued public employment.citations and quotation marks omitted elrod,at noting that the practice of patronage dismissals confronts decisions by this court either invalidating or recognizing as invalid government action that inhibits belief and association through the conditioning of public employment on political faith.
the supreme court carved out an exception to this general prohibition in elrod,permitting dismissals on the basis of political beliefs of those employees in policymaking positions so that representative government not be undercut by tactics obstructing the implementation of policies of the new administration,policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate.at.because such dismissals and demotions potentially infringe upon constitutional rights,we have held that the exception is narrow and should be applied with caution.diruzza county of tehamma,cir reading elrod and branti as carving out a narrow exception.
we disagree with the district court conclusion that hunt fell within the elrod policymaker exception and was thus permissibly terminated on the basis of his campaign speech.the district court application of the policymaker exception misinterprets both the supreme court and our own doctrine establishing the contours of the exception.although the factors set forth in fazio,at,are relevant considerations in determining whether hunt is a policymaker,they should not be considered in a vacuum,but rather in light of the underlying purpose of the policymaker exception.
the essential inquiry in determining whether the elrod policymaker exception applies is not whether the nine fazio factors mechanically apply,or whether the label or confidential fits a particular position rather,the question is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.branti,at id.at i f an employee private political beliefs would interfere with the discharge of his public duties,his first amendment rights may be required to yield quoting elrod,at fazio,at a public employee need not literally make policy in order to fit within the elrod policymaker exception.rather,an employer may fire a public employee for purely political reasons if the employer can demonstrate that political considerations are appropriate requirement s for the effective performance of the job.quoting branti,at fazio,at t he term policymaker as used in this context does not mean one who makes policy.rather,the term refers to a position in which political considerations are appropriate requirement s for the effective performance of the public office involved.quoting branti,at thomas carpenter,cir holding that the exception applies only where the government has shown that the employee political loyalty is essential to the effective performance of the tasks.
here,the record fails to establish that hunt party affiliation or political outlook were relevant to the effective discharge of his professional duties.indeed,the jury in its special findings of fact explicitly found to the contrary.the jury found that neither carona,the captains,nor the assistant sheriffs trust and confidence was necessary for hunt to perform his job.the jury also found that hunt political statements which were the basis of his demotion did not cause,and could not have been reasonably predicted to cause,a disruption in the efficient operation of the department.
these findings establish that political considerations were not appropriate requirements for the effective performance of hunt job and are sufficient to end the inquiry.indeed,if hunt clearly falls outside of the intended purpose and scope of the elrod exception on the basis of the jury factual findings,then we need not necessarily examine the fazio factors in order to determine whether hunt position carried certain attributes of a policymaking position.the binding factual findings of the jury indicate that hunt was not under the supreme court and our own doctrine a policymaker for the purposes of the elrod exception to the first amendment.to set aside those facts in order to rely on an equivocal balancing of the fazio factors is to lose sight of the forest for the trees.
moreover,dismissals on the basis of political considerations must further a vital government end because they infringe upon a constitutional right.elrod,at such dismissals must further some vital government end by a means that is least restrictive of freedom of belief and association in achieving that end,and the benefit gained must outweigh the loss of constitutionally protected rights.crucially,since it is the government burden to demonstrate an overriding interest in order to validate an encroachment on protected interests,the burden of establishing this justification as to any particular respondent will rest on the government.id.at emphasis added.
here,the government has not sufficiently established the interest at stake,and has thus failed to meet its burden.indeed,expanding the legal protection accorded to dismissals and demotions could very well undermine vital government interests.for example,an expansion of the exception could discourage some of the most capable and qualified people from running for higher office,and may also have a chilling effect on whistleblowing.most persuasively,the jury,in its answers to the special interrogatories,found as a matter of fact that hunt actions did not disrupt the efficient operation of the ocsd,nor could anyone have reasonably thought they would.thomas,at e ven in a police department,the disruption must be real,and not imagined.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.therefore,we conclude that the government has failed to establish that hunt dismissal furthered a vital government interest.
nothing in the record persuasively suggests that political considerations are an appropriate requirement for hunt position.because the jury found that political considerations were not an appropriate requirement,we conclude that hunt does not fall within the intended scope of the policymaker exception.that one can marshal colorable arguments to conclude that a majority of fazio factors apply in a given case is not sufficient reason to widen what the supreme court has deemed a narrow exception to the first amendment,particularly where,as here,such an expansion is at odds with the underlying purpose of that exception.see elrod,u.at branti,at.
moreover,the district court analysis of the fazio factors led it to wrongly conclude that hunt position was that of a policymaker.although the fazio factors are not necessarily dispositive,they suggest hunt was not a policymaker,and was thus entitled to constitutional protection against his retaliatory demotion.
a sheriff lieutenant is not automatically a policymaker.thomas,d at reversing dismissal of lieutenant first amendment retaliation claim.therefore,the district court properly considered hunt actual job requirements and responsibilities in applying the fazio factors.in fazio,we set forth s ome factors to be considered when determining whether a job is a policymaking position,including vague or broad responsibilities,relative pay,technical competence,power to control others,authority to speak in the name of policymakers,public perception,influence on programs,contact with elected officials,and responsiveness to partisan politics and political leaders.at.these factors are intended to guide the policymaker analysis,but not supplant what we have called the essential inquiry whether party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.id.at.because the parties agreed the court should not propound special jury interrogatories regarding relative pay and stipulated that hunt position required technical competence,only seven of the nine fazio factors are at issue.
although the district court,by using as many as special interrogatories,adopted a novel approach to resolving the question of hunt status,its conclusion that hunt was a policymaker was directly contradicted by the jury response to those interrogatories.the jury findings of fact suggest that at least three fazio factors vague or broad responsibilities,authority to speak in the name of,and influence on programs strongly indicate that hunt was not a policymaker.indeed,the jury found that hunt did not have a vaguely worded job description hunt did not have authority to speak to the media without prior approval of officials hunt did not have policymaking authority over any area of policy hunt did not formulate,substantially influence,or substantially influence modifications to any policy hunt did not formulate or substantially influence plans to implement the broad goals of the ocsd hunt did not formulate policy that affected san clemente and hunt did not exercise discretion in setting policy for the ocsd in san clemente.
hunt power to control others,another fazio factor,was severely limited.hunt lacked any power to hire or promote the officers that worked under him in san clemente.mccloud testa,cir holding that employee did not fall within the policymaker exception where he supervised employees but did not hire or fire them and was not responsible for their raises or granting leaves.hunt did have limited ability to impose discipline and manage deployments,but only within the contours of the department policy that was set by his superiors.this authority is both limited and largely operational.we agree that merely being a is not sufficient to show that political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the job in question.milazzo,cir.
the three remaining factors contact with elected officials,public perception,and responsiveness to partisan politics and leaders weigh in favor of classifying hunt as a policymaker.however,despite his interactions with the san clemente city council and its citizenry,hunt was at all times bound by department policy that was set by his superiors and over which he had little,if any,control or influence.his interactions with san clemente politicians and public are insufficient to elevate his administrative role into a political role.indeed,the jury found that,despite his responsibilities,hunt had no regular interaction with the ocsd political leadership.the jury found that hunt did not directly and regularly communicate with carona,and that it was,in fact,unusual for the two to speak,as hunt would commonly speak with his supervisor or other department officials when confronted with san clemente decisions.
the picture painted by the jury factual findings shows that hunt was one of sixty department lieutenants,with no authority to formulate policy,who reported to a supervisor,and who needed approval from officials to speak on behalf of the department.he did have heightened administrative responsibility over san clemente,which accounts for a small fraction of orange county population,where the effective performance of his job was neither compromised by his statements during the campaign,nor dependent on carona trust in him.we thus conclude that the fazio factors,with all reasonable inferences drawn in favor of hunt,reeves,at,and in light of the jury findings of fact,support the conclusion that hunt was not a policymaker.
in bardzik county of orange,cir,we held that another ocsd lieutenant who was the reserve division commander,and was also demoted by carona after supporting hunt candidacy,was a policymaker for the purposes of the elrod exception.although the legal principles we applied in bardzik are applicable here,the result in bardzik is not controlling because the policymaker inquiry is highly.
the position at issue in bardzik reserve division commander is factually quite distinct from hunt position in the ocsd.unlike hunt,bardzik duties went well beyond the administration of a small division and included significant programmatic authority.as reserve division commander,bardzik was in charge of six hundred reserve officers,id.at,compared to the officers that hunt oversaw in san clemente.bardzik reported directly to carona and would meet with him as much as several times a week at times,id.at,significantly greater contact than hunt rare interactions with carona.while the jury found that hunt job description was not vaguely worded,bardzik was broadly tasked by carona to take command of the reserve division,clean it up and bring it back to responsibility,get rid of the dead wood,and ensure it was no longer being led like a badge and gun club.id.at.
bardzik also had significant programmatic authority,under which he initiated proactive programs,which included establishing a unit and reforming the rescue responder program.id.at.bardzik further created policy,recommending a decentralization of the division,which was praised by carona as one of the highlights of the year,as well as a new promotional protocol to eliminate favoritism.id.under both the stated purpose for the elrod exception and the fazio factors,the position evaluated in bardzik is significantly more amenable to classification as a policymaking position than hunt ocsd position.thus,our analysis of the lieutenant position in bardzik does not control our conclusion here.
we agree with the district court,however,that although carona demotion of hunt in retaliation for campaign speech violated the first amendment,carona is entitled to qualified immunity.qualified immunity shields federal and state officials from money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right,and that the right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.ashcroft,quoting harlow fitzgerald.a government official conduct violates clearly established law when,at the time of the challenged conduct,the contours of a right are sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.id.at quoting anderson creighton,internal alterations omitted.
hunt first amendment right to be free from demotion for campaigning against carona was clearly established as of june.as we held in diruzza,u nder elrod and branti,decided by the supreme court in and,and under ninth circuit case law decided prior to,it was clearly established that a public employee in a sheriff office is protected from retaliation for the exercise of first amendment rights.at.however,the critical question here is whether a reasonable official in carona position should have known that hunt was not a policymaker whose political loyalty was important to the effective performance of his job.see lopez quinones puerto rico guard,cir the crucial question here is whether a reasonable official acting at the time of lopez termination should have known on what side of the line lopez own position fell.if carona could have reasonably but mistakenly believed that his or her conduct did not violate a clearly established constitutional right,he is entitled to qualified immunity.greene camreta,cir citing jackson city of bremerton,cir.
we conclude,like the district court,that carona could have reasonably but mistakenly believed that hunt demotion was not unconstitutional,given the unique nature of his job as chief of police services for the city of san clemente.although hunt position had no responsibility,influence,or control,as the jury found,hunt exercised discretion over the implementation of ocsd policy within san clemente,influenced ocsd policy as it affected san clemente,and formulated plans to implement ocsd policy in san clemente.while hunt had to secure authority before speaking with the public,when he did so,it was on behalf of the ocsd.we have carefully analyzed the development of the policymaker exception,its underlying purpose,the high burden on the government to prove that political fidelity was a necessary requirement of hunt job,and balanced the fazio analysis that requires a inquiry.even if carona engaged in the appropriate analysis and wrongly concluded that hunt was a such that demoting him was constitutional,we can not say that he acted objectively unreasonably in concluding he could demote hunt without violating his constitutional rights.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying hunt motion to amend the pretrial conference order.we review the district court denial of a motion to modify a order for abuse of discretion.byrd guess,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds.district courts have broad discretion to manage discovery and to control the course of litigation under federal rule of civil procedure.avila willits envtl.remediation trust,cir.where,as here,the district court has entered a pretrial order,modifications are allowed only to prevent manifest injustice.e.we have explained 
the district court should consider four factors in determining whether to modify the parties pretrial order the degree of prejudice or surprise to the defendants if the order is modified the ability of the defendants to cure any prejudice the impact of the modification on the orderly and efficient conduct of the case and any degree of willfulness or bad faith on the part of the party seeking the modification.
in light of these factors,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to amend the pretrial order.first,amendment would have caused prejudice or surprise to carona because hunt had abandoned any monell claim asserted in his complaint by filing two memoranda of contentions of fact and law and a proposed pretrial order that did not include any monell claim allowing hunt to raise the monell claim through an amendment to the order would have prejudiced the county because it had taken no discovery toward defending against a monell claim.second,hunt motion was made less than three weeks before trial began,which would have left insufficient time to cure that prejudice.finally,the amendment would have interfered with the orderly and efficient conduct of the case because curing the prejudice would have required reopening discovery,which,in turn,would have delayed the proceedings.
we have consistently held that issues not preserved in the pretrial order have been eliminated from the action.cal.retail clerks union and food emp rs joint pension trust fund bjorklund,cir.
