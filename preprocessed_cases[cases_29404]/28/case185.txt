the plaintiffs now appeal the denial of their motion and the dismissal of their voting rights act claim.in addition,the mcri defendants the admission into evidence of a report critical of the mcri methods for obtaining signatures in support of proposal.notwithstanding the disturbing allegations underlying the plaintiffs complaint,which the district court substantiated,because the opportunity to keep proposal off the ballot has long since passed,the plaintiffs appeal is dismissed as moot.consequently,so too is the mcri defendants.
