we have for review city of jacksonville cook,so d dca,and pinellas county eight is enough in pinellas,so d dca,decisions of district courts of appeal that affect a class of state or constitutional officers.we have jurisdiction over both cases pursuant to article v,section b,florida constitution,and have consolidated them for argument and decisional purposes.we quash both cook and eight is enough 
cook city of jacksonville 
in the general election,the voters in duval county voted on several amendments to the charter of the consolidated city of jacksonville jacksonville charter seeking to impose a limitation on the sheriff,supervisor of elections,property appraiser,tax collector,clerk of the circuit court,members of the duval county school board,and members of the civil service board.there were separate votes on each section of a proposed ordinance amending the jacksonville charter.the voters approved the ordinance as it related to the clerk of the circuit court as adopted,section of the jacksonville charter provides 
section.two term person elected and qualified for two consecutive full terms as clerk of the court shall be eligible for election as clerk of the court for the next succeeding term.the limitation shall apply to any full term which began in or thereafter.
petitioner henry cook was appointed clerk of the circuit and county courts for duval county in jacksonville clerk.cook was subsequently elected in and reelected in and.on november,cook presented to the duval county supervisor of elections jacksonville supervisor,cook statement of candidate papers indicating his intent to seek reelection as the jacksonville clerk.the jacksonville supervisor refused to accept the completed papers on account of section of the jacksonville charter.on november,cook,in his individual capacity,sued the city of jacksonville and the jacksonville supervisor,seeking a declaratory judgment invalidating section of the jacksonville charter and a writ of mandamus directing the jacksonville supervisor to accept cook candidacy papers.
the trial court ruled that section was an attempt to impose additional qualifications or disqualifications on the jacksonville clerk.the trial court found nothing in article viii,section d,florida constitution,that authorized the city to impose additional qualifications or disqualifications.additionally,the trial court ruled that the only disqualifications for the clerk job were contained in article vi,section,florida constitution.accordingly,the trial court held that section added an unconstitutional additional qualification or disqualification.accordingly,the trial court granted mandamus and ordered the jacksonville supervisor to accept cook candidacy papers.
the first district reversed.see cook,so d at.the court acknowledged our decision in thomas state ex rel.cobb,so d,construing it to hold that a statute which imposed additional qualifications is unconstitutional where the constitution has already set forth the qualifications.see cook,so d at.but the first district reasoned that our later cases of state ex rel.askew thomas,so d,and state grassi,so d,established that where the constitution establishes no qualifications,the legislature may impose additional qualifications.see cook,so d at.the first district concluded that neither article viii,section d,nor article v,section,florida constitution,provided specific qualifications for the clerk of the circuit court.see id.at.because no qualifications were established for the clerk of the circuit court in the constitution and because jacksonville home rule powers authorized it to establish a government framework within its territorial boundaries,the first district held that the limit was constitutional.see id.at the court did not address whether the term limit provision imposed an additional unconstitutional disqualification.cook petitioned this court for review.
deblaker eight is enough in pinellas 
pinellas is a charter county whose charter was initially proposed by special law,see ch,laws of,and ratified by the pinellas electorate.pursuant to the amendatory provisions of the pinellas county charter pinellas charter,eight is enough in pinellas committee,a political committee,initiated a petition drive to amend the pinellas charter.the goal of the initiative was to impose term limits on members of the board of county commissioners,the sheriff,tax collector,property appraiser,supervisor of elections,and clerk of the circuit court.with one vote applicable to all positions,the pinellas county electorate adopted the term limit amendment in the general election.the amended provision of the pinellas charter relating to county officers provides 
county officers.
this document charter shall in no manner change the status,duties,or responsibilities of the following county officers of pinellas county the clerk of the circuit court,property appraiser,tax collector,sheriff,and supervisor of elections except that no person may appear on the ballot for to the office of clerk of the court,property appraiser,tax collector,sheriff,or supervisor of elections if,by the end of the current term of office,the person will have served or,but for resignation,would have served in that office for eight consecutive years.
emphasis represents language added as a result of ratification vote.
clair johnson,a resident and registered voter of pinellas county,sued pinellas county prior to the ratification election,seeking a declaratory judgment that the then charter proposal was invalid and an injunction prohibiting the proposal from being placed on the ballot.the committee and its chairman intervened.the trial court denied johnson motion for summary judgment and motion for temporary and permanent injunction on september,finding that the proposed amendment was not contrary to the florida constitution and that the ballot language did not violate section,florida statutes.the trial court further found that the disqualifications enumerated in article vi,section,florida constitution,did not prohibit charter counties from imposing term limits within their counties.finally,the trial court found within the constitutional grant of home rule authority provided to charter counties by article viii,section g,the authorization for a charter county to impose term limits on its county officers and board of county commissioners.
soon after the trial court so ruled,fred petty,as tax collector,karleen deblaker,as the clerk of the circuit court,everett rice,as sheriff,jim smith,as property appraiser,and dorothy ruggles,as supervisor of elections,intervened as plaintiffs.after further proceedings in the trial court,the trial court issued an amended order and final judgment on january.in that order the trial court ratified its september,order.the trial court further held that the pinellas charter conferred plenary power on pinellas county,subject to the constraints of the charter and that nothing in the pinellas charter required submission of charter amendments to the legislature for its approval.
the board of county commissioners for pinellas county,clerk of the circuit court,tax collector,sheriff,supervisor of elections,property appraiser,and johnson appealed the amended order to the second district.the second district affirmed.see eight is enough,so d at.the court rejected the argument that in passing the special law which became the pinellas charter,the legislature reserved to itself the sole authority to propose charter amendments.see id.the court also rejected the argument that charter provisions prohibited the term limit amendment.see id.at.further,the court found that term limits did not affect the status,duties,or responsibilities of the county officers,and that a term limit amendment did not affect the composition,election,term of office and compensation of county commission members.see id.the second district found no statutes or constitutional provisions prohibiting a charter county from imposing term limits.see id.the court did not address whether the term limit provision imposed an additional disqualification from office.
deblaker,as clerk of the circuit court,petty,as tax collector,and rice,as sheriff,petitioned for review.during the pendency of our review,diane nelson succeeded petty as tax collector,and we granted her leave to withdraw.the board of county commissioners did not petition for review.
the issue we address in these consolidated cases is whether a charter county may in its charter impose a term limit provision upon those county officer positions which are authorized by article viii,section d,florida constitution,where the charter county through its charter has not abolished those county officer positions the disposition of these consolidated cases requires us to determine whether a term limit provision is a disqualification from office and,if so,whether the florida constitution prohibits a charter county from imposing a term limit provision upon such a county officer.we hold that a term limit provision is a disqualification from election to office and that article vi,section a,florida constitution,provides the exclusive roster of those disqualifications which may be permissibly imposed.we also hold that article vi,section b,florida constitution,provides those positions authorized by the constitution upon which a term limit provision may be permissibly imposed.
the county offices subject to this review are authorized by article viii,section d,florida constitution,which states 
county officers.there shall be elected by the electors of each county,for terms of four years,a sheriff,a tax collector,a property appraiser,a supervisor of elections,and a clerk of the circuit court except,when provided by county charter or special law approved by vote of the electors of the county,any county officer may be chosen in another manner therein specified,or any county office may be abolished when all the duties of the office prescribed by general law are transferred to another office.when not otherwise provided by county charter or special law approved by vote of the electors,the clerk of the circuit court shall be ex officio clerk of the board of county commissioners,auditor,recorder and custodian of all county funds.
importantly,the pinellas charter has not abolished the county officer positions,and the jacksonville charter has not abolished the office of clerk of circuit court position thus,we do not address the validity of a term limit provision upon an office authorized in a county charter but not expressly authorized in the florida constitution.
we decide the issue presented by these cases consistent with our decision in thomas state ex rel.cobb,so d.at issue in cobb was a statute purporting to require a candidate for the office of county superintendent of public instruction,which office was established in the constitution by article viii,section,to hold a florida graduate teaching certificate we framed the issue as 
has the legislature under our present constitution the power to prescribe the qualifications for the constitutional office of county superintendent of public instruction 
state ex rel.cobb,so d at.we answered this question in the negative and found that the legislature was prohibited from adding to or taking from the qualifications or disqualifications of this constitutionally authorized office.see id.at.in so holding,we stated 
our state constitution,as we have pointed out,prescribes in no uncertain terms that certain persons are disqualified to hold certain constitutional offices,such as,governor,members of the legislature,justices of the supreme court,judges of the circuit and criminal courts.as to all officers the constitution further excludes from office all persons convicted of bribery,perjury,larceny or of infamous crime,or who shall make,or become directly or indirectly interested in,any bet or wager,the result of which shall depend upon any election or that shall hereafter fight a duel or send or accept a challenge to fight,or that shall be second to either party,or that shall be the bearer of such challenge or acceptance but the legal disability shall not accrue until after trial and conviction by due form of law.this solemn declaration in our constitution about qualifications or disqualifications to hold public office are conclusive of the whole matter whether in the affirmative or in the negative form.
these plain and unambiguous specifications of disabilities exclude all others unless the constitution provides otherwise.the effect of this declaration in the constitution that certain officers are not qualified carries with it the necessary implication that all others are qualified.
state ex rel.cobb,so d at emphasis added.
article vi,section,florida constitution,sets forth the disqualifications for offices authorized by the constitution 
a no person convicted of a felony,or adjudicated in this or any other state to be mentally incompetent,shall be qualified to vote or hold office until restoration of civil rights or removal of disability.
b no person may appear on the ballot for to any of the following offices 
florida representative,
florida senator,
florida lieutenant governor,
any office of the florida cabinet,
representative from florida,or 
senator from florida.
if,by the end of the current term of office,the person will have served or,but for resignation,would have served in that office for eight consecutive years.
we have previously indicated in our advisory opinion concerning the then proposed article vi,section b,which was before us through the initiative process prior to ballot placement and approval by the voters,that a term limit provision is a disqualification.see advisory opinion to the attorney political terms in certain elective offices,so d.in advisory opinion,we stated 
we do not agree with opponents that the proposed amendment fails to identify constitutional provisions with which it conflicts or which it substantially affects.the initiative proposal is intended to amend article vi,section of the state constitution,which provides that n o person convicted of a felony,or adjudicated in this or any other state to be mentally incompetent,shall be qualified to vote or hold office until restoration of civil rights or removal of disability.the amendment,if passed,will add term limits as a further disqualification on holding office.
id.at emphasis added consistent with advisory opinion,we hold that a term limit provision is a disqualification from election to office.
respondent committee and the solicitor general maintain that this court in holley adams,so d,rejected the proposition that article vi,section,preempted the field with regard to disqualifications.we disagree and hold that article vi,section,florida constitution,imposes those disqualifications which may be validly imposed upon offices authorized by the constitution.
holley involved a challenge to chapter,laws of florida,popularly known as the resign to run law.holley,so d at.that law required a circuit judge who desired to seek the then elected office of supreme court justice to resign the office of circuit judge prior to qualifying to run for supreme court justice.see id while chief justice ervin would have found the resign to run law to have unconstitutionally imposed an additional disqualification,see id.at ervin,dissenting,the majority of this court did not address that issue.rather,this court held that the decision in cobb was distinguishable because,unlike in cobb,the law under scrutiny,resign to run was not a legislative determination that a person who currently holds the office of circuit judge is not fit to be a supreme court justice.id.at.we then stated 
the resign to run law is simply a limitation upon the right to retain the office already held when seeking another.it is not a limitation upon the right to seek another office,for the incumbent of an office has the choice under the statute to retain it unmolested or give it up and seek another.
ch.does not prescribe qualification but relates to the eligibility of those who may become candidates.
id.at citation omitted.under the reasoning of holley,the resign to run law is not a disqualification.
as noted above,article vi,section,florida constitution,provides the only disqualifications which may be imposed upon offices authorized by the constitution.clearly,by virtue of article vi,section b,t
