plaintiff labor organizations plaintiffs sued officials of the state of idaho,claiming that the voluntary contributions act vca,idaho code and to,violated plaintiffs constitutional rights under the first amendment as well as other constitutional provisions.before the district court,the state officials conceded that all challenged provisions were unconstitutional,except idaho code,which prohibits any payroll deductions for political activities.the district court held the ban on payroll deductions to be constitutional as applied to the state government itself,but unconstitutional as applied to private and local government employers.the state officials contend on appeal that the payroll deduction ban may be constitutionally applied to local government employers.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we hold that idaho code,as applied to local government employers,violates the first amendment because it is a law for which the state officials assert no compelling justification.moreover,the state officials have not demonstrated that the law should be reviewed under the more relaxed standard applicable to speech restrictions in nonpublic fora.in particular,they have not shown that the state of idaho may properly assert a proprietary interest in controlling access to the payroll systems that constitute the fora in this case.caselaw suggests that the authority over local governments the state possesses by operation of law is not enough to associate the local workplaces or payroll deduction programs with the state of idaho,and the state officials have adduced no specific evidence that the state actually does own,administer,or control the payroll deduction programs.

factual and procedural background 
in,the idaho legislature enacted the vca,a series of amendments to title of the idaho code,including an amendment to chapter right to work.see idaho sess.laws ch,enacting and id.ch.the chapter amendment states deductions for political activities as defined in chapter,title,idaho code,shall not be deducted from the wages,earnings or compensation of an employee.idaho code political activities are defined as electoral activities,independent expenditures,or expenditures made to any candidate,political party,political action committee or political issues committee or in support of or against any ballot measure.idaho code e.

defendants conceded that several provisions of the vca were unconstitutional because they restricted the ability of labor organizations to solicit political contributions,namely,idaho code to.on for summary judgment with respect to the remaining substantive provision banning payroll deductions for political activities,the district court held that the payroll deduction prohibition violated the first amendment to the extent it applied to local government employers and private employers.it also held,however,that the payroll deduction ban could be applied constitutionally to the state own payroll system,to employees of the state of idaho.accordingly,the court granted in part and denied in part both motions.pocatello educ.ass heideman,wl.ysursa and wasden appellants now appeal the district court ruling that is unconstitutional with respect to local government employers and school district employers 
idaho code burdens speech by diminishing plaintiffs ability to conduct any of the activities defined by the idaho code as political.the term political activities is broadly defined to include virtually all types of electioneering,including electoral activities as well as spending on behalf of or against candidates,ballot measures,political action or issue committees,or parties.see idaho code e.
the first amendment provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,or of the press or the right of people peaceably to assemble,and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.the fourteenth amendment renders that prohibition applicable to the states.see,thornhill alabama.explaining that freedom of speech is one of the fundamental personal rights and liberties secured against state abridgment by the fourteenth amendment.
this restriction on voluntary political contributions burdens political speech,which is protected by the first amendment indeed,political speech is a central concern of first amendment jurisprudence.see burson freeman,d plurality opinion accord,fed.election comm.right to life,d austin.chamber of commerce,d.right to life political action comm.bayless,cir.t here is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.mills alabama,d.
the law does not prohibit plaintiffs from participating in political activities,but it hampers their ability to do so by making the collection of funds for that purpose more difficult.the district court found that unions face substantial difficulties in collecting funds for political speech without using payroll deductions because of their members concerns over identity theft associated with other electronic transactions,as well as the nature of solicitation.the district court found that the payroll deduction ban would decrease the revenues available to plaintiffs to use for political speech.restricted funding will,therefore,diminish plaintiffs ability to engage in political speech,and is properly viewed as a regulation of protected speech.meyer grant,d holding that a colorado law prohibiting the payment of circulators of initiative petitions is properly viewed as a burden on political speech because its effect was to limit the number of voices who would convey a petition message,limit the size of the audience who would receive the message,and make it less likely the petition would gain enough signatures to earn placement on the state ballot.
the law on its face prohibits payroll deductions only for political activities.this is discrimination,which is a form of content discrimination.consol.edison pub.serv.comm n,d see also burson,at.holding a tennessee law prohibiting speech related to a political campaign near polling places to be a restriction bayless,at holding a state statute restricting only expenditures which expressly advocate election or defeat of a candidate to be a restriction.
ordinarily,because we are dealing with restriction of political speech,we would evaluate its validity under strict scrutiny.fed.election comm n.at.indeed,regulations of speech are generally presumptively invalid,under the rationale that content discrimination raises the specter that the government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.city of paul,d quoting simon schuster,members of state crime victims,d.to be constitutional,must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.fed.election comm n.at.as appellants proffer no compelling interest in favor of the law,both sides agree that it would easily fail strict scrutiny 
strict scrutiny,however,is not applied in all circumstances involving restrictions.see davenport.educ.ass n,d.appellants contend that two excepted circumstances apply here,and it is to that argument that we now turn.
in general,government may refrain from paying for speech with which it disagrees.see,regan taxation with representation,d explaining that congress may make distinctions when it subsidizes speech,in that case by granting to qualifying organizations the amount of income taxes they would otherwise owe chamber of commerce lockyer,cir en banc california law prohibiting the use of state grant and program funds on activities related to union organizing did not infringe affected employers first amendment rights.the nonsubsidy doctrine is premised on the rationale that the government is free to confer no benefit at all and is therefore entitled to condition the receipt of the benefit on speech or silence.see regan,at.but legal aid soc y legal servs,cir discussing unconstitutional restrictions upon which the government may not condition receipt of a benefit.
applying this doctrine,the district court held that the state of idaho could properly forbid payroll deductions of its own employees to be used for union activities,as the first amendment imposes no obligation to subsidize union and employee speech by paying for the administration of the payroll deductions.pocatello educ.ass n,wl,at toledo area council pizza,cir educ.ass campbell,cir.the parties appear to be in agreement as to this point,and the holding is unchallenged on appeal.as the district court noted,however,there is no subsidy by the state of idaho for the payroll deduction systems of local governments.
ii.forum analysis 
in certain cases,regulation of speech on government property is not subject to strict scrutiny.in particular,it is well established that,when the government permits speech on government property that is a nonpublic forum,it can exclude speakers on the basis of their subject matter,so long as the distinctions drawn are viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.davenport.at see also.educ.television comm forbes,d approving exclusion of independent political candidate from public television debate because he had little popular support.appellants invoke this doctrine,arguing that the proper way to view the statute is to look at the payroll deduction programs of local governments as nonpublic fora belonging to the state appellants argue that is therefore valid because it is viewpoint neutral,applying to all employers and to any type of political contribution,and assert that the restriction is plainly reasonable given idaho interest in its payroll system not assisting or having the appearance of assisting with political matters.
government regulation of speech in public spaces has historically been governed by the public forum doctrine.see united states kokinda,d explaining development of doctrine perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d formally classifying public property into three groups.the extent to which the government can control access depends on the nature of the relevant forum.cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.the traditional public forum includes property characterized,by long tradition or by government fiat as devoted to assembly and debate.perry educ.ass n,at.noting that streets and parks are the quintessential examples of public fora.the government may exclude speakers from a traditional public forum only when the exclusion is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and the exclusion is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.cornelius,at.see also hague comm.for indus.opinion of roberts,the privilege to use the streets and parks for communication of views on national questions may be regulated in the interest of all but it must not,in the guise of regulation,be abridged or denied.
in comparison,designated public fora are created where the government has opened public property for expressive activity.perry educ.ass n,at.if the government has opened the property to a class of speakers,rather than offering selective access to individual speakers,the property is a designated public forum with respect to all speakers within that class.educ.television comm n,at.flint dennison,cir widmar vincent,d state university created designated public forum for registered student groups by implementing policy that expressly made its meeting facilities generally open to such groups.the state may also designate a public forum for discussion of certain subjects.perry educ.ass n,at,citing city of madison joint sch.dist.employment relations comm n,d.in a designated public forum,prohibitions on speech,including the exclusion of particular speakers,must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest.perry educ.ass n,at.see.educ.television comm n,at.cornelius,at.in other words,as long as the forum is open,the state is bound by the same standards as apply to the traditional public forum.perry educ.ass n,at.
finally,a nonpublic forum has been characterized as a ny public property that is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication.faith ctr.church evangelistic ministries glover,cir.for example,in international society for krishna consciousness,lee,d iskcon,the court declared airport terminals to be a nonpublic forum because,although speech activity occurs in airport terminals,their tradition and purpose is to facilitate passenger air travel and serve as a commercial enterprise,not to promote expression.id.at.the government may limit access to a nonpublic forum to activities compatible with the intended purpose of the property.perry educ.ass n,at.
a forum does not need to be a physical place.see rosenberger,at.endorsing use of forum analysis in considering fora defined more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or geographic sense.for example,in cornelius,the supreme court held that a charity drive within federal workplaces constituted a forum.at.the court reasoned that the relevant forum should be determined on the basis of the type of access sought by the speaker to the relevant property,and the naacp did not claim any general right of access to the federal workplace outside of the charity drive.id.at.thus,the court considered the relevant forum to be the charity drive itself rather than the federal workplace.see also rosenberger,at.forum is the university student fund responsible for monetary reimbursements to student groups perry educ.ass n,at.forum is the public school mail facilities and delivery system flint,at forum is a student government election child evangelism fellowship anderson sch.dist.five,cir forum is the school policy of waiving fees for the use of school facilities.
following cornelius,the relevant forum in this case would be the payroll deduction programs of the local governments,as plaintiffs seek access to this part of local government workplaces.appellants assert that the payroll deduction programs are nonpublic fora.the government may place limits on speech in a nonpublic forum,perry educ.ass n,at,so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral.cornelius,at.appellants assert that meets this test 
nevertheless,plaintiffs argue strenuously that forum analysis does not apply at all because neither the payroll deduction programs nor the local workplaces are property of the state of idaho in any sense,and the state of idaho therefore can not assert an interest in protecting the fora.to resolve this question,we consider first the required relationship between the government entity seeking to impose a free speech restriction and the forum in which it is imposed.we then examine the relationship between the state of idaho and the workplaces of its local governments.
in iskcon,the court explained the rationale for forum analysis as follows where the government is acting as a proprietor,managing its internal operations,rather than acting as lawmaker with the power to regulate or license,its action will not be subjected to the heightened review to which its actions as a lawmaker may be subject.at.thus,in these situations,the role of the government has changed from regulator to something akin to that of a private landowner,with at least some of the associated exclusionary rights see greer spock,d the state,no less than a private owner of property,has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.davis massachusetts.analogizing the government control over public property to that of the owner of a private house.
forum analysis developed in battles over access to physical spaces,such as streets,buses,and airports,where property law provides a ready guide to the scope of the government rights.supreme court precedent accordingly suggests that a forum may be subject to government control where the government entity maintains a proprietary relationship over the relevant property.for example,in iskcon,the court noted specifically that the port authority of new york and new jersey,the entity which had adopted the regulation,owned and operated the airport terminals which constituted the property subject to the challenged regulation.at.see also.educ.television comm n,at.state agency owned and operated the television station which held the political debate determined to be a nonpublic forum kokinda,at.federal government acted in a proprietary capacity in restricting access to postal service sidewalk owned by postal service lehman city of shaker heights,d limits placed by city on access to municipal transit system advertising space held to be reasonable legislative objectives advanced by the city in a proprietary capacity 
by contrast,the mere possession of legal authority to regulate an entity,without more,represents an insufficient level of control over that property to claim the forum in the name of the state.in consolidated edison,the supreme court rejected an attempt by the state of new york,acting through the new york public service commission,to regulate consolidated edison monthly bill inserts.at.the state argued that it was entitled to treat the billing envelope as subject to the state plenary control because of the state regulatory interest in controlling operations of a public utility.id.at.see also id.at.noting that consolidated edison,although privately owned,was a monopoly.the court held that the state legitimate regulatory interest in controlling consolidated edison activities did not alter the nature of the property as private therefore,caselaw governing rights of access to governmental property did not apply.id.at.
reviewing the relationship between the state of idaho and the workplaces of local governments,we conclude that appellants have failed to establish that the state of idaho is the proprietor of the local workplaces or of local government payroll systems.the state relationship with the local governments instead resembles that of a regulator who possesses broad powers over them.
appellants evidence of control over local governments is similar to that presented by the state of new york in consolidated edison.appellants rely exclusively on the state legislature authority over idaho political subdivisions,arguing that the state power to regulate various aspects of local government necessarily gives it the right to control access to the local governments payroll deduction programs.they point out that the legislature may create,control,alter and abolish local governments as it sees fit,subject only to the limits of the idaho constitution,citing state ex rel.hays steunenberg,idaho.appellants discuss the doctrine of preemption of municipal law by state law,note that local governments may levy taxes only to the extent they are authorized to do so by the legislature,and note the limits on the borrowing capabilities of counties,cities,and school districts,citing idaho const.art.xii,id.art.xiii,brewster city of pocatello,idaho,caesar state,idaho,idaho water res.bd.kramer,idaho,state robbins,idaho.
appellants note that school districts are supervised and controlled by the state board of education,idaho code,which must approve the changing of school district boundaries,the addition or subtraction of territory,and the creation of new districts.id.appellants also highlight common school district twin falls bank trust,idaho,which states that school districts are agencies of the state.id.at but see smith meridian joint sch.dist,idaho,calling this holding into doubt in light of the subsequent passage of the idaho administrative procedures act,which specifically defines the term agency.finally,school districts can only exercise implied powers consistent with those expressly granted by the legislature.olmstead carter,idaho.
as illustrated by consolidated edison,however,the generalized lawmaking power held by the legislature with respect to a state political subdivisions does not establish that the state is acting as a proprietor with respect to the property of local governments.in consolidated edison,the new york legislature had granted the public service commission broad regulatory powers over consolidated edison.see consol.edison pub.serv.comm n,noting that the public service commission was granted all powers necessary or proper to enable it to carry out the purposes of the public service law quoting pub.serv.law,rev,d.the court nevertheless found this broad grant of authority insufficient to render consolidated edison billing envelopes a forum of the public service commission.here,nothing in the idaho code suggests that idaho is the proprietor of the local government workplaces or their payroll deduction programs.the statutes instead suggest the the state has granted units of local government the right to own and control their own property,independent of the state control.
many units of local government in idaho are expressly declared to be independent corporate bodies,suggesting independent powers of management and governance as compared with state agencies,which lack a similarly corporate status.see,idaho code cemetery maintenance districts,counties,housing authorities,recreation districts,waste disposal districts,school districts,library districts,highway districts,cities id.declaring state board of corrections to be an agency of the state,state board of education belongs to the executive department of state government,classifying department of fish and game as a branch of the executive department of state government.
caselaw has also recognized that local governments are distinct entities from the state of idaho.idaho sch.for equal educ.opportunity state,idaho,affirming school districts right to sue the state despite a statute purporting to limit this right smith,at holding that school districts and their boards of trustees are separate entities from the state union pac.idaho,denying eleventh amendment immunity to county officials and holding that counties are independent political subdivisions of the state 
of particular importance to forum analysis,the legislature has granted many local governmental units various powers to acquire,hold,and convey real and personal property.see,idaho code cemetery maintenance districts,counties,fire protection districts,television translator districts,housing authorities,recreation districts,school districts,cities.these rights of ownership are clearly independent of the state itself,as other portions of the code discuss the ability of the local government units to grant property to the state or to other political subdivisions of the state.see,idaho code.for example,school districts have the same property transfer rights the state as they have other government entities.id.b.appellants presented no evidence that local workplaces are treated differently than other types of property owned by local government.
in sum,the state broad powers of control over local government entities are solely those of a regulator,analogous to the new york public service commission regulatory powers over consolidated edison.local governments are independent corporations and many are explicitly granted the right to own and control their own property.lacking any evidence of the state proprietary relationship with the local government workplace,appellants assertion that the payroll deduction programs of local governments are nonpublic fora belonging to the state must fail.
