since,charleston county,south carolina has been governed by a county council composed of nine members elected in,partisan elections.despite the county substantial minority population,few candidates,and very few minority candidates,have ever been elected to the council.the united states brought this suit,alleging that the county election of its council diluted minority voting strength in violation of section of the voting rights act of.the district court agreed,finding that the county severe voting polarization,its particular electoral structure,and its sheer size combined to deny minority voters an equal opportunity to elect their preferred representatives.because the district court finding is not clearly erroneous,we affirm.
located in the southeastern corner of south carolina,where the ashley and cooper rivers converge on the atlantic,charleston county covers over nine hundred square miles.it includes tiny municipalities like awendaw and mcclellanville islands like kiawah and seabrook and of course cities like charleston,the state second largest.the county is ethnically as well as geographically diverse.the third most populous of the state counties,it has the second highest total number of black residents.of its roughly residents,are white are black and are of other racial or ethnic descent 
the numbers of registered and actual voters,however,are more disparate.as of november,people were registered to vote in charleston county,of whom were white and of whom were nonwhite.of those registered voters,actually voted in the november general election,of whom were white and of whom were nonwhite.according to the evidence of voter turnout presented by the county own expert witness,ronald weber,minority registered voters have consistently participated at a lower rate than white registered voters in charleston county council general elections.
the county council oversees local governance on issues ranging from economic development to public safety,and it is composed of nine members elected to staggered terms in,partisan elections.candidates for the council run from four residency districts three council seats are reserved for residents of the city of charleston,three for residents of north charleston,two for residents of west ashley,and one for a resident of east cooper.charleston county is one of only three counties in south carolina that elects its entire county council,and it is the only county with a majority white population to do so.the other two counties that elect their county councils,hampton and jasper,are less populated,rural counties with roughly equal numbers of minority and white residents.
the county modified system,in which all of the county residents may vote for candidates residing in specific areas of the county,was created in,and it was precleared by the attorney general under section of the voting rights act.see.in,the county residents narrowly rejected a referendum to switch from the electoral system to a district system.both the county and the united states agree that voting on the referendum was extremely polarized at least of minority voters approved the switch to districts,while at least of white voters wanted to retain elections.
since,people have been elected to the county council,only three of whom are minorities lonnie hamilton iii,who was elected six times between and,serving a total of years marjorie,who was elected twice in and and timothy scott,who has remained the council only minority member since.while minority candidates preferred by minority voters have had great difficulty winning election to the council,white candidates who were preferred by minority voters have been somewhat more successful,according to evidence of recent council elections presented by the united states expert witness,theodore arrington.
section a of the voting rights act prohibits a state or its political subdivision from imposing any voting practice that results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the united states to vote on account of race or color a.section b,as amended in,further provides that a violation of a occurs 
if,based on the totality of the circumstances,it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by a in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.
id.b.the amendment made clear that section condemns not only voting practices borne of a discriminatory intent,but also voting practices that operate,designedly or otherwise,to deny equal access to any phase of the electoral process for minority group members,at,reprinted in,hereinafter senate report see also chisom roemer,nn,d.
in thornburg gingles,d,the supreme court established the framework for claims that an voting system dilutes minority voting strength in violation of of the voting rights act.according to the court,three preconditions are necessary to a finding of vote dilution 
first,the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single member district 
second,the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive 
third,the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate.
gingles,at.citations and footnotes omitted.if these three preconditions are satisfied,then the trier of fact must determine whether,based on the totality of the circumstances,there has been a violation of section.johnson degrandy,d cane worcester county,cir.
in determining which circumstances courts should take care to consider,the supreme court has turned for guidance to the senate report that accompanied congress amendments to the voting rights act.see gingles,at.according to congress and the court,the most important factors in the inquiry into the totality of the circumstances are the extent to which minority group members have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction,and the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized.id.at.quoting senate report at internal quotation omitted.if these factors are present,other considerations are supportive of,but not essential to a claim the history of discrimination in the state or political subdivision the extent to which the state or political subdivision has used voting practices that enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group,such as unusually large election districts or shot provisions the exclusion of minorities from the candidate slating process the use of racial appeals in political campaigns and the degree to which past discrimination in such areas as education,employment and health has hindered the ability of minorities to participate effectively in the political process.id.emphasis in original.
however,this list is neither comprehensive nor exclusive.gingles,at.see senate report at the senate report factors will often be the most relevant ones,but in some cases other factors will be indicative of the alleged dilution.congress intended the ultimate conclusions about equality or inequality of opportunity to be judgments resting on comprehensive,not limited,canvassing of relevant facts.degrandy,at.
before the district court,charleston county method for electing its county council was challenged as a violation of by both the united states and a group of charleston county voters.the united states and the private plaintiffs claimed that the county method resulted in the unlawful dilution of minority voting strength.in addition,the private not the united that the county system intentionally discriminated against minority voters.both the united states and the private plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment as to the three gingles preconditions necessary to establish a violation.
on april,based on the reports and testimony of both arrington,the united states expert and weber,the county expert,the magistrate judge recommended that the plaintiffs motion be granted.on the first gingles and magistrate judge found that the minority population of charleston county is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district.on the second gingles magistrate judge reviewed evidence presented by both parties indicating that minority voters in charleston county are politically cohesive.for instance,according to weber,minority voters have been politically cohesive in of contested council elections since.
finally,on the third gingles bloc magistrate judge again reviewed evidence from both parties that minority voters preferred council candidates are usually defeated by cohesive white voting.pursuant to our decision in lewis alamance county,cir,the magistrate judge declined to consider charleston county argument that candidates were usually defeated on account of partisanship,not race.according to the magistrate judge,alamance county renders causation irrelevant to the third gingles the question for purposes of the third gingles precondition is whether whites vote as a bloc,and not why they do so.under alamance county,according to the magistrate judge,causation is instead relevant to the inquiry into the totality of the circumstances,once the gingles preconditions have been satisfied.
on july,the united states district court for the district of south carolina adopted the magistrate report,and granted summary judgment to the united states and the private plaintiffs as to the three gingles preconditions.the district court then held a trial on the remaining issue whether,based on the totality of the circumstances,the county electoral method violated.on march,the district court agreed with the united states that the county system diluted minority voting strength,depriving minority voters of an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect representatives of their choice.however,the district court rejected the private plaintiffs claim that the county system was adopted with the intent to discriminate against minority voters.
charleston county now appeals the district court decision the county does not challenge the district court finding that the united states had established the first two gingles preconditions the county concedes not only that its minority voters are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district,but also that they are politically cohesive.the county,however,does contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the third gingles presence of white racial bloc voting.the county also contends that,even if the three gingles preconditions were satisfied,the district court clearly erred in determining that the voting scheme diluted minority voting strength in violation of.we address the county claims in turn.
the crux of the county argument,from the outset of this litigation,has been that voting in charleston county is polarized as a result of partisanship rather than race.according to the county,whites vote as a for republican candidates,whatever their blacks vote as a for democratic candidates,whatever their race.in the county view,the third gingles precondition requires more than a showing that white bloc voting usually defeats the candidate.in order to demonstrate gingles legally significant white bloc voting,the county claims,the united states must prove that race rather than partisanship is the cause of the polarized voting.see at.for its part,the united states responds that evidence of partisanship as the cause of the racially divergent voting should be considered in the totality of the circumstances inquiry,after the gingles preconditions have been satisfied.
the parties thus rightly agree that an inquiry into causation is relevant.see alamance county,at see also gingles,at,concurring in judgment evidence that a candidate preferred by the minority group in a particular election was rejected by white voters for reasons other than those which made that candidate the preferred choice of the minority group would seem clearly relevant in answering the question whether bloc voting by white voters will consistently defeat minority candidates.uno city of holyoke,cir section does not require courts to ignore evidence that factors other than race are the real obstacles to the political success of a minority group.league of united latin am.citizens lulac clements,cir en banc the rigorous protections of the voting rights act,as the text of suggests,extend only to defeats experienced by voters on account of race or color.the parties simply disagree over the stage in the vote dilution inquiry at which causation evidence is appropriate.
as we explained in alamance county,the approach most faithful to the supreme court case law is one that treats causation as irrelevant in the inquiry into the three gingles preconditions,but relevant in the totality of circumstances inquiry.alamance county,at citations omitted see also gingles,at,concurring in judgment explaining that causation evidence should be part of the overall vote dilution inquiry.the inquiry into the gingles preconditions is a preliminary one,designed to determine whether an system potentially violates.see growe emison,d.an system can not be responsible for diluting minority voting strength unless minority voters cohesively support particular candidates,the candidates are being systematically defeated by white bloc voting,and those defeats would not be occurring under a system of districts.see id.
but simply clearing the gingles hurdles,while necessary to prove a possible violation of,is not sufficient to establish an actual violation.degrandy,at.to demonstrate an actual violation,a plaintiff asserting vote dilution must show that,under the totality of the circumstances,the state challenged electoral scheme has the effect of diminishing or abridging the voting strength of the protected class.voinovich quilter,d.accordingly,a court must undertake a searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality,gingles,at.quoting senate report at internal quotation omitted,which demands a comprehensive,not limited,canvassing of relevant facts,degrandy,at.it is this inclusive examination of the totality of the circumstances that is for considering why voting patterns differ along racial lines.
by expanding the inquiry into the third gingles precondition to ask not merely whether,but also why,voters are racially polarized,the county would convert the threshold test into precisely the,examination it is meant to precede.we have rejected this approach,alamance county,at,as has the majority of our sister circuits,compare goosby town,cir treating causation under the totality of circumstances analysis rather than the third gingles precondition milwaukee branch of the thompson,cir sanchez colorado,cir uno,at nipper smith,cir en banc,with lulac,at finding third gingles precondition unsatisfied because partisan affiliation,not race,caused the defeat of the candidate.
the county also misfires when it argues that by referring to the third gingles precondition as legally significant white bloc voting,what the gingles court meant was white bloc voting that occurs on account of racial animus or bias.gingles,at.rather,what the gingles court meant was the degree of racially polarized voting that matters in the context of.according to the court,for racially polarized voting to be legally significant,minority voters must usually vote for the same candidates,and white bloc voting must normally or generally lead to the defeat of candidates.id.legally significant white bloc voting thus refers to the frequency with which,and not the reason why,whites vote cohesively for candidates who are not backed by minority voters.the county does not even attempt to argue that its racially polarized voting is legally insignificant in this sense.indeed,the county own expert testified that candidates are usually defeated by white bloc voting.the district court therefore properly found the third gingles precondition satisfied.
the county next argues that,even if the gingles pr
