in this appeal,senator roland burris challenges a permanent injunction entered by the district court after our decision in judge quinn,cir judge i.that injunction states that the state of illinois will hold a special election on november.in that election,the people of illinois will select a permanent replacement to fill president barack obama seat in the senate for the remainder of the congress.because november is fast approaching and in the interest of a manageable election,the district court limited the candidates who will appear on the ballot for the special election to those people who are slated to appear on the november ballot in the general election to fill the senate term that will begin at the start of the congress.one practical effect of this limitation was to prevent senator burris,who was appointed to serve as president obama temporary replacement in the senate,from participating in the special election.in this appeal,senator burris asks us to vacate the district court permanent injunction.we conclude that the lower court acted well within its discretion,and we affirm its order.
we will assume familiarity with our earlier opinion,which described the background of this case,and so we address here only the facts necessary to resolve this successive appeal.on june,we affirmed the district court decision to deny a preliminary injunction to two illinois voters who claimed that the seventeenth amendment required pat quinn,the governor of illinois,to issue a writ calling for a special election to select a permanent replacement for president obama former seat in the senate.judge i,supra.
our analysis of the seventeenth amendment led to the conclusion that a state must hold an election each time that a vacancy occurs in its senate delegation,so that the people of the state can elect a replacement senator.to ensure that such an election takes place,the executive officer of the state is required by the constitution to issue a writ of election.the timing and mechanics of the special election are governed by state law,as contemplated by the elections clause of the constitution and the final phrase of the seventeenth amendment second paragraph.finally,the seventeenth amendment permits the state legislature to empower the state executive to fill a senate vacancy temporarily by appointment,until a special election takes place.judge i,at.at the time of the plaintiffs initial appeal in this case,governor quinn had not issued a writ of election,and the state of illinois took the position that senator burris was to serve as president obama replacement in the senate until january.they maintained this position despite the fact that blagojevich certificate appointing senator burris made clear that his tenure in the senate was to last only until the vacancy is filled by election as provided by law.accordingly,we concluded that the plaintiffs had a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their constitutional claim.
ultimately,however,we decided that preliminary relief was not warranted because the plaintiffs failed to identify any irreparable harm that they might suffer in the absence of immediate equitable relief.we noted there was still ample time during which governor quinn might issue a writ of election,and we felt confident that the district court would resolve the merits of the plaintiffs claim in a timely fashion.because the issue was not presented in the plaintiffs appeal,we declined to address how the state was to decide what names should appear on the ballot for the special election.we did suggest,however,that the state might propose a solution acceptable to all parties.judge i,at.
following our decision,the plaintiffs asked the district court to enter a permanent injunction ordering governor quinn to issue a writ of election that would call for a special election on november,the date specified by the illinois election code,ilcs west.on june,the district court held the first of five hearings to consider the plaintiffs request.lawyers for the plaintiffs,governor quinn,and senator burris were present.governor quinn opposed the injunction,saying that a second election on november would cause voter confusion,that there was too little time to prepare,and that the illinois election code failed to outline any method for selecting candidates to participate.senator burris joined the governor opposition.in response,the plaintiffs proposed a number of potential solutions to the purported timing and problems.the district court postponed its decision while governor quinn filed a petition in this court for rehearing.
on june,governor quinn filed his petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc.among other arguments,he again asserted that it would be impossible for illinois to prepare for a special election in compliance with the illinois election code in the time remaining before november.the plaintiffs filed an expedited response,explaining that a november special election was feasible if the state overrode the normal primary system for selecting candidates for the ballot and used a more expeditious method.we denied rehearing on july,at which point we amended our initial decision to make clear that 
t he district court has the power to order the state to take steps to bring its election procedures into compliance with rights guaranteed by the federal constitution,even if the order requires the state to disregard provisions of state law that otherwise might ordinarily apply to cause delay or prevent action entirely to the extent that illinois law makes compliance with a provision of the federal constitution difficult or impossible,it is illinois law that must yield.
judge quinn,wl,at cir.july,unpublished order judge ii.
four days after that order,the district court held its fourth hearing to consider the permanent injunction.abandoning his earlier position,governor quinn there acknowledged that a special election was possible.this meant that all of the parties then agreed that a primary was unnecessary.governor quinn proposed that the court disregard the requirements of the illinois election code and limit the special election ballot to candidates who had been selected in primaries or had collected the requisite number of signatures and were set to appear on the november general election ballot for the new,senate term.that precise procedure,the parties agreed,had been used in illinois to select candidates for a special election to the house of representatives following our decision in jackson ogilvie,cir.see vote set for house vacancy,chicago tribune,july,at.while the plaintiffs initially put forward a plan under which the central committees of the state political parties would choose candidates for the special election,in accordance with the vacancy provisions of the illinois election code,they made clear that they did not object to the governor plan.
senator burris,however,was not satisfied.he opposed any plan that would leave him or other interested citizens,he said off the special election ballot.he proposed that the district court enter an injunction providing that parties who collected a limited number of signatures would also be entitled to appear on the ballot for the special election.governor quinn urged the court to reject that idea,arguing that an entirely novel qualifying procedure would be much too complicated to implement in the short time that remained.in response,the district court asked the parties whether they would object to its ordering that senator burris should be included on the special election ballot by fiat.senator burris supported that proposal.but the plaintiffs noted that senator burris appointment to the senate did not give him a special claim to a spot on the ballot over any other citizen,and governor quinn added that the presence of senator burris on the list of special election candidates might cause confusion among voters if he was then absent from the list of general election candidates on the same ballot.as the hearing closed,the district judge asked governor quinn and the plaintiffs to return later that week with a draft injunction order.senator burris,still objecting to his potential exclusion,asked to submit a brief in opposition to any order,to which the court responded,i do need any briefs on this.but i will hear you fully when we have an order d o be afraid that you wo have an opportunity to be heard.
on july,the district court held its fifth and final hearing.governor quinn and the plaintiffs arrived having reached agreement on the contours of a permanent injunction order.after a discussion about how long the state would have to certify election results,the court asked senator burris attorney what right senator burris had to be placed on the special election ballot as opposed to any other person.the attorney responded,i do know that senator burris is suggesting that there is a right outside of the right that should be afforded to any person to have ballot access.he believes that to be a constitutional right.senator burris also submitted a brief in opposition to the permanent injunction,in which he argued that the district court had denied him the opportunity to be heard and threatened to violate his right to access the ballot by issuing an injunction.
the district judge decided it would adopt governor quinn proposal,restricting the special election ballot to those candidates slated to run in the general election.at the same time,in springfield,illinois,governor quinn issued a writ of election.he commanded the clerks in each county to cause a special election to permanently fill president obama vacancy for the remainder of obama term to be held in the state of illinois on tuesday,november,in conformity with any applicable federal court orders and,to the extent feasible,with the illinois election code 
on august,the district court entered its preliminary injunction order.in the order,the district court confirmed that the illinois election code established november as the date for a special election,and it found that the writ of election issued by governor quinn complied with the federal constitution and illinois law.in addition,the district court noted that it had conducted five separate hearings to consider procedures for conducting a special election on short notice,and it recognized that to the extent that illinois law makes compliance with a provision of the federal constitution difficult or impossible,it is illinois law that must yield to the extent that it otherwise might apply to cause delay or prevent action entirely.judge ii.noting that a primary election was not necessary and that candidates had to be limited to a manageable number,the court entered its order adopting governor quinn plan.senator burris appeal followed 
we review a district court entry of a permanent injunction for an abuse of discretion.insight v.the spamhaus project,cir.in an election law case,t he essential question is whether the district court properly exercised its equitable discretion in reconciling the requirements of the constitution with the goals of state political policy.connor finch,d.
senator burris principal contention in this appeal is that the district court lacked the power to enter a permanent injunction defining the mechanics of the november special election.this argument is split into two closely related branches first,the senator claims that the lower court order concerns a nonjusticiable political question and second,he asserts that the injunction invades the exclusive province of the illinois state legislature,in violation of the elections clause and the seventeenth amendment.in addition to these arguments,senator burris takes the position that the permanent injunction interferes with his constitutional right of access to the ballot.
we begin with the argument,for if this case presents an issue that falls within the scope of that doctrine,then we lack authority to adjudicate it.massachusetts epa,d citing luther borden,how.contrary to the plaintiffs suggestion,it makes no difference whether senator burris raised this argument before the district court it affects our jurisdiction and can not be forfeited.
the doctrine identifies a class of questions that either are not amenable to judicial resolution because the relevant considerations are beyond the courts capacity to gather and weigh,or have been committed by the constitution to the exclusive,unreviewable discretion of the executive political branches of the federal government.miami nation of indians of indiana,of the interior,cir.the supreme court decision in baker carr sets out the factors that,if present,suggest that a political question exists 
a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion or the impossibility of a court undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.
d.importantly,the baker court added that t he doctrine is one of political questions,not one of political cases.the courts can not reject as no law suit a bona fide controversy as to whether some action denominated political exceeds constitutional authority.id.senator burris suggests that several of the considerations baker carr identified as tending to reveal a political question are present in his case.in our view,however,the only ones that require closer attention are whether there is a lack of judicially manageable standards for implementing the special election or if the conduct of that election is entirely committed to the political branches.
with respect to the first of those issues,both history and constitutional text show that this case is not one where reasonable people might disagree about the availability of judicially manageable standards.but compare vieth jubelirer,d,and davis bandemer,d.the seventeenth amendment supplies a concrete rule requiring an election to fill each senate vacancy.the district court turned to state law,past practice in illinois,and recent primary election results to establish the timing of the required special election and a fair slate of candidates to participate.nothing that the court did in order to bring illinois election procedures into line with the seventeenth amendment was beyond its capacity.
similarly,this case does not involve an issue committed to the exclusive discretion of one of the political branches.senator burris takes the view that,because the constitution commits to the illinois legislature the job of defining the mechanics of a vacancy election,the federal district court has no institutional role to play.but a long line of decisions from the supreme court demonstrate that he is wrong.the court has said that w hen challenges to state action respecting matters of the administration of the affairs of the state and the officers through whom they are conducted have rested on claims of constitutional deprivation which are amenable to judicial correction,federal courts may act to address the merits of those claims.baker,at internal quotation marks and footnote omitted.indeed,the court repeatedly has held that a federal court may correct constitutional wrongs in areas generally within the purview of state lawmakers,and it has applied this principle to the area of elections.in addition to baker,supra,see william rhodes,d the state claim that the doctrine precludes judicial consideration of these cases requires very little discussion.that claim has been rejected in cases of this kind numerous times.bond floyd,d the state does not claim that it should be completely free of judicial review whenever it disqualifies an elected representative it admits that,if a state legislature excluded a legislator on racial or other clearly unconstitutional grounds,the federal judiciary would be justified in testing the exclusion by federal constitutional standards.reynolds sims,d o nce a state legislative apportionment scheme has been found to be unconstitutional,it would be the unusual case
