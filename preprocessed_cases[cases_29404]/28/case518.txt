introduction 
in,the voters of the city and county of san francisco city,a home rule charter city,passed proposition h,a local ordinance prohibiting virtually all city residents from possessing handguns and all city residents,without exception,from selling,distributing,transferring and manufacturing firearms and ammunition.a legal challenge to the ordinance resulted in the trial court holding that key aspects of the ordinance were preempted by state law.based on its further determination that the invalid portions of the ordinance were not severable from the arguably valid portions,the court found that the ordinance was preempted in its entirety.lastly,the trial court held that the city home rule power under the california constitution,article xi,section,subdivision a municipal home rule for charter cities did not override state preemption because the field being regulated was one of statewide,rather than local,concern.we agree with the trial court conclusions,and affirm the judgment in all respects.
facts and procedural history 
this appeal concerns proposition h prop h or ordinance,a municipal ordinance enacted by the city voters in november.the findings section of prop h states that h andgun violence is a serious problem in san francisco,accounting for percent of injuries or deaths caused by firearms in the city in.these findings also state that prop h is not intended to affect residents from other jurisdictions with regard to handgun possession.therefore,the provisions of section banning handgun possession in the city apply exclusively to residents of the city and county of san francisco.section also invokes the city home rule power and describes that power as allowing counties to enact laws that exclusively apply to residents within their borders,even when such a law conflicts with state law or when state law is silent.
prop h contains two substantive provisions,section and section.section is entitled ban on sale,manufacture,transfer or distribution of firearms in the city and county of san francisco.it states,in its entirety,that w ithin the limits of the city and county of san francisco,the sale,distribution,transfer and manufacture of all firearms and ammunition shall be prohibited.there are no exceptions to this section.
section is entitled limiting handgun possession in the city and county of san francisco.it states that within city boundaries,no resident of the city and county of san francisco shall possess any handgun unless required for professional purposes,as enumerated herein.section contains narrow exemptions to the city ban on possession of handguns for government employees carrying out the functions of government employment,active members of the united states armed forces or the national guard,and security guards while actually employed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his or her employment section indicates that any city resident may surrender his or her handgun without penalty at any district station of the san francisco police department or to the san francisco sheriff department within days after section becomes effective.the city board of supervisors is charged with enacting penalties for violation of the ordinance.
section is entitled state law.it provides that n othing in this ordinance is designed to duplicate or conflict with california state law or to create or require any local license or registration for any firearm,or create an additional class of citizens who must seek licensing or registration.additionally,the ordinance does not apply to any person currently denied the privilege of possessing a handgun under state law 
finally,section of the ordinance contains a severability clause that provides i f any provision of this ordinance or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid or unconstitutional,such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect other provisions or applications or sic this ordinance,which can be given effect without the invalid or unconstitutional provision or application.to this end,the provisions of this ordinance shall be deemed severable.
after prop h passed,paula fiscal,several retired law enforcement and military personnel,two law enforcement associations,and several firearms rights groups collectively,petitioners sought a writ of mandate declaring prop h invalid.among other arguments,petitioners challenged the ordinance on the grounds that it was preempted by state law.
the trial court granted petitioners request for writ of mandate,finding prop h unenforceable,primarily because it was preempted by three separate state laws regulating firearms.specifically,the court determined that the key provisions of prop h,prohibiting the sale of firearms and possession of handguns by city residents,were preempted by penal code section,subdivision b prohibiting localities from restricting handgun possession in an individual home,business,or private property,government code section indicating an express intent by the legislature to occupy the whole field of firearms licensing and registration and the unsafe handgun act,penal code sections establishing a protocol for designating which handguns may be sold in california uha.finally,the trial court found that any residual portions of prop h arguably valid were not severable because the court could not disentangle the various bans without exceeding its powers by deleting and adding words,rewriting the ordinance.the court further concluded that the subject of prop h dealing with the possession and use of handguns is one of statewide concern and therefore controlled by the applicable state law.this appeal followed.
discussiona.introduction 
before addressing the issues raised in this case,we briefly note what is not at issue in this appeal.this case is not about the public policy choices that the voters in san francisco have made by enacting prop thus,we need not,and do not,pass judgment on the merits of prop h,or engage ourselves in the sociological and cultural debate about whether gun control is an effective means to combat crime.compare ayres donohue,shooting down the more guns,less crime hypothesis stanford.comment,confirming more guns,less crime stanford.similarly,the question of whether california citizens do or do not enjoy a constitutional right to own or possess firearms,or if it exists,whether that right can be limited by local gun control legislation has not been raised or argued by the parties to this case.see generally kasler lockyer cal th,d,no mention made in california constitution of right to bear arms.our task is simply to determine whether prop h is preempted by state law.
california preemption analysis and standard of review 
in city of stockton cal th,d,our supreme court recently restated the guiding principles for determining whether a local ordinance is displaced by a state measure.the court explained,under article xi,section of the california constitution,a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general state laws.if otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law,it is preempted by such law and is void.citations.a conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication.citations.city of los angeles cal th,d,italics added,fn.omitted see also american financial services city of oakland cal th,d,american financial,supra,cal th at,d.
the court explained the italicized terms as follows a local ordinance duplicates state law when it is coextensive with state law,supra,cal th at,d,citing in re portnoy cal d,as finding duplication where local legislation purported to impose the same criminal prohibition that general law imposed.
a local ordinance contradicts state law when it is inimical to or can not be reconciled with state law,supra,cal th at,d,citing ex parte daniels cal,as finding contradiction in a local ordinance that set the maximum speed limit for vehicles below that set by state law.
a local ordinance enters a field fully occupied by state law in either of two the legislature expressly manifest s its intent to occupy the legal area or when the legislature impliedly occupies the field,supra,cal th at,d,see also witkin,summary of cal.law ed.constitutional law,w here the legislature has manifested an intention,expressly or by implication,wholly to occupy the field municipal power to regulate in that area is lost,supra,cal th at,d.
the court went on to say when the legislature has not expressly stated its intent to occupy an area of law,we look to whether it has impliedly done so.this occurs in three situations when the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law,and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the locality,supra,cal th at,d,supra,cal th at,d.
because the city in this case is a charter city,the home rule doctrine also comes into play.article xi,section,subdivision a of the california constitution reserves to charter cities the right to adopt and enforce ordinances that conflict with general state laws,provided the subject of the regulation is a municipal affair rather than one of statewide concern.johnson bradley cal th,d.because the various sections of article xi fail to define municipal affairs,it becomes necessary for the courts to decide,under the facts of each case,whether the subject matter under discussion is of municipal or statewide concern.this question must be determined from the legislative purpose in each individual instance.city of santa clara von raesfeld cal d,quoting professional fire fighters,city of los angeles cal d.
a trial court decision invalidating a local ordinance on grounds of preemption is reviewed de novo.see city of watsonville state of health services th,d pieri city and county of san francisco th,d.similarly,where a charter city ordinance is challenged on preemption grounds and is defended as a permissible exercise of the city home rule power,the challenge also presents a question of law which must be decided on a basis.northern cal.psychiatric society city of berkeley d.northern cal.psychiatric society.
overview of parties arguments 
the preemption doctrine outlined above frames the parties arguments.petitioners contend the ordinance contains multiple provisions that trespass into fields of regulation that the state has either expressly or impliedly fully occupied.according to petitioners,state law has so thoroughly and pervasively covered the subjects covered by prop h,and the subjects are so in need of uniform state treatment,that the city most recent effort to restrict its citizens ability to purchase,own,and possess firearms,at home and at their businesses,is clearly preempted.
in rebuttal,the city points out that the legislature has never made clear its intention to preempt local regulation of firearms,and therefore this court should not infer preemption.the city stresses san francisco is besieged by violent crime,which often involves firearms,and the state legislature has failed to enact laws that would effectively address the gun violence that has particularly ravaged the city less affluent neighborhoods and minority communities.in light of the legislature inaction,the city claims it is essential that it be able to enact its own local ordinance restricting access to firearms in order to provide for the safety and welfare of its citizens.
the city is correct to the extent it argues that the legislature has never expressed an intent to preempt the entire field of firearm regulation to the exclusion of local control.the legislature,instead,has chosen to preempt discrete areas of gun regulation.great western shows,county of los angeles cal th,d,great western.that state law tends to concentrate on specific areas,leaving unregulated other substantial areas relating to the control of firearms,indicates an intent to permit local governments to tailor firearms legislation to the particular needs of their communities.citation.suter city of lafayette th,d suter.
we therefore turn to the state statutory scheme to determine whether any of the provisions of prop h duplicate or contradict state law,or whether its subject matter invades a field that the state has fully occupied,either expressly or implicitly,supra,cal th at,d.in undertaking a preemption analysis,we examine the myriad of subjects covered by the ordinance,starting with section handgun ban.despite the fact that no other court has been called upon to consider a local firearms ban of this scope,this court,when considering the power of the city to legislate in this area,is by no means writing on a blank slate.
section of prop h entitled limiting handgun possession in the city and county of san francisco is preempted by state law 
with narrow exceptions,section of prop h bans the possession of handguns by san francisco residents,including handgun possession within the sanctity of homes,businesses,and private property the trial court identified two state statutes,each of which specifically preempts a narrowly limited field of firearms regulation,which the trial court found preempted section.california rifle pistol city of west hollywood th,d crpa.these two code sections are penal code section,subdivision b prohibiting localities from restricting handgun possession in an individual home,business,or private property and government code section indicating an express intent by the legislature to occupy the whole field of firearms licensing and registration.the trial court conclusion is supported by the legislative history and subsequent judicial interpretation of these provisions.
in its current form,penal code section,subdivision b,reads that if a california resident suffers no legal impediment to handgun ownership,n o permit or license shall be required to purchase,own,possess,keep,or carry,either openly or concealed,a pistol,revolver,or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person within the citizen or legal resident place of residence,place of business,or on private property owned or lawfully possessed by the citizen or legal resident.penal code section was enacted in as part of the uniform firearms act.by barring the imposition of any permit or licensing requirement,penal code section served to preclude local public entities from adopting impediments on legally qualified citizens wishing to purchase,own,possess,keep,or carry a concealable firearm in their homes or businesses.
in galvan superior court cal d,galvan our supreme court held that penal code section did not prohibit san francisco from passing an ordinance requiring the registration of most firearms within city limits.id.at.the supreme court held that the san francisco ordinance did not contradict section because registration has an entirely different meaning than licensing,and registration and licensing,by their very nature,seek to achieve different goals.id.at.significantly,in discussing penal code section,galvan interpreted the no permit or license shall be required language broadly,as indicating a legislative intent that the right to possess a weapon at certain places could not be circumscribed by imposing any requirements id.at.
in response to galvan,the legislature enacted former government code section stats,ch,later at government code section stats,ch,government code section.this section expressly preempts all local laws which attempt to regulate either licensing or registration of firearms,by declaring the intention of the legislature to occupy the whole field of regulation of the registration or licensing of commercially manufactured firearms while expressly prohibiting all local regulations,relating to registration or licensing of commercially manufactured firearms 
after government code section was enacted,san francisco passed an ordinance requiring anyone seeking to purchase a concealable firearm within the city first to get a permit from the city police chief.this permit requirement was easily struck down by the court in sippel nelder d.as running afoul of both penal code section and government code section.id.at.the court concluded that,with the passage of government code section,the legislature resolved any possible doubt as to its intent to fully occupy the field of firearm control,both in terms of registration and licensing.ibid.the court also held that the plaintiff was entitled,under penal code section,to possess a concealed firearm at his residence without obtaining a license or permit of any kind.id.at.
ten years later,in doe city and county of san francisco d.doe,division three of this court was called upon to examine a san francisco ordinance banning the possession of handguns within city limits.exempted from the ordinance were persons possessing a state license to carry a concealed firearm under penal code section.id.at.
the doe court found the ordinance preempted by employing multiple,alternative analyses.most important to our analysis of prop h,the court concluded that section was intended to occupy the field of residential firearm possession.doe,supra,d at.it is at least arguable that the state legislature adoption of numerous gun regulations has not impliedly preempted all areas of gun regulation however,we infer from penal code section that the legislature intended to occupy the field of residential handgun possession to the exclusion of local governmental entities.a restriction on requiring permits and licenses necessarily implies that possession is lawful without a permit or license.it strains reason to suggest that the state legislature would prohibit licenses and permits but allow a ban on possession.id.at.
in our view,doe correctly interpreted penal code section as depriving local entities of any power to regulate handgun possession on private property.the city claims doe finding of a legislative intent to occupy the field of residential handgun possession was based on faulty reasoning.it argues that doe interpreted penal code section too broadly because when read literally,section does nothing more than preempt local governments from imposing a requirement that gun owners obtain a permit or license to purchase a handgun or to keep a handgun in their home or business however,they cite to no subsequent case which has overruled,disapproved of,or even sought to limit or clarify,the doe decision.in fact,doe has been cited with approval by our supreme court.great western,supra,cal th at,d.
also,the legislature is deemed to be aware of existing laws and judicial decisions in effect at the time legislation is enacted and to have enacted and amended statutes in the light of such decisions as have a direct bearing upon them.citation.barajas city of anaheim th,d.given the presumption of the legislature awareness of doe during the three times it has reenacted penal code section since the doe decision it is reasonable to assume that if the legislature intended to reopen this area of regulation to local units of government,it would have addressed the issue specifically by repealing or amending penal code section.olmstead arthur gallagher cal th,d.because it did not do so,we conclude that the legislature intended to maintain the prohibitions placed on local government that are contained in penal code section,as interpreted by the doe decision.peltier mccloud river th,d refusing to consider arguments that a previous case interpretation of a statute was wrong,given that the statute was reenacted without change to the language interpreted.
therefore,insofar as section of the ordinance operates to prohibit and punish handgun possession by city residents on private property,in their homes and businesses,it is impliedly preempted by penal code section.we agree with doe that it can be readily infer red from penal code section that the legislature intended to occupy the field of residential handgun possession to the exclusion of local governmental entities.doe,supra,d at.
while we have thus far focused on the relationship between state law and section ban on handgun possession on one private property,it is important to note that section regulates in a much broader field than just private property.section prohibits both public and private handgun possession and thus effectively displaces numerous state laws allowing private citizens to possess handguns for and other lawful purposes.as the trial court noted,t he statute books contain almost one hundred pages of unannotated state gun laws that set out a myriad of statewide licensing schemes,exceptions,and exemptions dealing with the possession and use of handguns.we provide a brief overview of just a few of the state statutes dealing with public handgun possession.
penal code section provides that,upon a showing of good cause,any,responsible adult can obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun.even without a license,penal code sections and,subdivision j create special exceptions whereby people who have been threatened and who have obtained restraining orders may carry loaded and concealed handguns.penal code sections,subdivision a and,subdivision b allow civilians to possess concealed and loaded handguns when summoned by police to assist police in making an arrest or to preserve the peace.penal code section,subdivision k permits possession of a loaded gun when making a citizen arrest.penal code section,subdivision j allows possession of a loaded firearm when a person has a reasonable belief that he or she is in immediate grave danger and the firearm is necessary to protect person or property.
certain classes of persons,while engaged in legitimate activities,are exempted from the operation of most of the statutory prohibitions governing handgun possession,including law enforcement agencies and officers see,subd.a a,subds.a,b,subds.a,subd.b,including retired peace officers,subd.a a,and the military,subds.e,f.
additionally,special exemptions and licenses are granted to certain individuals in the private sector,including the private security industry,subds.b,d,entertainment industry professionals,subd.a b vi,subds.a,subd.a,members of gun clubs,subd.f,subd.a,and private investigators,subd.d.any legal firearm may be possessed in public for hunting or shooting at a target range,or going to or from these places,one home and business,and certain other recognized activities,subds.a.
the broad language of government code section,prohibiting all local regulations,relating to registration and licensing of firearms,indicates that the state has an interest in statewide uniformity of handgun licensing.italics added.in finding government code section expressly preempted prop h,the trial court pointed out that the ordinance had the practical effect of revoking or otherwise invalidating existing state licenses,including those permitting the possession of handguns.the trial court went on to conclude that a local regulation that invalidates existing licenses,but does not affirmatively create new licensing schemes,relates to the state regulatory scheme of licensing firearms and,consequently,is expressly preempted by government code section.we agree.
while the city emphatically argues that prop h is a proper response to crime because it is aimed at criminals who use handguns in the commission of their unlawful acts,the city arguments fail to acknowledge that the ordinance will affect more than just criminals.it will also affect every city resident who has not,through some demonstration of personal disability or irresponsibility,lost his or her right to possess a handgun.although a precise assessment of the impact of this ordinance is difficult to gauge because the ordinance has never been enforced,at a minimum,section of prop h would invalidate all licenses possessed by city residents to carry a concealed weapon issued under penal code section,and it would prohibit the possession of handguns by city residents even if those residents are expressly authorized by state law to possess handguns for or other lawful purposes.
if the preemption doctrine means anything,it means that a local entity may not pass an ordinance,the effect of which is to completely frustrate a broad,evolutional statutory regime enacted by the legislature.section of prop h stands as an obstruction to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the legislative scheme regulating handgun possession in this state.for that further reason,it is preempted,supra,cal th at,d,local legislation is preempted if it is inimical to accomplishment of the state law policies.
section of prop h entitled ban on sale,manufacture,transfer or distribution of firearms in the city and county of san francisco is preempted by state law 
section of the ordinance provides in full within the limits of the city and county of san francisco,the sale,distribution,transfer and manufacture of all firearms and ammunition shall be prohibited.unlike section,there are no exceptions contained in section.presumably,if section were enforced,there would be no sales of firearms or ammunition in the city.storefront firearms dealers in the city would immediately go out of business.other businesses that deal in the sale of firearms,such as auction houses that offer collectible firearms for sale,would also be adversely affected.the impact of the transfer and distribution bans are more difficult to gauge.a literal interpretation of the ban could lead to absurd results,such as prohibiting law enforcement agencies from distributing firearms and ammunition to their officers.
we first note that the key provision of section,banning the sale of all firearms within city limits,runs into many of the same preemption obstacles as does section.first,it is at odds with penal code section guarantee that city residents be able to purchase,own,possess,keep,or carry firearms at their homes,and businesses.italics added.as the trial court recognized,a local ordinance that substantially burdens the purchasing and possession of handguns by banning their sale is just as contrary to section as was the possession ban struck down by doe.
secondly,we agree with the trial court that section contravenes government code section,which expressly preempts any local enactments relating to the licensing or registration of commercially manufactured firearms.as noted by the trial court,san francisco currently has gunshops,pawnshops,and auction houses that hold valid state licenses specific to their firearm transactions section effectively cancels all of these licenses.see,subd.a.clearly,therefore,in adopting section,san francisco has entered the preempted field of firearms registration and licensing in express derogation of government code section.
lastly,we agree with the trial court that section ban on the sale of firearms is impliedly preempted due to its duplication of,and contradiction with,the uha.the uha was enacted in in response to the proliferation of local ordinances banning low cost,cheaply made handguns known as saturday night specials,which called to the legislature attention the need to address the issue of handguns sales in a more comprehensive manner.see stricker,gun control reducing the firepower mcgeorge,gun control.
the uha uniformly bans the sale of saturday night specials in california,but it also includes provisions applicable to all handguns sold in the state,including those of higher quality,subd a.for example,the uha requires that all models of handguns meet certain quality assurance tests and other standards before being approved for sale in this state,including specified standards relating to the safe firing of the handgun and the ability to drop the handgun without it firing accidentally,subd.a.the uha charges the california department of justice with testing and compiling a list of handguns that may be sold in this state pursuant to this title,subd.a.there are criminal penalties for violating the uha for instance,selling a saturday night special with potential imprisonment for up to one year in a county jail,subd.a.
the trial court held that section wholesale ban on the sale of firearms within city limits,including all handguns,was impliedly preempted by the uha.in reaching its conclusion,the trial court pointed out that,with respect to unsafe handguns,section duplicates state law by doubly banning them.for handguns,section conflicts with state law because it has the effect of banning the sale of every single handgun which the uha indicates may be sold in california,subd.a.
in challenging this conclusion,the city first claims the uha has no applicability to resolving the preemption question posed in this case because this legislation was simply a consumer measure unrelated to the regulation of firearms as a response to crime.see santa monica pines,rent control board cal d,disapproved on other grounds in city of west hollywood beverly towers,cal d,where local legislation serves local purposes,and state legislation that appears to be in conflict actually serves different,statewide purposes,preemption will not be found.while the uha was primarily enacted to protect legitimate owners and innocent bystanders from a product that may inadvertently injure them,the uha also has the effect of eliminating a type of firearm from criminals arsenals.gun control,supra,mcgeorge.at,fns.omitted.
petitioners offer legislative history of the uha,of which we take judicial notice,showing that one of the goals of the uha included curbing handgun crime,as well as promoting gun safety we have also taken judicial notice of assembly bill,entitled the crime gun identification act of,which was signed into law by governor arnold schwarzenegger on october,and became effective january.see stats,ch.assembly bill amends the uha by requiring that all handguns sold in california after january,be equipped with an array of characters identifying the make,model,and serial number of the handgun.these characters must be embossed onto the pistol firing pin and interior surfaces,which will then be imprinted on each cartridge case when the handgun is fired.this new technology,identified as,will provide important investigative leads in solving crimes by allowing law enforcement personnel to quickly identify information about the handgun from spent cartridge casings found at the crime scene.there can be no doubt that this newly enacted amendment to the uha deals with crime prevention and criminal apprehension.we therefore reject the city argument that the uha can have no preemptive effect because it is a consumer protection statute that operates in a different regulatory field than does section.
the legislative history of the uha also reveals that the issue of preemption was specifically raised with respect to the existing local bans on the sale of saturday night specials as well as any future attempts by local governments to ban handgun sales more broadly.a report by the senate committee on public safety concluded that t his bill would appear to preempt any such local ordinance,both those already in existence and any proposed locally in the future.com.on public safety,on unsafe handguns,on bill reg.sess.as amended april.in apparent response to this concern,a subsequent amended version of the april,version of the proposed bill addressed the question of preemption directly by including language expressly preserving the power of local governments to place more stringent requirement upon the manufacture,importation,transfer,sale,or possession of handguns.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.june.had the uha been enacted with this quoted language,the city position,at least with regard to section of prop h,would have more persuasive bite.however,when the legislature ultimately enacted the uha,this language was deleted.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.june.
our supreme court has cautioned courts not to read too much into deletions from bills when ascertaining legislative intent.see american financial services city of oakland cal th,d.however,following passage of the uha,cities,including san francisco,repealed their own saturday night special ordinances.we agree with the trial court conclusion that these repeals were in recognition of the uha preemptive effect on the topic and indeed,the ci
