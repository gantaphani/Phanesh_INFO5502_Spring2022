the batavia public library district the batavia district sought to annex certain territory in which respondents,russell ott and lori ott collectively,the otts,and petitioner,daniel zack,allegedly reside.the otts sought a referendum on the annexation by signing and filing a petition with the batavia district board of library trustees.suspecting that the neighboring geneva public library district the geneva district had facilitated the otts petition,zack objected to the referendum by filing his own petition with the kane county officers electoral board the electoral board.following a public hearing,the electoral board overruled zack objection and ordered that the referendum be placed on the april,ballot.
zack appealed the electoral board decision by filing a petition for judicial review in the circuit court of kane county.the caption of the petition does not name the electoral board or its members as parties,but each member was timely served with the petition and zack filed proof of service in the circuit court.the court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the petition,because the petition did not name the members of the electoral board as parties.the court dismissed the petition solely on the jurisdictional issue,and we conclude that the court erred in ruling that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petition.therefore,we reverse the circuit court order and remand the cause for further proceedings.
on october,the batavia district passed ordinance the annexation ordinance,which sought to annex certain territory.see ilcs west public library district act of gives a public library district the authority to annex by ordinance.on november,the otts signed and filed with the district a document entitled petition for referendum concerning annexation of territory to the batavia public library district.see ilcs west.the otts were the only signatories of the petition for the referendum.
on december,zack filed his objection to the referendum.under section of the election code,any legal voter in the district may file an objector petition with the proper electoral authority.ilcs west.asserting that he was a legal voter eligible to object,zack argued that the otts signatures are not legible the signatures on the petition for referendum do not match the otts official signatures that were recorded in the office of the election authority,because they appear different and do not include the otts middle initials the otts registered as voters in the annexation territory on the same day they signed the petition,which made their legal residence questionable and doubtful zack is interested in ensuring that only qualified voters and their proper signatures appear on the petition for referendum as required and the neighboring geneva district solicited the petition,which constitutes improper ultra vires political acts beyond the statutory powers of such library district.in support of the objection,zack attached copies of the otts petition for referendum,the kane county election commission certifications of the otts voter registration status,and a letter in which the library director of the geneva district tendered the otts petition to the batavia district board of library trustees.
the electoral board held a public hearing on the objection on december,and the electoral board entered its written findings on december.the otts moved to strike the objection,based on zack absence from the hearing,but the electoral board denied the motion because zack was represented by counsel.zack sought a declaration that the petition for referendum was moot,but the electoral board denied it,concluding that the subsequent actions of the batavia district were beyond the scope of the hearing.the electoral board found that the otts were registered voters at the time they signed the petition for referendum and that the petition otherwise complied with the election code.therefore,the electoral board denied zack objection to the referendum.
on december,zack filed a petition for judicial review in the circuit court of kane county.on january,the circuit court entered a written order dismissing the petition for judicial review,based on a finding that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction for zack failure to name the members of the electoral board as parties.zack filed a timely notice of appeal on february.
on appeal,zack argues that we must reverse the circuit court dismissal of his petition for judicial review because the court erred in deciding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide the petition the electoral board,before making its ruling,erred in refusing to consider the lack of contiguity of the otts property the electoral board ruling should be set aside and the otts petition should be declared invalid and the electoral board is not a proper party to these proceedings and may not engage in advocacy.the otts offer arguments to rebut all of zack positions,but we conclude that zack prevails on the jurisdictional issue,which is dispositive.
zack persuasively argues that the circuit court erred in ruling that his failure to name the electoral board members in the petition for judicial review divested the court of subject matter jurisdiction.illinois courts do not possess inherent authority to resolve disputes concerning elections courts exercise their jurisdiction over such cases only as provided by statute.rita mayden,d,allord municipal officers electoral board,d.if the party seeking judicial review of an electoral board decision fails to comply strictly with the statutory procedures,illinois courts can not invoke their jurisdiction.rita,d at,allord,d at.
however,a party compliance with the statutory procedures gives the circuit court subject matter jurisdiction only if the pleading on file seeks relief that the court has the authority to grant.cardona del granado,d,trial court retained jurisdiction over plaintiff lawsuit because plaintiff placed the jury verdict before the court by timely filing a posttrial motion challenging the court judgment on the verdict.in this case,zack petition for judicial review informed the necessary parties of the claimed issues and what relief was sought.see cardona,d at.we determine that the pleading sufficiently raised justiciable matters such that the circuit court had the authority to order the relief sought.see people mescall,d,quoting people davis,jurisdiction is a subject which relates to power of court and not to rights of parties.
the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the true intent of the legislature.people alexander.the starting point in ascertaining the legislature intent is the language of the statute itself.serwinski board of election commissioners,d.we interpret the election code,like all statutes,in a way that gives meaning to all of the language in the statute.allord,d at,a statute can not be read in a manner that ignores or reduces its language to meaningless surplusage,citing in re application of the county collector.when the facts are not disputed,determining compliance with the election code is a question of law,which we review de novo.pascente county officers electoral board,d.
