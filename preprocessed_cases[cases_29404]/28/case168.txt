the issues before us today are whether the district court erred in finding that the met their burden of proof under the first necessary precondition of a section voting rights claim,and whether the district court erred in ultimately denying their claim under its totality of the circumstances inquiry.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court decision.
factual and procedural history 
the central,northern,and southern voting districts into which mississippi is currently divided were drawn in approximately to organize the election of supreme court justices.in and,respectively,the state began to elect its three public service commissioners and three transportation commissioners from these districts as well.since their inception,the configuration of these districts has remained relatively unchanged.
as they presently exist,each of the three districts has an east to west configuration and consists of white voting age population majorities,elijah wilson and robert leflore wilson,claim that maintaining the districts with these white voting age population majorities violates section of the voting rights act.see.accordingly,wilson filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of mississippi against,kirk fordice,mike moore,dick molpus,the state of mississippi state board of election commissioners,and the mississippi democratic party executive committee fordice,charging that the use of these districts to elect public service and transportation commissioners impermissibly dilutes the voting strength of mississippi citizens.
reasoning that wilson claim was barred by res judicata,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of fordice.on appeal,this court vacated and remanded.naacp fordice,cir.wilson then sought an order directing reconfiguration of the districts to create a majority voting age population district along the western side of mississippi.after a bench trial,the district court found that wilson had failed to prove that the state three voting districts,as currently configured,violate section and dismissed his complaint.wilson now appeals.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the legal standards a court applies to determine whether section has been violated.perez pasadena indep.sch,cir.however,the district court findings in any section vote dilution dispute are determinations peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case that require an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of the contested electoral mechanisms.thornburg gingles,d.therefore,we review the district court findings on the gingles threshold requirements and its ultimate findings on vote dilution for clear error.perez,at.we thereby preserve the benefit of the trial court particular familiarity with the indigenous political reality without endangering the rule of law.gingles,at.
in anderson city of bessemer,d,the supreme court articulated general principles that govern the exercise of an appellate court power to overturn factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard.first,a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.at.appellate courts must,however,carefully heed any such firm conviction.
in particular,despite an appellate court conviction that it would have weighed the evidence differently had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it may not reverse a district court findings when they are based on a plausible account of the evidence considered against the entirety of the record.id.in other words,when two permissible views of the evidence exist,the fact finder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.id.applying the aforementioned principles to findings under the respective gingles threshold and totality of the circumstances vote dilution inquiries,this court has stated that if a district court uses the correct legal standards,its findings will not be reversed unless its account was implausible based upon the entirety of the record or the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.magnolia bar ass n,lee,cir quoting anderson,at.
ii.section voting rights claim 
legal standard 
the legal standard governing a voting rights claim is found in section of the voting rights act of.section states that 
a no voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,practice,or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any state or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the united states to vote on account of race or color,or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section f,as provided in subsection b.
b a violation of subsection a is established if,based on the totality of the circumstances,it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivisions are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection a in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.
analysis of a section claim in this court requires a framework.magnolia bar,at.first,a class of minority voters must satisfy the three threshold preconditions announced in gingles.id.second,the minority voters must offer evidence of the circumstances of the local political landscape.id.taken together,the gingles threshold and totality of the circumstances inquiries are the means by which courts determine whether a challenged election practice or procedure has resulted in an abridgement or denial of the right to vote based on color or race in violation of section.id.
iii.gingles threshold inquiry 
to meet the threshold gingles inquiry,a minority group challenging an electoral mechanism must prove three elements by a preponderance of the evidence.id.first,it must demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a voting age majority in a district.second,the minority group must show that it is politically cohesive.third,the minority group must demonstrate that the majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it,in the absence of special circumstances,usually to defeat the minority group preferred candidate.gingles,at.growe emison,d finding the three gingles prerequisites applicable to vote dilution claims in districts.
wilson relies on decennial census data in configuring three proposed majority voting age population districts.each of these plans creates a new westernmost district along the mississippi river with,and voting age populations respectively.the district court found that these proposed districts satisfy wilson burden under the first gingles precondition.see westwego citizens for better gov t city of westwego,cir.fordice,however,takes issue with this finding and avers that the proposed districts,which were drafted using census data,have population deviations in excess of the de minimis limits placed on judicial redistricting plans.based on data from the and census estimates,fordice alternatively asserts that,at the time of trial,wilson proffered districts contained excessive population deviations in violation of the constitutional one person,one vote requirement.
these arguments reflect the perplexing issues the district court faced regarding the standard of deviation applicable to satisfy the constitution one person,one vote mandate when a voting rights plaintiff submits proposed redistricting plans as well as whether census estimates are adequate to clearly and convincingly rebut the presumptive correctness of decennial census data.we need not,however,resolve these intricate questions on this record.even assuming arguendo that wilson satisfied his burden under the first gingles prerequisite,we are convinced by a detailed review of the record that the trial court correctly determined wilson failure to preponderate on the totality of the circumstances factors.we explain in more detail our affirmation of the district court judgment.
iv.totality of the circumstances inquiry 
wilson contests the district court finding that,under the totality of the circumstances,the electoral districts of mississippi do not dilute the voting strength of the state citizens.
we begin our analysis of wilson claim and review of the district court conclusion with the senate report that accompanied the amendments to section.in it,congress listed several relevant factors in a totality of the circumstances analysis of a vote dilution claim.see magnolia bar,at.they include the following 
the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state or political subdivision that touched the right of the members of the minority group to register,to vote,or otherwise to participate in the democratic process 
the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized 
the extent to which the state or political subdivision has used unusually large election districts,majority vote requirements,shot provisions,or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group 
whether members of the minority group have been denied access to any candidate slating process 
the extent to which members of the minority group in the state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education,employment and health,which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process 
whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals 
the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.
whether there is a sufficient lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group and 
whether the policy underlying the state or political subdivision use of such voting qualification,prerequisite to voting,or standard,practice or procedure is tenuous.
id.at citing,at,reprinted in in,alterations in original.
before making its totality of the circumstances analysis,the district court correctly recognized that it was required to effect a flexible,inquiry predicated on an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of the contested electoral mechanisms,magnolia bar,at,a searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality and a functional view of political life.league of united latin am.citizens clements,cir lulac iv quoting at,at.moreover,the district court noted that the totality of the circumstances analysis does not require proof of any particular number of factors or that a majority of them point in a specific direction.see gingles,at.with these guidelines firmly in mind,the district court made its findings.
history of official discrimination and its effects 
first,the abysmal reality of mississippi history of official discrimination regarding the right of to register and to vote is evident in the record.furthermore,the census data revealed that in mississippi are less educated,suffer from higher unemployment,earn lower incomes,and live in disparate conditions as compared to mississippi white citizens.thus,the negative impact that the state legacy of discrimination has made on the socioeconomic status of is undeniable.
absent an indication that these facts actually hamper the ability of minorities to participate,they are,however,insufficient to support a finding that minorities suffer from unequal access to mississippi political process.lulac iv,at.thus,to support a favorable finding on these factors,wilson bore the burden to demonstrate that the citizens of mississippi do not in fact participate to the same extent as other citizens.id.
wilson was unable to make this showing.in fact,his own expert,lichtman,acknowledged that in recent years mississippi and white citizens have maintained virtual parity in voter turnout while wilson also argues that in mississippi experience disparate access to the state political process,because of their depressed economic condition,he presented no evidence at trial to show that any prospective candidate of choice has lost an election or was barred from running because of inadequate resources.in sum,the trial record is devoid of any supportive documentary evidence or testimony from lay witnesses whose personal experiences mirrored the contentions urged by wilson.as such,the district court finding adverse to wilson is not clearly erroneous.
racially polarized voting and minority electoral success 
the district court resolved against wilson one of the two factors that have been declared as the most important in the totality of the circumstances analysis.see,gingles,at.t he most important senate report factors bearing on challenges are the extent to which minority group members have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction and the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized.citation omitted.although it concluded that lichtman statistical evidence established that racially polarized voting exists to some extent in the state of mississippi,the district court found that mississippi citizens have enjoyed substantial success in elections for positions in the districts at issue.specifically,in the central district,reuben anderson anderson and fred banks,banks,two candidates,defeated white candidates in the mississippi supreme court elections of and respectively.
wilson asserts that the district court reliance on the supreme court elections and their attendant white crossover voting was misplaced.he urges that the court should have focused on the,and respective defeats of transportation commissioner candidates willie richardson richardson,andrew jenkins jenkins,charles evers evers,and dorothy benford benford because those elections represent the offices at issue.see magnolia bar,at clark i,at stating that elections involving the particular office at issue will be more relevant than elections involving other offices.thus,wilson now implores this court to hold that the district court erred.
noting the pivotal nature of his argument that the district court focused on the wrong races,wilson seeks to show that the elections of justices anderson and banks were politically atypical and therefore should not serve as the prism through which his section claim is viewed.specifically,wilson notes that section litigation was ongoing during the time that anderson was seeking reelection in and when banks was campaigning in.by,the same year that the martin opinion was rendered,an mississippi state senator,who had also filed a section lawsuit introduced a bill to reconfigure mississippi supreme court districts.
wilson argues that in the midst of this political and judicial upheaval regarding the state supreme court districts,anderson and banks received unprecedented support from the white community.he claims that prominent white citizens not only openly aligned themselves with anderson and banks but also championed the candidates campaigns and unabashedly urged other white voters to help elect them to office.no other candidate in mississippi recent political history had received such enthusiastic support from the white community.taken together with the brewing unrest regarding mississippi supreme court districts,wilson maintains that this unusual circumstance of white crossover voting could signal not the crumbling of racial divides in the state political process and the burgeoning of access but rather a determination to retain districts that impermissibly dilute the votes of mississippi citizens.
recognizing that section presents very complex political and legal issues,this court took an accordingly analytical yet pragmatic approach to determining how the success of candidates affects the vote dilution analysis.see zimmer mckeithen,cir,aff sub,carroll parish sch.bd.marshall,d.we refused to endorse the view that the success of candidates at the polls necessarily forecloses the possibility of dilution of the vote.id.at.cognizant that politics engenders a certain cunning and savvy,we opined that 
such success,might,on occasion,be attributable to the work of politicians,who apprehending that the support of a n candidate would be politically expedient,campaign to insure his election.or such success might be attributable to political support motivated by different that election of a n candidate will thwart successful challenges to electoral schemes on dilution grounds.
id.accordingly,we refused to hold that a minority candidate success at the polls is conclusive proof of a minority group access to the political process lest we invite attempts to circumvent the constitution.id.instead,we chose to require an independent consideration of the record.id.
supreme court and more recent fifth circuit precedent also provide that proof that some minority candidates have been elected does not foreclose a claim.gingles,at.clark calhoun county,cir clark ii t he election of a few minority candidates does not necessarily foreclose the possibility of dilution of the vote.citation omitted.this is particularly true when the election occurs after litigation ha s been initiated.clark i,at citing gingles,at.in fact,proof that the election of a minority candidate to political office occurred after initiation of a lawsuit could be a factor mitigating against a finding of increased minority electoral success.id.citation omitted.accordingly,the circumstances surrounding recent electoral success in mississippi are relevant to wilson vote dilution claim.
in making its minority electoral success findings,the district court opined that the elections of justices anderson and banks are p lainly the most probative for purposes of determining whether the current districts operate to dilute minority voting strength wilson argues,however,that if the success of anderson and banks was attributable to political support motivated by a desire to thwart successful vote dilution challenges,allowing those elections to defeat his claim that the disputed electoral districts dilute the voting power of mississippi to elect public service and transportation commissioners would circumvent the constitution.see zimmer,at.as such,wilson contends that the district court should have addressed the unsuccessful campaigns of candidates richardson,jenkins,evers and benford for the pertinent office of transportation commissioner.
initially,we observe that this court has previously addressed the circumstances underlying the elections of anderson and banks.see magnolia bar,at stating that a lthough a close call,we think that the district court could reasonably conclude that the election of two judges from the central district was not aberrational and reasoning that the district court conclusion is plausible in light of the record.as such,we will not revisit that issue in this appeal.nonetheless,wilson correctly observes that exogenous elections are less probative than elections for the particular office at issue,but he fails to fully address the critical evidentiary reality that the exogenous character of elections does not render them nonprobative rangel morales,cir.accordingly,the district court was not barred from considering the banks and anderson elections in making its determination of minority electoral success regarding the offices of public service and transportation commissioner.
although wilson makes the salient point that the district court section focus must principally hone in on the transportation commissioner elections,the trial record undercuts the argument.namely,wilson proof regarding the transportation commissioner elections is sorely lacking.the record is simply replete with conclusory allegations that these elections demonstrate that mississippi citizens vote is diluted under the districts current configuration.wilson proffered no testimony from the defeated candidates,richardson,jenkins,evers,and benford,respectively,or other evidence pertaining to the specifics of those unsuccessful campaigns that might arguably have developed a trial record supporting his claim.simply put,wilson failed to marshal the quality of evidence needed to complete the electoral picture of the districts in question.having failed to adequately preponderate on the transportation commissioner races,wilson attempt to impugn the district court ruling in his section vote dilution case is unavailing.
finally,wilson argument that the district court placed too much weight on the supreme court races ignores the fact that the district court also based its minority electoral success findings on fordice evidence that three other candidates have been victorious in recent biracial elections in mississippi.specifically,in,myra murrell murrell was elected as tax in scott county,defeating a white candidate in a county with a black voting age population antwinette mccrary mccrary won an council position in the city of quitman,a town with a black voting age population and in,tommy storey storey defeated a white candidate in the majority white tippah county 
thus,despite wilson having grounded his appellate argument substantially on the district court purported error in solely relying on the banks and anderson elections,the record contains evidence of several other electoral successes.while consistent minority electoral success does not as a matter of law foreclose a section claim,it is presumptively inconsistent with such a claim.overton city of austin,cir quoting gingles,at.therefore,under this circuit precedent,the district court correctly reasoned that the murrell,mccrary,and storey as well as the banks and anderson elections are probative to the instant section case,and absent any other countervailing evidence in the record,we can not say that it erred by relying on these elections to ultimately conclude that the electoral success of in mississippi militates against a finding of vote dilution.see rangel,at finding that the district court erroneously disregarded evidence of a body of exogenous elections when only one indigenous election was available.
remaining factors 
election districts size,and majority vote requirement 
of the remaining factors,the district court did not find favorably for wilson.it found that the districts at issue were necessarily large,but are not used in potentially discriminatory procedures or voting practices.the effects of districts is a moot question because the electoral districts for public service and transportation commissioners are single member districts.
regarding the majority vote requirement,the district court reasoned that the requirement itself was not discriminatory.see magnolia bar.at although abolition of the majority vote requirement might increase chances for electoral success of candidates,a majority vote requirement is not inherently discriminatory.wilson argues,however,that the use of a majority vote requirement in majority white voting age population election districts that experience racially polarized voting constitutes minority vote dilution.see clark ii,at observing that under certain circumstances,the majority vote requirement can operate to the detriment of minority voters and negate their potential strength quoting westwego ii,at.the facts in clark ii,however,differ from the facts on record in the case at bar.
in clark ii,the specter of racially polarized voting combining with the majority vote requirement to dilute minority voting strength was more than a mere theoretical possibility.id.tommy pittman pittman,the only democratic candidate for constable,finished first in the primary among all of the other candidates,who were white,but pittman lost the election.id.at.wilson briefly mentioned the defeat of roger crowder crowder in a election for agriculture commissioner,but presented no supporting facts to show that racial bloc voting caused his defeat.interestingly,wilson own proof regarding the election reveals that crowder received of the white vote in counties with more than white voting age populations.thus,based on wilson evidence,the district court did not err in making its finding under the majority vote requirement factor in favor of fordice.
candidate slating and racial appeals 
mississippi does not use a candidate slating process and the district court concluded that wilson offered
