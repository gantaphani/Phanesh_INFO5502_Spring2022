an indiana statute,challenged in this suit as an infringement of free speech,requires that political advertising that expressly advocat es the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate contain a disclaimer that appears and is presented in a clear and conspicuous manner to give the reader or observer adequate notice of the identity of persons who paid for the communication,b,d,and makes violation a misdemeanor.disclaimer is a misnomer the correct word would be disclosure but as we see,that word has been appropriated to describe a reporting requirement.
the district court dismissed the suit on jurisdictional grounds that we concluded were unsound,cir,but we decided that we should not attempt to decide the merits of the plaintiffs constitutional challenge until we obtained an authoritative interpretation of the statute from the indiana supreme court.the state had argued that despite using the word person to denote who was subject to it the statute was limited to candidates,campaign committees,and the committee agents.we said that if the statute was as narrow as the state claimed it claim no court of indiana had passed was a straightforward antifraud statute unlikely to present serious constitutional problems.for on the state interpretation,the statute merely forbids the candidate and his organization to create the impression that independent voices support him or oppose his opponent,when in fact the voices are those of the candidate himself,playing ventriloquist.mcintyre ohio elections comm n,d.but if instead,as the plaintiffs argued,the statute reached all persons,then it was a blanket prohibition of anonymous speech unless the speech is costless,for it is only the identity of someone who pays or contributes to paying,either directly or by soliciting payment,for political advertising that is required to be disclosed,and thus might discourage political speech by exposing persons who want to express themselves for or against a particular candidate to the risk of retaliation,a risk from which anonymity would shield them.
although the mcintyre decision held that government may not forbid the distribution of anonymous campaign literature,id.at.see also talley california,d,several subsequent decisions upheld statutes similar to the indiana statute interpreted to reach all persons.federal election comm public citizen,cir per curiam gable patton,cir kentucky right to life,terry,cir.those cases point out that the statute struck down in mcintyre applied to issue referenda as well as to candidate elections and that only issue referenda were before the court,a difference on which mcintyre had relied to distinguish buckley valeo,d per curiam,which had upheld a provision of the federal campaign finance law that was similar to these state statutes.the federal election campaign act of,at issue in buckley,regulates only candidate elections,not referenda or other ballot measures and we construed independent expenditures in buckley to mean only those expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.mcintyre ohio elections comm n,supra,at.the opinions that distinguish mcintyre also point out that ohio had defended its statute only on the basis that knowing the author of a document helps one to evaluate its truthfulness,whereas a weightier ground is that disclosure protects the integrity of the electoral process by ensuring that the words of an independent group are not mistakenly understood as having come from the mouth of a candidate.federal election comm public citizen,supra,at see also buckley valeo,supra,at.gable patton,supra,at kentucky right to life,terry,supra,at seymour elections enforcement comm n.it also deters corruption by identifying large contributors who may be seeking a quid pro quo related provides information helpful to the enforcement of the provisions of election campaign law,both also being purposes that had been emphasized in buckley,at.see generally malcolm heinicke,note,a political reformer guide to mcintyre and source disclosure laws for political advertising,stan.pub.policy.
although the indiana statute is inapplicable to issue referenda the only type of political campaign that mcintyre had considered,we realized when we first heard the appeal in this case that if the indiana statute reached political advertising wholly independent of the candidate or his campaign organization,a serious constitutional question would be created.interest groups contest issue referenda just as candidates and parties contest elections of officials,and so the public interest in knowing the source of an anonymous contribution to the debate is as great in the one case as in the other,though it may be small in both if the contributor is an obscure individual.the court in mcintyre said that insofar as the interest in informing the electorate means nothing more than the provision of additional information that may either buttress or undermine the argument in a document,we think the identity of the speaker is no different from other components of the document content that the author is free to include or exclude,and added that in the case of a private citizen who is not known to the recipient,the name and address of the author add little,if anything,to the reader ability to evaluate the document message.at.yet this too is an observation that seems apt to campaigns to elect officials,as well as to issue referenda,though perhaps less so than in the latter case.
our doubts about the constitutionality of the indiana statute if interpreted more broadly than the state thought it should be interpreted impelled us to certify to the indiana supreme court,pursuant to cir.and,the following question 
is the term persons in b,d limited to candidates,authorized political committees or subcommittees of candidates,and the agents of such committees or subcommittees,or does it have a broader scope,and,if so,how much broader 
at.the indiana supreme court accepted the certification and ruled that the statute was not so limited that person means person any person.it thus rejected the state narrowing construction.
the litigation in our court then resumed.with the major constitutional challenge to the bipartisan campaign reform act popularly known as the act pending in the supreme court,we decided to hold off on further consideration of the appeal until the case was decided,because the act contains a provision rather similar to the indiana statute challenged in this case.when the supreme court rendered its decision,mcconnell federal election comm n,d,we directed the parties to submit memoranda discussing the bearing of that decision on the appeal and they have now done so.
the constitutional issue now ripe for resolution is difficult because it entails a balancing of imponderables.on the one hand,forbidding anonymous political advertising reduces the amount of political advertising because some advertisers are unwilling to reveal their identity.on the other hand,the quality of the political advertising that continues to be produced and disseminated under such a regime is enhanced because the advertising contains additional information useful to the consumer.the avidity with which candidates for public office seek endorsements is evidence as if any were needed that the identity of a candidate information that the voting public values highly.in areas of inquiry where logic or exact observation is unavailing,a speaker credibility often depends crucially on who he is.as aristotle said,persuasion is achieved by the speaker personal character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible.we believe good men more fully and more readily than others this is true generally whatever the question is,and absolutely true where exact certainty is impossible and opinions are divided.aristotle,rhetoric,in the complete works of aristotle,jonathan barnes ed.where exact certainty is impossible and opinions are divided is a pretty good description of politics.
can we get help in answering the thorny question presented by this appeal from the case law,and in particular from the supreme court recent and very lengthy opinions in the mcconnell case the provision of the bipartisan campaign reform act that is analogous to the indiana statute regulates electioneering communications,which are advertisements broadcast within days of a general election or days of a primary that refer to a candidate for federal office.f a i.individuals who spend more than producing such communications,or contribute at least to an organization that produces them,must report in the case of the contributions it is the recipient who must report their identities to the federal election commission.f.without attempting to narrow the class of covered individuals,the supreme court upheld this provision on the ground that it served important state interests in providing the electorate with information,deterring actual corruption and avoiding any appearance thereof,and gathering the data necessary to enforce more substantive electioneering restrictions.at.at.like the indiana statute,the provision of the bipartisan campaign reform act that the court upheld requires identifying any person who contributes to the making of the ad,even if the person is not a candidate or a member of the candidate campaign staff.
true,what is required is disclosure to an agency rather than disclosure in the political ad itself,though,as is apparent from the court reference to providing the electorate with information,the identity of the contributor is available to the public rather than secreted by the fec.a,d.that may not seem a big difference from the standpoint of protecting the advertiser from retaliation,but the court had earlier indicated that having to identify itself to the entire audience for the ad has as a practical matter a greater inhibiting effect than just a reporting requirement does because it broadcasts the advertiser name to the entire electoral community.buckley american constitutional law foundation,d.the reaction may not be retaliation in any strong sense,but there is a weak sense as well there may be a degree of social ostracism,some dirty looks,a few snide comments,and such,and we and other courts have long recognized that mild forms of retaliation can be effective in deterring the exercise of free speech.coady steil,cir pieczynski duffy,cir bart telford,cir keenan tejeda,cir suppan dadonna,cir allen scribner,cir.
the court in mcintyre thought the intrusion on freedom of political advocacy brought about by a reporting requirement was a far cry from compelled on all writings,at,which is what we have what the bipartisan campaign reform act does not have it does not even require identifying the specific ads financed by the reporting contributor.mcconnell federal election comm n,supra,at.at see f.but of course the very thing that makes reporting less inhibiting than notice in the ad people are likely to see the report than the reporting a less effective method of conveying information that by hypothesis the voting public values.it as if cigarette companies,instead of having to disclose the hazards of smoking in their ads,had only to file a disclosure statement with the food and drug administration.
the only reference to mcintyre by the majority in mcconnell appears in a footnote that distinguishes genuine issue ads from regulation of campaign speech and assumes that restrictions constitutionally applicable to the latter,such as the restrictions both in the bipartisan campaign reform act and in the indiana statute,might not be applicable to the former mcintyre is cited noncommittally as having invalidated a statute banning the distribution of anonymous campaign literature.at.at.remember that mcintyre had only been about issue referenda,where there are no candidates and so,it might be thought,campaign literature is more likely to consist of genuine issue ads.thus the court may have so far narrowed mcintyre one of the dissenting opinions said the court had overruled it,at.at that it no longer overlaps the indiana statute.
an alternative interpretation,however,is that because the bipartisan campaign reform act and therefore the mcconnell decision are about campaign financing,the decision is inapplicable to people who pay for political ads themselves,since they are not engaged in.on that reading,mcintyre,which was such a case,is unaffected by mcconnell,and so the indiana statute,which is also about requiring to identity themselves,is condemned by mcintyre holding.but campaign financing and are not synonyms,as the argument assumes and the bipartisan campaign reform act is not just about relevant provision that the court upheld applies equally to and ads.the disclosure statement must be filed by every person who makes a disbursement for the direct costs of producing and airing electioneering communications in an aggregate amount in excess of during any calendar year,whether he produces the ad himself or gives the money to someone else to produce it,f and sections a b and e expressly impose a requirement of reporting campaign disbursements by a candidate from his personal funds.and the first governmental interest that the court recited in upholding the it would provide the electorate with applicable to ads.an ad might seem disinterested,but if the voting public knew who had paid for it was an interest group that the candidate was known to have done favors existence of an interest might be revealed.to draw the constitutional line between self and campaign ads would be to deliver a gratuitous benefit to wealthy candidates and wealthy supporters of candidates.
but what must give us considerable pause,in light of the distinction the supreme court has drawn between disclosure reporting one identity to a public agency and disclaimer placing that identity in the ad itself,is the fact that the indiana statute requires the latter and not merely the former.buckley american constitutional law foundation,supra,at,invalidated a state law that required people who circulated petitions for issue referenda actually initiatives,but the only and irrelevant difference is that a referendum asks the people to vote on a law proposed by the legislature,while in an initiative the proposal has not been before the legislature to wear identification badges.but the requirement was inapplicable to elections of candidates.federal election comm public citizen,supra,at,interpreting a provision of the previous federal campaign finance law,upheld a requirement of a disclaimer in a candidate election.but all that had to be disclaimed for once,the word was apt was that the advertiser was independent of the the court assumed that a separate requirement,that the identity of the advertiser be disclosed in the ad,was also valid.id.at.there is a similar assumption in mcconnell.see at.at.a statute quite like the indiana statute was invalidated in citizens for responsible government state political action comm.davidson,and cir and upheld in gable patton,supra,at,and kentucky right to life,terry,supra,at.several cases,signally mcintyre itself,expressly or implicitly contrast the fragility of the small independent participant in political campaigns with large corporations or other organizations.mcintyre ohio elections comm n,supra,at.buckley american constitutional law foundation,supra,at citizens against rent for fair housing city of berkeley,and,d gable patton,supra,at doe mortham,so d,first bank of boston bellotti,and,d seymour elections enforcement comm n,supra,at.
the indiana supreme court,recognizing this last point,did a bit of judicial legerdemain,expanding the statutory exemption for mailings of up to pieces of mail that are substantially similar,a,to include any form of delivery of any written material,including personal delivery or use of some service other than use of the united states postal service,with the result that indiana law permits some individual pamphleteering and applies only to candidate elections.majors abell,supra,at.the statutory exemption as expanded by judicial interpretation protects the most vulnerable independent contributors to political advocacy.and as we said earlier,to require only the reporting of the advertiser name to a public agency,while it would as a practical matter allay some of the anxieties of potential advertis
