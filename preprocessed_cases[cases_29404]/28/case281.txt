we are called on to determine whether montana dollar limits on contributions to political candidates are constitutional under the federal constitution first amendment.the claims against the limits are familiar.limitations on contributions effectively abridge free speech in two primary ways.first,the contribution itself is a general expression of the donor support for the candidate and his views.limiting the amount a donor can contribute curtails that expression.second,it costs the candidate money to produce political speech that will be heard.without that money,candidates will be silenced their ideas will not be considered by the voters at elections.
these claims are doubly familiar to us because we have already considered some of montana contribution limits and found they passed constitutional muster why consider them again we must because,after citizens united what constitutes a sufficiently important state interest to justify limits on contributions has changed.now,the prevention of quid pro quo corruption,or its appearance,is the only sufficiently important state interest to justify limits on campaign contributions.before citizens united,it was enough to show the state interest was simply to prevent the influence contributors of large sums have on politicians,or the appearance of such influence.no longer so.
after a trial,the district court held montana contribution limits were unconstitutional,and permanently enjoined their enforcement but the district court applied neither citizens united new formulation of what constitutes an important state interest nor the correct formulation of whether the state contribution limits are closely drawn to the state goal of preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.to allow montana political contribution limits to be tested under the new and more restrictive standard of citizens united,and the correct closely drawn test,we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
since,montana has limited how much individuals,political action committees,and committees are allowed to contribute to candidates for state office.see ann.lair bullock,cir lair i.by statute,individuals and political action committees pacs can contribute up to total to two candidates who filed jointly and are running together for the offices of governor and lieutenant governor,to candidates running for other statewide offices,and to candidates running for any other state public office,including candidates for the state senate and the state house of representatives.ann.a limits.these amounts are adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index as a marker.ann.a.the current limits are,and,respectively.admin.
political parties and their affiliated committees can contribute more than can individuals.montana treats all committees that are affiliated with a political party as one entity ann.a political party or its committees can contribute,in the aggregate,up to to two candidates running together for the offices of governor and lieutenant governor,to candidates running for other statewide offices,to candidates for public service commissioner,to candidates for state senate,and to candidates running for any other state public office,including the state house of representatives.ann.party limits.these amounts are also adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index,and the current limits are,and respectively.admin.
appellees are individuals,pacs,and committees together,lair that challenge these restrictions as unconstitutional burdens on their freedom of speech under the federal constitution first amendment.intervenors are rick hill,a candidate for governor,hill campaign treasurer,and a committee associated with the hill campaign together,hill campaign.the hill campaign supports lair challenge.appellants are the attorney general of the state of montana,montana commissioner of political practices,and a county attorney,each sued in their official capacity together,montana.
the district court held a trial in september and shortly after issued findings of fact and conclusions of law.the district court concluded montana limits and party limits were unconstitutional under the federal constitution first amendment and permanently enjoined their enforcement.the district court decision turned on our prior case addressing the constitutionality of montana contribution limits and a supreme court case that followed.montana has appealed that decision.because our decision today relies in large part on the chronology of those prior cases,as well as subsequent cases,we discuss them in chronological order.
montana right to life association eddleman,cir.
the story begins with our opinion in montana right to life ass eddleman,cir,upon whose continued validity this appeal turns.there,the district court conducted a trial on the constitutionality of the limits and found those limits were constitutional under buckley valeo,and its progeny.see montana right to life eddleman,blg jds,dist.lexis,at.we affirmed.we first set out the supreme court framework for addressing campaign contribution limits per buckley,the court foundational opinion on what governmental limitations of campaign finance violate the free speech rights guaranteed by the first amendment.eddleman,at.in buckley,the supreme court struck down limitations on how much candidates could spend on their campaigns,but upheld limitations on how much donors could give to candidates campaigns.id.at.central to the supreme court decision validating contribution limits was its finding of the minimal effect those contribution limits had on individuals first amendment free speech rights a limitation upon the amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor ability to engage in free communication.id.emphasis omitted quoting buckley,at.per the supreme court,a contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views,but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support.id.quoting buckley,at.for that reason,a contribution limitation involves little direct restraint on the contributor political communication,for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor freedom to discuss candidates and issues.id.quoting buckley,at.the supreme court therefore did not apply the strict scrutiny doctrine to contribution limits.id.at instead,the court explained that contribution limits will be upheld if the state demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs a means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.id.quoting buckley,at.
we noted in eddleman that the supreme court reaffirmed buckley in nixon shrink missouri gov t pac.eddleman,at.we synthesized those two cases to create a test for challenges to contribution limits 
s tate campaign contribution limits will be upheld if there is adequate evidence that the limitation furthers a sufficiently important state interest,and if the limits are closely drawn,if they a focus narrowly on the state interest,b leave the contributor free to affiliate with a candidate,and c allow the candidate to amass sufficient resources to wage an effective campaign.
eddleman,at.in conducting this closely drawn tailoring analysis,courts must be mindful that the dollar amounts employed to prevent corruption should be upheld unless they are so radical in effect as to render political association ineffective,drive the sound of a candidate voice beyond the level of notice,and render contributions pointless.id.at quoting shrink missouri,at.w e look at all dollars likely to be forthcoming in a campaign,rather than the isolated contribution,and we also consider factors such as whether the candidate can look elsewhere for money,the percentage of contributions that are affected,the total cost of the campaign,and how much money each candidate would lose.id.internal citations omitted.
in eddleman,we identified montana asserted important state interest as preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption.id.at.we explained that a state interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption is not confined to instances of bribery of public officials,but extends to the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors.id.quoting shrink missouri,at.we affirmed the district court finding that montana carried its burden to show that latter interest the threat of large contributors affecting politicians.id.at see also eddleman,dist.lexis,at,finding montana had shown an important state interest in combating influence.neither we nor the district court relied on a finding that montana showed quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.see eddleman,at eddleman,dist.lexis,at.we also held the limits were closely drawn under this newly minted standard.id.at.
randall sorrell.
the supreme court decided randall sorrell,after our opinion in eddleman.that case addressed the constitutionality of vermont campaign contribution limits.id.at.like montana,vermont limited contributions by individuals,pacs,and political parties to candidates for state office.id.at.the supreme court found the contribution limits violated first amendment free speech rights and were unconstitutional.id.at.but no single opinion garnered a majority of the justices.justice breyer wrote the plurality opinion,which chief justice roberts and justice alito joined in relevant part.id.at.the plurality outlined a new,closely drawn test for restrictions on contributions.under that test,the reviewing court first should identify if there are any danger signs that the restrictions on contributions prevent candidates from amassing the resources necessary to be heard or put challengers at a disadvantage incumbents.id.at.the plurality found four danger signs in vermont contribution limits the limits are set per election cycle,rather than divided between primary and general elections the limits apply to contributions from political parties the limits are the lowest in the nation and the limits are below those we have previously upheld.id.at thomas,concurring listing the plurality danger signs see also id.at plurality op.lair i,at.the plurality held,if such danger signs exist,then the court must determine whether the limits are closely drawn.randall,at.
the plurality looked to five sets of considerations to determine whether the statute was closely drawn whether the contribution limits will significantly restrict the amount of funding available for challengers to run competitive campaigns whether political parties must abide by exactly the same low contribution limits that apply to other contributors whether volunteer services are considered contributions that would count toward the limit whether the contribution limits are adjusted for inflation and any special justification that might warrant a contribution limit so low or so restrictive.id.at lair i,at.the plurality found each factor weighed against the contribution limits constitutionality and held the limits violated first amendment free speech rights.randall,at.
justice thomas,joined by justice scalia,concurred in the decision to strike down vermont contribution limits.id.at thomas,concurring in the judgment.but justice thomas expressly disagreed with the plurality rationale for striking down that statute.id.instead,he would overrule buckley and its progeny because buckley provides insufficient protection to political speech.id.at.he noted t he illegitimacy of buckley is underscored by the continuing inability of the court and the plurality here to apply buckley in a coherent and principled fashion.id.justice kennedy concurred only in the judgment in a separate opinion that expressed skepticism of buckley and its progeny viability.id.at kennedy,concurring in the judgment.
lair challenge in the district court lair murry,d.
lair now challenges the limits,which the ninth circuit upheld in eddleman,and the party limits,which were not at issue in eddleman.after a trial,the district court issued a brief order,without any analysis.it found the limits and party limits unconstitutional and enjoined their enforcement.seven days later,the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law.lair murry,d.the district court concluded it was not bound by the ninth circuit decision in eddleman because the supreme court closely drawn analysis in randall abrogated both eddleman closely drawn analysis and eddleman ultimate holding that the limits are constitutional.id.at.unbound by eddleman,the district court then proceeded to analyze montana limits and party limits under the randall plurality standard.the court first assum ed that the state of montana has a sufficiently important interest in setting contribution limits.id.at quoting randall,at.the court then applied the randall plurality,closely drawn analysis to the facts presented at the bench trial and found montana limits were not closely drawn.id.at.the district court therefore permanently enjoined montana from enforcing the and party limits.id.at.
emergency motion in the ninth circuit to stay lair bullock,cir.
montana filed in the ninth circuit an emergency motion to stay the district court injunction.lair i,at.as a part of its analysis,our motions panel was required to determine whether montana made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal.id.quoting nken holder.the panel concluded montana made that showing because,contrary to what the district court had stated,the supreme court decision in randall did not abrogate the ninth circuit opinion upholding the limits in eddleman.to that end,the panel applied the supreme court test from marks united states,to determine whether randall had a binding majority opinion.id.at.that test asks whether,in a fractured supreme court decision,one opinion can be meaningfully regarded as narrower than another and can represent a common denominator of the court reasoning.id.at quoting united states rodriguez preciado,cir.the panel held that justice breyer plurality opinion could not represent a common denominator with justice thomas concurring opinion because justices thomas and scalia would strike down buckley and its progeny in their entirety rather than apply buckley,as did justice breyer plurality.id.as a result,there was no majority,controlling opinion in randall the only binding aspect of randall is its judgment,striking down the vermont contribution limit statute as unconstitutional.id.at.the motions panel therefore held montana was likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal and,after addressing the other stay factors,stayed the district court permanent injunction pending a decision by a merits panel.id.at.the case then came before us.
we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision to issue a permanent injunction.gathright city of portland,cir.under that standard,we review legal conclusions de novo.brown california dot,cir.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,but review the application of law to those facts de novo on free speech issues.see also la quinta worldwide llc,de,cir if the district court identified and applied the correct legal rule to the relief requested,we will reverse a permanent injunction only if the court decision resulted from a factual finding that was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
the most important standard for this case comes from our en banc decision in miller gammie,cir en banc.gammie explained that panels are normally bound by the decisions of prior panels.id.at.but where the reasoning or theory of our prior circuit authority is clearly irreconcilable with the reasoning or theory of intervening higher authority,a panel should consider itself bound by the later and controlling authority,and should reject the prior circuit opinion as having been effectively overruled.id.at.
the central question in this appeal is what parts of eddleman,if any,remain good law in this circuit.lair contends the district court was not bound to apply eddleman closely drawn analysis or to follow eddleman holding that the limits are constitutional.lai
