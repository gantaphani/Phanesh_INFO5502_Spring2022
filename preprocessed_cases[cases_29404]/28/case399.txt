ii.background 
new mexico classifies political parties in two separate groups for the purpose of placing candidates for public office on the ballot.candidates other than presidential from major political parties are nominated by secret ballot in a primary election.stat.ann.a.to become a primary candidate,one must obtain a certain number of signatures from members of the candidate own party.id.c,a major political party is defined as any qualified party which had at least one candidate who received at least five percent of the total number of votes in the preceding general election for governor or president of the united states.id.a.
candidates from minor political parties must take a different route to the ballot.a minor party nominates its candidates by the manner prescribed in its internal party rules and regulations.id.b.after the party nominates its candidates,an appropriate party official must certify the names of the candidates to the secretary of state or county clerk.id.a,a b.this certification must be accompanied by a petition containing a list of signatures and addresses of voters for each candidate.id.b,c.candidates must obtain signatures equivalent to at least one percent of the votes cast in the last election for governor or president id.b,c.minor political parties are defined as any qualified party which has not obtained the status of major political party.id.b.to become a minor political party,a political group must file a petition to obtain recognition.id.a.the petition must contain the signatures of of one percent of the total number of votes cast in the state in the last preceding general election for governor or president.id.the upshot is that political groups which have not yet obtained minor party status must go through two rounds of petitioning one to become a minor party and then one for each of the candidates it nominates.
the libertarian party of new mexico filed its petition with the secretary of state in november.minor political party status was granted in april.thereafter,the party held a convention and nominated candidates for public office.the party certified its nominees to the secretary of state,but failed to obtain the candidate petition required for each candidate by stat.ann.b.when the secretary of state refused to place the libertarian party candidates on the ballot,the party and the candidates filed suit under.the libertarian party sought a declaration that new mexico system violated the constitution and a preliminary injunction mandating the placement of their candidates on the ballot.the libertarian party alleged the system,which requires the party to first show a modicum of support and then show additional support for each candidate,imposes a substantial burden on the party ability to have its nominees appear on the general election ballot.
the secretary of state filed a motion for summary judgment on august,approximately five weeks after the complaint was filed.the libertarian party requested more time for discovery pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure.in a september order,the district court denied the rule f motion.the district court then granted summary judgment to the defendants.
iii.discussion 
rule f motion 
in response to the secretary of state motion for summary judgment,the libertarian party attached an affidavit pursuant to.f,arguing that discovery was needed before the court could rule on the motion for summary judgment.the affidavit stated with more time,the plaintiffs would 
present expert and lay witness affidavits,answers to interrogatories,admissions,and documentary evidence that will create a genuine issue with respect to a the character and magnitude of the burdens that new mexico scheme for new political parties imposes on the plaintiffs first and fourteenth amendment rights b the legitimacy and strength of any interests which the defendants may offer as justification for the scheme and c the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiffs rights.
aplt app.at aff.of bryan sells.the affidavit went on to state the libertarian party would specifically show that the magnitude of the burden is severe,the interests offered by new mexico are not compelling,and the scheme is not necessary to advance new mexico interest.in its response to the motion for summary judgment,the libertarian party stated it would seek historical evidence regarding the burdens new mexico election laws place on new minor party candidates.
the district court denied the rule f motion,finding historical evidence was not necessary to assess the character and magnitude of the burdens created by new mexico ballot access scheme.the libertarian party challenges the denial of their request for discovery.this court reviews the denial of a rule f motion for an abuse of discretion.trask franco,cir.
rule f provides 
should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party can not for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party opposition,the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.
the libertarian party argues that under supreme court precedent to resolve the merits of its claim,a district court must engage in a fact specific inquiry and examine the burdens placed on candidates and parties.see anderson celebrezze,d.appellants submit that historical evidence showing the burdens faced by other similarly situated minor party candidates would prove a severe burden which is not outweighed by any state interest.
the secretary of state,echoing the district court ruling,counters that historical evidence is not necessary because the new mexico scheme is constitutional as a matter of law.relying on jenness fortson,d,and american party of texas white,d,the secretary of state contends the new mexico petition requirement is constitutional because more burdensome petition requirements were upheld in those cases.in jenness the court upheld a georgia requirement that minor party candidates collect signatures equaling at least five percent of the total number of voters eligible to vote in the last election for the particular office.at.the court upheld a similar texas requirement in which minor party candidates had to demonstrate support from a number of voters equaling at least one percent of the total vote cast for governor in the last preceding election with more stringent requirements on who qualified to sign a minor party candidate petition.am.party of texas,at.further,this circuit upheld oklahoma petition requirement for minor party recognition,noting the percent of support required was undeniably constitutional.rainbow coal.of.state election.
the district court conclusion that historical evidence was not needed in light of jenness and american party of texas appears to turn the anderson balancing test into a bright line test,ignoring the highly fact specific inquiry required.we need not,however,resolve this issue.the district court did not ab
