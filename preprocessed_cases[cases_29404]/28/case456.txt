unique among federal administrative agencies,the federal election commission has as its sole purpose the regulation of core constitutionally protected activity the behavior of individuals and groups only insofar as they act,speak and associate for political purposes.fec machinists political league.as a result,commission investigations into alleged election law violations frequently involve subpoenaing materials of a delicate nature represent ing the very heart of the organism which the first amendment was intended to nurture and protect political expression and association concerning federal elections and officeholding.id.at.at the close of such investigations,a commission regulation has long required public release of all investigatory file materials not exempted by the freedom of information act.in this case,the subjects of a investigation challenge the regulation as inconsistent with both the federal election campaign act and the first amendment.we hold that the regulation,though not contrary to the plain language of the statute,is nevertheless impermissible because it fails to account for the substantial first amendment interests implicated in releasing political groups strategic documents and other internal materials.
the federal election commission administrative enforcement procedures are governed by a of the federal election campaign act feca.when the commission receives a sworn complaint alleging that an election law violation has occurred,it must first notify the alleged violator and give it an opportunity to respond to the accusation.if four commission members find reason to believe that the respondent has committed or is about to commit a violation,the commission must proceed with an investigation.a.if the commission then finds probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred,it must attempt to reach an informal conciliation agreement with the respondent.id.a a i.the commission may bring a civil enforcement proceeding in district court if conciliation negotiations fail.id.a.where the commission decides to dismiss a complaint at any stage of the process,however,the statute allows aggrieved parties to challenge the dismissal in district court.id.a.
two parts of section a directly address confidentiality and disclosure of information.subsection a a the provision at issue in this that a ny notification or investigation made under this section shall not be made public by the commission or by any person without the written consent of the person receiving such notification or the person with respect to whom such investigation is made.id.a a.subsection a b addresses disclosures in proceedings 
i no action by the commission or any person,and no information derived,in connection with any conciliation attempt by the commission may be made public by the commission without the written consent of the respondent and the commission.
ii if a conciliation agreement is agreed upon by the commission and the respondent,the commission shall make public any conciliation agreement signed by both the commission and the respondent.if the commission makes a determination that a person has not violated election laws,the commission shall make public such determination.
the commission promulgated two regulations implementing these provisions,plus a third that reconciles feca with the freedom of information act.the latter regulation,a,requires the disclosure of investigatory file materials in closed cases 
opinions of commissioners rendered in enforcement cases and general counsel reports and investigatory materials shall be placed on the public record of the agency no later than days from the date on which all respondents are notified that the commission has voted to close such an enforcement file.
the roots of this case reach back to the when the national republican senatorial committee,the national republican congressional committee,and an independent political action committee chaired by oliver north filed eleven complaints with the commission alleging,among other things,that the and various individual unions had unlawfully coordinated their labor campaign expenditures with political candidates and party committees.finding reason to believe that feca violations had occurred,the commission embarked on a investigation during which it subpoenaed approximately pages of documents from the,the democratic national committee dnc,and other respondents,as well as witnesses.the turned over documents containing detailed descriptions of meetings with elected officials,training programs for union activists,convention and activities,and polling data analyzing union members political attitudes and the effectiveness of particular political messages.the dnc provided memoranda concerning internal deliberations between state and national party leaders,as well as coordinated campaign plans describing state officials strategies,techniques,and timetables for winning upcoming elections across the country.
after the district court for the district of columbia issued a decision narrowing the circumstances under which the commission could regulate coordination practices under feca,fec christian coalition,d,the commission dismissed the complaints in this case.at that time,commission investigators had yet to review an estimated to pages of the materials gathered during the course of the proceedings.fec general counsel report,in re,et,at june.none of the complainants sought judicial review of the dismissal under a.
pursuant to a,the commission then redacted certain materials and made available an initial pages of investigatory files in its public records office.the and dnc petitioned the commission to withdraw the released files from the records office and to withhold virtually all remaining documents,arguing that the materials were protected by certain foia exemptions and by section a a prohibition against disclosing a ny notification or investigation made under this section without written consent of the respondent.according to the petitioners,disclosure of the materials would disadvantage them by revealing political tactics and strategies to their opponents and by needlessly releasing information identifying hundreds of officials,employees,and volunteers named in the documents,making it harder for the two organizations to recruit such personnel in the future.like the parties,we shall refer to the two petitioners as the.the commission denied both the section and foia claims.
the then filed suit against the commission in the district court for the district of columbia.applying chevron natural resources defense council,d,the district court held that section a a plain language protects investigatory files from disclosure.fec,d.the court also concluded that the commission position violated and foia exemption c,b c,d at.
the commission appeals,arguing that its longstanding disclosure policy warrants chevron deference.in support of the commission,the campaign and media legal center,the center for responsive politics,and the national voting rights institute assert in their amicus brief that disclosure of investigatory files is essential to public oversight of the commission.the defends the district court chevron analysis and argues that even if feca is ambiguous,the commission deserves no deference because its interpretation raises serious first amendment problems.amplifying the latter point,the james madison center for free speech argues in its amicus brief that the commission policy creates an incentive for political groups to file complaints against their opponents in order to gain access to their strategic plans,as well as to chill the opponents activities.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.mining ass fowler.
because the commission is charged with administering feca,we analyze its regulations under the chevron framework.see,republican comm.fec.as usual,we begin by asking whether congress has spoken directly to the precise question at issue,since both we and the commission must give effect to congress unambiguously expressed intent.chevron,at.at.we consider the provisions at issue in context,using traditional tools of statutory construction and legislative history.fda brown williamson tobacco,d.a statute is considered ambiguous if it can be read more than one way.united states nofziger.we evaluate the statute clarity ourselves,giving no deference to the agency interpretation.sbc communications fcc.only if the statute is either silent or ambiguous on the question at issue do we defer to the agency reasonable interpretation.chevron,at.at.
before considering the commission plea for chevron deference,we must address the argument that it should prevail at chevron step one.echoing the district court reasoning,it argues that subsection a a a ny notification or investigation made under this section shall not be made public by the commission or by any person without the written consent of the person receiving such notification or the person with respect to whom such investigation is made speaks directly to the question at issue by prohibiting the release of investigatory file materials in both open and closed cases.for its part,the commission asserts that the term investigation refers only to the act of investigating a complaint,not to the fruits of the inquiry.according to the commission,once a pending investigation has closed and later stages of the enforcement process have implicitly revealed the fact that the commission engaged in the act of investigation,the statute simply does not address the confidentiality of related files.
as we read subsection a a,we can not agree with the that the term investigation unambiguously encompasses files compiled during a commission proceeding.all other uses of investigation in section a refer to a process,not to materials compiled during that process.see a commission may not conduct any investigation or take any other action based solely on anonymous complaints id.a commission shall make an investigation of an alleged violation,which may include a field investigation or audit,upon a finding of reason to believe id.a commission may petition to hold a party in civil contempt if it determines after an investigation that the party violated a court order.moreover,we think it telling that in contrast to subsection a a,section a other confidentiality provision expressly protects information revealed in the course of commission enforcement actions.specifically,subsection a b i forbids the disclosure of both action s by the commission or any person in connection with any conciliation attempt and information derived in connection with such attempts.id.a b i.finally,the fact that subsection a a permits disclosure upon written consent of the person with respect to whom such investigation is made without addressing the interests of third party witnesses who have provided confidential materials to investigators also implies that congress was concerned about protecting the targets of commission investigations,not the agency sources of information.
the argues that its interpretation is supported by viewing subsection a a in the context of section a larger structure,but we think that exercise further demonstrates that the statute has two possible meanings.according to the,section a express requirement to release commission determinations and signed conciliation agreements,id.a b ii,would be superfluous if congress had intended the commission to release all investigatory file materials in every closed case.thus,except for the limited disclosures required by subsection a b ii,the asserts,subsection a a confidentiality mandate continues to protect all other documents even after an investigation has ended.this argument makes sense,however,only if subsection a a in fact protects investigatory files.if,as the commission maintains,the statute prohibits only disclosure of the fact that the commission is engaged in the act of investigating a complaint,then the provision the relies on merely serves to formally terminate that confidentiality requirement at the time the commission either determines that no violation occurred or signs a conciliation agreement,since the release of a determination or conciliation agreement will implicitly reveal the fact that an investigation occurred.for that matter,so will the filing of a civil enforcement action or a dismissal challenge by an aggrieved party,neither of which is required to be litigated under seal.id.a.
the next argues that the statute legislative history supports its interpretation of the statute.to the extent the sparse legislative record provides any clue of congress intent,however,we think it supports the commission interpretation.congress provided no explanation when it enacted the original version of subsection a a in,a.scattered references in the legislative history of feca amendments,which added a civil penalty for subsection a a violations and the confidentiality and disclosure requirements in what is now subsection a b,emphasize the importance of protecting the confidentiality of pending investigations and indicate that some members believed that subsection a a helps to prevent political opponents from bringing baseless charges against each other for purposes of generating negative publicity.see,conf,at the conferees intent is that a violation within the meaning of subsection a a occurs when publicity is given to a pending investigation,but a violation does not occur when actions taken in carrying out an investigation lead to public awareness of the investigation,at indicating that the penalty for violating subsection a a applies to any party who reveals the identity of any person under investigation cong.rec.comments of wayne hays arguing when presenting the bill on the house floor that subsection a a limits unfair publicity by prohibiting disclosure of the fact that an individual is being investigated or is about to be investigated until after the commission has determined whether charges have merit.the legislative record,however,contains no references to protecting the confidentiality of closed commission files or to the interests of parties who provide information during the course of an investigation.
considering all of these factors together,we think the commission may well be correct that subsection a a is silent with regard to the confidentiality of investigatory files in closed cases and that congress merely intended to prevent disclosure of the fact that an investigation is pending.but even if the could convince us that its alternate construction represents the more natural reading of subsection a a,the fact that the provision can support two plausible interpretations renders it ambiguous for purposes of chevron analysis.nofziger,at.
contrary to the contention,nothing in in re sealed case,requires a different result.there we held that the commission must file motions to enforce its investigatory subpoenas under seal because subsection a a plainly prohibit s the fec from disclosing information concerning ongoing investigations under any circumstances without the written consent of the subject of the investigation.id.at.in so holding,we had no need to address the issue we face here,as the commission disclosures in that case revealed both that an investigation was pending against a particular party and several individual file documents compiled during the course of the agency investigation.see id.at commission filed in open court the complaint,a staff analysis detailing the alleged violations,the commission reason to believe finding,and information concerning an unrelated investigation.also,we specifically limited our analysis to the context of ongoing investigations where,because secrecy is needed to protect an innocent accused from damaging publicity,respondents have a strong confidentiality interest analogous to the interests of targets of grand jury investigations.id.at.but that analogy breaks down once a commission investigation closes because feca expressly requires disclosure of no violation findings,a b ii,whereas federal rule of criminal procedure e continues to protect suspects exonerated by a grand jury.illinois abbott,d.
we turn,then,to the chevron step two the commission disclosure policy reflects a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.at.the parties devote many pages of briefing to this issue the commission argues that it deserves particular deference because its regulation embodies a longstanding procedural policy,while the questions the policy historical and legal origins.at this stage of our chevron analysis,we would normally accord considerable deference to the commission,united states kanchanalak,citation omitted,particularly where,as here,congress took no action to disapprove the regulation when the agency submitted it for review pursuant to d.see,fec democratic senatorial campaign,d.as the points out,however,because we are also obliged to construe the statute to avoid constitutional difficulties if such a construction is not plainly contrary to the intent of congress,we do not accord the commission deference when its regulations create serious constitutional difficulties.chamber of commerce fec,citing edward debartolo.gulf coast constr.trades council,d.this is just such a case because congress failure to act obviously can not be viewed as a clear expression of intent and because,as we shall show,the commission failed to tailor its disclosure policy to avoid unnecessarily infringing upon first amendment rights.
we begin with a little background.the supreme court has long recognized that compelled disclosure of political affiliations and activities can impose just as substantial a burden on first amendment rights as can direct regulation.see,buckley valeo,d disclosure of campaign contributions naacp alabama ex rel.patterson,d disclosure of membership lists.when facing a constitutional challenge to a disclosure requirement,courts therefore balance the burdens imposed on individuals and associations against the significance of the government interest in disclosure and consider the degree to which the government has tailored the disclosure requirement to serve its interests.buckley,at.at block meese.where a political group demonstrates that the risk of retaliation and harassment is likely to affect adversely the ability of the group and its members to pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs which they admittedly have the right to advocate,for instance,the government may justify the disclosure requirement only by demonstrating that it directly serves a compelling state interest.naacp,at.at.in contrast,where the burden on associational rights is insubstantial,we have upheld a disclosure requirement that provided the only sure means of achieving a government interest that was,though valid,not of the highest importance.block,at.furthermore,even where requiring disclosure of political or speech activities to a government agency may be necessary to facilitate law enforcement functions,we have held that c ompelled public disclosure presents a separate first amendment issue that requires a separate justification.id.at emphasis added.
in affidavits submitted in the district court,the and dnc assert that releasing the names of hundreds of volunteers,members,and employees will make it more difficult for the organizations to recruit future personnel.the commission urges us to dismiss this assertion of a chilling effect as speculative.although we agree that the evidence in this case is far less compelling than the evidence presented in cases involving groups whose members had been subjected to violence,economic reprisals,and police or private harassment,see,brown socialist workers campaign comm.ohio,d naacp,at.at,that difference speaks to the strength of the first amendment interests asserted,not to their existence.in buckley valeo,for example,the supreme court considering either the popularity of the parties involved or any specific evidence of disclosure of campaign contributions would chill political activity and therefore place not insignificant burdens on first amendment rights.at.at.although it is true,as the commission points out,that a separate part of the opinion held that minority parties could be exempted from disclosure requirements by demonstrating a reasonable probability of threats,harassment,or reprisals,the commission fails to note that the court required such an evidentiary showing only after concluding that the disclosure requirements at issue survived strict scrutiny as the least intrusive means of achieving several compelling governmental interests.id.at.at see also.broad.of,fcc,en banc wright,joined by wilkey,noting that buckley engaged in a full first amendment analysis despite the absence of concrete evidence of retaliation.
moreover,in addition to arguing that disclosure will chill future individual political activity,the and dnc affidavits charge that disclosing detailed descriptions of training programs,member mobilization campaigns,polling data,and strategies will directly frustrate the organizations ability to pursue their political goals effectively by revealing to their opponents activities,strategies and tactics that we have pursued in subsequent elections and will likely follow in the future.rosenthal aff.at see also stoltz aff.at.the commission does not challenge the factual basis for this claim.although we have found no cases presenting similar facts,the supreme court has concluded that extensive interference with political groups internal operations and with their effectiveness does implicate significant first amendment interests in associational autonomy.
for example,in eu san francisco county democratic central committee,d,the court held that california statutes dictating the composition and leadership of political parties governing bodies burdened significant associational rights by limit ing a political party discretion in how to organize itself,conduct its affairs,and select its leaders,thereby also potentially color ing the parties message and interfer ing with the parties decisions as to the best means to promote that message.id.at.at.in the same case,the court applied strict scrutiny to a section of the statute that prohibited party leaders from endorsing candidates in primaries because such limitations directly hamper the ability of a party to spread its message.id.at.at.similarly,in tashjian republican party,d,where the court struck down a closed primary system,it held,t he party determination of the boundaries of its own association,and of the structure which best allows it to pursue its political goals,is protected by the constitution.even the court compelled disclosure decisions emphasize the potential damage to political groups effectiveness,in addition to the risk of chilling individual participation.in buckley analysis of contribution disclosure requirements,for example,the court explained,t he right to join together for the advancement of beliefs and ideas,is diluted if it does not include the right to pool money through contributions,for funds are often essential if advocacy is to be truly or optimally effective.at.at quoting naacp,at.at citation omitted see also ripon soc y,republican party,en banc plurality opinion speeches and assemblies are after all not ends in themselves but means to effect change through the political process.if that is so,there must be a right not only to form political associations but to organize and direct them in the way that will make them most effective.
in this case,the and dnc affidavits indicate that compelled disclosure of internal planning materials,though less direct than regulation of political group leadership or structure,will similarly frustrate those groups decisions as to how to organize themselves,conduct their affairs,and select their leaders,as well as their selection of a message and the best means to promote that message.eu,at.at.although we do not suggest that any commission action that places a political association at a disadvantage relative to its opponents violates the first amendment,where,as here,the commission compels public disclosure of an association confidential internal materials,it intrudes on the privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the first amendment,buckley,at.at,as well as seriously interferes with internal group operations and effectiveness.
having concluded that the and dnc have asserted substantial first amendment interests in the disclosure of their own internal materials and at least marginal interests in preventing the chilling of political participation by their members and officials,we proceed to assess the strength of the government proffered interest in disclosure.the commission offers two justifications for a the regulation deters feca violations,and it promotes the agency own public accountability.although we have no doubt that these interests are valid,we need not engage in a detailed balancing analysis,for the commission made no attempt to tailor its policy to avoid unnecessarily burdening the first amendment rights of the political organizations it investigates.see,united states popa,declining to determine the precise level of scrutiny applicable to a particular statute where it was insufficiently tailored to meet even the least exacting standard.indeed,the blanket nature of the commission,as it does,the release of all information not expressly exempted by to result in the release of significant amounts of information that furthers neither goal.for example,the commission never explains how releasing investigatory files will deter future violations in cases where,as here,the respondents have been cleared of wrongdoing.nor does the commission explain how a policy requiring the release of materials that played no meaningful role in its decisionmaking process will promote its own accountability.the facts of this case are particularly disturbing because the commission proposes to release between and pages of documentation that it has never examined.the materials therefore can not shed light on the commission reasoning,and may not even relate to questionable activities.the fact that the commission redacts information falling under one or more foia exemptions is no answer,since the freedom of information act does little to protect the first amendment interests at issue.
adding to the first amendment concerns in this case,the and james madison center in our when combined with the commission broad subpoena practices,the automatic disclosure regulation encourages political opponents to file charges against their competitors to serve the dual purpose of chilling the expressive efforts of their competitor and learning their political strategy so that it can be exploited to the complainant advantage.madison amicus br.at.we have no doubt,as agency counsel explained at oral argument,that the commission does its best to screen out frivolous complaints at the reason to believe stage,but such efforts do nothing to reduce the incentive for political adversaries to attempt to turn the commission disclosure regulation to their own advantage.as this case demonstrates,the release policy gives parties a large potential bonus for filing a complaint because even if their allegations of wrongdoing are rejected,they may still obtain access to thousands of pages of their opponents internal strategic information.
the commission argues that no first amendment problem exists here because it is merely disclosing its own agency records to the public,rather than coercing a private party to produce information.commission reply br.at.this position is quite remarkable.feca authorizes the commission to order any person to submit written reports and answer its questions,to subpoena witnesses to testify or present documentary evidence,and to seek judicial enforcement of such orders and subpoenas.a,a,b.thus,agency investigators do use some actual or threatened imposition of governmental power or sanction to obtain information from respondents and other witnesses.penthouse int l meese.while it is true,as the commission asserts,that political groups could seek protective orders to ensure confidentiality,turning every discovery request and subpoena into a first amendment court battle would burden both the judiciary and the commission.furthermore,the considerable time that transpires between an initial subpoena and the commission ultimate public disclosure of a closed case file does not somehow convert the materials involved into the commission own agency records.rather,where the commission compiles information relating to speech or political activity for law enforcement purposes,our case law requires that it provide a separate first amendment justification for publicly disclosing the materials.block,at.
in sum,although we agree that deterring future violations and promoting commission accountability may well justify releasing more information than the minimum disclosures required by section a,the commission must attempt to avoid unnecessarily infringing on first amendment interests where it regularly subpoenas materials of a delicate nature represent ing the very heart of the organism which the first amendment was intended to nurture and protect.machinists political league,at.because a fails to undertake this tailoring,it creates the serious constitutional difficulties outlined above.chamber of commerce,at.we therefore conclude that the regulation is impermissible.
we end with a comment about the concurring opinion,which reads edward debartolo florida gulf coast building construction trades council,d,as requiring that we account for the constitutional concerns at step one of the chevron analysis.were there only one way to read the statute that would avoid constitutional problems,we might well agree,for congress is bound by and swears an oath to uphold the constitution,and t he courts will therefore not lightly assume that congress intended to infringe constitutionally protected liberties or usurp power constitutionally forbidden it.id.at.at.but here the statute is susceptible to more than one constitutionally permissible interpretation as we have indicated,the commission could tailor its disclosure policy to avoid unnecessary first amendment infringements,or,as the concurrence maintains,it could decline to release any materials other than those expressly required by section a.neither debartolo nor chevron suggest that the opposed to the choose between these permissible alternatives.rather,debartolo mandate that every reasonable construction must be resorted to,in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality,id.quoting hooper california,suggests merely that an agency acts unreasonably if,instead of choosing among constitutionally permissible alternatives,it interprets ambiguous statutory language as indicating that congress intended to authorize infringements on constitutional rights.thus,we think the constitutional issues raised by the commission disclosure policy are properly addressed at chevron step two.see,chamber of commerce,at addressing constitutional problems created by the commission interpretation of an undefined statutory term at step two of the chevron analysis.
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
so ordered.
we are asked in this case,as in so many others,to dance the chevron,under which 
the court must first exhaust the traditional tools of statutory construction to determine whether congress has spoken to the precise question at issue if the court can determine congressional intent,then that interpretation must be given effect if,on the other hand,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,then the court will defer to a permissible agency construction of the statute.
nrdc browner,internal quotations omitted see chevron,nrdc,d if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.unlike the majority,i would stop the music at chevron step one.in my view,a proper employment of the traditional tools of statutory construction yields a plain and affirmative congressional response to the precise question at issue,whether the federal election campaign act feca or act prohibits the federal election commission fec or commission from disclosing thousands of pages of politically sensitive documents it obtained while investigating the and the dnc collectively,the appellees,now that the investigation has been completed.
my inquiry into the congress intent proceeds,as it must,from the fundamental canon that statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute itself.butler west,quotati
