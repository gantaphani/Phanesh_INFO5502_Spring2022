the former sheriff of cameron county,texas brought suit against the brownsville herald and two former employees collectively the herald alleging that two articles about a candidate debate shortly before the election were defamatory.the trial court denied the herald motions for summary judgment and the court of appeals affirmed because we conclude there was no evidence of actual malice,we reverse.
on october,shortly before early voting was to begin in the november general election,several candidates for local office in cameron county participated in a debate at the brownsville public library.among them was respondent conrado cantu,democratic candidate for sheriff,and his republican opponent,terry vinson.both candidates made speeches and answered questions over the course of approximately thirty minutes.
an audience member recorded the debate.while the transcript of that recording in the summary judgment record is not entirely complete,all parties agree that as far as it goes it accurately represents what the candidates said.during the course of the debate,the following exchanges occurred 
cantu i am sure you vinson are a good instructor,because you were my instructor in the police academy,but the fact still remains that if he was in los fresnos as chief and sincere,why did they select him as chief i t is not easy to go out there and stand in a neighborhood and tell everybody what are your needs,what are your problems.i can do that because i am,i know the people,i know everybody that lives in my precinct and that is why i have been honored by everybody because of my dedication.
cantu i have been honored like i said by the school district,by the county and other entities because of my dedication and it is going to be very,very important when you go out to vote on november,you are going to vote for somebody that really cares,who comes from the heart,and want to do a great job for every taxpayer of this county.it is not easy,it is not an easy job.vinson is a nice man,but he is an instructor,he is not a sheriff.you have to have the right character to be a sheriff and you have to delegate authority and it does not stop there.you have to be to understand what is going on in our neighborhoods,where there is a lot of burglaries,how are you going to relate to these make them understand that they need to stop or we are going to put a stop to it in their neighborhoods.how is it going to happen you have to be able to understand,you have to have grown up here to understand that.
vinson well,when he brings up the,well he is forgetting we have orientals,we have filipinos,we have chinese,we got japanese,we got chinese,we got israelis,we have what is he going to talk to them,you are going to find somebody to do the communicating for you.i have worked the streets in cameron county for over years,years on the street,i have never called anybody because he is unable to communicate one way or another.he did take in the area,i mean,all you got to do is take a report and say what can we do as being not what i can do,what can we do,the people and myself as sheriff.what can we do as a team itself,that what we need to do.is a barrier that is there because people put it there,it should exist.i do believe in it.i believe everybody is the same,everybody is treated the same and everybody should be shown the respect 
vinson i am not going to tolerate the compadreism,i am sorry,i am not from this culture,i apologize to that sic,but i can guarantee you one thing,i will treat everybody the same 
the herald assigned brad pierce to report on the debate.he took notes,but did not record it.the next morning,his article appeared on the front page of the newspaper,under a headline added by the copy desk editor 
cantu no anglo can be sheriff of cameron county 
election dem candidate stresses hispanic heritage at debate 
no anglo could ever be sheriff of cameron county,conrado cantu said wednesday during a debate with his opponent terry vinson in the race for the county top law enforcement office.
how are you going to relate to these people cantu asked vinson,stressing that he up for the job because he hispanic and knows the residents.
cantu repeatedly said he the better candidate because he.
is a barrier that there because people put it there,vinson replied.we have a large culture,but i believe everyone is the same.
the two sheriff candidates squared off for more than minutes at the public library wednesday in debates sponsored by south texans for good government.
when asked about investigations of criminal misconduct currently focusing on him,cantu became visibly upset,said he thought he had come to debate the issues and blamed vinson for trying to trick him.
i have never done anything wrong,cantu said.i still going to work hard and win this campaign.
cantu defended his qualifications for the job,saying that while he might have only years experience in law enforcement,he learned a lot in that time.
if you do work among the people that count,what good is experience cantu said.i have the desire and energy to be the next sheriff of the county,and that is more important than experience.
it takes a man who is dedicated to his job and in fulfilling his goals,he said.i will work hard to represent you and i know i wo let you down.
vinson,standing on his record of more than two decades in law enforcement and his extensive instruction in training officers,said that while he not suggesting cantu is not qualified,he is a rookie officer.
i done my time.i ready to get to work,vinson said.i have the ability to manage personnel.i know what officers need to do.we all have differences,y but the issues are who can do the job.
vinson said he wants to reorganize the sheriff department,build on sheriff omar lucio programs and focus on training deputies.he said he wo tolerate compadreism and wants to instill honesty and accountability to the office.
cantu wants to build a better relationship with the constables offices and beef up patrols in neighborhoods.
there a lot of burglaries going on in this county and for a while nothing been done about it,cantu said.vinson agreed that burglary is an important issue to address,but we got to get the drugs out of the community and i the man who can do that.
the article concluded with reports of debates between other local candidates.
the morning the article appeared,george cox,then the editor of the newspaper,spoke with pierce about the article.pierce told cox that cantu had not used the word anglo,but that the substance of the article was accurate.
that same morning,cantu came to the herald offices and told cox that he objected to the use of the word anglo in the article.he brought an audiotape of the debate,which cox declined to review.but cox did agree to publish a article,and had cantu meet with pierce for an interview to present his side of what occurred.
the next day,october,a second article appeared concerning the debate.that article stated in its entirety 
sheriff candidate says racial issue was the point 
election cantu says valley needs candidates 
constable conrado cantu said he wants to set the record straight on comments that he made this week about his opponent in the cameron county sheriff race not being the best man for the job because he not hispanic.
democrat cantu said he never intended to suggest that race is an issue in his campaign,but that he has an advantage over republican terry vinson because he is from the rio grande valley,speaks spanish and understands the needs of the majority of the public.
the people of the rio grande valley live in a area,cantu said,explaining that because he is,he is the best candidate to represent citizens as cameron county top law enforcement officer.
cantu was speaking at the south texan for good government debates on wednesday when he made what some observers believe were discriminating remarks against vinson.however,chris patterson,a youth basketball coach and cantu supporter,said he believes the constable was simply misunderstood.
i did hear it that way.i do think it was a bad intent.he was talking about,patterson said.claiming that he said no anglo could ever be sheriff was a fair representation of cantu comments,patterson added,and its sic definitely not what he stands for.
however,vinson maintains that cantu statements that he can not connect with hispanics just because he not native to the valley are inappropriate.
it was my impression that because of my heritage,i was incapable of communicating or relating with the hispanic culture,vinson said.what is that,if it not a racial statement he was singling me out and that was wrong,i was quite offended.
in a county that more than percent hispanic,he does have a point,independent voter henry gonzalez said,but they all kinds of people in the valley,not just hispanics.
cantu said some of his strengths are the fact that he grew up in south texas and can relate to the problems of all people,regardless of whether they live in cameron park or valley international country club.
i did not say that an anglo could not be sheriff,he said,but rather that,by being,he has a better opportunity to resolve conflicts and protect neighborhoods.
however,tracy larimore,who said he was leaning toward voting for cantu until wednesday night,said,does that mean that he can understand the anglo race,and if that so,how come vinson ca understand the hispanic race 
i clearly heard that the only person who could be sheriff is an hispanic,larimore said.frankly,i think he was caught off guard.i think he meant what he said and now he taking flack over it.he would have been far better not saying a word.
however,patterson said anyone who knows cantu is sure that he would never say anything discriminatory.he only known the constable for a short while,but finds him to be a generous,caring person who deeply interested in the well being of the county youth.
in wednesday debates,cantu talked about his energy and passion for the job while vinson cited his experience and knowledge of the office.
cantu ultimately won the election.nine months after taking office,he sued the herald for defamation the herald filed motions for summary judgment,which the trial court denied.the herald filed an interlocutory appeal and the thirteenth court of appeals affirmed we granted the herald petition for review 
to recover for defamation,a public official like cantu must prove that the herald published a false and defamatory statement with actual malice at the summary judgment stage,the herald can negate actual malice as a matter of law by proving that it did not publish the articles at issue with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth 
the herald motions for summary judgment included affidavits from its publisher,copy desk editor,pierce,and cox,each averring he had no knowledge of any inaccuracies in the articles before publication or any reason to doubt their accuracy.neither cantu nor the court of appeals suggest these affidavits were insufficient to meet the applicable summary judgment standards 
jurors of course would not be required to accept the truth of these affidavits but the possibility that a jury might disbelieve them is not evidence supporting the contrary the herald having produced some evidence that it acted without malice,the burden shifted to cantu to produce some contrary evidence to avoid summary judgment 
the court of appeals held that cantu had done so,pointing to circumstantial evidence suggesting actual malice to that evidence we now turn.
from the day the articles appeared through oral arguments in this court,cantu primary complaint is that he never used the words attributed to him by the herald in its initial headline and first sentence.the herald concedes this is true.the court of appeals concluded this was some evidence of malice,as pierce attended the debate and heard the candidate comments,and knew that cantu did not say that no anglo can be sheriff of cameron county.
but unlike the court of appeals,the herald did not put this last phrase in quotation marks.while some of cantu statements at the debate were placed in quotation marks,this one was not.cantu discounts this distinction,arguing the colon used in the headline is the equivalent of quotation marks.
in masson new yorker magazine,the united states supreme court held that placing a reporter words in a speaker mouth may be evidence of malice in some circumstances as the court noted 
in general,quotation marks around a passage indicate to the reader that the passage reproduces the speaker words verbatim.they inform the reader that he or she is reading the statement of the speaker,not a paraphrase or other indirect interpretation by an author 
but the court rejected the notion that every alteration of a speaker words was some evidence of actual malice the court noted that reporters who rely on notes must often reconstruct a speaker statements,and even those who rely on recordings can print statements verbatim in only rare circumstances due to space limitations and editorial judgments 
instead,the court held that an altered statement could constitute some evidence of actual malice if a reasonable reader could understand the passage as the speaker actual words not a paraphrase,and the alteration was material as we recently noted,the standard is objective rather than subjective,and presumes a hypothetical reader of ordinary intelligence who reads an entire article in context 
in this case,three rather apparent clues would lead a reasonable reader to conclude the herald was interpreting cantu remarks rather than quoting them verbatim.first,such a reader would note that quotation marks were placed around eight of cantu statements in the first article,but not the one at issue.
second,a reasonable reader could not miss the pattern of the articles,in which a summary of what each candidate said appears in one paragraph for example,the,and paragraphs of the initial article followed by one or two paragraphs of explicit quotations to support the summary.in this context,a reasonable reader would understand the first headline and sentence to be a paraphrase of cantu remarks,with his actual statements following in quotations.
finally,while both articles were allegedly defamatory,the herald second article reported cantu response that i did not say that an anglo could not be sheriff.nothing in the article contradicts that claim.to the contrary,the report that some observers believe cantu had made discriminating remarks at the debate clarified that the issue was the implicit rather than explicit meaning of what he said.
based on the entire context of the articles cantu claims were defamatory,we hold that a reasonable reader would have understood the herald reports to be a paraphrase or interpretation of cantu remarks.accordingly,proof that he did not make the exact remark attributed to him,standing alone,is no evidence of actual malice.
of course,deliberately attributing a statement to a public figure that the latter never made may be defamatory whether or not it is in quotation marks.but a deliberate alteration of the words uttered by a plaintiff does not equate with knowledge of falsity for purposes of new york times sullivan and gertz robert welch,unless the alteration results in a material change in the meaning conveyed by the statement.
cantu argues that the herald made a deliberate and material change in meaning when it converted his remarks about his bilingual and bicultural attributes into remarks about racial and ethnic ones.for summary judgment purposes,we assume the truth of cantu assertion that he intended only the former.further,we agree with cantu that reasonable jurors could conclude from the herald report that he was accused of intending the latter,and that the difference between the two is material.
but evidence that the herald report was mistaken,even negligently so,is no evidence of actual malice cantu must present some evidence that the herald misinterpreted his remarks on purpose,or in circumstances so improbable that only a reckless publisher would have made the mistake an understandable misinterpretation of ambiguous facts does not show actual malice.
in time,pape,the supreme court addressed a similar defamation claim in which the words of a source were undisputed but their meaning was ambiguous in that case,a report on police brutality by the co
