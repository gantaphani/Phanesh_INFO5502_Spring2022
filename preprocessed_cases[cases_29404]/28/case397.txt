plaintiff karen howden weaver claimed she was discharged from her employment with the albuquerque city attorney office in violation of her rights guaranteed by the first amendment.in particular,she alleged retaliatory discharge for her political support of an opponent of the mayor,and for her speech criticizing what she perceived to be patronage hiring in the city attorney office a federal jury rejected her claims.she now appeals,and we affirm 
background 
karen weaver had been employed as an assistant city attorney for six and years before her termination in july.she supported bob schwartz in the october mayoral election,an election that was won by martin chavez.shortly after the election,in december,the mayor chavez asked for a letter of resignation from each of the approximately attorneys employed by the city attorney office,and decided to accept three resignations,including weaver.upon learning that she was pregnant,however,mayor chavez changed course.weaver took maternity leave and returned to the city attorneys office in.
following the election,weaver demonstrated a pattern of making complaints alleging that attorneys had been hired for political reasons.for example,she claimed that two attorneys hired in,one of whom became her supervisor,were political hires.she also commented that the promotion of one of the line attorneys in the office was politically motivated.in june,she made similar complaints about a prospective attorney hire,ben chavez.she asserted that the mayor had directed the city attorney,robert white,to hire chavez even though he was not the best qualified applicant.she voiced this complaint directly to white,and also sent messages to attorneys within and outside the city attorney office.in addition,she spoke by telephone with the attorney who was chavez supervisor at his previous place of employment,asking questions about chavez performance and qualifications.weaver was not a member of the office hiring committee nor did the city attorney authorize her conversations with chavez employer.
on june,the city attorney responded to weaver criticism of his hiring practices,informing her via that no one had been selected for political reasons and cautioning her to be more reflective in remarks about her current and future colleagues.the next day,at the behest of the city attorney,weaver immediate supervisor told her to stop interfering with the hiring process,or she would be fired.weaver continued to exchange messages touching on this subject with a lawyer friend outside the office who had also applied for employment with the city attorney office but had not been hired.a few days after the june warning,weaver stormed out of her office,used the f word,and said,they have just hired ben chavez,he a political hack,and he never tried a case.vol.ii,at.after the city attorney and the supervising deputy attorney reviewed the situation,they decided to discharge weaver.her employment was terminated on july.
weaver sued,alleging that she was discharged in retaliation for exercising her first amendment right to speak on matters of public concern by supporting a mayoral candidate other than martin chavez and by voicing her concerns about hiring improprieties.the city defendants responded that weaver termination was premised on her intemperate remarks about patronage hiring and her interference in the hiring process.they asserted that weaver conduct caused sufficient disruption in the city attorney office to justify firing her.
the district court denied summary judgment and weaver claims were tried before a jury.at the close of weaver case,finding no evidence to support the retaliation claim based on her support of the losing mayoral candidate,the district court entered judgment as a matter of law in the city and the mayor favor.the remaining first amendment claim was submitted to the jury,which returned a special verdict finding that weaver criticism of what she perceived to be politically motivated hiring practices in the city legal department cause d disharmony or disruption in the workplace.vol.i,at.
the district court entered judgment against weaver,and later denied her motion for relief.the district court concluded that weaver statements disrupted the office and made her difficult to supervise,weaver interfered with the office hiring processes,her statements were inappropriate in light of the time,place,and manner in which they were made,and a balancing of interests tilted in favor of the city defendants and justified weaver termination.weaver appeals,challenging the judgment as a matter of law on her claim that she was fired for supporting an opponent of the mayor.she also challenges the district court analysis of her claim and asserts that the evidence of disruption was inadequate to justify discharging her.
ii.discussion 
retaliation for supporting a different candidate for mayor 
weaver first argues that the evidence introduced at trial shows mayor chavez decided to discharge her in december,but deferred that decision until july.accordingly,she contends,the campaign and the discharge decision were close in time,thus raising an inference of retaliation that the jury should have decided.we agree with the district court resolution of this claim.
p rotected conduct closely followed by adverse action may justify an inference of retaliatory motive.marx schnuck,cir.on the other hand,evidence such as a long delay between the employee speech and challenged conduct,or evidence of intervening events,tend to undermine any inference of retaliatory motive and weaken the causal link.maestas segura,cir citations omitted.we review de novo the grant of a judgment as a matter of law.praseuth rubbermaid,cir.
in analyzing this claim,we reject weaver characterization of the events as deferring the firing from december to july.the evidence shows that the decision to terminate her employment was made in july by the city attorney,not the mayor.in addition,the intervening events pertaining to disruption within the office rebut any inference that she was fired for her support of a different candidate.other attorneys in the the city the mayor political opponents,but they were not discharged.finally,despite hearing trial testimony from both mayor chavez and weaver,no direct or circumstantial evidence was developed to support weaver claim of a causal connection between her support of a losing candidate and her termination.
accordingly,like the district court,we find that there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find in weaver favor on this issue.lifewise master funding telebank,cir.
retaliation for criticism of hiring practices 
weaver second argument is that the district court erred in concluding that her workplace speech sufficiently interfered with the operation of the city attorney office to support her termination.we disagree.
legal framework 
it is clearly established that a state may not discharge an employee on a basis that infringes that employee constitutionally protected interest in freedom of speech.rankin mcpherson,d.p ublic employees do not surrender all their first amendment rights by reason of their employment.rather,the first amendment protects a public employee right,in certain circumstances,to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern.garcetti ceballos,d.the state as an employer,however,has interests in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.pickering bd.of,d.the challenge is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.
we apply a test to determine whether a public employer actions unjustifiably infringe on free speech rights.schrier of,cir.steps one and two bear on the first amendment interests at stake 
first,we must determine whether the employee speech involves a matter of public concern.if so,we then balance the employee interest in commenting upon matters of publ
