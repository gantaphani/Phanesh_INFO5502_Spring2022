in,ravi mehta,chairman of the fair political practices commission fppc or commission,signed a document delegating some of the commission functions to employees of the fppc.before the fppc ratified the delegation,the employees held proceedings against an organization and two of its treasurers for violations of the political reform act when the organization and treasurers failed to respond to notices from the fppc employees,a default decision was entered against the organization and treasurers including a fine of.
the fppc initiated this action to obtain a civil judgment against the organization and its treasurers.the trial court entered judgment in the fppc favor for almost million,including interest.on appeal,defendants assert the fppc was not entitled to judgment pursuant to government code section because it did not follow the procedures set forth in the political reform act and implementing regulations,the fppc failed to consider mitigating evidence,and the penalty was unconstitutionally excessive.we affirm.
background 
californians against corruption cac was organized on march,with carl russell howard as treasurer.stephen cicero was later the treasurer from july to april cac used money it raised primarily to fund a campaign to recall senator david roberti.from january to june,cac received approximately in contributions and expended approximately.
ravi mehta became chairman of the fppc on january.several days later,he signed a document entitled delegation of authority.citing provisions of the government code and regulations concerning the fppc,he purported to delegate the statutory,regulatory,and administrative duties and authority of the executive director to robert tribe,jeevan ahuja,and steven churchwell.specifically,the document stated that ahuja was to have the authority to conduct probable cause proceedings,including,but not limited to,making a determination as to the existence of probable cause 
in june,jeevan ahuja presided at a hearing to determine whether probable cause supported proceedings against defendants for violations of the political reform act.although they were given notice of the hearing,defendants did not attend and did not send counsel.on june,ahuja signed an order finding probable cause to believe that defendants violated provisions of the political reform act 
on august,robert tribe filed an accusation against defendants asserting violations of the political reform act and seeking a penalty of for each violation.the following chart shows the allegations against defendants.
the fppc sent the accusation to defendants.because defendants did not respond with a notice of defense within days,tribe,on october,signed a default decision and order finding defendants violated the political reform act as alleged in the accusation and imposing a fine of.ravi mehta signed the default decision and order on november.defendants filed a petition for writ of mandate,but the petition was later dismissed for lack of prosecution.
at a meeting of the commission on april,it was noted that mehta signed the january,delegation document.the notes of the commission hearing continue commissioner rushford recommended the appointment of churchwell and tribe as acting directors with divided responsibilities.churchwell will handle the probable cause hearings and tribe will do the rest of the executive director responsibilities.in addition,this motion will ratify chairman mehta assignment of those duties to them from january,when the delegation was first made the motion was carried.
on january,the fppc filed an action against defendants to obtain a civil judgment in the amount of the fine,as allowed by government code section.defendants answered the complaint,and the fppc moved for summary judgment.the trial court granted the fppc motion and later entered judgment against defendants for,plus in interest 
discussion 
icompliance with required procedures 
after the fppc finds that an organization or person has violated the political reform act and imposes a fine,it may obtain a civil judgment requiring payment of the fine.in a proceeding to obtain a civil judgment,however,the fppc bears the burden of establishing several prerequisites,including a showing that the fine was imposed following the procedures set forth in the political reform act and implementing regulations.defendants argue that the fppc was not entitled to judgment in this matter because it did not establish the fine was imposed following the proper procedures when it delegated commission functions to ahuja and tribe.we conclude defendants can not make this argument here because they did not challenge the authority of fppc officials in earlier proceedings.
political reform act 
the political reform act was adopted by initiative in.it established the fppc and charged it with primary responsibility for the impartial,effective administration and implementation of the political reform act.consumers union of,california milk producers advisory bd.d.
the fppc appoints an executive director who must act in accordance with applicable laws,policies,and regulations.the commission may delegate authority to the chairman or the executive director to act in the name of the commission between meetings of the commission.
the first phase of fppc proceedings after investigation of an alleged violator of the political reform act is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe a violation has occurred.the government code provides for a determination of probable cause by the commission.by regulation,however,this determination has been delegated to the executive director the executive director may find there is probable cause to believe a violation has occurred if the evidence is sufficient to lead a person of ordinary caution and prudence to believe or entertain a strong suspicion that a proposed respondent committed or caused a violation.a finding of probable cause by the executive director does not constitute a finding that a violation has actually occurred,tit,subd.d.a finding of probable cause allows the commission to hold a hearing concerning whether a violation has occurred and,if it so finds,impose a fine.
acting pursuant to mehta delegation of authority to act as an executive director,jeevan ahuja determined probable cause supported further proceedings against defendants and robert tribe filed the accusation and signed the default decision and order.defendants assert these actions were taken without proper authority because mehta delegation was ineffectual.we conclude,however,that even assuming mehta delegation was ineffectual,defendants challenge of the authority of ahuja and tribe is precluded by the de facto officer doctrine.
de facto officer doctrine 
persons claiming to be public officers while in possession of an office,ostensibly exercising their functions lawfully and with the acquiescence of the public,are de facto officers the lawful acts of an officer de facto,so far as the rights of third persons are concerned,are,if done within the scope and by the apparent authority of office,as valid and binding as if he were the officer legally elected and qualified for the office and in full possession of it.citations.in re redevelopment plan for bunker hill cal d.t he right of a de facto officer to an office can not be collaterally attacked.citations.a right to hold office may not be collaterally attacked by a challenge to the official acts performed by the person holding such office.citation.ibid.
here,the fppc officials,acting pursuant to mehta delegation,acted as public officials,exercising their functions with public acquiescence.their actions were within the scope or apparent authority of the offices they purported to hold.therefore,their actions were valid and binding in the face of collateral attack.
defendants,nevertheless,make several arguments against application of the de facto officer doctrine here first,they are attacking the officials authority directly,not collaterally.second,the de facto officer doctrine does not apply because of an exception for appointment requirements enacted to protect people subject to the fppc authority.third,collateral estoppel bars the fppc from asserting the de facto officer doctrine.fourth,the de facto officer doctrine is bad law.and fifth,ahuja and tribe were not de facto officers.
collateral attack 
defendants assert this is a direct,not collateral,attack on the authority of ahuja and tribe.they base this assertion on the language in government code section requiring the fppc,as an element of its enforcement action,to establish t hat the monetary penalties,fees,or civil penalties were imposed following the procedures set forth in this title the political reform act and implementing regulations,subd.a.since the statutes concerning delegation of authority within the fppc are contained in the political reform act,defendants argue,the failure to delegate authority according to those statutes and their implementing regulations is a failure to follow the procedures set forth in the political reform act.this failure prevents the fppc from establishing an element of its cause of action against defendants under government code section,subdivision a.thus,according to defendants,the qualification of ahuja and tribe to act is directly,not collaterally,at issue.
this argument misconstrues government code section,subdivision a,which refers only to procedures for imposing the fine,not qualifications of fppc employees to act.by using the phrase imposed following the procedures,the legislature evinced an intent to protect a person or organization subject to an fppc fine from civil enforcement of that fine if the fppc failed to follow the procedures for imposing the fine,as required by the political reform act.this has to do with the procedural rights afforded to the person or organization,not to the authority of the fppc to act through its employees.thus,government code section,subdivision a,does not implicate the authority of the officiating officer.nothing in the statute supports the conclusion the legislature intended to allow someone such as defendants here to ignore proceedings of the fppc and later defend a civil action to enforce the imposed fine based on an attack on the authority of the officiating officer.
accordingly,government code section does not provide for a direct attack on the authority of the fppc officiating officer.defendants attack is collateral.
protection exception 
defendants assert there is an exception to the de facto officer doctrine,which occurs when the government officer appointment requirements were imposed to protect the person subject to the officer authority.he bases this assertion of an exception,primarily,on a law review note and an opinion of the illinois supreme court.see note,the de facto officer doctrine the case for continued application,de facto officer doctrine daniels industrial com,daniels.we need not decide whether the law review note and the illinois case reflect california law because,even assuming they do,they do not provide for an exception to the de facto officer doctrine under the facts of this case.
the major thesis of the law review note is that the de facto officer doctrine should be retained,even though its continued existence has been threatened by a federal court decision.de facto officer doctrine,supra.at see also andrade lauer questioning validity of de facto officer doctrine.citing several draft evasion cases in which courts allowed as a defense the improper selection of members of local draft boards,the note proposes an exception to the de facto officer doctrine when a qualification for a specific office aims to protect the individuals subject to that official authority.de facto officer doctrine,supra.at.the note concludes that a court should discern the policies embodied in the particular requisite to office and determine whether they are designed to protect the interests of individuals appearing before such officers or to protect the administration of government.id.at.
attempting to apply this exception described in the law review note to their case,defendants observe that,by statute,not more than three of the five fppc members may be from the same political party and that its members are appointed by different elected officials.see.they also note that the fppc,acting as a body,appoints the executive director and other officers.see.they conclude that these statutes establish that the appointment requirements at issue here were imposed to protect individuals.
we disagree.the facts of this case do not imperil interests personal to defendants that are protected by the political reform act.although we assume for the purpose of argument that the delegation from the chairman mehta to those acting in the functions of executive director ahuja and tribe was improper because the fppc had not given the chairman authority to act on its behalf,it could have done so under government code section.furthermore,the fppc ratified mehta action later.this is not a case in which mehta could not have been authorized to delegate authority instead,the proper authorization did not come until after he made the delegation.contra daniels,supra,at,in which arbitrators were appointed by commission chairman to fill positions that could only be filled by gubernatorial appointment.we therefore conclude the specific failure to follow the statutory scheme to delegate duties of the executive director did not implicate the statutory provisions meant to protect defendants individual interests,as discussed in the law review note.this case does not fall within the law review note exception to the de facto officer doctrine.
in daniels,the illinois supreme court held that a worker compensation claimant,on direct review of a compensation award,could challenge the legal status of the commissioners who adjudicated his claim,at.this is readily distinguished from the present case because,here,we consider a collateral attack.even if,under california law,defendants could make a direct attack on authority of ahuja and tribe consistent with daniels,they did not.therefore,daniels is unhelpful to defendants.
collateral estoppel 
the issue of improper delegation by mehta appears to have been litigated and resolved against the fppc in another case in the trial court.horcher fair political practices commission.defendants argue that collateral estoppel precludes the fppc from arguing the de facto officer doctrine in this case because,even though the de facto officer doctrine was not raised in the horcher case,it could have been.in support of this assertion,defendants cite warga cooper th,d,a case in which the court applied the doctrine of res judicata,not collateral estoppel,to an issue in an action involving the same parties as the prior proceeding.id.at,d.defendants were not involved in the prior proceeding here therefore,only the doctrine of collateral estoppel may be applied,if appropriate.we find it is not.
the elements of the collateral estoppel doctrine are well established.first,the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to that decided in a former proceeding.second,this issue must have been actually litigated in the former proceeding.third,it must have been necessarily decided in the former proceeding.fourth,the decision in the former proceeding must be final and on the merits.gikas zolin cal th,d.it is undisputed that the de facto officer doctrine was not litigated in horcher.accordingly,neither of the first two elements can be established.collateral estoppel does not preclude the fppc from asserting the de facto officer doctrine in this proceeding.
validity of de facto officer doctrine 
recognizing that the california supreme court has held that california courts follow the de facto officer doctrine see,in re redevelopment plan for bunker hill,supra,cal d,defendants,to preserve the issue for possible later review,assert the de facto officer doctrine is bad law and should not be followed.we are bound by the supreme court holding.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.
ahuja and tribe as de facto officers 
defendants assert this is not a case in which the de facto officer doctrine is applicable because mehta did not appoint ahuja and tribe as acting executive directors instead,he delegated to them the duties of an executive director.this is a dis
