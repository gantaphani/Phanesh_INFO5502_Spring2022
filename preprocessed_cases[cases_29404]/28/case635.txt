joint resolution at.
florida voters mona mangat,diana demarest,gracie fowler,and louisa mcqueeney filed a complaint,asking the second judicial circuit court to determine whether the ballot summary passed by the legislature complies with the requirements of section,florida statutes,and the various appellate court decisions that have applied and interpreted the requirements of that statutory provision.the parties submitted memoranda of law to the court and the court heard arguments at a hearing in july.in addition,the florida senate and house of representatives filed amicus briefs addressing the available remedies should the circuit court find the ballot summary defective.the circuit court issued an order determining that the ballot summary was misleading and should be removed from the ballot of the november,general election.
the circuit court found three statements in the introduction of the ballot summary to be misleading.the court noted that a citizen reading the statement to ensure access to health care services without waiting lists could only conclude that once the amendment was passed a constitutional right would exist to obtain a doctor of one choice without being put on a waiting list,while the amendment itself says nothing about waiting lists.the court noted that a second statement in the ballot summary provides that the amendment will protect the relationship,but the amendment itself says nothing about this relationship and does not have anything to do with confidentiality.finally,the summary states that the amendment will guard against mandates that do work,but neither the summary nor the amendment explains what mandates are at issue,why they do not work,or for whom the mandates do not work.the court concluded that this statement is a subjective term intended to influence a voter decision on the amendment.the circuit court concluded that all of these phrases are examples of comments that this court has held may not be included in ballot summaries.thus,the circuit court found that the ballot summary contained in the legislature joint resolution did not meet the requirements of section,florida statutes.
the amici and the secretary of state asked the circuit court to substitute the text of the proposed amendment for the ballot summary,rather than striking the proposed amendment from the november ballot.the circuit court ruled that it did not have authority to grant this remedy because its limited function was to determine whether the ballot summary,ballot title,and the amendment comply with the requirements of the florida constitution and section.the court stated that it was not empowered to correct the acts of the legislature,even if its failure to do so resulted in the amendment being struck from the ballot.
the department of state filed a notice of appeal in the first district court of appeal and also filed an unopposed suggestion for certification of the case to this court.the first district certified that the final judgment of the trial court presents issues of great public importance that require immediate resolution by this court.we have expedited our review of the case in light of the time constraints for printing the ballot for the november general election.
in most ballot summary cases,we are asked to determine whether the ballot summary for a proposed constitutional amendment meets the constitutional and statutory requirements for accuracy.in the instant case,however,the appellant does not ask the court to look at the lower court determination that the ballot summary set forth in the joint resolution is misleading.in fact,the appellant concedes that the ballot summary is misleading.rather,the appellant focuses entirely on the applicable remedy after such a determination has been made.the appellant argues that the court should substitute the text of the proposed amendment contained in the joint resolution for the misleading ballot summary on the november ballot and permit the voters to determine whether the proposed amendment will become part of the florida constitution.
we agree with the circuit court determination that the ballot summary for amendment does not meet the statutory or constitutional requirements for accuracy.the first two statements that the circuit court found misleading are classic examples of a ballot summary flying under false colors as the amendment does not address waiting lists or the relationship at all.these statements do not give fair notice of the purpose and effect of the amendment.even if the amendment is approved by the voters,it will not create a constitutional right to access health care services without a waiting list and will not affect the relationship.
while the third statement about mandates that do work might arguably have a relationship to the amendment which is intended to prevent mandated participation in any health care system,neither the amendment nor the summary identifies what mandates are at issue,explains how the mandates do not work,or specifies for whom they do not work.thus,this statement is ambiguous.it appears to be a reference to the federal health care mandate,which is the type of political rhetoric that this court has condemned in other cases.see in re advisory op.to the att y re additional homestead tax exemption,so d,concluding that use of the phrase provides property tax relief in the ballot summary constitutes political rhetoric that invites an emotional response from the voter by materially misstating the substance of the amendment advisory op.to the att y re tax limitation,so d,stating that the ballot summary must be accurate and informative and objective and free from political rhetoric in re advisory op.to the att y our everglades,so d,finding emotional language of ballot title and summary to be misleading as it resembled political rhetoric more than an accurate and informative synopsis evans firestone,so d,holding ballot summary defective in part because phrase thus avoiding unnecessary costs constituted editorial comment.the court has repeatedly stated that the ballot summary should tell the voter the legal effect of the amendment,and no more.evans,so d at.the court has also condemned p olitical rhetoric in a ballot title and summary that invites an emotional response from the voters as opposed to providing only a synopsis of a proposed amendment.advisory op.to att y re.marriage prot.amendment,so d.
because the misleading statements in the ballot summary here do not reflect the true legal effect of the proposed amendment,the ballot summary does not comply with the requirements of section that the substance of the amendment be printed in clear and unambiguous language on the ballot.it also does not comply with the implicit accuracy requirement of article xi,section of the florida constitution.thus,we affirm the circuit court conclusion that the ballot summary for amendment is invalid.
next,we turn to the appellant argument concerning the appropriate remedy in this case.prior to,all proposed amendments were subject to a requirement that t he substance of the amendment or other public measure shall be an explanatory statement,not exceeding words in length,of the chief purpose of the measure.stat.in,however,the legislature revised this requirement.see,at,laws of the current law now provides except for amendments and ballot language proposed by joint resolution,the substance of the amendment or other public measure shall be an explanatory statement,not exceeding words in length,of the chief purpose of the measure.emphasis added.
based upon this new statutory language,we agree with the appellant that the legislature is not limited to words in a ballot summary.see sancho smith,so d,dca the effect of this change in the statute is to exempt the florida legislature from the limit applicable to a ballot summary for an amendment by citizen initiative or by another authorized method of amending the constitution.indeed,the legislature is not required to provide a ballot summary instead,the legislature may resolve to place the exact text of a proposed amendment on a voter ballot however,the joint resolution in this case specifically provides that the summary language be placed on the ballot.the joint resolution says nothing about placing the text of the actual amendment on the ballot.
nevertheless,the appellant argues that this court should sever the misleading ballot summary language from the joint resolution and place the text of the proposed amendment itself on the ballot.for the reasons stated below,we conclude that there are several problems with the remedy proposed in this case,including that the appellant actually seeks substitution rather than severance of language and that this court does not have authority to substitute language for that the legislature has clearly intended to appear on the ballot.
severability is a judicially created doctrine which recognizes a court obligation to uphold the constitutionality of legislative enactments where it is possible to remove the unconstitutional portions.ray mortham,so d.it is derived from the respect of the judiciary for the separation of powers,and is designed to show great deference to the legislative prerogative to enact laws.id.quoting schmitt state,so d.
indeed,florida courts have stricken invalid portions of legislative enactments and have permitted the remainder to be preserved as valid law.see,florida hosp.waterman,buster,so d,severing several subsections from a statute that unconstitutionally impinged upon the patients right to know about adverse medical incidents provision in the florida constitution.we have also applied the doctrine to a constitutional amendment in one instance.see ray,so d at.severing provisions relating to federal legislators from constitutional amendment that imposed term limits on elected state officials.however,this court has historically applied the severability doctrine to a statute or amendment after it has been enacted by the legislature or approved by the voters.see,ray,so d at the issue of severability arises only after an amendment already approved by voters has been challenged.in this case,this court is not reviewing a legislative enactment or an approved constitutional amendment,but rather a joint resolution containing a proposed amendment that has not yet been submitted to the voters for approval.
while the appellant speaks in terms of severance,the remedy being proposed is in fact a substitution of other language for the ballot summary.the joint resolution specifically provides that the ballot summary appear on the ballot.the legislature resolved that the proposed health care services amendment would be represented on the ballot by the ballot title and summary.the legislature did not resolve to place the entire text of the proposed amendment on the ballot.thus,if the summary is struck from the ballot,it leaves nothing but the ballot title for the voters to consider.therefore,the solution the appellant seeks is substitution,not severance,of the ballot summary.the severability doctrine has only been used to strike objectionable language.it is not a vehicle for the wholesale substitution of other language for language that is stricken.
further,in the context of a ballot summary review,we have not severed defective language from a ballot summary that contains misleading or ambiguous language.instead,we have stricken the misleading summary from the ballot,thereby removing the proposed amendment from a vote of the electorate.see,askew firestone,so d,striking from the ballot a proposed constitutional amendment regarding the ban on lobbying by former legislators based on the misleading ballot summary in the joint resolution advisory op.to atty re property tax cap,unless voter approved,so d,striking from the ballot a misleading ballot summary in a citizens initiative petition relating to property tax cap.
the appellant suggests that the courts paramount focus should be the legislatures intent in passing the joint resolution,that the proposed health care services amendment be put to the vote of florida citizens.while we acknowledge this intent,we are also cognizant that the legislature clearly expressed its intent that a summary of the amendment,rather than the text of the amendment or both the summary and the text,appear on the ballot to be presented to florida voters.this court does not have the authority to substitute the language that of the members of the legislature have voted to place on the ballot.
the appellant relies heavily on the fact that this court ordered substitution of the text of a proposed amendment in a previous case.see aclu hood,no,unpublished order directing the secretary of state to remove the ballot summary and replace it with the actual text of the proposed amendment.we note that the court direction in aclu was issued through an unpublished order that contained no explanation,analysis,or authority for the court action.id.however,to the extent that our order in aclu is viewed as authority for the remedy the appellant requests in this case,we specifically recede from aclu as it is not consistent with a long line of cases involving proposed constitutional amendments.we have faithfully reviewed proposed amendments for compliance with the strict minimum for ballot clarity and not ventured into fixing problems with the ballot language.armstrong harris,so d,see also askew,so d at.our role in this process is as a reviewer of constitutional validity,not as an editor or author.for example,in smith american airlines,so d,where we found the ballot summary for an amendment proposed by the taxation and budget reform commission to be fatally defective,we specifically stated that the court has no authority to independently rewrite the ballot summary to conform to the requirements of section.id.at.rather than fixing the problem with the ballot summary,we struck the amendment proposed by the commission from the general election ballot.id.at.pursuant to our role and precedent,the only remedy in the instant case is to strike the proposal from the ballot.
moreover,although the appellant argues that the striking of the entire amendment in this case thwarts legislative intent by preventing florida voters from voting on the merits of the proposal,we have previously asked the legislature to establish a procedure that would avoid this problem.see american airlines,so d at in order to prevent this problem from recurring in the future,we urge the legislature to consider amending the statute to empower this court to fix fatal problems with ballot summaries,at least with respect to those amendments proposed by revision commissions or the legislature.see also askew,so d at overton,concurring suggesting a process whereby misleading ballot language can be challenged and corrected in sufficient time to allow the people to vote on the proposal armstrong,so d at pariente,specially concurring agreeing with justice overton concerns in askew.the legislature has yet to establish such a process.
finally,if we were to place the entire text of the amendment on the ballot we would be ignoring the legislature explicit language that the ballot summary and title be placed on the ballot.indeed,if the legislature had intended for the text of amendment to be placed on the ballot along with the summary,it could have done so.see sancho smith,so d,dca concluding that the ballot summary accurately described the proposed amendment and noting that the summary included a copy of the full text of the amendment.
in this case,the ballot language put forth by the party proposing the constitutional amendment contains misleading and ambiguous language.currently,our only recourse is to strike the proposed constitutional amendment from the ballot,thereby removing it from a vote of the electorate.see,askew,so d at.
conclusion 
for the reasons explained above,we affirm the circuit court order finding the ballot summary for amendment does not meet the requirements of section and therefore may not be included on the november ballot.
no motion for rehearing will be allowed.
pariente,concurring in result.
i agree with the majority that it would be inappropriate in this case for this court to substitute a lengthy and complex amendment in lieu of a misleading ballot summary for placement on the ballot as the majority has explained,the legislature voted to place only the summary on the ballot,and the legislature does not contest that the summary it proposed was misleading.
rather than a simple and straightforward amendment,the text of amendment is lengthy and complex.in this case,i would conclude that an explanation of its chief purpose and effect would be required.if the intent of the proposed amendment was to avoid federal mandates that have been placed into recently enacted federal laws regarding health care and health insurance,that purpose should be clearly and unambiguously set forth.instead,the ballot summary claimed its purpose was to ensure access to health care services without waiting lists,protect the relationship,and guard against mandates that do work.i assume this latter phrase was a veiled reference to the legislature view of recently passed federal health care legislation.
as stressed repeatedly by this court,it is of paramount importance that the voters have fair notice of the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment before they cast a vote.for some proposed amendments,the purpose and effect of the proposed change may be readily apparent based on the full text of the proposed amendment itself.however,more lengthy and complex amendments will certainly require an explanatory statement to explain the impact of the amendment and the effect on existing constitutional provisions.see,askew firestone,so d,striking a proposed legislative amendment from the ballot because although the ballot summary tracked the text of the proposed amendment,the summary fai
