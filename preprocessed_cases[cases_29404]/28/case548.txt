every ten years,in the year following the year in which the national census is taken,the boundary lines of california senatorial,assembly,congressional,and board of equalization districts are reapportioned to,among other things,reflect population shifts.cal,art.xxi.our state constitution assigns this task to california legislature,with participation of the governor through the power to approve or to veto legislation.legislature reinecke cal d.
in,the legislature enacted,and governor gray davis approved,reapportionment legislation.it put most residents of the city of santa clara in assembly district,but a meandering district boundary through the city put some of its residents in assembly district.
unhappy with this division,a number of santa clara residents,taxpayers,registered voters,and public officials whom we will refer to as plaintiffs brought this action,challenging the reapportionment of assembly districts they allege that its separation of santa clara into two assembly districts violates article xxi,section,subdivision e of california constitution,which states the geographical integrity of any city,county,or city and county,or of any geographical region shall be respected to the extent possible without violating the requirements of any other subdivision of this section.the trial court disagreed,and plaintiffs appealed.
as we will explain,that constitutional provision is the most flexible of the reapportionment standards and provides the greatest discretion to our state legislature.it plainly does not prohibit division of a city,county,or geographical region into different legislative districts.a reapportionment plan enacted by the legislature and approved by the governor is entitled to significant judicial deference.such a plan is presumptively constitutional,and a party challenging the plan bears the burden of demonstrating it inevitably poses a total and fatal conflict with constitutional provisions.we agree with the trial court that plaintiffs have not met their burden here.thus,we shall affirm the judgment.
the national census listed santa clara population at.san jose,with a population of,borders santa clara on the north,east,and south.santa clara also is bordered on the west by sunnyvale,with a population of,and on the southwest by cupertino,with a population of.
in,the assembly reapportionment divided santa clara at the bayshore freeway highway,which crosses the city in an manner.approximately percent of santa clara residents lived south of the bayshore freeway and were placed in assembly district.residents of santa clara who lived north of the freeway were placed in assembly district.
when time came for the reapportionment,officials of santa clara wanted to keep the whole city within one assembly district.since santa clara population was less than a quarter of the size of an assembly district if california population at that time were divided equally into assembly districts,the officials felt inclusion of the entire city in one assembly district could be readily accomplished.
the national census is the basis for legislative apportionment.for reporting purposes,the national census utilizes units known as census tracts and census blocks.the census listed california population at.this population was divided into census tracts and census blocks.consequently,the average population size of a census tract was persons,and the average population size of a census block was persons.among other things,the national census reports total population,voting age population,and data with respect to census tracts and census blocks.
in preparation for the reapportionment,the legislature contracted with the institute of governmental studies,university of california,berkeley,to merge census information with political data obtained from county registrars.at the census block level,the political information contained such things as party registration and voting records in recent state and federal elections.the result is referred to as the statewide database,which can be used with a computer program,such as maptitude for redistricting,for drawing district boundaries at the census block level.
hearings were held in locations throughout the state by the assembly committee on elections,reapportionment and constitutional amendments and the senate elections and reapportionment committee.after the hearings,the legislature released a draft plan for assembly reapportionment.it placed santa clara entirely within assembly district,along with sunnyvale,cupertino,mountain view,part of san jose,and unincorporated areas of the county.see appendix however,the legislature did not enact the draft plan.
in the plan ultimately enacted by the legislature,slightly less than percent of santa clara population was placed in assembly district,and the rest was put in assembly district.this was accomplished by putting a small area on the east side of the city into assembly district,and by running an irregular,finger of that district up from the southeast corner of the city toward its middle.see appendices b 
plaintiffs brought this action to challenge the division of santa clara into two assembly districts.in their view,such a division is unconstitutional unless dictated by strict necessity.asserting that reapportionment by the legislature should be subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny,plaintiffs believe that dividing santa clara was unnecessary to accomplish reapportionment and,thus,division of the city violates article xxi,section,subdivision e,of our state constitution.
the trial court held that the reapportionment plan enacted by the legislature is entitled to judicial deference and that plaintiffs failed to establish the plan is constitutionally invalid.
discussion 
plaintiffs complaint alleges,among other things,that in the reapportionment plan enacted by the legislature,the berryessa neighborhood of san jose,which lies to the east of santa clara,was divided among four assembly districts,the,and.according to plaintiffs,the berryessa neighborhood is home to a substantial community,which comprises the majority of its residents.thus,plaintiffs claim,the legislature divided santa clara between districts and to facilitate its plan to dilute this community voting strength and increase the number of latino voters in assembly district,thereby ensuring the electoral safety of that district latino incumbent.
this allegation suggests a federal equal protection of law challenge to the assembly reapportionment plan however,plaintiffs did not make the required prima facie showing in the trial court and do not pursue such a claim on appeal.
plaintiffs challenge to the reapportionment plan relies solely upon article xxi of our state constitution,which states section.in the year following the year in which the national census is taken under the direction of congress at the beginning of each decade,the legislature shall adjust the boundary lines of the senatorial,assembly,congressional,and board of equalization districts in conformance with the following standards a each member of the senate,assembly,congress,and the board of equalization shall be elected from a district.b the population of all districts of a particular type shall be reasonably equal.c every district shall be contiguous.d districts of each type shall be numbered consecutively commencing at the northern boundary of the state and ending at the southern boundary.e the geographical integrity of any city,county,or city and county,or of any geographical region shall be respected to the extent possible without violating the requirements of any other subdivision of this section.
because the issue presented by plaintiffs is solely a matter of state law,it must be resolved pursuant to state principles of constitutional adjudication.while we will cite decisions of the united states supreme court for their persuasive value,in the end we resolve this case under state law.
we begin by rejecting the suggestion of the senate and the assembly that this appeal should be dismissed because the issue presented is nonjusticiable.
schabarum california legislature th,d hereafter schabarum discussed the political question rule,which,in rare instances,may require a court to refrain from addressing a challenge to legislative action.this rule arises out of the separation of powers in our tripartite system of government.id.at,d.courts are limited to the judicial resolution of cases and may not usurp the functions of the legislative and executive branches.ibid.usurpation would include unwarranted intrusion into the roles of the executive legislative branches.ibid.
nevertheless,it is well established that it is a judicial function to interpret the law,including the constitution,and,when appropriately presented in a case or controversy,to declare when an act of the legislature or the executive is beyond the constitutional authority vested in those branches.schabarum,supra,th at,d.california constitution directs the legislature to perform reapportionment and provides standards it must follow.cal,art.xxi.where,as here,a claim is made that the reapportionment plan enacted by the legislature does not conform to the dictates of our state constitution,the issue is justiciable.see silver brown cal d,see also davis bandemer,supra,at.at,d at.
before turning to the merits of plaintiffs challenge to the reapportionment plan,we address their claim that the trial court committed reversible error in denying plaintiffs request to take the deposition of william cavala.the matter arose as follows.
in enacting the reapportionment plan,the legislature provided notwithstanding any other provision of law,any person challenging the validity or constitutionality of any provision of this act shall,within days from the effective date of this act,and no later,petition the california supreme court for a writ of mandate,specifying the nature of the relief sought.stats,ch.
plaintiffs timely filed such a petition for writ of mandate.in its preliminary opposition to the petition,the assembly attached cavala declaration as the senior consultant to the speaker in the assembly office of majority services,cavala was involved in providing proposals for the assembly reapportionment.cavala declaration explained some of the considerations that went into redistricting in the region that includes santa clara.plaintiffs responded that the declaration should be stricken because cavala can not properly testify to the motives of the legislators and,in any event,the subjective motivations of the legislators are not a proper subject for inquiry.the california supreme court summarily denied the petition for a writ of mandate.
thereafter,while the matter was pending in the trial court,plaintiffs noticed the deposition of cavala.pointing out that,in the supreme court,plaintiffs had opposed the consideration of cavala comments regarding the reapportionment,the assembly asserted the legislative privilege as to most of the questions plaintiffs wanted to ask cavala this prompted plaintiffs to move to compel cavala deposition.
the trial court held that by submitting cavala declaration to the supreme court,the assembly waived the legislative privilege with respect to the contents of the declaration and,thus,plaintiffs could use any relevant parts of it as evidence,subject to objections on grounds other than privilege,but unless the assembly planned to use cavala declaration in this action,plaintiffs could not compel cavala to submit to deposition testimony.
asserting that the trial court erred in denying the motion to compel,plaintiffs argue the assembly waived the legislative privilege and opened the door to cavala deposition by voluntarily filing his detailed declaration with the california supreme court.in their view,the error was prejudicial because cavala had a unique insider perspective on the redistricting process such that his deposition testimony could have bolstered their case.the contention fails.
we are not here concerned solely with a question of privilege.we also confront the more fundamental,historically enshrined legal principle that precludes any judicially authorized inquiry into the subjective motives or mental processes of legislators.county of los angeles superior court cal d.in this state,evidence that relates to the mental processes of individual legislators is irrelevant to the judicial task.id.at.consequently,such evidence is not the proper subject of discovery requests.schabarum,supra,th at,fn,d see city of santa cruz superior court th,d rule applies to nonlegislators so long as the questioning goes to the legislators thought processes board of supervisors superior court th,d.
thus,regardless of whether the assembly waived the legislative privilege,this can not alter the standard of review that courts apply in resolving constitutional challenges to legislation.since court inquiry into the subjective motivations of members of the legislature is precluded,whatever light cavala might have been able to shed on such motivations is irrelevant to our judicial task.for this reason,the trial court did not commit prejudicial error in refusing to compel deposition testimony by cavala 
in rejecting plaintiffs challenge to the reapportionment plan,the trial court said that its role was to give deference to the l egislative process and to determine whether there was a reasonable basis for the legislature action.the court is not to substitute its own judgment for that of the legislature.the legislature determinations are entitled to great deference as long as they reflect a reasonable application of the article xxi criteria and federal redistricting requirements.plaintiffs have the burden of demonstrating a clear and unmistakable violation of those requirements and the legislature interpretation is entitled to deference in the absence of a showing that a particular provision has been unmistakably violated.therefore,the plans carry a strong presumption of constitutionality and plaintiffs have not demonstrated a clear and unmistakable violation with respect to either the individual districts at issue or the plan as a whole.
plaintiffs urge us to review de novo their challenge to the reapportionment plan and not to follow what they describe as the trial court overly deferential approach.
for reasons that follow,we conclude,as did the trial court,that a reapportionment plan enacted by the legislature and approved by the governor is entitled to significant judicial deference.
california constitution expressly commits the task of reapportionment to the legislature.cal,art.xxi.in performing the judicial function,courts may not engage in unwarranted interference with the role of the legislative branch.schabarum,supra,th at,d.all intendments favor the exercise of the legislative authority,and courts must strictly construe constitutional restrictions or limitations on that authority any doubt as to the legislature authority to act must be resolved in favor of its action.pacific legal foundation brown cal d,schabarum,supra,th at,d.courts also must defer to the legislature determination that facts exist to support legislation unless it is palpably arbitrary.citation.consequently,we must uphold the challenged legislation so long as the legislature could rationally have determined a set of facts that support it.citation.schabarum,supra,th at,d.in addition,courts must presume that the legislature acts are constitutional id.at,d the party challenging a legislative enactment bears the burden of proving it violates the constitution.to meet this burden,the party must demonstrate that the enactment inevitably poses a present,total,and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional provisions,that no set of circumstances exists under which the enactment would be valid.pacific legal foundation brown,supra,cal d at,people rodriguez th,d.the state is not required to justify the enactment.
on every occasion on which our state supreme court has been compelled to enter a reapportionment fray,it has indicated that the policies of judicial restraint and deference to the legislature are applicable,assembly deukmejian cal d.indeed,as a practical matter,it would be very difficult to fairly consider challenges to a reapportionment scheme without according deference to the legislature.the decision in wilson eu cal th,d,demonstrates the inherent difficulty and necessary give and take that goes into developing a reapportionment plan.quoting its opinion in legislature reinecke cal d at page,the supreme court noted that redrawing specific district lines to achieve possibly more reasonable results runs the serious risk of creating undesirable side effects that could not be foreseen from a judicial perspective.wilson eu,supra,cal th at,d.
so,too,has the united states supreme court recognized that the difficulty of reapportionment requires that state legislatures be allowed the discretion necessary to balance competing interests.miller johnson,supra,at.at,d at.courts should not be what has consistently been referred to as a political task for the legislature,a task that should not be monitored too closely by the courts.davis bandemer,supra,at.at,d at.
for these reasons,unless a complaining party makes a prima facie showing of an equal protection violation,a court adjudicating a constitutional challenge to a reapportionment plan must apply the standard applicable to constitutional challenges generally,deference to the legislature judgment.
according to plaintiffs,the undisputed facts in this case compelled the preservation of santa clara in a single assembly district.we are not persuaded.
article xxi,section of our state constitution sets forth standards the legislature must apply in enacting reapportionment legislation.california supreme court summarized the standards as follows consecutively numbered districts,reasonably equal populations among districts of the same type,contiguous districts,and respect for the geographical integrity of any city,county,or city and county,or of any geographical region to the extent possible without violating the other standards.wilson eu,supra,cal th at,d.in addition,the supremacy clause of the united states constitution requires that reapportionment take into consideration the federal principles of equal protection and the voting rights act.id.at,d.any other relevant criteria also may be given consideration id.at,d,however,it may be impossible to completely fulfill all of them in all areas of california.see silver brown,supra,cal d at.
respect for the geographical integrity of any city,county,or city and county,or of any geographical region cal,art.xxi,subd.e is the most flexible reapportionment standard,and it provides the greatest discretion to our state legislature.see silver brown,supra,cal d at.it requires that political boundaries be respected,but it does not expressly prohibit division of a city into different districts.see wilson eu,supra,cal th at,d.
in providing that the geographical integrity of a city should be respected to the extent possible,this standard recognizes that the reapportionment task is complicated by what is known as the ripple effect,whereby the casting of one district on the water produces ripples felt throughout the state.if uncontrolled,this effect may result in the initial choice of a perfect district in one place leading to intolerably imperfect districts elsewhere.legislature reinecke,supra,cal d at,fn.
because,as a practical matter,the reapportionment process involves give and take in resolving conflicts among the various standards and in considering the concerns,desires,and objections of numerous interested persons and groups see wilson eu,supra,cal th at,d,a result which may appear ideal for one place or another must be subordinated to the goal of fair and reasonable reapportionment of the whole state legislature reinecke,supra,cal d at.therefore,courts must approve a reapportionment plan if it appears to reflect a reasonable application of the standards,even though alternatives may appear equally reasonable.legislature reinecke,supra,cal d at,see also wilson eu,supra,cal th at,d.
in response to plaintiffs challenge,defendants presented evidence to demonstrate some of the difficulties that inhere in reapportioning the area in which santa clara is located.the city is in the santa clara valley.the valley is narrow and is bordered by the santa cruz mountains to the west,the diablo range to the east,and the san francisco bay to the north.the san francisco peninsula,a narrow body of land surrounded on three sides by the pacific ocean and the san francisco bay,runs northwest from the santa clara valley.the city and county of san francisco is at the tip of the san francisco peninsula and has a population of about persons less than would be needed to form two complete assembly districts.in order to avoid the prospect of running district boundaries across a bridge to add population,the only possibility would be to run the boundaries south from san francisco into other jurisdictions.this causes a ripple effect that runs down the peninsula into the santa clara valley.underpopulated districts encompassing east bay communities also have a ripple effect that runs south into the santa clara valley to converge with the san francisco ripple effect.
reapportionment in santa clara county is further complicated by the fact that merced county is situated to the east and monterey county is situated to the south.they are two of california four covered jurisdictions that require federal preclearance pursuant to section of the voting rights act.hence,the legislature was required to take special care to ensure that district boundaries affecting those counties would be drawn in a manner to obtain federal preclearance.wilson eu,supra,cal th at,d.
it also was shown there was a large and concentrated latino population in san jose.under the reapportionment plan,assembly district included san jose latino neighborhoods and had a latino population of percent.in,the district elected a latino representative.during legislative hearings on the reapportionment,the mexican american legal defense fund submitted a proposal under which assembly district would have a latino population of percent.the coalition of asian pacific americans for fair redistricting submitted a plan under which assembly district would have a latino population of percent.
in the reapportionment plan that the legislature did not enact,the latino population of assembly district was decreased to percent.defendants experts believed this could have made the plan susceptible to a voting rights act challenge.in the plan enacted by the legislature,the latino population of that district was percent.the addition of latino neighborhoods to the district set off a ripple effect in adjoining districts,most notably assembly districts and.in the adjustments necessary to maintain population equality,santa clara was split,with some of its residents being placed in assembly district.
in challenging the plan that was enacted by the legislature,plaintiffs assume that only strict necessity would permit the split of a city in a districting plan.claiming that t he most powerful evidence in the record is the draft plan which was not adopted,they argue the draft plan unequivocally established that it was possible,within the meaning of article xxi,subdivision e,to keep santa clara whole.this is so,according to plaintiffs,because the enacted plan did not serve to better equalize district populations over the draft plan,the draft plan and the enacted plan were equally lawful with respect to the contiguity requirement,and the changes from the draft plan to the enacted plan did not serve to unify any other city as a tradeoff for the split of santa clara.
the draft plan to which plaintiffs refer was not even a truncated product of the legislative process.the enactment of a reapportionment plan requires a majority vote in both houses of the legislature and approval by the governor.it does not appear that the draft plan was ever voted upon by either house of the legislature.it was just as it is described,a preliminary draft plan to serve as the starting point for legislative consideration of reapportionment.it has no legal status and is certainly not binding upon the legislature in any way.at most,it serves only to indicate that santa clara could have been kept whole in an alternative assembly districting plan.
the california supreme court has twice indicated a reasonable,comprehensive reapportionment plan should not be reject
