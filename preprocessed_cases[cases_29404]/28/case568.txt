the peace and freedom party pfp sought,by a petition for writ of mandate,to compel the secretary of state to include voters listed in the inactive file of registered voters in calculating whether pfp qualified to participate in the march primary election pursuant to elections code section,subdivision b.further section references are to the elections code unless otherwise specified.finding the legislature has explicitly excluded such voters from the calculation,subd.a,the superior court rejected pfp claims that so interpreting the statutory scheme violates federal constitutional and statutory law.
pfp appeals from the judgment denying its writ petition.although the march primary election is long passed,the issue pfp raises is likely to recur in future elections and is a matter of continuing public interest and importance.thus,we exercise our discretion to decide the issue on the merits,even though it is technically moot.burch george cal th,fn,d,lundquist reusser cal th,fn,d,libertarian party eu cal d.
we shall affirm the judgment.as we will explain,the legislature decision to exclude voters on the inactive file of registered voters from the calculation to determine whether a political party qualifies to participate in a primary election pursuant to section,subdivision b,passes constitutional muster.because information in the inactive file is unreliable and often duplicative of information in the file of active voters,the exclusion is a reasonable,nondiscriminatory restriction that furthers the state compelling interest in protecting the integrity and stability of the electoral process in california.for the same reason,the exclusion is consistent with the intent and provisions of the national voter registration act et.
background 
pfp sought to qualify to participate in the march primary election pursuant to section,which states in pertinent part a party is qualified to participate in any primary election b if on or before the day before any primary election,it appears to the secretary of state,as a result of examining and totaling the statement of voters and their political affiliations transmitted to him or her by the county elections officials,that voters equal in number to at least percent of the entire vote of the state at the last preceding gubernatorial election have declared their intention to affiliate with that party.
the requisite number of voters equivalent to one percent of the entire vote at the then last preceding gubernatorial election was voters.according to pfp,the secretary of state reported that registered voters were affiliated with pfp and,hence,pfp did not qualify to participate in the march primary election.in determining whether pfp had met the criteria set forth in section,subdivision b,the secretary of state did not include voters whose names had been placed on the inactive file of registered voters.pfp petition for writ of mandate claimed that if voters listed on the inactive file were included in the calculation,then pfp and its candidates would qualify to participate in the primary election.
the secretary of state decision to exclude voters listed on the inactive file in the calculation apparently was premised on section,subdivision a,which states based on information received pursuant to sections to,inclusive,or information provided directly by the voter,the county elections official shall take the following actions as appropriate if the information indicates the voter has moved to a new address within the same county,the county elections official shall update and correct the voter registration.if the information indicates the voter has moved to a new address in another county,if the mailings have been returned as undeliverable,or if the voter fails to confirm his or her address as required by section,the county elections official may place the voter name on the inactive file of registered voters who do not receive election materials and are not included in calculations to determine the number of signatures required for qualification of candidates and measures,precinct size,or other election administration related processes.italics added.
pfp asserted that the calculation whether a political party qualifies for participation in a primary election pursuant to section,subdivision b,is not one of the other election administration related processes referred to in section,subdivision a therefore,it is not a calculation from which voters listed on the inactive file are excluded.pointing out that such voters remain registered voters until their affidavits of registration are cancelled by the county elections official,pfp argued they are voters within the meaning of section,subdivision b,for the purpose of calculating whether the political parties with which they had affiliated would qualify for participation in the primary election.in pfp view,a contrary interpretation would violate the national voter registration act et.
the secretary of state opposed pfp petition for writ of mandate,asserting that the inactive file of registered voters is not a reliable source of voter registration information because it contains errors and is potentially duplicative of names on the active voters list.according to the declarations of various election officials,there are many reasons a voter registration may be moved to the inactive file,including death,moving to a different county,a name change,notification by the post office that mail is undeliverable to the voter address,the receipt of a national change of address notice,registration with a different political party,and the failure to vote in two consecutive federal elections and to respond to attempts by the county to contact the voter.generally,if election officials receive direct information from a voter that he or she has moved or otherwise changed his or her registration,the voter old registration information is updated and not placed in the inactive file.but if the official receives the information indirectly,such as through information from the postal service,then the voter registration is placed in the inactive file.
john,chief of the elections division,declared the file of active voters represents persons who are properly registered at their current address,are not deceased,and whose registration is not duplicative of another registration on the voter file.the file of active voters is used as the basis for the report of registration,for calculating the number of voters per precinct as provided by statute,for printing and mailing sample ballots and other election materials,as well as other election administration purposes.the file of inactive voters,on the other hand,consists of records of voters where the election official has received notice that the voter has moved,is deceased,or is no longer eligible to vote.the inactive file exists for the single purpose of ensuring that a mistake was not made when the voter was moved from the active file,and is,in effect,a holding file until a voter registration may be permanently cancelled.
further declared that,pursuant to a stipulation with the united states department of justice,voters placed on the inactive file of registered voters as the result of the alternate residency confirmation process authorized by section may never be moved off the inactive list to the list of cancelled voters 
consequently,declared that the inactive file of registered voters contains duplicate names and erroneous information,and that there is no process or capacity either at the state level or at the county level to review,update or integrate data from the inactive voter file in each county into the active voter file.
gave the following example of a hypothetical woman who changes her voter information several times during her life as the result of changing her residence,marrying,divorcing,and changing her party affiliation mary brown as mary lee brown,then she moves in with her boyfriend and at the new address,then marries and as mary lee green,then changes her party affiliation,then divorces and as mary brown,then moves and as mary brown,then remarries and as mary white,and then moves again and.in this example,the voter could have as many as nine registrations on file in her county,one active and eight inactive.
concluded that it would be erroneous to use such a person duplicate listings on the inactive file of registered voters for the purpose of calculating whether a party qualifies to participate in a primary election pursuant to section,subdivision b.
noted that voters on the inactive file retain the right to appear at their polling place,correct their record,and vote.but they do not receive election materials,and they are not included for determining political party eligibility.he opined that this was consistent with the congressional intent underlying the national voter registration act.
the superior court ruled that,pursuant to section,subdivision a,the secretary of state correctly excluded inactive voters from the calculation called for by section,subdivision b,and that exclusion of pfp from participation in the march primary election did not violate federal law.accordingly,it denied pfp petition for writ of mandate.
discussion 
as we have noted,section,subdivision b,provides that a political party is qualified to participate in a primary election if,at least days before the election,voters equal in number to at least percent of the entire vote of the state at the last preceding gubernatorial election have declared their intention to affiliate with that party.and section,subdivision a,states that voters listed on the inactive file of registered voters shall not be included in calculations to determine the number of signatures required for qualification of candidates and measures,precinct size,or other election administration related processes.
the administrative process of determining whether a political party qualifies to participate in a primary election pursuant to section,subdivision b,is by any understanding an election administration related process.therefore,an application of the general rules of statutory construction leads to the conclusion that,by virtue of section,subdivision a,voters listed on the inactive file of registered voters must be excluded from the calculation to determine whether the number of signatures on voter registration forms declaring the voters affiliations with a particular political party is sufficient to qualify that party for participation in a primary election pursuant to section,subdivision b.
as it did in the superior court,pfp contends the phrase other election administration related processes in section,subdivision a,should not be interpreted to encompass the political party qualification determination made pursuant to section,subdivision b.in pfp words,that determination is simply too fundamental to the electoral rights of political parties and their members to be subsumed within such a general phrase.this is so,pfp argues,because a voter listed on the inactive file continues to be a registered voter until his or her voter registration is cancelled pursuant to election laws,under the circumstances of this case,excluding registered voters affiliated with pfp,but listed on the inactive file,from the calculation to determine if their political party qualifies to participate in a primary election deprives those voters chosen political party and its candidates of ballot access,and this result necessarily denies such voters their right to vote for the part y and candidates of their choice.
in pfp view,such an interpretation of the statute is wrong because it would violate the first amendment rights of peace and freedom party voters and registrants whose names have been placed in the inactive file.we disagree.
the first amendment protects the right of citizens to associate and to form political parties for the advancement of common political goals and ideas.timmons twin cities area new party,d.in determining whether an interpretation of a state election law would be unconstitutional,a court must first consider the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the constitutional provision that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate.it then must identify and evaluate the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.in passing judgment,the court must not only determine the legitimacy and strength of each of those interests it also must consider the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff rights.anderson celebrezze,d.
n ot all restrictions imposed by the states on candidates eligibility for the ballot impose constitutionally suspect burdens on voters rights to associate or to choose among candidates a s a practical matter,there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order,rather than chaos,is to accompany the democratic processes.citation.to achieve these necessary objectives,states have enacted comprehensive and sometimes complex election codes.each provision of these schemes,whether it governs the registration and qualifications of voters,the selection and eligibility of candidates,or the voting process itself,inevitably least to some individual right to vote and his right to associate with others for political ends.nevertheless,the state important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions.anderson celebrezze,supra,at.at,d at,fn.omitted.
pfp concedes that nothing in the relevant code sections,or in the superior court interpretation of them,prevents a candidate registered as a member of pfp from being on the general election ballot.rather,pfp only was prevented from being deemed a qualified political party eligible to participate in the primary election pursuant to section,subdivision b.it still could have qualified to participate in the primary election if it obtained petitions signed by registered voters,equal in number to percent of the entire vote of the state at the last preceding gubernatorial election,declaring that they desired to have pfp participate in the primary election,subd.c.
and,despite the failure to participate in the primary election,an individual pfp candidate could qualify to have his or her name on the general election ballot by nomination,with the limitation that the designation independent,rather than the party affiliation,would be printed on the ballot by the candidate name.libertarian party eu,supra,cal d at.nothing prevents pfp from publishing the affiliation of its candidates it simply can not designate the affiliation on the ballot so long as it remains unqualified.libertarian party eu,supra,cal d at.requiring the candidate be identified as an independent,rather than a pfp candidate,imposes an insubstantial burden on the associational and voting rights of the candidate and the citizenry,and serves a compelling state interest to protect the integrity and stability of the electoral process in california.libertarian party eu,supra,cal d at.
in other words,the burden that pfp identifies concerning the associational rights of voters listed on the inactive file is minimal.burdick takushi,d,prohibition against candidates imposed only a limited burden on voters rights to associate where the state election laws provided other reasonable mechanisms through which a voter candidate of choice may appear on the ballot.
moreover,the right to associate for political purposes through the ballot is not absolute.burdick takushi,supra,at.at,d at.t o avoid burdening the general election ballot with frivolous candidacies,a state may require parties to demonstrate a significant modicum of support before allowing their candidates a place on that ballot.citation.california dem.party jones,d.
a significant modicum of support from eligible voters is what section,subdivision b,and section,subdivision a,are designed to ensure.and they do so in a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner.as demonstrated by the record in this case,persons listed on the inactive file of registered voters are excluded from the party qualification calculation under section,subdivision b,because information on the inactive voter list often is inaccurate with respect to eligibility to vote and often is duplicative of information on the active vot
