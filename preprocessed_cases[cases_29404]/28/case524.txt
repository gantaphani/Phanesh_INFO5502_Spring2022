relevant factual and procedural history 
on november,the city council adopted ordinance,entitled hotel worker living wage ordinance wage ordinance the ordinance set minimum wage standards that exceeded california minimum wage requirements for certain hotel workers employed within the gateway to los angeles century corridor property business improvement district pbid,which abuts los angeles international airport.under the ordinance,hotels within the pbid that contained or more guest rooms were obliged to pay at least per hour to workers who received health benefits,and at least per hour to workers who did not receive health benefits.
the wage ordinance was opposed by are a group of hotel operators within the pbid and individual other parties,including the los angeles chamber of commerce chamber of commerce whereas respondents objected to the imposition of special minimum wage requirements on a relatively small number of hotels,the chamber of commerce primary concern was that similar requirements would eventually be imposed on other businesses.on december,respondents submitted a referendum petition against the wage ordinance containing signatures.on january,appellant frank martinez,the city clerk of the city of los angeles,certified that the petition satisfied the requirements of the los angeles city charter.this certification obliged the city council to submit the wage ordinance to a popular vote or repeal it.throughout the remainder of january,members of the city council and other city officials met with opponents of the ordinance and other interested parties in an effort to devise a new ordinance that would resolve the opposition to the wage ordinance.
on january,the city council repealed the wage ordinance.on february,it approved ordinance,entitled airport hospitality enhancement zone ordinance zone ordinance the ordinance designated the area bounded by the pbid as a hospitality enhancement zone,and committed the city of los angeles city to make a number of improvements within the zone.the city declared that it would perform in street improvements,conduct a study into ways of attracting new businesses,and create a program that would train workers per year for positions in hotels and restaurants in addition,it promised to investigate a reduction in business taxes,the creation of a new recycling and waste diversion program,and the construction of a convention center and remote hotel facilities.
the zone ordinance also set minimum wage requirements for hotel workers identical to those found in the wage ordinance,but mandated their implementation by phases,and delayed full implementation until january.in addition,the zone ordinance permitted a hotel to avoid the wage requirements if it showed that the requirements were significantly burdensome or that its workers had agreed in a collective bargaining agreement to waive the requirements.the ordinance contained a commitment from the city that it would not impose wage requirements on other businesses absent further study.
on february,respondents filed their petition for mandamus and injunctive relief against the city council,frank martinez,in his official capacity as city clerk of the city of los angeles,and rockard delgadillo,in his official capacity as city attorney of the city of los angeles.the petition contended that the city council conduct in connection with the zone ordinance contravened their rights regarding referenda and initiatives under the california constitution.it also sought an injunction to prevent martinez from giving effect to the zone ordinance by publishing it on february,judge dzintra janavs issued an alternative writ of mandate and order to show cause,and directed martinez to refrain from publishing the zone ordinance.judge janavs subsequently permitted appellant unite here local local to intervene in the action.after local exercised a peremptory challenge to judge janavs,the action was transferred to judge david yaffe.following a hearing on may,judge yaffe granted the petition,and judgment was entered on may.this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting the petition.we agree.
governing principles 
the key issues before us concern whether the city council properly approved the zone ordinance after repealing the wage ordinance in the face of respondents certified referendum petition.the referendum is the means by which the electorate is entitled,as a power reserved by it under our state constitution,to approve or reject measures passed by a legislative body.cal,art.ii,subd.a,art.iv,empire waste management town of windsor th,d.under the referendum provisions of the california constitution,the electors may approve or reject statutes except urgency statutes,statutes calling elections,and statutes providing for tax levies or appropriations for usual current expenses of the state.cal,art.ii,subd.a see former cal,art.iv.as characterized by our supreme court in associated home builders,city of livermore cal d,associated home builders the amendment of the california constitution in to provide for the initiative and referendum signifies one of the outstanding achievements of the progressive movement of the early.fn.omitted.drafted in light of the theory that all power of government ultimately resides in the people,the amendment speaks of the initiative and referendum,not as a right granted the people,but as a power reserved by them.
shortly after the amendment,the court in in re stratham,stratham concluded that when an ordinance which has been suspended by a referendum has been repealed by a municipal council,the council can not enact another ordinance in all essential features like the repealed ordinance the council may,however,deal further with the subject matter of the suspended ordinance,by enacting an ordinance essentially different from the ordinance protested against,avoiding,perhaps,the objections made to the first ordinance.if this be done,not in bad faith,and not with intent to evade the effect of the referendum petition,the second ordinance should not be held invalid for this cause.citations.id.at.subsequently,several courts have followed or endorsed this rule.see assembly deukmejian cal d,assembly gilbert ashley d,gilbert martin smith d.martin reagan city of sausalito d.reagan lindelli town of san anselmo th,d lindelli.here,appellants contend that the city council is not subject to the rule first articulated in stratham,and alternatively,that the trial court incorrectly determined that the zone ordinance was in all essential features like the wage ordinance stratham,supra.at.as we elaborate below,these contentions present questions regarding the interpretation of the california constitution and municipal ordinances that we resolve de novo.see lindelli,supra,th at,d.
applicability of the stratham rule 
appellants contend that the stratham rule does not govern the city council actions because the city is a charter city.they argue that the california constitution does not impose the stratham rule on charter cities,that charter cities fall outside the scope of election code section,which subjects general law cities to the rule,and that the city charter itself does not authorize the rule.
in our view,the california constitution subjects the city council to the stratham rule.in associated home builders,our supreme court stated declaring it the duty of the courts to jealously guard this right of the people citation,the courts have described the initiative and referendum as articulating one of the most precious rights of our democratic process.citation.i t has long been our judicial policy to apply a liberal construction to this power wherever it is challenged in order that the right be not improperly annulled.if doubts can reasonably be resolved in favor of the use of this reserve power,courts will preserve it.citations.associated home builders,supra,cal d at.in light of these principles,as explained below,we conclude that the constitution imposes the stratham rule on charter cities,notwithstanding the absence of an express provision addressing this matter.see former cal,art.iv,cal,art.ii,art.iv.
a charter city is constitutionally entitled to exercise exclusive authority over all matters deemed to be municipal affairs.cal,art.xi.devita county of napa cal th,d.the city of los angeles became a charter city prior to the amendment to the constitution reserving the right of initiative and referendum to electors.see davies city of los angeles cal.although the amendment provided that the right was,it authorized the legislature to establish procedures for the exercise of the right,but exempted charter cities from the operation of any such statutes.ibid.former cal,art.iv.revisions to the amendment have not altered the substance of these provisions.see associated home builders,supra,cal d at fn,rossi brown cal th,fn,d,midway orchards county of butte d.cal,subd.a.
under these provisions,charter cities can not deny their citizens the referendum powers reserved in the california constitution,although charters may properly reserve broader referendum powers to voters.the constitutional reservation goes to the full extent expressed by its language.if the charter differs from the constitution in any respect it does not thereby diminish the powers reserved by the constitution.on the other hand,if the powers reserved by the charter exceed those reserved in the constitution the effect of the charter would be to give to the people the additional powers there described.citations.in other words,as between the provisions of the constitution and the provisions of a city charter,those which reserve the greater or more extensive referendum power in the people will govern.rossi brown,supra,cal th at,d,quoting hunt mayor council of riverside cal d.accordingly,c harter cities may provide for the exercise of the power of referendum in any manner that does not impinge on the basic right of referendum expressed in the constitution.browne russell th,d.
the key issue,therefore,is whether the state constitution impliedly subjects charter cities to the stratham rule.our research discloses that the rule was applied twice in published decisions before the legislature enacted any statutes bearing on the rule.the first application of the rule involved the city of los angeles.in stratham,the city council enacted an ordinance in september barring taxicabs and related businesses from soliciting customers at railroad depots.stratham,supra.at.faced with a successful referendum petition challenging the ordinance,the city council repealed it.ibid.in november,the city council approved a second ordinance dealing with the same subject matter,which it characterized as an emergency measure.ibid.an individual charged with a misdemeanor under the second ordinance filed a writ of habeas corpus,contending that the city council had identified the ordinance as an emergency measure in bad faith to avoid the operation of the referendum petition.ibid.in denying the petition,the court in stratham declined to disturb the city council declaration of an emergency.id.at.moreover,pointing only to case authority,the court applied the rule in question and concluded that the ordinances were substantially different.id.at.
the second application of the stratham rule occurred in gilbert,in which the court again did not examine the rule constitutional basis.gilbert,supra,d at.there,the escondido city council enacted a business license ordinance in june that was defeated in a referendum election held in april.ibid.in december,the city council enacted a similar ordinance which nonetheless the first the funds collected constituted a tax levy for the city current expenses.ibid.the court in gilbert rejected a challenge to the second ordinance,reasoning that its status as a tax levy exempted it from the referendum provisions of the california constitution.id.at.in addition,the court concluded that the two ordinances were sufficiently different to avoid the operation of the stratham rule.id.at.
shortly after gilbert,the legislature enacted the predecessor of election code section.former,added by stats,ch.election code section,like its predecessor,applies to general law cities see,former,added by stats,ch.the provision,as adopted in and in its current form,states that a qualified referendum petition stays an ordinance pending a vote on the referendum,and that if the legislative body of a city repeals the ordinance in the face of the petition,the ordinance shall not again be enacted for a period of one year after the date of its repeal.since,appellate courts have looked to stratham and its progeny in applying this provision.martin,supra,d at.reagan,supra,d at.lindelli,supra,th at,d.
in assembly,our supreme court invoked the stratham rule in a context outside the scope of election code section.there,the court confronted challenges to referendum petitions that sought to have election district reapportionment statutes enacted by the legislature submitted to the voters for their approval.assembly,supra,cal d at.after determining that the petitions were valid,the court clarified the consequences for the legislature if the statutes were rejected through the referenda since its inception,the right of the people to express their collective will through the power of the referendum has been vigilantly protected by the courts.thus,it has been held that legislative bodies can not nullify this power by voting to enact a law identical to a recently rejected referendum measure.see gilbert,supra,d,stratham,supra.at pp.unless the new measure is essentially different from the rejected provision and is enacted not in bad faith,and not with intent to evade the effect of the referendum petition,it is invalid.citations.should the referenda here be rejected in the primary election,the legislature will be governed by these rules in fashioning new reapportionment plans for the remainder of this decade.assembly,supra,cal d at.
in view of this authority,the stratham rule must be regarded as an implied element of the constitutional provisions reserving the referendum power.because these provisions are,the courts may properly devise procedures necessary to protect the power when the appropriate legislative body fails to establish such procedures.see midway orchards county of butte,supra,d at.here,the stratham rule was applied to the city prior to the enactment of the predecessor of election code section.moreover,in assembly,the court relied on stratham in concluding that the legislature can not nullify the referendum power by enacting legislation essentially similar to that rejected in a referendum,notwithstanding the absence of a constitutional provision expressly addressing such conduct assembly,supra,cal d at.although assembly did not present the issue raised here,its rationale implies that the city council may not adopt an ordinance in contravention of the stratham rule to conclude otherwise would permit the nullification of the referendum power.absent the stratham rule,the legislative bodies of charter cities would be free to wear down opponents of ordinances,who necessarily incur the costs of collecting signatures for referendum petitions.under the judicial policy favoring a liberal construction of the referendum power,we conclude that the city council is subject to the rule.
pointing to lawing faull d.lawing,appellants contend that charter cities are exempt from the stratham rule unless they incorporate it into their charters.there,a charter city imposed the requirement in its charter that referendum petitions would be certified only if signed by percent of the voters.id.at.pointing to the judicial policy favoring the liberal construction of the referendum power,proponents of a petition challenged the requirement on the ground that it contravened former article iv,section,of the california constitution,which provided that u ntil provided by law,no legislative body could require more than percent of the electors sign a petition.lawing,supra,at.the court rejected this contention,concluding that the phrase,u ntil provided by law,expressly permitted charter cities to deviate from the requirement.id.at.here,unlike lawing,nothing in the california constitution expressly authorizes the city to exempt itself from the stratham rule.
appellants also contend that the discussion of the stratham rule in assembly is dictum,and thus does not constitute authority on the issue before us.we disagree.our supreme court dicta,though not binding upon us,command our serious respect.bunch coachella valley water dist.d.people jackson d.because the assembly dictum represents our supreme court fullest analysis of the stratham rule,we therefore follow it.manufacturers life ins.superior court cal th,d.
appellants suggest that the stratham rule is not needed to protect the referendum power because the electors,if dissatisfied with the city council conduct,are free to amend the city charter to incorporate the rule or to vote against members of the city council who seek reelection.in our view,the court in assembly impliedly rejected the notion that this avenue of expressing dissatisfaction is sufficient to preserve the referendum power,given that the voters in statewide elections are also free to amend the constitution and discharge members of the legislature.
finally,appellants contend that the stratham rule is inapplicable to charter cities because unlike election code section,the rule does not specify the period of time a charter city is prohibited from adopting the second ordinance after withdrawing the first ordinance.it is unnecessary for us to address this contention,insofar as it seeks full clarification of the pertinent time period.because the interval between the adoption of the wage ordinance and the zone ordinance is essentially equal to the analogous interval in stratham,the situation before us falls squarely under that case.stratham,supra.at.
analysis of the ordinances 
the remaining issue concerns the application of the stratham rule to the wage and zone ordinances.under the stratham rule,t he determination whether subsequent legislation is essentially the same begins with a comparison of the terms of the legislation challenged by referendum and the subsequent legislation,focusing on the features that gave rise to popular objection.lindelli,supra,th at,d.we may consult the record as a whole to identify the popular objections to the wage ordinance.see ibid.upon making this identification,we look to the language of the wage and zone ordinances to determine whether they are essentially different,and whether the city council enacted the zone ordinance not in bad faith,and not with the intent to evade the referendum petition stratham,supra.at.gilbert,supra,d at,reagan,supra,d at.moreover,every presumption is in favor of the validity of the zone ordinance.gilbert,supra,d at,accord,reagan,supra,d at.
in stratham,the first ordinance enacted by the city council prohibited taxicabs and other entities from soliciting patrons near railroad depots and within defined areas of the city,absent consent from the affected railroads and businesses,but exempted carriers who solicited passengers in certain ways from the scope of the prohibition see stratham,supra.at.the second ordinance approved by the city council expanded the areas covered by the prohibition to encompass the solicitation of passengers on boats and other common carriers it eliminated the exemption for certain forms of solicitation and it added new prohibitions against the solicitation of patronage upon any public street in a loud,noisy,boisterous manner,along with other forms of interference with individuals and their baggage.the ordinance also contained a declaration that absent the measure,the general public,but especially the traveling public arriving in the city by rail and otherwise,will be greatly annoyed,inconvenienced and harassed and their comfort,safety,welfare and health endangered the court in stratham held that the two ordinances differ ed from each other,not merely in phraseology,but in substance relating to matters of importance,and that nothing in the second ordinance suggested bad faith.id.at.
in gilbert,the second ordinance,like the first,imposed a business license assessment,but unlike its predecessor,contained a declaration that it constituted a tax levy for the usual current expenses moreover,it differed from the first ordinance because it imposed a dissimilar tax rate,dealt with a new tax year,and contained novel exemption and enforcement provisions.gilbert,supra,d at.the court concluded that it was unlike the first ordinance in all its essential features and provisions,and lacked any trace of bad faith.id.at.
again,in reagan,the city council of sausalito enacted two ordinances committing it to buy waterfront property from a nonprofit private corporation and then lease a portion of the property to the corporation,which planned to allow recreational activities on it.reagan,supra,d at.faced with a referendum petition challenging the ordinances,the city council repealed them and enacted a third ordinance authorizing the use of city revenues to purchase the property for use as a public recreation area.ibid.because the third ordinance lacked any reference to a lease involving the corporation,the court in reagan concluded that it was essentially different from the first two ordinances,and displayed no evidence of bad faith.ibid.
in contrast with stratham,gilbert,and reagan,the court reached a contrary conclusion in martin.there,the city of sausalito owned waterfront property subject to a lease.martin,supra,d at.in april,the city council of sausalito adopted an ordinance permitting a sublease of the property until.ibid.after a referendum petition concerning the ordinance was presented to the city council,it repealed the ordinance and approved a second ordinance identical to the first,except that it terminated the sublease in,changed the rental fee of the lease,and included another parcel of land in the lease.id.at.the court held that the ordinances were essentially the same under the stratham rule,reasoning that the new features in the second ordinance did not address the objectionable aspects of the first ordinance,which it identified as the character of the sublease.id.at.the court stated no one will contend that the voters signing the referendum petition were doing so because of the extra period in the terms of the leases.undoubtedly the voters were concerned with the fundamental principle of the resolutions,namely,the leasing of city property for the commercial purposes specified in the resolutions.that principle was identical in the resolutions.id.at,d.
similarly,in lindelli,the town council of san anselmo passed an ordinance awarding a contract to a waste management company.lindelli,supra,th at,d.confronted with a certified referendum petition challenging the ordinance,the town council set the vote on the referendum for the earliest permissible election date and awarded a interim contract to the waste management company prior to the election.lindelli,supra,th at,d.applying the stratham rule,the court concluded that the interim contract contravened the stay provisions of election code section because the two contracts differed only in the length of their terms.lindelli,supra,at,d.
we conclude that the ordinances before us are as distinct as those at issue in stratham,gilbert,and reagan.although the referendum petition circulated by respondents does not recite specific objections to the wage ordinance,the record contains undisputed evidence establishing that the ordinance was subject to two challenges respondents objected to the economic burden imposed by the wage ordinance because it mandated higher minimum wage requirements on hotels near the los angeles international airport,whereas the chamber of commerce objected to the prospect that similar requirements would be imposed elsewhere.
the zone ordinance contains substantive provisions that address the economic burdens of the wage requirements and the potential for their imposition outside the pbid.to offset the effe
