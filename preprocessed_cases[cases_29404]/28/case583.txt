these two separate declaratory relief actions were brought by the city of san diego the city and the limited partnership which owns the san diego padres professional baseball team,padres,the padres against two individuals,michael kane dunkl and philip zoebisch collectively referred to as the proponents,who began in november to circulate a proposed initiative which would have made certain negative findings concerning an earlier city ordinance,proposition c prop.c.prop.c was adopted by city voters in november to enable funding and construction of the downtown ballpark redevelopment project pursuant to a memorandum of understanding mou between the city,its redevelopment agency,the padres and others.
the city and the padres sought judicial declarations that the proposed initiative,commonly known as the ballpark initiative referred to here as the proposed initiative,was invalid and should not be placed on the ballot even if adequate signatures for that purpose were obtained.these actions were coordinated in the superior court and resulted in summary judgments in favor of the city and the padres,the moving parties below.the basis of the summary judgment rulings was that the proposed initiative was invalid and should not be placed on the ballot for an upcoming election,because it sought to enact measures that were beyond the power of the voters to adopt.specifically,the findings that the proposed initiative sought to enact were not legislative in character but rather were administrative measures properly within the domain of the city administration.
the proponents of the proposed initiative appeal the summary judgments and also the related rulings of the superior court that found their related motions to strike the complaints under code of civil procedure section,the slapp motions must be taken off calendar as moot in view of the city and the padres successful summary judgment motions.these two appeals have been consolidated in this court for oral argument and decision.the proponents argue that the trial court erred as a matter of law in characterizing the proposed initiative as failing to meet the criteria for a permissible ballot measure that was legislative in character.the proponents also argue that the rulings that the slapp motions were moot were erroneous and represent an impermissible chilling of their constitutional rights to petition the government for redress of grievances.
on de novo review of the summary judgments,we find that review of the proposed initiative was appropriately carried out and that the superior court reached the correct legal conclusions in granting summary judgment to the city and the padres on their requests for declaratory relief that the proposed initiative was invalid.we further conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the slapp motions to strike were moot once the padres and the city prevailed on the legal questions presented for resolution in the summary judgment proceedings.it is well accepted that review of ballot measures is appropriate where the validity of a proposal is in serious question,and where the matter can be resolved as a matter of law before unnecessary expenditures of time and effort have been placed into a futile election campaign.senate of the state of cal.jones cal th,d.there is no constitutional right to place an invalid initiative on the ballot.see,san francisco nishioka th,d.that was the case here,and no inappropriate restriction of the proponents constitutional rights occurred under these circumstances.we affirm the summary judgments and underlying rulings for the reasons explained below.
factual and procedural background 
in november,the city voters approved prop.c by approximately a percentage margin,authorizing the city to enter into an mou with,in particular,the padres prop.c and the mou it authorizes provide for a partnership between the padres,the city and redevelopment entities to build a new major league ballpark as part of a larger redevelopment project in centre city east in downtown san diego sometimes called the project.prop.c states that its purpose and that of the mou it authorized are to constitute legislative acts establishing policy for the city on these matters,and further to provide the ways and means to implement such policy by any necessary and appropriate administrative and nonlegislative acts that will carry out the purpose and intent of the ordinance.prop.c also authorizes the city council to amend or modify the mou,in the best interests of the city entities,only if any such amendment or modifications do not materially decrease the rights or increase the obligations of the city increase the financial commitments of the city or decrease revenue to the city.the city may carry out the mou and associated agreements if they are in the best interests of the city,with respect to the same three criteria.
under the mou,the redevelopment project will proceed as long as the city finds several conditions subsequent have been met.on march,the city council issued written findings based on testimony and other evidence that several of the conditions subsequent specifically set forth in the mou had been satisfied.these findings recited that the city had determined it would be feasible to complete land acquisition,environmental approvals,parking facilities and infrastructure,and the padres had made the necessary assurances regarding the private development that would be completed in association with the redevelopment and ballpark project,including a hotel project.however,other mou conditions still remained to be satisfied at the times covered by this record,including the crucial requirement that the city be assured it and its redevelopment agency will be able to obtain financing for the city million investment in the ballpark on reasonably acceptable terms and on a fully basis.
in november,the proponents published and filed with the city clerk their notice of intent to circulate the proposed initiative.after the required waiting period,the proponents began to gather voter signatures the proposed initiative as circulated has the stated purpose of determining on behalf of the city,through its voters,that as of november,certain contingencies and conditions subsequent affecting obligations of the city set forth in various provisions of the mou have failed,are unsatisfied,or are defeated by nonperformance.proposed initiative,subd.a all further references to the proposed initiative are to section and subdivision in abbreviated fashion.the proposed initiative further states that it shall have the effect of terminating as of november,any contingent obligations of the city,pursuant to the related determination that the conditions subsequent have failed,subd.b.the proposed initiative would further have provided that reinstatement or creation of similar obligations of the city which are terminated by this proposition shall require a vote of the people in an election held for that purpose,subd.c.
other key sections of the proposed initiative are section,the findings and declarations section,and section,entitled exercise of city discretion.section,subdivisions a and b express disapproval of the expenditures anticipated by the mou and of the hotel proposal as too risky.section,subdivision c states the intent of the voters to establish,through the proposed initiative,policy for the city and its implementation by such administrative and acts as may be necessary and appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of proposition c and the mou.under section,subdivision d,the voters shall directly exercise the discretion of the city to implement the mou in the best interests of the city.
section of the proposed initiative then sets forth a list of the specific conditions subsequent and contingencies that the initiative would have deemed unsatisfied or failed if not completed or waived by city council action on or before november,thus having the effect of terminating all obligations of the city under the mou.these allegedly unsatisfied conditions include the city ability to obtain financing on reasonably acceptable terms,the temporary extension of the padres use and occupancy at qualcomm stadium,the profitability of the project for purposes of generating taxes,and the obtaining of adequate financing and security for the investments.section,subdivision e states that the adoption of the proposed initiative would establish,retroactive to november,such policy and implementation that would carry out the purposes and intent of the proposed initiative and the mou.
the proposed initiative includes a severability clause,and also states that the proponents of the initiative the individuals dunkl and zoebisch shall be included among any defendants in any judicial challenge to any provision of the proposed initiative.
on january,about six weeks after the period commenced,the city and the padres filed these declaratory relief actions,challenging the validity of the proposed initiative and also seeking injunctive relief against its continued circulation.the superior court coordinated the actions.the proponents immediately noticed special motions to strike the complaints as slapp suits under section et they contended that their constitutionally protected activities of petitioning the government and free speech were being jeopardized by the existence of the actions.
the city and the padres promptly sought an order shortening time to place their summary judgment motions on calendar as companion matters.they contended that the existence of the proposed initiative was jeopardizing funding for the ballpark project,and hence review of the proposed initiative was appropriate.the trial court set the summary judgment hearing for february.it set the slapp motions for hearing on february,but took them under submission and ruled on all the motions at once.in its summary judgment reply papers,the city retreated from its request for an injunction,on the basis that the proponents had conceded the initiative was dead if found invalid by the court.the proponents evidently had no apparent intent to present a void initiative to the city clerk for certification to be placed on the ballot.the padres also did not further pursue injunctive relief.
at the hearings on the motions,the proponents argued their motions to strike should be granted because of a potential chilling effect on the initiative process if individual proponents could be sued.they argued the city clerk would be a more appropriate defendant.they also argued that the city and the padres were guilty of unreasonable delay or laches because they did not sue until after the end of the waiting period after the publication and filing of the notice of intent to circulate the petition.san diego sdmc,time to begin circulating initiative petition.the city and the padres responded that they had acted promptly and the waiting period was meant only to ensure that the city could enact the same matter as in the proposed initiative if it desired,but there was no such desire here.they denied that any unconstitutional restraint of speech was going on rather,the pursuit of the actions was justified due to the highly regulated nature of election activity.the padres further argued that the content of the proposed initiative would amount to unconstitutional impairment of its contract rights,and also claimed voter fraud by the misleading nature of the proposed initiative.
in ruling on the motions,the superior court declined to address the argument that the proposed initiative was illegal due to misrepresentation of its purpose or the issue of any illegal impairment of contract.the court ruling first stated that review of ballot measures,while rarely undertaken,is appropriate where the validity of the proposed measure is in serious controversy.the court focused its analysis upon section of the proposed initiative,which stated its purpose to be a finding that certain contingencies and conditions subsequent affecting the obligations of the city as set forth in the mou had failed,were unsatisfied,or were defeated by nonperformance.the court stated that the factual findings contained in the proposed initiative,which purported to carry out the purpose and intent of prop.c and the mou and to exercise the city discretion as allowed by the mou,would actually be findings such as those that are typically made by a governing entity in an administrative decision.the court found such in an initiative to be impermissible,and ruled that the proposed initiative made only administrative decisions that would have undermined a measure previously adopted by the voters.the court then stated that in light of its rulings,the slapp motions were moot.
summary judgments were entered in favor of the city and the padres.these timely appeals followed and have been consolidated by stipulation for oral argument and decision in this court,subd.a,subd.j.immediately after filing their notices of appeal,the proponents brought writ petitions in this court to challenge the denial of or refusal to rule on the slapp motions.the petitions were summarily denied.
discussion 
iissues presented 
both the summary judgments and the underlying slapp rulings are on review in this matter.the city and the padres regard the summary judgments as dispositive,while the proponents of the proposed initiative contend that the slapp issues are the real key to this case and should not have been ruled to be moot due to the summary judgments issuance.all the issues are closely interrelated.under the procedural mechanism set out by the slapp statute,section,subdivision b,the court may strike a cause of action against a person that fits within the slapp parameters as arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person constitutional right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
where,as here,the plaintiffs declaratory relief actions present purely legal questions about the validity of the subject matter of the lawsuits,by way of a challenge to a proposed ballot measure,the slapp issue of whether the plaintiffs are more probably than not going to prevail in their actions may appropriately be determined by the use of related summary judgment proceedings,subd.b.the question here is not whether the defendant proponents are likely to prevail in their defense of the measure.under the slapp statute,the question is whether the plaintiffs who are challenging the ballot measure are likely to prevail at trial or at pretrial motion proceedings.
accordingly,within the slapp framework,the trial court did not err in addressing the summary judgment issues first to determine whether the plaintiffs city and the padres were likely to prevail in their challenge,subd.b.however,here,as in the trial court,due to the intertwined nature of the pending motions,it is necessary to consider the procedural questions raised in connection with both the slapp and summary judgment motions simultaneously,before drawing any final conclusions.we do so below.
first,however,we reiterate the nature of the rule that it is proper to conduct review of a claim that a proposed measure may not properly be submitted to the voters because,for example,the measure is not appropriately legislative in character.senate of the state of cal.jones,supra,cal th,d,citing american federation of labor eu cal d,which granted relief when an initiative measure violated a federal constitutional provision and also exceeded the scope of the initiative power.
in light of this rule,and because only legal questions are presented on an undisputed set of facts giving rise to the summary judgment motions,we may properly proceed to examine the procedural and substantive issues raised with respect to the validity of the proposed initiative.there is no threat to the proponents constitutional rights under the first amendment or the california constitution in this process,because where there is a legitimate question raised about the power of the voters to adopt a proposed initiative,the supreme court has stated there is no value in putting before the people a measure which they have no power to enact.american federation of labor eu,supra,cal d at.rather,t he presence of an invalid measure on the ballot steals attention,time and money from the numerous valid propositions on the same ballot.it will confuse some voters and frustrate others,and an ultimate decision that the measure is invalid,coming after the voters have voted in favor of the measure,tends to denigrate the legitimate use of the initiative procedure.see also citizens for responsible behavior superior court th,d.accordingly,before the slapp issues can be finally determined,the facial validity of the proposed initiative must be resolved.
summary judgment and related slapp issues 
in evaluating the propriety of a grant of summary judgment our review is de novo,and we independently review the record before the trial court.citation.in practical effect,we assume the role of a trial court and apply the same rules and standards which govern a trial court determination of a motion for summary judgment.citation.lenane continental maritime of san diego,th,d.section,subdivision c provides that a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show there is no triable issue as to any material fact such that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
where the trial court grants summary judgment solely upon the basis of its interpretation of statutory and case law,i t is well settled that the interpretation and application of a statutory scheme to an undisputed set of facts is a question of law citation which is subject to de novo review on appeal.citation.rudd california casualty ins.d.in such a case,the appellate court is not bound by the trial court interpretation.california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.
our first task will be to focus upon the preliminary procedural issues raised by appellants in their challenges to both the summary judgments and the underlying slapp rulings.we shall then turn to the substantive arguments about the validity of the proposed initiative,and finally return to the slapp rulings.
procedural issues 
in attacking both the summary judgments and the slapp rulings,the proponents argue they were not properly named defendants in the action,and the city clerk would have been a more appropriate and a more traditional defendant to have been named,based on other election challenge cases.see,senate of the state of cal.jones,supra,cal th,d,san francisco nishioka,supra,th,d.the proponents base this argument both on traditional constitutional protections of the right to petition the government for redress,and on their reading of the sdmc.neither of these arguments is well taken.first,their citation to city of long beach bozek cal d,bozek is inapposite.that case dealt with whether governmental entities may sue private citizens for malicious prosecution.in holding this is not permissible,the supreme court discussed the paramount importance of protecting the constitutionally guaranteed right to petition the government for the redress of legitimate grievances,citing,cal,art.i.the court also noted there were other available remedies for governmental entities to regain costs and expenses expended in defending baseless claims.bozek,supra,cal d at.nothing in bozek prevents a public or private entity from seeking,in an otherwise authorized action,a judicial declaration of the invalidity of a proposed ballot measure,even where private citizens are the proponents of same.
nor is the proponents citation to smith silvey d.well taken.that case determined an injunction could not issue under section where its effect was to prevent the person enjoined from contacting government agencies,and also interfered with his exercise of his rights to free speech and to petition for redress of grievances.this case is distinguishable because no injunctive relief was issued here and it was within the power of the court to consider the declaratory relief requests in ruling on these challenges of ballot measures.election procedure is a highly regulated area and does not constitute pure expressive speech,which must be afforded a higher level of protection.san francisco nishioka,supra,th at,d.
the proponents also claim that the only known california case which directly granted relief against proponents of an initiative,city of atascadero daly d,should be distinguished from this case because there was a stipulation of the parties in that case that a controversy existed,by which they submitted the validity of the ordinance to determination by the trial court.the issue there was whether a proposed ordinance could properly require the city to submit any measure to the voters for their approval before the measure could be implemented.id.at.the court thus had to decide whether the initiative process should be available for the purpose of enacting the ordinance,and decided it was not.ibid.the proponents here are incorrect that the trial court in that case derived its power to decide the controversy between the parties from their stipulation.rather,subject matter jurisdiction was already present in view of the authority that allows challenges to determine the validity of the proposed initiative.also,the proper parties were before the court to enable it to afford appropriate relief,subd.a.
accordingly,where the issue has been placed before the court of whether a proposal is lawful and may be placed on the ballot for the voters consideration,the courts have the power and the duty to order that the measure is not qualified for the ballot if the measure is found to be beyond the power of the voters to enact.american federation of labor eu,supra,cal d at,citizens for responsible behavior superior court,supra,th at,d.there is no bar to naming the proponents as defendants where appropriate.
there are two additional reasons why these defendants were properly named parties in this action.first,section of the proposed initiative states that these individuals shall be named as defendants in any judicial challenge to the measure,and that is what occurred.there is nothing in the proposed initiative to support the proponents claim that this portion was only to go into effect if the proponents were successful in placing the measure on the ballot and in obtaining its approval from the voters.rather,these defendants were properly named because they were the proponents of the measure and had the necessary interest in the subject matter to be named as parties,such that complete relief could be obtained by naming them as parties,subd.a.
moreover,under the election procedure set forth in the sdmc,it would have been premature to name the city clerk as a defendant,because sdmc section only requires the city clerk to accept a petition to place an initiative on the ballot if it is in substantial compliance with the requirements for the appropriate number of signatures and format.here,the proposed initiative never got to that point,and the duties of the city clerk to process it further were never implicated,such that the city clerk would have been a necessary or appropriate party.sdmc,et under sdmc section and,the proponents role is to prepare the petition and then submit it to the city clerk,once the required number of signatures has been obtained.the proponents are appropriate defendants under these circumstances.
next,the proponents complain that the city and the padres are not proper plaintiffs in these actions,because sdmc section permits challenges to ballot measures to be made by voters,and the city and the padres are not voters.this objection is meritless because a voter challenge under sdmc section is not the sole avenue of relief for a party who seeks to demonstrate that a proposed ballot measure is beyond the powers of the voters to adopt.rather,such a question of law may be raised by a nonvoter seeking declaratory relief under section as to the respective rights and duties of the parties and the construction of a written instrument,where the validity of a ballot measure is concerned.see,senate of the state of california jones,supra,cal th at,d.
the proponents have raised two more procedural issues that warrant brief discussion before we address the merits.first,on appeal,they contend the city and the padres actions should be held equitably ba
