james schrader received the nomination of the libertarian party of ohio to be its candidate for the united states house of representatives from the seventh congressional district of ohio in the general elections.schrader filed a nominating petition with the clark county board of elections that contained signatures,a number sufficient under ohio law to secure his place on the ballot.the libertarian party of ohio,however,had not met the requirements to be recognized as a political party in ohio at that time.as a result,ohio law prohibited schrader from designating his affiliation with the libertarian party as a partisan cue on the ballot.
schrader,the libertarian party,and bruce wilson,a voter,filed an action under against ohio secretary of state and the clark county board of elections to designate schrader as a libertarian on the ballot,claiming that the ohio statute violated the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.the district court held for schrader,declaring that the ohio statute prohibiting voting cues for unqualified political parties was unconstitutional.the state of ohio now challenges that decision.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
background 
ohio election laws pertaining to voting cues 
at issue in this appeal are two sections of the ohio revised code that combine to regulate how eligible candidates appear on the ballot.the first describes the ballot format.see ohio.voting cues,which are descriptions of political affiliation,are allowed under this section,but only for candidates of political parties that are recognized under ohio law.under the name of each candidate nominated at a primary election and each candidate certified by a party committee shall be printed,in less prominent type face than that in which the candidate name is printed,the name of the political party by which the candidate was nominated or certified.id.
the second relevant section defines a political party under ohio law.see ohio.a political party is any group of voters that,at the most recent regular state election,polled for its candidate for governor in the state or nominees for presidential electors at least five per cent of the entire vote cast for that office or that filed with the secretary of state.id.if,however,a new political party seeks to become qualified,then it must file a petition signed by qualified electors equal in number to at least one per cent of the total vote for governor or nominees for presidential electors at the most recent election,declaring their intention of organizing a political party,the name of which shall be stated in the declaration,and of participating in the succeeding primary election,held in years,that occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the date of filing.id.as a result,a candidate must be the nominee of a qualified party as defined under ohio revised code in order to obtain a partisan cue on the ballot pursuant to ohio revised code.an independent candidate for election to an office,in contrast,must simply file a statement of candidacy and a nominating petition with the requisite number of signatures.see ohio.
in sum,all candidates listed on the ohio ballot must gain access either as the nominee of a qualified political party,through the procedure,or as a member of a previously unqualified political party that obtains enough signatures to become a political party as defined in ohio revised code.both schrader and the ohio attorney general agree that ohio revised code was properly interpreted to deny schrader,and other future candidates who,like him,are members of unqualified political parties,a partisan cue on the ballot.
ohio election laws have been the subject of constitutional scrutiny in several prior cases.one is williams rhodes,d declaring ohio scheme that required a new party to collect the signatures of percent of the electors in the previous gubernatorial election unconstitutional because it was so restrictive,and because it effectively provided the democratic and republican parties with a complete monopoly.another is anderson celebrezze,d striking down ohio early deadline for independent candidates to file a statement of candidacy and a nominating petition as an unconstitutional burden on the voting and associational rights of their supporters.more recently,however,this court has upheld the signature requirement of ohio procedure under ohio revised code,finding that the burden of obtaining the signatures of one percent of the qualified electors in the last gubernatorial election is not unconstitutionally burdensome.see miller lorain county bd.of elections,cir.
the specific sections at issue in schrader case,and,were scrutinized by this court in rosen brown,cir.in particular,the plaintiff in rosen challenged the failure of to allow the cue of independent to be used for candidates who gain access to the ballot through the procedure.this court held that was unconstitutional because it violates the first and fourteenth amendment rights of independent candidates to be so designated on ohio general election ballots.rosen,at.
despite this court ruling in rosen,the ohio legislature reenacted in without any changes to the portion of the statute that deals with voting cues on the ballot.schrader is thus challenging the same language in ohio revised code that this court struck down independent candidates in rosen.at oral argument,however,counsel for the state noted that ohio regularly follows rosen,even though the relevant portion of the statute has not changed.it does so by informally asking candidates who gain access to the ballot through the procedure whether they wish to have the cue independent affiliated with their names on the ballot.
schrader notes that as a result of the connection between and,a previously unqualified party that wishes to place a candidate on the ballot with the party voting cue must file the requisite number of signatures approximately one year before the general election.this results in an earlier filing deadline for candidates of unqualified political parties than for independent candidates.the discrepancy in the timing of the filing deadlines,however,was not raised as an issue on appeal and is therefore not before us.schrader obtained access to the ballot under the procedure,and his only challenge is to the constitutionality of ohio system under.
procedural history of the libertarian party of ohio challenge to the ohio ballot scheme 
the libertarian party of ohio was formed in and is the ohio affiliate of the national libertarian party,founded in colorado in.it obtained the status of a political party as defined under ohio revised code in,and was therefore eligible for a voting cue on the ballot that year as permitted by ohio revised code.the libertarians failed to poll at least five percent of the voters in the election,however,thus losing their status as a recognized political party.not until november of year after the events in the libertarian party of ohio again succeed in obtaining enough signatures to qualify as a political party on the ballot.
on april,the libertarian party of ohio held its annual convention in akron.among other items of business,it nominated schrader as its candidate for the united states house of representatives from the seventh congressional district.schrader had been circulating petitions to obtain the requisite signatures to be placed on the ballot prior to the convention.because he was applying through the procedure,schrader needed to collect at least valid signatures,a number equal to one percent of the voters who participated in the last gubernatorial election in the seventh congressional district.schrader used official forms prepared by the state of ohio for use by independent candidates.directly above the statement of candidacy heading on each nominating petition,however,schrader typed this additional statement james schrader is the nominee of the libertarian party.on april,schrader submitted petitions containing signatures to the clark county board of elections.
because schrader met the requirements of the procedure,the board of elections placed him on the ballot as an independent candidate.on july,schrader sent a letter to bob taft,then the ohio secretary of state,requesting that schrader receive the voting cue of libertarian on the ballot.schrader duly noted in his letter that the state had failed to amend the relevant portion of ohio revised code,despite its having been declared unconstitutional by rosen.secretary taft did not respond to schrader request.schrader,wilson,and the libertarian party of ohio then filed a complaint on august,in the district court,requesting injunctive and declaratory relief.
after schrader filed an amended complaint,both parties moved for summary judgment.on september,the district court entered a preliminary injunction directing the secretary of state to place the designation libertarian after schrader name on the ballot.schrader received votes,or percent of the votes cast in the race for the seventh congressional district,with the voting cue of libertarian appearing on the ballot in november of.
following the election,the district court allowed the parties to file supplemental briefs and renewed motions for summary judgment.determining that the issue was not moot,because it was capable of repetition,yet evading review,rosen brown,cir,the district court entered an order granting schrader motion for summary judgment and denying ohio motion.the district court concluded that ohio denial of a partisan voting cue for schrader,and for other candidates like schrader who are members of unqualified political parties,is a violation of the first and fourteenth amendments.
in this appeal,the ohio secretary of state contends that the district court erred in holding that the reenacted version of ohio revised code is unconstitutional.ohio specifically argues that the sixth circuit precedent of rosen does not extend to this case,because the state interests in regulating candidates is inherently greater than its interests in regulating independent candidates.furthermore,ohio maintains that its legitimate interest in regulating elections and controlling the recognition of political parties outweighs any encroachment on the associational and equal protection rights of schrader and the libertarian party of ohio.
ii.analysis 
framework for analysis 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see,holloway brush,cir.summary judgment is proper when there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in deciding a motion for summary judgment,the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the judge is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.a genuine issue for trial exists only when there is sufficient evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.id.at.
in determining the constitutionality of election laws,the balancing test set forth in anderson celebrezze,d,must be applied.anderson directs courts to proceed as follows 
a court must first consider the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate.it then must identify and evaluate the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.in passing judgment,the court must not only determine the legitimacy and strength of each of those interests it also must consider the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff rights.only after weighing all these factors is the reviewing court in a position to decide whether the challenged provision is unconstitutional.
at.the supreme court has subsequently recognized,however,that if a state election law subjects the first and fourteenth amendment rights of participants in the political process to severe restrictions,the regulation must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.burdick takushi,d holding that hawaii prohibition of voting was not a severe restriction that infringed upon its citizens rights under the first and fourteenth amendments citation omitted.as the district court found and the following analysis will show,the burden placed on schrader and the libertarian party of ohio was not so severe as to trigger the review as outlined in burdick.we will therefore focus on the application of the anderson balancing test to schrader challenge to ohio revised code.
b.the district court failed to give sufficient weight to the state interest in regulating elections when applying the anderson balancing test 
in applying the anderson balancing test to schrader claim,the district court concluded that the interests put forward by ohio were not so compelling as to override the first and fourteenth amendment rights of schrader and other similarly situated candidates of unqualified political parties.the district court therefore declared ohio revised code unconstitutional.challenging this decision,ohio contends that the district court mistakenly relied on this court decision in rosen in assessing the extent to which the ohio election laws deprived schrader and the libertarian party of ohio of their first and fourteenth amendment rights.furthermore,ohio argues that the district court gave insufficient weight to the state interest in regulating elections when evaluating the balance of interests under the anderson test.the following analysis of the competing burdens and interests under the anderson balancing test will assess these claims.
the first step of the anderson test requires us to examine the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments.see anderson,at.no one challenges the basic principle that the united states constitution protects the rights of those involved in the political process.as stated by the supreme court in eu san francisco county democratic cent,d 
it is well settled that partisan political organizations enjoy freedom of association protected by the first and fourteenth amendments freedom of association means not only that an individual voter has the right to associate with the political party of her choice,but also that a political party has a right to identify the people who constitute the association,and to select a standard bearer who best represents the party ideologies and preferences.
id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,the first amendment rights of voters and political parties are protected from unequal regulatory burdens under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.see williams rhodes,d.
in the present case,the district court relied on this court decision in rosen brown,cir,to determine that ohio revised code violated schrader and the libertarian party of ohio first and fourteenth amendment rights.the court in rosen heard testimony from two political scientists and a marketing and communications professional to the effect that party identification and the indication of a candidate party affiliation on a ballot in the form of a voting cue play a crucial role in a voter actions at the climactic moment of choice in an election.rosen,at.because provides cues only for candidates of qualified political parties,it did not allow for the designation of independent as a voting cue for those who gained access to the ballot through the procedure.
this law,rosen concluded,infringes upon the right of supporters of independent candidates to meaningfully vote and meaningfully associate by providing a voting cue to democratic and republican candidates but not to independent candidates.id.at.furthermore,the court held that the statute violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because it places unequal burdens on independent and candidates and is designed to give democrats and republicans a decided advantage at the polls in a general election.id.at.expanding on rosen analysis,the district court determined that the associational interests of schrader and the libertarian party of ohio to
