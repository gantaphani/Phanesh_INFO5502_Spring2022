factual and procedural background 
city of glendale governance.
the city is governed by a city charter.article iv,section of the charter provides that city council members are compensated.article vi of the charter contains provisions regarding t he council generally and in section specifies how a vacancy on the city council must be filled,providing,a ny vacancy occurring in the council shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining members of the council.the person appointed serves until the next local or statewide election,whichever is earlier.in the event an appointment is not made within days of the vacancy,a special election must be held.in the same article,section section captioned,councilmembers holding other city offices provides a councilmember shall not hold any other city office or city employment except as authorized by state law or ordinarily necessary in the performance of the duties of a councilmember.no former councilmember shall hold any compensated city office or city employment until two years after leaving the office of councilmember.
prior to its enactment via proposed charter amendment jj,section read no members of the council shall be eligible to any office or employment,except an elective office,during the term for which he was elected.the neutral analysis in the ballot pamphlet for amendment jj explained the amendment was designed to clarify that the ban on employment in section applied only to city employment not to other outside employment.the argument in favor of the amendment similarly stated this amendment clarifies the language in the present charter which leaves in question the right of councilpersons to be employed while on the council.it clearly states that a council member may not hold another city office nor may a council member use his influence to obtain employment with the city until two years after leaving his council office.the argument against the amendment emphasized the valuable experience a council member could provide to the city in other capacities,asserting as one example could an attorney who has had four or more years on the council become a most valuable part of the legal department perhaps even the manager 
april events.
on april,the city held its municipal elections,which included the election of a city treasurer and three city council members.the terms of quintero and two other council members had expired,and quintero did not run for.after the election results were finalized on april,three new council members took office and quintero term of office ended.in the same election,sitting city council member rafi manoukian had run for city treasurer and won,thereby creating a vacancy on the city council.pursuant to article vi,section of the charter,the city council appointed quintero to serve the remainder of manoukian term,set to expire in june.
quo warranto and writ proceedings.
code of civil procedure section provides an action may be brought by the,in the name of the people of this state,upon his own information,or upon a complaint of a private party,against any person who usurps,intrudes into,or unlawfully holds or exercises any public office,civil or military within this state.and the must bring the action,whenever he has reason to believe that any such office has been usurped,intruded into,or unlawfully held or exercised by any person,or when he is directed to do so by the governor.in may,appellants,the proposed relators as members of the public and city residents,sought leave to sue in quo warranto and submitted their application to the attorney general in accordance with section.see also,tit.they argued that quintero appointment to the city council violated section.as proposed defendants,the city and quintero opposed the application.
the attorney general issued an opinion opinion in october,denying leave to sue on the ground that it was not in the public interest to authorize the initiation of a quo warranto lawsuit under the present circumstances.the attorney general found the language of section ambiguous,reading it as either imposing a ban on any type of office and serving a function,or applying to city employment and precluding a former council member from using his or her influence as a means to future city employment.in view of that ambiguity,the attorney general turned to the electorate intent in enacting section and concluded that reading the provision in the context of the charter as a whole,and in light of the reasons given in the ballot pamphlet,all indications are that the provision was aimed at prohibiting or rather continuing to prohibit a council member from improperly using his or her influence to gain city employment.though the attorney general acknowledged there was room for some debate concerning section interpretation,she concluded the case was not close and therefore burdening the courts with the proposed quo warranto action would not further the public interest.
in november,appellants filed an ex parte application seeking an alternative writ of mandate and an order to show cause why a peremptory writ should not issue,arguing the attorney general abused her discretion by deciding the merits of the quo warranto action and,alternatively,abused her discretion by ruling incorrectly.the attorney general opposed the application.the trial court issued an alternative writ of mandate to expedite a hearing on an order to show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue.it also set a briefing schedule,and the attorney general,the city and quintero thereafter answered the petition and filed opposition papers.
the trial court heard the matter on january.at the beginning of the hearing,the trial court summarized the bases for its tentative ruling denying the writ of mandate.rejecting the first of appellants two arguments,it explained that the attorney general was necessarily required to evaluate the merits of appellants proposed action in order to determine whether their quo warranto application raised a substantial question.with respect to appellants second argument,the trial court explained that while the plain language of section could be read to support appellants position,nothing in the ballot materials supported the view that section precluded quintero from holding the position of a city council member less than two years after leaving office.the trial court also considered that there was no public purpose served by appellants interpretation and that the fundamental right to hold office may only be curtailed when clearly specified.accordingly,the trial court reasoned that while appellants offered a plausible interpretation of section,the attorney general did not commit an extreme and indefensible abuse of discretion in concluding that the public interest would not be served by appellants proposed action.at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial court adopted the tentative ruling denying the writ of mandate as its final order.
thereafter,the trial court entered judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate.this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellants maintain that the trial court erred in denying their petition for writ of mandate,arguing that the trial court essentially provided the attorney general with unfettered discretion both to determine the merits of their claim and,in turn,to make an incorrect determination.we find no merit to their contentions.
general principles regarding quo warranto actions and the standard of review.
quo warranto was a common law writ literally meaning by what authority was a public office held or claimed.the crown instituted a formal inquiry into whether a subject was exercising a privilege illegally or had the right to occupy a public office.international of firefighters,local city of oakland d,firefighters accord,witkin,california procedure ed,black law dict.ed.the quo warranto remedy is currently codified in section,and it is the specific action by which one challenges any person who usurps,intrudes into,or unlawfully holds or exercises any public office.citation.it is the exclusive remedy in cases where it is available.citation.title to an office can not be tried by mandamus,injunction,writ of certiorari,or petition for declaratory relief.citations.nicolopulos city of lawndale th,nicolopulos.
the key to the remedy of quo warranto is that it can only be brought by the attorney general,on his or her own information or by the request of a private party.nicolopulos,supra,th at firefighters,supra,d at.a quo warranto action must be brought when the attorney general has reason to believe the conditions warranting the remedy exist or when directed to do so by the governor.courts have construed that language to mean the attorney general enjoys considerable discretion whether to bring any particular quo warranto action and may exercise that discretion to refuse to sue where the issue is debatable.firefighters,supra,at see also city of campbell mosk d.
the attorney general discretion under section is not wholly beyond the trial court control.as explained in lamb webb cal,the trial court power to compel the attorney general to violate his own judgment by ordering him to grant leave to commence a suit against his own conviction and conscientious belief that such leave should not be given should be exercised only where the abuse of discretion by the attorney general in refusing the leave is extreme and clearly indefensible.accord,city of campbell mosk,supra,d at appellant must demonstrate that the attorney general refusal to sue was an extreme and clearly indefensible abuse of his discretion.
an appellant may challenge the attorney general exercise of discretion via a writ of mandamus.firefighters,supra,d at see also lamb webb,supra,cal.at.because t he trial court and appellate court perform the same function in a traditional mandamus action,we therefore do not undertake a review of the trial court findings or conclusions.citation.khan los angeles city employees retirement system th.we consider the record to determine whether appellants have met their burden to show the attorney general abused her discretion in other words,whether the decision was arbitrary,capricious,entirely lacking in evidentiary support,unlawful,or procedurally unfair.citation.khan los angeles city employees retirement system,supra,th at.to the extent the attorney general decision depended upon an interpretation of section,the decision raises a question of law that we review de novo.california correctional peace officers state th.
ii.the attorney general and the trial court properly construed code of civil procedure section to afford discretion to the attorney general to decline to bring a quo warranto action.
in the opinion,the attorney general set forth the principles governing her decision whether to grant leave to sue w e must decide whether the application presents a substantial issue of fact or law that warrants judicial resolution,and whether granting the application would serve the public interest.that said,we are accorded broad discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a quo warranto application,and the existence of a debatable issue or a legal dispute does not necessarily establish that the issue or dispute requires judicial resolution through the quo warranto procedure.instead,the overall public interest is the guiding principle and paramount consideration in our exercise of discretion.
following an assessment of the facts and circumstances giving rise to appellants application,the attorney general concluded that while the application presented a debatable issue it did not present a substantial one.the opinion concluded as is the case with most legal propositions,there is room for some debate here as to the proper interpretation of section.upon examining the language at issue in its full context,however,we do not consider this question to be a close one,and we conclude that the overall public interest would not be furthered by burdening the courts,the parties and the public with the proposed quo warranto action a private party who has merely raised a debatable issue is not entitled to pursue the debate in quo warranto proceedings where we determine it would not serve the public interest.
in its order,the trial court outlined the attorney general obligations,explaining the test for quo warranto is whether there is a substantial issue of fact or law for a court to decide concerning the interpretation of section after application of rules of construction,including the legal presumption in favor of quintero right to hold public office.the trial court expressly rejected appellants assertion that the attorney general role was confined to weeding out frivolous or vexatious claims against public officials.though it acknowledged case law confirming that one purpose of the application process was to prevent frivolous and vexatious prosecutions,the trial court explained that the quo warranto remedy is vested in the people because disputes over title to public office are a public question of governmental legitimacy and not just a private quarrel among rival claimants.see nicolopulos,supra,th at.accordingly,the trial court reasoned the requirement for leave to sue,therefore,is not just a procedural vehicle to weed out spurious claims.it also serves to authorize a private party to prosecute a lawsuit in the name of the people based on the public interest.the attorney general must have reason to believe the private party is raising a substantial issue furthering the public interest before authorizing a lawsuit in the people name.
we find no merit to appellants assertion that the attorney general discretion is far more circumscribed than the trial court described and that,therefore,the attorney general did not have discretion to deny their quo warranto application.appellants emphasize that section makes a distinction between situations where the attorney general may bring an action upon his or her own information or private party complaint and where it must bring an action when he or she has reason to believe an office is unlawfully held or when directed by the governor.they further argue the reason to believe standard is low,requiring that the attorney general must be deemed to have abused her discretion in failing to comply with section mandatory directive because their application at a minimum provided a reason to believe that quintero was holding office in violation of the charter.
appellants position finds no support in the law.notwithstanding the statute requir
