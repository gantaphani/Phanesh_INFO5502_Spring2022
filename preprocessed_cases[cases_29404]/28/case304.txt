plaintiff denise schmidt alleges that she broke an unwritten rule and suffered the consequences when she challenged a sitting superior court judge for his seat in a local election while she was serving as a temporary superior court commissioner.schmidt lost her march election bid against an incumbent judge of the superior court of california,county of contra costa superior court.soon after,the superior court executive committee adopted a policy rendering schmidt ineligible to continue to serve as a temporary commissioner.having lost the election and her position as a temporary commissioner,schmidt filed this action under alleging,inter alia,that the executive committee adopted this policy in retaliation for her challenge to the incumbent judge in violation of her free speech rights under the first amendment and the california constitution.while the timing and targeted effect of the superior court policy are certainly suspicious,we do not reach the merits of schmidt federal or state law retaliation claims because the judges of the superior court executive committee enjoy legislative immunity for their decision to alter the minimum qualifications to serve as a temporary commissioner.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants 
denise schmidt became employed as an acting or temporary commissioner for the superior court in.schmidt previously had been employed as a temporary commissioner by the walnut creek danville municipal court,but,as a result of the consolidation of the municipal and superior courts,in june or july of she automatically became employed as a temporary superior court commissioner.she was paid a per diem rate for her work,and was free to accept or reject days of work that she was offered.
schmidt correct job title is an issue of some debate between the parties.the district court described schmidt as an acting or temporary court commissioner.the documents from her appointment in classify her as a temporary court commissioner.schmidt refers to her employment status in her first amended complaint as that of acting court commissioner.she also argues in her reply brief that she was a court commissioner tout court,and that the classification of temporary court commissioner does not exist.although that classification may not exist currently,it did exist in contra costa county when schmidt was appointed as a temporary commissioner for the municipal court.see cal.gov t code,repealed by cal.legis.serv.ch.that section of the government code was repealed in following the consolidation of the municipal and superior courts,after which there was no longer any specific authority in the government code for the superior court to employ temporary court commissioners.however,the trial court employment protection and governance act,cal.gov t code,which was a key piece of legislation in the consolidation process,guaranteed that trial court employees would remain employed at their existing or equivalent classifications.id.c.ultimately,though,whether the superior court had the authority to employ temporary court commissioners is beside the point the parties agree that schmidt was a subordinate judicial officer sjo,and whether the superior court has the authority to regulate the qualifications of sjos is a threshold issue for our analysis of legislative immunity whether schmidt was a temporary court commissioner or an acting court commissioner is irrelevant to this inquiry.
schmidt was an active member of the california bar prior to her appointment as a temporary superior court commissioner in and remained active until at least.at some point in late or early,schmidt telephoned the california bar on an unrelated matter,and the bar representative with whom she spoke informed her that,in light of her appointment as a court commissioner,it was appropriate for her to be in inactive status according to schmidt,the california bar then placed her in inactive status of its own accord,made her inactive status retroactive to her appointment as court commissioner in,and refunded the fees that she had paid for those years.
the superior court executive had been considering the issue of adopting a temporary or pro tem judges policy since at least august,when judge lois haight,a defendant in this action,prepared policy recommendations requiring that temporary judges be members of the california bar for five years immediately preceding their appointment handwritten notes on the draft policy by judge laurel brady,another defendant,suggested adding a requirement that temporary judges be active members of the bar.the draft policy was discussed at the august,executive committee meeting.
also in,schmidt decided to challenge an incumbent judge,john sugiyama,who was up for election in march after his appointment to the superior court in.on november,schmidt filed a declaration of intent to run,and took all other steps required to qualify as a candidate for judge of the superior court.schmidt campaigned from november until march.according to schmidt,her inactive state bar status became a campaign issue during the election,which she lost in march,when judge sugiyama won a decisive victory.
judge haight stated in a declaration that she had no knowledge of schmidt candidacy.at her deposition,however,she confirmed that she donated money to judge sugiyama campaign.the other individual defendants in this action former court executive officer ken torre,then assistant presiding judge thomas maddock,judge brady,and judge barry baskin were aware of schmidt candidacy.judge baskin was on judge sugiyama election committee,held a fundraiser for judge sugiyama in his home,and donated money to sugiyama campaign committee.
on april,a month and a half after the election,the executive committee held its monthly meeting.the fifth item on its agenda was discussion of a temporary judge policy drafted by judge baskin.that draft policy document addressed only temporary judges not commissioners or referees and required them to be active members in good current and historical standing of the state bar of california for a minimum of five consecutive years immediately preceding appointment,and to sign a declaration so stating on each day of service,before serving.judge baskin draft policy was strikingly similar to judge haight draft policy from the previous august.the executive committee discussed judge baskin draft policy and decided to include small claims appeals pro tem judges in the program,and it was moved,seconded,and approved that the assistant presiding judge oversee the pro tem program judge baskin was tasked with preparing amendments to the policy.
in may,assistant court executive officer sherry dorfman had a report drawn up reflecting the california bar membership status of all pro tem judges,private judges,and temporary commissioners,which she provided to the executive committee at its next meeting on may.schmidt was listed as inactive as of january.only three other people were listed as inactive temporary commissioner richard calhoun private judge stanley dodson,and private judge patrick resen.on may,schmidt applied for a permanent commissioner position at the superior court.two days later,at its may meeting,the executive committee discussed an amended version of the policy presented at the april meeting,and unanimously approved it.the may version of the temporary judges policy the policy also applied to temporary commissioners and temporary referees,and had an effective date of may.the policy required all temporary judges,commissioners,and referees to be active members in good current and historical standing of the state bar of california for a minimum of five consecutive years immediately preceding each day of service.
also on may,commissioner steven houghton contacted schmidt on his own initiative to inform her of the executive committee decision and to tell her that she would no longer be able to sit as a temporary commissioner under the new policy.according to houghton,schmidt response was that they were targeting her.houghton informed schmidt that temporary commissioner calhoun and houghton himself would no longer be eligible under the policy and that it was about her.houghton also offered to try to obtain a waiver of the active bar membership requirement for schmidt on account of the length of her service in the superior court.
judge maddock,then the assistant presiding judge implementation of the policy,learned on may that schmidt had telephoned a superior court staff member regarding her status as a temporary commissioner.judge maddock returned schmidt call the next day and read to her the paragraph of the policy that set forth the criteria to serve as a temporary judge or commissioner,including the active membership requirement.following adoption of the policy on may,schmidt never again served as a temporary commissioner for the superior court.
the policy was further revised at executive committee meetings in june and july.the june revision changed the date that the policy would go into effect to may,or when revised,on subsequent dates of revision.the july revision added a sentence clarifying that the superior court policy remained that temporary judges and temporary commissioners have no employment rights and are not entitled to employment benefits.
schmidt filed a complaint in federal court in january against judge maddock,judge brady,judge haight,and judge baskin the judge defendants,and against ken torre,contra costa county,the judicial council of california,and the contra costa superior court.she filed a first amended complaint fac only against the judge defendants,torre,and the county in april,seeking monetary and injunctive relief pursuant to for violation of her rights under the first,fifth,and fourteenth amendments and the bill of attainder clause of the united states constitution,for violation of her analogous rights under the california constitution,and for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.of the judge defendants,schmidt sued judge maddock in his official and individual capacities,and judges brady,haight,and baskin in their individual capacities schmidt also sued torre in his official capacity.the district court granted the defendants separate motions to dismiss the fac in january,dismissing all of schmidt claims with leave to amend.schmidt then filed a second amended complaint sac against only torre,judge maddock,and judge brady in april.these remaining defendants responded with a motion to dismiss,which the district court granted with prejudice in november as to all of schmidt sac claims.
schmidt appealed,and we reversed and remanded in a memorandum disposition.see schmidt contra costa,fed.app x cir.we reversed principally on procedural grounds,and therefore did not reach the merits of each of schmidt claims.id.at.as we explained in our disposition,we reversed because the district court considered matters outside the pleadings in ruling on the defendants motion to dismiss and treated it as a motion for summary judgment without complying with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,and the district court erred by concluding that schmidt failed to state a first amendment claim under.id.at.
on remand,schmidt elected to go forward on her fac.the judge defendants along with torre again moved to dismiss the fac for failure to state a claim under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.in december,the district court granted the motion with respect to all claims against the judge defendants and torre for their role in promulgating the policy,concluding that they were entitled to legislative immunity.the district court also concluded,however,that neither the judge defendants nor torre was entitled to immunity from liability on schmidt claim that they applied the policy to her retroactively.the district court therefore denied the motion to dismiss with respect to schmidt first amendment claim,but granted the motion with respect to her other claims.schmidt also claimed that the judge defendants and torre violated her rights under the california constitution,but the rights that she identified were analogues of the rights she identified in the federal constitution therefore,the district court also dismissed all of schmidt claims other than her free speech claim 
after discovery,all parties schmidt,the judge defendants and torre,and contra costa county moved for summary judgment.the only remaining claims were schmidt first amendment claim under the federal constitution and her free speech claim under the california constitution.in february,the district court granted summary judgment to the judge defendants and torre on the first amendment and free speech claims,because it concluded that candidacy for political office does not amount to speech on a matter of public concern and therefore is not protected speech.the district court also concluded that the judge defendants and torre were protected by absolute legislative immunity,because t he policy is legislative and schmidt failed to present evidence that she was terminated pursuant to an administrative decision to apply a policy retroactively 
schmidt raises various issues on appeal,but here we only address schmidt challenge to the district court grant of legislative immunity to the judge defendants 
the district court initially granted the judge defendants legislative immunity from all claims predicated on their involvement in promulgating the policy in its december rule b dismissal order.in that order,the district court set forth its analysis of the legislative nature of the policy,and in doing so,properly limited its discussion to the allegations contained in schmidt fac.however,in its february order granting summary judgment to the judge defendants on schmidt remaining first amendment and california free speech claims,the district court again determined that t he policy is legislative,and again concluded that the judge defendants were entitled to absolute legislative immunity.because the district court again addressed the issue of legislative immunity in its summary judgment ruling,we elect to address the issue of the judge defendants entitlement to legislative immunity at the summary judgment stage,where we consider the evidence produced in response to the parties summary judgment motions.

authority to regulate 
the threshold inquiry in our discussion of legislative immunity is whether the superior court has the authority to regulate the minimum qualifications of sjos employed by the court,as the executive committee did when it adopted the policy.in most legislative immunity cases,the governmental entity authority to act is clearly defined and therefore rarely at issue.see,cmty.house,city of boise,cir noting the sections of the idaho code authorizing cities to pass ordinances and resolutions kaahumanu cnty.of maui,cir noting that the maui county council has authority to grant conditional use permits.to merit legislative immunity,however,government officials must act within their defined or delegated legislative powers.the foundational case on legislative immunity,tenney brandhove,focuses specifically on whether officials act ed in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity.emphasis added see also rehberg paulk,d bogan scott harris,d.when officials act outside their legitimate sphere of legislative authority when they acquire power by an unwarranted extension of privilege courts must not hestitate to sustain the rights of private individuals in the face of illegitimate legislative action.tenney,at.officials cross the line only when they violate the separation of powers and usurp functions exclusively vested in the judiciary or the executive.id.at.
here,the superior court authority to adopt the policy is not.this is not because this case arises within the context of california judicial branch,as it is that when judges perform legislative functions,they too may be entitled to legislative immunity supreme court of,at hirsch justices of the supreme court of the state of,cir.rather,it is because a superior court authority to regulate the qualifications of sjos is not specifically enumerated in california law.
article vi,section of the california constitution establishes the judicial council of california and charges it with adopt ing rules for court administration,practice and procedure,specifying that t he rules adopted shall not be inconsistent with statute.cal.const.art.vi,d.in turn,the judicial council adopted the california rules of court,which have the force of statute to the extent that they are not inconsistent with legislative enactments and constitutional provisions.silverbrand cnty.of los angeles,cal th,d,cal quoting sara superior court,cal th,d,cal internal quotation marks omitted.the judicial council also has specific statutory authority to promulgate rules establishing the minimum qualifications and training requirements for sjos.cal.gov t code c.the superior court policy established minimum qualifications for certain commissioners and temporary demanding than those set by the judicial council in the california rules of court.we must therefore determine whether the superior court may regulate sjos in this way under california law 
the california rules of court do authorize the superior court to adopt regulations establishing minimum qualifications for current and potential employees.we disagree with the district court and the judge defendants,however,that the superior court authority to do so can be found in california rule of court,which provides that e ach court must a dopt for judges and court personnel an internal operations manual of policies and procedures necessary for the efficient operation and management of the court.the california courts have yet to interpret this rule,but it does not appear to provide authority for the superior court to adopt minimum qualifications for sjos.that this rule applies to internal operations manuals suggests that such manuals are meant to set forth the policies and procedures applicable to current employees of the superior court,not to potential employees.
furthermore,there is no relevant authority in section of the government code,which both parties cite in their briefs.section provides that e very court may make rules for its own government and the government of its officers not inconsistent with law or with the rules adopted and prescribed by the judicial council.cal.gov t code a.in addition to this statutory authority,the superior court has the inherent supervisory and administrative powers to enact its own rules so long as they do not conflict with statutes,case law or the california rules of court.ghaffarpour superior court,th,d,see also elkins superior court,cal th,d,cal rutherford owens illinois,cal th,d,cal.the california supreme court has concluded,however,that both this inherent authority and the statutory authority from section a amount to nothing more than california courts ability to create their own rules of evidence and procedure,so long as those local rules do not conflict with statewide rules.elkins,d,at.the authority to adopt local rules of evidence and procedure is not expansive enough to encompass the authority to adopt the policy at issue here.
instead,the superior court authority to adopt the policy can be found in california rules of court b and c.by adopting rule b,the judicial council granted superior courts the authority to m anage their personnel systems,including the adoption of personnel policies.rule c requires superior courts to adopt personnel plans that address r ecruitment,selection,and promotion policies.these two rules grant the superior court significant authority over its personnel policies,including policies that apply to potential or future employees,through use of the terms recruitment and selection.cal.c.this authority encompasses the ability to adopt policies establishing the minimum qualifications for persons who seek employment with the superior court.
personnel plans adopted by the superior courts in california must be consistent with applicable statutes,rules,and standards of judicial administration.cal.b.the superior court policy,which established qualifications to serve as an sjo that are more demanding than those set by the judicial council,is not inconsistent with the judicial council statutory authority to promulgate rules establishing the minimum qualifications and training requirements for sjos.cal.gov t code c.the crux of the issue is the meaning of minimum in section c schmidt argues that minimum qualifications are,in a sense,also maximum qualifications that is,just as states may not increase the minimum voting age above years,superior courts in california may not add to the minimum requirements to serve as an sjo.the judge defendants,by contrast,read minimum as establishing a statewide baseline or floor that allows superior courts to add to the requirements for those who seek to serve as an sjo.
because the term minimum in section c is undefined in california statutes or case law,we must determine its meaning.we must give effect to the language of a statute if it is plain and unambiguous.golden ref.suntrust bank,cir see also in re,cal th,d,cal.the plain meaning of the adjective minimum is least attainable or possible.webster third new international dictionary of the english language unabridged.further,black law dictionary defines minimum as o f,relating to,or constituting the smallest acceptable or possible quantity in a given case.black law dictionary ed.
clearly,a minimum sets the lowest,least,or smallest possible standard.the judge defendants interpretation of the statute is consistent with this definition,while schmidt interpretation does not mirror the standard definition of the term.applying the plain meaning of minimum to this statute,it is clear that the judicial council establishes a statewide floor for the necessary qualifications that an sjo must possess.this does not prevent a county superior court from adopting additional requirements.
in adopting the policy,the superior court,through its executive committee,exercised its authority under the california rules of court,and therefore acted within its legislative authority.in the language of tenney,this was not an unwarranted extension of privilege,but rather was legitimate legislative activity.at.therefore,we conclude that california law does afford the superior court the authority to adopt a policy regulating the minimum qualifications for future and current sjos,and therefore that the judge defendants are eligible for legislative immunity at the first step of the inquiry.we next turn to the federal test for legislative immunity.
