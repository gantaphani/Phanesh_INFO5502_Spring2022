the citizens of nevada reserved to themselves the power to legislate by initiative.const.by way of the state petition process,nevada citizens may place qualified initiatives,which propose to create or amend statutes,or amend the constitution,on a statewide general election ballot.id.if a constitutional initiative obtains voter approval in two consecutive general elections,the initiative is adopted,and the nevada constitution is amended.const.
in anticipation of the general election,plaintiffs collectively the committee circulated a petition to place the regulation of marijuana initiative the initiative,a constitutional initiative,on the ballot.after the committee submitted the petition to defendant dean heller,nevada secretary of state the secretary,the secretary determined that the initiative did not qualify for the ballot because the petition failed to garner the requisite number of valid signatures.thousands of signatures were disqualified because they did not satisfy two requirements,as contained in the dual affidavit and deemed registered rules.as a result of these disqualifications,the secretary determined that the initiative petition failed to comply with two signature statewide rule,which requires that at least of nevada eligible voters sign the petition,and the counties rule,which requires that the initiative proponents obtain signatures from at least of the eligible voters in at least of the nevada counties.
the committee challenged the counties,dual affidavit,and deemed registered rules in district court,and moved for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of these requirements.the committee alleged that the counties rule violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because it treats more favorably the votes of residents of sparsely populated counties than the votes of residents of densely populated counties,thereby diluting the votes of the latter.the court granted permanent injunctive relief with respect to the counties and dual affidavit rules,only the former of which is before this court on appeal.the secretary argues that the district court erred in enjoining enforcement of the counties rule because the court did not undertake the requisite strict scrutiny review,the rule survives this exacting review,and the case on which the district court primarily relied does not control the present case.
the general election has long passed,and the committee initiative did not appear on the ballot.although the parties do not challenge the justiciability of this case,we initially consider two justiciability issues standing and mootness.first,we hold that the committee had standing to bring its constitutional challenges in federal court.although the initiative failed to meet the statewide rule,which the committee did not challenge,it would have done so had the committee prevailed on its three challenges.the committee injury was therefore redressable when the committee filed suit.second,we hold that this case fits within the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine.as in the other election cases we have decided,the challenged action here is too short in duration to enable full litigation on the merits,and there is a reasonable expectation that the committee will again be subject to the challenged counties rule.
finally,we examine the merits of the secretary appeal,whether the counties rule passes muster under strict scrutiny review.we agree with the district court that the counties rule is unconstitutional.the counties rule violates the equal protection tenet of one person,one vote,and is not narrowly tailored.the rule is indistinguishable from a similar rule that this court struck down in idaho coalition united for bears cenarrussa,cir.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of a permanent injunction.
background 
during the petition cycle for nevada general election,the committee sought to place the regulation of marijuana initiative on the ballot.the initiative sought to amend the nevada constitution to direct the state legislature to regulate the manufacture,taxation,and sale of marijuana.on february,the committee filed a copy of the initiative petition with the secretary.after it gathered signatures in favor of the initiative,the committee submitted the circulated petition to the various county clerks on june.on july,the secretary announced that the initiative failed to qualify for the ballot.the secretary concluded that the initiative did not satisfy the statewide and counties rules.
the counties rule requires that a n initiative petition shall be proposed by a number of registered voters equal to percent or more of the number of voters who voted at the last preceding general election in not less than percent of the counties or of the counties in the state.const.because the counties rule is not based on county population,but rather on a fixed percentage of signatures from a fixed percentage of counties,it dilutes the vote of residents of densely populated counties,such as washoe county,which includes reno,and clark county,which includes las vegas in addition to this signature requirement,under nevada statewide rule,the total number of registered voters signing the initiative petition shall be equal to percent or more of the voters who voted in the entire state at the last preceding general election.const.in the general election,people voted.therefore,to satisfy the statewide rule,an initiative petition for the general election must have contained at least valid signatures.because the committee initiative met the threshold in only counties,and only of the statewide signatures were validated,as alleged in the complaint,the secretary concluded that it did not qualify for the ballot.
in making this determination,the secretary,and the clark county election department,invalidated thousands of signatures based on the dual affidavit and deemed registered rules.the dual affidavit rule requires that an initiative petition contain an affidavit from one of the signers averring that all of the signatures are genuine and that each individual who signed such document was at the time of signing a registered voter in the county of his or her residence.const.the secretary invalidated signatures from clark and washoe counties because they did not comply with this rule.on the basis of these two counties signature verification rates,of these disqualified signatures would have been verified had the dual affidavit rule not been enforced.
the deemed registered rule establishes that a citizen is deemed to be registered to vote,a prerequisite to signing an initiative petition,when he or she submits a voter registration form to the county clerk.stat.in a random sample of the signatures gathered,the clark county election department disqualified signatures based on this rule.
on july,the committee filed suit against the secretary and the clark county registrar in district court pursuant to,alleging that the counties,dual affidavit,and deemed registered rules violated the first and fourteenth amendments.the committee claimed that the counties rule deprived residents of densely populated counties equal protection under the law and curtailed their right to free speech and association,and their right to petition the government for redress of grievances on that same day,the committee also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,asking the court to enjoin the secretary from applying the counties and dual affidavit rules,and to enjoin the clark county registrar from applying the deemed registered rule to the signatures on the initiative petition.on august,the district court granted the motion for a temporary restraining order,and scheduled a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction for august.
at the hearing,the district court informed the parties that,like the rule that the ninth circuit invalidated in idaho coalition,the counties rule violated the constitutional tenet of one person,one vote due to its unequal impact on voters from the various counties.the court posited that instead of requiring signatures from of the voters in of the counties,nevada could require those same percentages in legislative districts,presumably state legislative districts,which are more equipopulous than are counties.the court quoted an excerpt from idaho coalition and stated that it was giving away its thinking on this but it seems that the county rule is unconstitutional under the idaho coalition case.the court concluded that under idaho coalition,the counties rule violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.at the hearing,the parties also agreed to convert the proceeding to a permanent injunction hearing pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.
consistent with the views it expressed at the hearing,the court issued an order on august,declaring the counties rule unconstitutional and permanently enjoining the secretary from enforcing it when considering whether the committee initiative qualified for the ballot.the district court issued the same ruling with respect to the dual affidavit rule,enjoining the clark county registrar in addition to the secretary.the court,however,denied the committee request to enjoin enforcement of the deemed registered rule,which this court affirmed in an unpublished disposition.committee to regulate and control marijuana,et lomax.the secretary timely appealed the court order enjoining enforcement of the counties rule.
ii.jurisdiction 
although neither party raises the justiciability issues of standing and mootness on appeal,we have an independent obligation to consider them sua sponte.dittman california,cir mootness rk ventures,city of seattle,cir standing.
standing is an essential component of the case or controversy requirement of article iii,of the united states constitution.carroll nakatani,cir.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three parts injury in fact causation and likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d schneider chertoff,cir.when evaluating whether these three elements are present,we must look at the facts as they exist at the time the complaint was filed.lujan,at.internal quotation marks omitted clark city of lakewood,cir standing is determined by the facts that exist at the time the complaint is filed.the injury must not be conjectural or hypothetical the plaintiff must demonstrate a real or immediate threat of an irreparable injury.cole oroville union high sch,cir.
it is clear that the committee suffered a real or immediate threat of an irreparable injury,namely the failure of its initiative to qualify for the ballot.it is also clear that the enforcement of the challenged rule caused this injury.the injury was also redressable when the committee filed suit.had the committee succeeded on all three of its claims,the initiative would have qualified for the ballot.although the initiative failed to satisfy the statewide rule,which the committee did not challenge,the statewide rule did not constitute an independent ground upon which the initiative was rejected.rather,the initiative failed to meet the statewide threshold precisely because thousands of signatures were disqualified based on violations of the three challenged rules.in other words,the enforcement of the latter rules prevented the initiative from satisfying the former,uncontested rule.
in determining redressability,courts assume that plaintiff claim has merit.bonnichsen united states,cir the question in deciding whether a plaintiff injury is redressable is not whether a favorable decision is likely but whether a favorable decision likely will redress a plaintiff injury.assuming then,as we must,that the committee succeeded on each of the three challenges it brought,the initiative would have obtained the requisite percentage of statewide signatures thus,we can not say that at the time the committee filed suit,its injury was not redressable.although the district court ultimately rejected the committee challenge to the deemed registered rule,that event did not deprive the committee of standing to file its complaint in federal court.because the initiative would have satisfied the statewide rule,and qualified for the ballot,had the committee prevailed on all of its challenges,because the district court had the power to prevent the injury at the time the complaint was filed,the committee injury was redressable.
see ry.labor executives ass dole,cir holding that plaintiffs injury was not redressable because,even if the court granted the requested injunctive relief,the injury would continue to occur.we therefore hold that the committee had standing to challenge the counties rule.
like standing,the case or controversy requirement of article iii,also underpins the mootness doctrine.clark,at.whereas standing is evaluated by the facts that existed when the complaint was filed,m ootness inquiries,however,require courts to look to changing circumstances that arise after the complaint is filed.id.if a live controversy no longer exists,the claim is moot.city of erie pap,d dream palace county of maricopa,cir the question of mootness focuses upon whether we can still grant relief between the parties.internal quotation marks omitted.although the general election has passed,the committee case is not moot.see,padilla lever,cir en banc holding that plaintiff challenge to an election law is not rendered moot by the passing of an election alaska right to life comm.miles,cir same schaefer townsend,cir same.rather,the committee claim remains justiciable because it falls comfortably within the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine.see padilla,at.
the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception applies when the challenged action is too short in duration to allow full litigation before it ceases,and there is a reasonable expectation that the plaintiffs will again be subject to the same action.first bank of boston bellotti,d padilla,at.
turning to the first element,a challenged action evades review if it is almost certain to run its course before either this court or the supreme court can give the case full consideration.miller ex rel.nlrb cal.pac.med,cir.we have held that e lection cases often fall within this exception,because the inherently brief duration of an election is almost invariably too short to enable full litigation on the merits.porter jones,cir see also padilla,at.this is certainly the case here.in nevada,county clerks must file constitutional initiatives with the secretary,who determines whether they qualify for the ballot,days before the general election is held.const.therefore,the committee had a maximum of days to bring its lawsuit and make its way to this court supreme court precedent,and our own,makes clear that this deadline is insufficient to allow full review.see,meyer grant,d the chances of months being a sufficient amount of time for complete review are slim at best bellotti,at.months is too short a period of time for complete judicial review padilla,at same for months greenpeace action franklin,cir same for year alaska ctr.for the env t forest,cir same for years.we therefore conclude that,in the election context,the counties rule evades review 
to satisfy the second element of the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception,the committee need only show that it is reasonable to expect that the secretary will engage in conduct that will once again give rise to the assertedly moot dispute.miller,at internal quotations marks omitted.the committee has done so.throughout this litigation,the secretary has expressed a clear desire to enforce the counties rule,insisting that the rule passes constitutional muster and furthers the interests of nevada.therefore,if we do not hear this case,and the injunction is vacated,there is a reasonable expectation that this precise issue will repeat itself 
in sum,we conclude that the committee challenge,although premised on an election that has long passed,is capable of repetition,yet evading review.we therefore hold that the case is justiciable and proceed to examine the merits of the secretary appeal of the district court ruling on the counties rule.
