background 
in march appellant filed nomination papers as an incumbent candidate for the office of committee member.on june,appellant was appointed in lieu of election to the office of committee member for a term expiring june.capitalization omitted.appellant name was not printed on the democratic party ballot because the number of candidates nominated for election to the committee did not exceed the number of openings on the committee.
appellant frequently complained that the committee was unlawfully constituted to the extent it included persons who were not statutorily authorized to become members.see,the committee bylaws expanded the statutorily authorized membership to include the following the chair s of the assembly district committee s which include any portion of san luis obispo county,and the regional director s of the state party whose region s includes any portion of san luis obispo county members of the state democratic central committee resident in this county and presidents or designee thereof of volunteer democratic clubs in this county which are chartered by this committee.
shortly before the november general election,appellant filed a complaint with the san luis obispo county district attorney office.the nature of this complaint is disputed.appellant claimed that the complaint concerned jenkins alleged violation of section,which makes it unlawful to solicit funds for the use of a political party without that party written consent.jenkins claimed that appellant had accused the committee of violating the elections code.the trial court written ruling states that appellant had apparently made a complaint to the district attorney office regarding misconduct by the central committee and jenkins.
as a result of appellant complaint,the economic crime unit of the district attorney office contacted debra broner,the committee chairperson.she was advised that the district attorney office was investigating a complaint that the committee included unlawful members and chartering of democratic organizations.broner alleged that,for at least two days,on or about wednesday and thursday right before the general election,she was compelled to gather and present documents that had previously been circulated with all of the committee members,including appellant.the documents supported the legality of the committee membership.
according to broner,appellant complaint impeded the committee campaign during the general election the interference appellant timing caused with the conduct of the election campaign by the committee was severe.the impact was not limited to this county.i was constrained to contact the party regional director,and the state chairman office.there was great concern that an unfounded investigation,triggered so close to the general election clearly would interfere with the conduct of the campaign in our county,and close statewide campaigns the district attorney office found no basis for taking action,but the delay impeded the committee campaign.
broner declared that,after the district attorney investigation,committee members recognized how gravely the unfounded complaint had undermined the substantial work of the committee.members expressed an understanding that these kinds of unfounded complaints from a committee member would continue to sic the work of the committee through the critical presidential campaign.accordingly,members signed a motion to remove appellant from office for failing to contribute to the substantial work of the committee.
the motion was authorized by the committee bylaws.section of article v of the bylaws provides members are expected to be regular in attendance at meetings and regular contributors to the substantial work of the committee.section of article v provides members who are severely deficient in this requirement may be removed according to article vi and article ix.article ix requires that a removal motion must first be presented at a regular meeting of the committee.at the next regular meeting,the member shall be given an opportunity to answer the charges and confront the persons making the charges.a vote of the committee is necessary to remove a member.
the motion to remove appellant was formally made at a meeting of the committee on january,and a copy of the motion was given to her at that time.the motion was debated at the next regularly scheduled meeting on february.committee members spoke in favor of and against the motion.appellant spoke in her own defense.
cheryl conway,one of the members who spoke in favor of the motion,stated as follows appellant poisons the well with each new member of the committee by telling them at the beginning of their association with us that they are illegal and unethical.in the last seven or eight months,the messages have escalated in frequency and fervor.each seemingly containing the implicit threat the member participation will subject them to jail time and financial fines.this is not supporting the substantial work of the committee.in fact,it undermining it at every turn.i have personally witnessed appellant telling out of the area dignitaries that the committee is unethical and illegal because we,by virtue of our bylaws and statewide bylaws,have allowed our membership legally to be more expansive and inclusive of our communities.appellant is poisoning the well of our ability to bring in statewide candidates to assist in fund raising because of her increasingly threatening messages to them.she has even sent an message to jack office that his representative,mike hyle,is illegally a member our county committee.she has recently begun to make clear that her threats are personally directed to one of our members,sending out about irrelevant issues and spewing vindictive remarks for many years,members have been trying to work with appellant and provide her with the information that it would take to convince her that her interpretation is wrong and that the continually escalating behaviors are not conducive to strong committee,enabling us to turn san luis obispo county blue.in fact,she has recently reported us,to the san luis obispo county district attorney office right before the election cycle,and the state and national parties.she has told our former chair that she will never give up this quest,no matter what.
at the end of the debate,a vote was taken.members voted in favor of the motion,ten members voted against it,and one member abstained.the chairperson declared the motion to remove appellant from membership on the committee had passed.
appellant filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel respondents to reinstate her as a member of the committee and to remove as committee members all persons not duly elected under the california elections code or serving as ex officio members pursuant to sections and.appellant also sought a writ of prohibition precluding respondents from removing her from office,once she has been reinstated,for any reason other tha n those enumerated in the elections code and to preclude respondents from selecting new members except pursuant to the elections code.the trial court denied the petition in a ruling.
because appellant term of office expired on june,we can not reinstate her to the office of committee member.therefore,the portion of this appeal relating to her removal from office is moot.an appeal becomes moot when,through no fault of the respondent,the occurrence of an event renders it impossible for the appellate court to grant the appellant effective relief.citations.in re yvonne th,d.
we exercise our discretion to consider the removal issues pursuant to the principle that,if an appeal is technically moot,but there may be a recurrence of the same controversy between the parties and the parties have fully litigated the issues,a reviewing court may in its discretion reach the merits of the appeal.citation.city of hollister monterey ins.th,d.the controversy between the parties has already recurred.pursuant to rule c of the california rules of court,we granted appellant motion to take additional documentary evidence on appeal consisting of a certificate of election showing that,on june,appellant was elected to the office of committee member for a term expiring on june,and appellant petition for writ of mandate,filed on december,seeking reinstatement of her membership after the committee had allegedly informed her that she had forfeited her office as committee member and would be prohibited from participating in committee meetings.many of the issues raised in appellant petition are similar to those raised in this appeal.
we also exercise our discretion to consider the removal issues pursuant to the following principle i f a pending case poses an issue of broad public interest that is likely to recur,the court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue even though an event occurring during its pendency would normally render the matter moot.citation.edelstein city and county of san francisco cal th,d.the removal issues presented by this case are of broad public interest and have already recurred.

removal clause invalidity based on conflict with elections code 
appellant contends that the removal clause of the bylaws is invalid because the elections code does not authorize the committee to adopt rules regulating the removal of its members.appellant notes that section,subdivision a,provides that a democratic party county central committee may make rules and regulations providing h ow officers of the committee may be removed,not how members may be removed.
appellant further contends that the removal clause is invalid because it establishes grounds for removal not mentioned in sections and,the only sections of the elections code providing for the removal of members of a democratic party county central committee.section provides any member of a committee,other than an ex officio member,who misses more than three consecutive regularly called meetings may be removed by a vote of the committee concerned,unless his or her absence is caused by illness or temporary absence from the county on the date of the meeting.section provides a committee may remove any member,other than an ex officio member,who during his or her term of membership affiliates with,or registers as a member of another party,who publicly advocates that the voters should not vote for the nominee of this party for any office,or who gives support or avows a preference for a candidate of another party or candidate who is opposed to a candidate nominated by this party.
the controlling authority is eu san francisco county democratic central committee,d eu.in eu the supreme court concluded that certain provisions of the elections code are unconstitutional because they burden the first amendment rights of political parties and their members without serving a compelling state interest,at.the unconstitutional provisions prescribe the composition of state central committees,limit the committee chairs term of office,and designate that the chair rotate between residents of northern and southern california,at.the court reasoned that these provisions directly implicate the first amendment associational rights of political parties and their members because they limit a political party discretion in how to organize itself,conduct its affairs,and select its leaders,at.although the provisions in question concerned the state central committee,the eu court made clear that its reasoning also applied to county central committees by requiring parties to establish official governing bodies at the county level,california prevents the political parties from governing themselves with the structure they think best,at,fn.omitted.
the eu court observed,a state indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election process.citation.toward that end,a state may enact laws that interfere with a party internal affairs when necessary to ensure that elections are fair and honest.eu,supra,at.the court determined that the state had failed to establish the requisite compelling state interest because it had not shown that its regulation of internal party governance is necessary to the integrity of the electoral process,at.in sum,the court declared,a state can not justify regulating a party internal affairs without showing that such regulation is necessary to ensure an election that is orderly and fair.because california has made no such showing here,the challenged laws can not be upheld,at,fn.omitted.
assuming for purposes of discussion that the elections code does not authorize a county central committee to remove a member on grounds other than those specified in the code,appellant has failed to show that this restriction is necessary to ensure an election that is orderly and fair.eu,supra,at.appellant argues that t he elections code necessarily limits the power to remove persons who are publicly elected to county central committees in order to preserve the democratic process appellant was not publicly elected,since her name did not appear on the democratic ballot.she was appointed in lieu of election to the office of committee member.capitalization omitted.in any event,preserving the democratic process in internal party affairs is not a compelling state interest.the eu court rejected a similar argument that the challenged laws serve a compelling interest in the democratic management of the political party internal affairs.eu,supra,at.the court explained that the state has no interest in protect ing the integrity of the party against the party itself.citation.ibid.
appellant further argues the state has a significant interest in having a uniform set of removal standards applicable to all county committees.but appellant does not show that such uniformity is necessary to the integrity of the electoral process.if it were necessary,the legislature would have imposed uniform removal standards on all political parties.but no such uniformity exists.for example,section,which applies to peace and freedom party county central committees,authorizes the removal of a committee member for a violation of the bylaws or constitution of the committee.if section had applied to the democratic party,it would have authorized the removal of appellant for violating the bylaw requiring members to be regular contributors to the substantial work of the committee.
appellant contends that,irrespective of eu,the elections code prevails over the bylaws because of the following statement in the bylaws preamble the provisions of the elections code shall control in case of any conflict between that code and these bylaws.but the committee members who adopted the bylaws could not have intended that a valid bylaw would be superseded by elections code provisions that unconstitutionally burdened their first amendment rights.the only reasonable interpretation of the preamble is that conflicting provisions of the elections code shall control to the extent they are constitutional.bylaws must be given a reasonable construction and,when reasonably susceptible thereof,they should be given a construction which will sustain their validity citation.
