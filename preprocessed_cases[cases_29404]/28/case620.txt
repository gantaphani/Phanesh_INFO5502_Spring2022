we granted the state petition for discretionary review in this case to determine whether of the texas election code passes constitutional muster.we hold that it does not.
during a campaign for dallas municipal offices,appellant created and circulated a political flyer that described an incumbent candidate for the dallas city council as pinocchio.the flyer was published anonymously and distributed by a publishing company through a bulk mailing.after the election,the dallas county district attorney office received a complaint pointing out that the flier,contrary to the requirements of,did not contain the name and address of the person contracting for its publication.ultimately,appellant was indicted for violating.in response to the indictment,appellant filed a motion to set it aside,contending that was unconstitutional because it sought to regulate core political speech and was not narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest.
appellant is correct.we hold that,on its face,violates the first amendment to the united states constitution and affirm the court of appeals opinion upholding the trial court dismissal of the charges against appellant 
the united states supreme court has long held that the distribution of political leaflets that advocate controversial viewpoints is the essence of first amendment expression.see international society for krishna consciousness,lee,d lovell city of griffin.in,the supreme court held that no form of speech is entitled to greater constitutional protection than political speech and,when a law burdens core political speech,exacting scrutiny must be applied and the statute may be upheld only if it is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest.mcintyre ohio elections com n,d the supreme court also held that compelled identification of the author against that person will is particularly intrusive,as it reveals unmistakably the content of his or her thoughts on a controversial issue.id.at.
the texas legislature has adopted laws requiring disclosure to be made in political advertisements.under,any person who enters into a contract or other agreement for the printing,publication,or broadcasting of a political advertisement must identify,within the advertisement,the person who made the contract or the person he represents.political advertising includes any communication supporting or opposing a candidate for public office or an office of a political party.the disclosure requirement applies to all political advertisements whether published in the print media,broadcast by radio or television,or appearing in a pamphlet,circular,flier,or other similar form of written communication.id.
although the language of speaks in terms of contracts or other agreements,the substance of the statute,by requiring the author of an advertisement to identify himself,regulates political advertising and,therefore,the content of core political speech.see mcintyre,at.statutes that regulate the mechanics of the electoral process are subject to a lower level of scrutiny than statutes that regulate constitutionally protected speech because they regulate only the election process,not the content of political speech.mcintyre at.it is the substance of the statement being published that determines whether the statute applies,and it is the content of the statement that must be augmented with the name and address of the speaker.
the state argues that should be analyzed under a lower level of scrutiny because it does not directly forbid speech,but merely prohibits commercial agreements to create and broadcast anonymous political advertising.however,a statute that regulates political speech does not have to ban speech to be subject to exacting scrutiny.
freedom of speech includes the right to engage in the dissemination of ideas without being publicly identified.talley california,d.to comply with,however,a person must add personal information to the text of his statement.a law mandating that additions be made to the text of a statement curtails the author freedom to omit any information he chooses and violates the first amendment.talley,at.anonymity allows individuals to discuss matters of public importance without fear of reprisal.buckley am.constitutional law foundation,d.the ability of an author or other sponsoring party to remain anonymous while engaging in political speech is a right that may be burdened only in the face of the most compelling state interest.mcintyre,at.
because it burdens core political speech,is subject to exacting scrutiny and can be upheld only if it is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest.id.at.further,the state must do more than simply assert that it has an interest it must also demonstrate that there are actual problems that arise when persons enter into agreements to print,publish or broadcast political advertising without identifying themselves.united states national treasury employees union,d turner broadcasting system,fcc,d when the government defends a regulation on speech it must do more than simply posit the existence of the disease to be cured.it must demonstrate that the recited harms are real,and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.
here,the state has identified three interests by which it seeks to justify the requirements imposed by deterring and punishing political corruption notifying the public of any allegiance a particular candidate might have toward the publisher of the communication and providing a method of detecting those expenditures that appear to be from an individual,but really come from political action committees or corporations.
it has been consistently recognized that there must be substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair,honest,and orderly.timmons twin cities area new party,d storer brown,d.the government interest in preventing and detecting corruption in campaign finances may be of sufficient importance to outweigh possible infringement on constitutional rights.buckley valeo,d.the state interests in this case,therefore,are compelling,but this is only half of the analysis.the burden placed on the right to freedom of speech under must also be sufficiently narrow and must impose as few restrictions as possible to meet the state goals.
in mcintyre ohio elections commission,the supreme court addressed an ohio law mandating that any published statement designed to influence voters in an election with respect to a candidate or issue must contain the name and address of the person or organization responsible for its issuance.mcintyre,at.the court held the statute unconstitutional because the state interest in providing voters with additional relevant information did not justify the requirement that a writer make statements or disclosures he would have otherwise omitted.id.the court also held that ohio prohibition against anonymous political statements was not its principal weapon against fraud,but was merely a deterrent and aid to enforcement.id.at.the ancillary benefits to the state did not justify the broad reach of the statute.id.at.
here,the court of appeals was correct in holding that the supreme court analysis in mcintyre applies with equal force to the state contends that serves a compelling interest in deterring and punishing political corruption,but it did not specify in the court of appeals,nor does it specify here what types of overriding political corruption is intended to address.nothing in limits its application to wrongful actions such as the publications of statements that are false,misleading,fraudulent,or libelous.the statute applies with equal force to all political advertisements regardless of their accuracy or veracity.further,extant state laws deter false and fraudulent statements through recognized tort claims.see.civ.prac.torts rem.section merely provides a deterrent and an aid to law enforcement and,therefore,can not justify such a sweeping prohibition on anonymous political speech.mcintyre,at.
to the extent that is aimed at abuse or corruption in campaign financing,the state interests are already addressed by the election code numerous restrictions on contributions and
