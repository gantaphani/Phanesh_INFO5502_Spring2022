while the outcome of this case may yield major consequences,we are,as the commonwealth concedes,confronted with two relatively narrow and more technical issues on appeal.appellants br.this lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of two provisions of pennsylvania election code.stat.ann.b and.these provisions,respectively,regulate the number of signatures required to attain a position on the general election ballot and govern the process by which private individuals can sue in the pennsylvania commonwealth court to challenge the validity of a candidate nomination paper or petition.at the summary judgment stage,the district court held that,acting in combination,the two statutory provisions as applied to the appellees violated their first and fourteenth amendment rights.yet on appeal the commonwealth challenges only two technical issues on which it believes it can prevail,even assuming some constitutional injury.appellants br.first,the commonwealth argues that neither state official sued here has a sufficient connection to the challenged code provisions to be a proper defendant.second,it argues that the district court order was incoherent on its face,id.at,and thus provided no practical benefit to the appellees.for the reasons discussed below,we reject both arguments and will affirm the district court order.
the appellees in this case are the constitution party of pennsylvania,the green party of pennsylvania,and the libertarian party of pennsylvania their respective chairmen joe murphy,carl romanelli,and thomas robert stevens james clymer,a member of the constitution party and ken krawchuk,a former libertarian party candidate for the senate.for ease of reference and consistency with our earlier opinion in this case,we will refer to the appellees collectively as the aspiring parties.they filed suit against the secretary of the commonwealth of pennsylvania,pedro cortes,and the commissioner of the pennsylvania bureau of commissions,elections,and legislation,jonathan marks collectively,the commonwealth or the officials in their official capacities.
in order to fully understand this appeal,it is necessary to provide some background regarding pennsylvania election code.to begin,the code distinguishes between political parties and political bodies.stat.ann.an organization qualifies as a political party if,during the most recent general election,one of its candidates polled at least two percent of the largest entire vote cast in each of at least ten counties and polled a total vote in the state equal to at least two per centum of the largest entire vote cast in the state for any elected candidate.id.a.political parties may then be categorized as either major or minor parties.id.a rogers corbett,cir.minor parties are defined as parties receiving less than fifteen percent of the total statewide registration for all political parties.stat.ann.a,while parties with more support,at present only the democratic and republican parties,are deemed major parties,rogers,at.political bodies are organizations that did not have a candidate who crossed the threshold in the last election,and so they do not qualify for the benefits of being either a minor or a major party.stat.ann.
major parties have the benefit of a publicly funded primary process through which the field of candidates is winnowed down and a party representative is chosen for the general election.see id.rogers,at.to be placed on the primary ballot,a major party candidate needs only to gather,at most,signatures.stat.ann.minor parties and political bodies together,parties,however,have to put on a much larger campaign to have their nominees appear on the general election ballot.for statewide office in,for example,a party candidate would need to gather signatures appellees march,rule j letter at.after collecting these signatures,party candidates are also required to file a nomination paper with the secretary of the commonwealth.see id.nominations by minor political parties,nominations by political bodies rogers,at.the nomination paper is then examined by the secretary of the commonwealth,who must reject the filing of any submission containing material errors or defects apparent on its face or on the face of the appended or accompanying affidavits or contain ing material alterations made after signing without the consent of the signers or not contain ing a sufficient number of signatures.stat.ann.
even after being received and filed by the secretary,however,the nomination paper can be subjected to further examination if an individual lodges an objection within seven days of its acceptance and seeks to set aside the nomination paper id.if any objections are filed pursuant to,the commonwealth court reviews and holds a hearing on the objections and determines whether the candidate name will be placed on the ballot.id.if an objection is successful and a nomination petition or paper is dismissed,the court shall make such order as to the payment of the costs of the proceedings,including witness fees,as it shall deem just.id.
the pennsylvania supreme court has held that,under,an award of costs is not warranted solely on the basis that the party prevailed there must be some further reason,and it is an abuse of discretion for a lower court to award such costs without identifying any reason specific to the case or why justice would demand shifting costs to them.in re farnese.at the same time,however,the court held that,while fraud,bad faith,or gross misconduct may require an award of costs,a party conduct need not proceed to such an extreme before costs can be shifted.id.at.thus,under,costs may be awarded to the person opposing nomination papers if there is some showing that it would be just to do so,despite the absence of fraud,bad faith,or gross misconduct on the part of the candidate whose nomination paper was challenged.id.
in,independent presidential candidate ralph nader and his running mate were ordered to pay in costs under,following a court determination that their pennsylvania campaign involved fraud and deception of massive proportions.in re nader.that ruling appears to mark the first time costs were ever imposed pursuant to,and the reverberations from that decision have been significant.
according to the aspiring parties,the nader decision transformed how was understood and applied across the commonwealth.they claim that the threat of extraordinary costs caused several minor party candidates either to withhold or withdraw their nomination petitions during the election cycle.appellees br.at.for example,appellant krawchuk previously stated that,although the libertarian party nominated him as its candidate for united states senate in,he declined to run due to the fact that ralph nader and his running mate had recently been ordered to pay.constitution party of aichele,cir.thus,according to the aspiring parties,in only one minor party candidate ran for statewide office appellant romanelli,the green party nominee for united states senate.id.
as required by,romanelli had to obtain valid signatures to get on the ballot in.he submitted signatures but was removed from the ballot after private parties affiliated with the democratic party filed a successful objection pursuant to.romanelli was then ordered to pay costs totaling.in re nomination papers of rogers.commw.the commonwealth court found that costs were warranted due to the failure of both romanelli campaign and the green party to comply with certain court orders,including an order to provide nine people to assist in the review of the nominating signatures and an order to timely provide the court with the specifics of what stipulated invalid signatures romanelli believed could be rehabilitated.id.at 
over the course of the next several election cycles,the effect of the nader decision continued to deter aspiring party candidates from entering the political fray.aichele,at.indeed,as discussed at length in aichele,the challenge process was allegedly being used by allies of the major parties to scare off minor party candidates with threats of financial ruin.id.at.this was not an empty threat the cost of reviewing thousands upon thousands of signatures made many potential party candidates unwilling to run.in not a single candidate,other than the democratic and republican nominees,appeared on a statewide ballot.
recognizing this shift in the political calculus following nader,the aspiring parties filed suit under on may,against the commonwealth.they claimed that,as a result of the increasing imposition of costs on party candidates,b and together,the provisions worked in combination to violate their first and fourteenth amendment rights.specifically,they alleged that the provisions required them to assume the risk of incurring substantial financial burdens if they defend nomination petitions they are required by law to submit.compl.in response,the commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss this case under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,which the district court granted for lack of standing under rule b.the aspiring parties timely appealed that determination,and we reversed,holding that the aspiring parties had standing.aichele,at.
the case was thus remanded to the district court,which entertained for summary judgment on the aspiring parties request for a declaratory judgment that the provisions violated their constitutional rights in their motion for summary judgment,the aspiring parties argued that,even if the signature requirement alone was facially constitutional the two provisions worked in combination to unconstitutionally burden their constitutional rights.the aspiring parties explained that even though there were no direct costs associated with securing a spot on the ballot,the joint effect of b and essentially created an implicit fee that was part of a patently exclusionary system in which parties or their candidates would,almost without fail,be forced to spend upwards of to defend a nomination paper.the constitution party of pennsylvania cortes,supp,estimating a cost for candidates defending a challenge arising from the commonwealth court ordering such candidates to provide temporary employees to jointly review signatures with the challenger before the court would itself review the signatures that remained in dispute.this figure also did not include the potential added liability if costs were assessed by the commonwealth court.this added liability could bring the total cost to over per candidate per election.id.at.
the district court considered these claims and held in a opinion that the near certainty of incurring costs pursuant to brings the facts of this case in line with prior precedent holding that patently exclusionary fees were unconstitutional absent alternative means of ballot access.id.at.the district court then noted that t he typical alternative to onerous ballot access costs was a higher signature requirement something already in place in addition to the onerous costs associated with a party bid for a statewide office.id.at.it then concluded that the combined effect of the signature requirement with section signature validation procedures substantially burdened the aspiring parties associational rights,and held both provisions unconstitutional as applied.id.
in addition,the district court explained that the commonwealth attempt to rely on rogers our earlier opinion holding that b signature requirement is facially constitutional was misplaced.even though the signature requirement was facially valid,the district court noted,this did not prevent it from finding the requirement unconstitutional as applied in combination with.id.at.as the district court made clear,it is not solely the signature requirement nor solely the challenge provision that creates the unconstitutional burden on the aspiring parties it is the interaction of both provisions that causes problems.thus,as the district court explained in a footnote,its holding should not be read to facially invalidate b.id.at.the district court granted the aspiring parties motion for summary judgment on their challenge to b and,but granted summary judgment in favor of the commonwealth on the aspiring parties facial challenge to.id.at.the commonwealth timely appealed this order regarding the unconstitutionality of both provisions,but the aspiring parties chose not to appeal the determination that is facially valid 
because we are reviewing a grant of summary judgment,our standard of review is plenary.belitskus pizzingrilli,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.a see also belitskus,at.
the commonwealth begins by asserting that,even assuming some constitutional injury,the district court order in this case should be reversed.appellants br.at.the commonwealth then makes only two arguments in its briefing,neither of which addresses the substance of the district court ruling on the challenge.first,the commonwealth claims that neither official has a sufficient connection to the challenged provisions to be a proper defendant here.second,it argues that the district court declaratory judgment order holding the provisions unconstitutional as applied but upholding them on their face is nonsensical and thus provides no practical benefit to the aspiring parties.as the commonwealth attempts to wryly put it,i n other words,b is constitutional,except that it is.id.at.because the commonwealth chose not to raise any other issues on appeal,we must limit our analysis to these two issues,deeming waived any argument that the provisions,as applied in combination to the aspiring parties,do not actually violate their constitutional rights 
while the commonwealth begins by arguing that neither official sued here has any connection to the challenged provisions,we believe the appropriate place to begin is with its second argument that the district court declaratory judgment provided no practical benefit to the aspiring parties.
this is the case,the commonwealth argues,because,with all due respect to the district court,its opinion is incoherent on its face.id.at.as further evidence of what appears to be some serious confusion on the part of the commonwealth,it then asks,s o exactly what did the district court declare and,more important,what are the officials supposed to do in the wake of the declaratory judgment against them id.at.the commonwealth does correctly note that the challenged provisions remain part of the election code,but then concludes that,as a result,the officials can not protect the aspiring parties from the operation of.stat.ann.because t hey have no ability to prevent private parties from invoking that statutory provision to challenge the nomination papers.id.at.
this argument shows that the commonwealth fails to appreciate the difference between a facial and an challenge.the distinction between facial and challenges goes to the breadth of the remedy employed by the court.citizens united fed.election comm n.that is,a n as applied challenge is a claim that the operation of a statute is unconstitutional in a particular case while a facial challenge indicates that the statute may rarely or never be constitutionally applied.constitutional law see also united states huet,cir.same united states marcavage,cir.same.here,the district court held that in many situations the challenged election laws are constitutional it is only when they are applied to certain parties that the two provisions work in tandem to deprive these groups of their constitutionally protected rights under the first and fourteenth amendments accordingly,even though the provisions remain on the books,they can not both be enforced against the aspiring parties as a result of the district court ruling 
to accept this reasoning would mean that there is no mechanism in place that would allow private parties to bring a challenge under against the aspiring parties.the commonwealth is therefore wrong that the signature requirement can be enforced against the aspiring parties in the form of a private suit brought pursuant to an unconstitutional provision of pennsylvania election code.indeed,the commonwealth in its reply brief seems to acknowledge as much,noting that i f the aspiring parties were not required to file nomination papers under b,there would not be anything for anyone to challenge appellants reply br.at.as the commonwealth further points out,it is certainly true that but for the signature requirement there would be no challenges to those signatures and but for those challenges there would be no costs associated with defending the challenges.id.at.this demonstrates just how the relief granted here provides a practical benefit to the aspiring parties the commonwealth may not enforce both b and together against the aspiring parties.
seen in this light,it is readily apparent that the district court order was not incoherent on its face and indeed provides the aspiring parties with a very practical benefit.as we held in aichele,i f the commonwealth officials do not enforce the election provisions at issue,then the aspiring parties will not be burdened by the nomination scheme embodied in b and.at 
the commonwealth also argues that the district court erred because the two state officials sued in this case had no connection to the enforcement of the provisions causing harm to the aspiring parties,and thus were improper defendants under.specifically,the commonwealth asserts that the secretary of the commonwealth and its commissioner of the pennsylvania bureau of commissions,elections,and legislation are simply some hapless state official s who are at best bystander s.appellants br.at.
as we have held on multiple occasions,while suits against a state are barred by the eleventh amendment,a party can sue a state official under ex parte young for acting in violation of a federal law or the constitution 
the theory behind young is that a suit to halt the enforcement of a state law in conflict with the federal constitution is an action against the individual officer charged with that enforcement and ceases to be an action against the state to which sovereign immunity extends the officer is stripped of his official or representative character and becomes subject to the consequences of his individual conduct.
mci telecomm.bell atl,cir.such a suit,however,can not simply seek to make the state officials representative s of the state.ex parte young.instead,i n making an officer of the state a party defendant in a suit to enjoin the enforcement of an act alleged to be unconstitutional,it is plain that such officer must have some connection with the enforcement of the act.id.that said,we have held that even entirely ministerial duties can be sufficient under young,because the inquiry is not into the nature of an official duties but into the effect of the official performance of his duties on the plaintiff rights.finberg sullivan,cir.
more specifically,this case was brought under,which allows an individual to bring suit against a state official who is acting under color of state law a requirement that parallels the state action requirement elucidated in ex parte young actions brought pursuant to the fourteenth amendment.see,am.mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,citing lugar edmonson oil.despite the commonwealth arguments to the contrary,the supreme court holding in american party of texas white,makes clear that a claim challenging the combined effect of ballot access provisions is properly brought against a state election official,such as the secretary of the commonwealth.id.at reviewing minor political parties claim for declaratory and injunctive relief brought against the texas secretary of state challenging various aspects of the texas ballot qualification system as they interact with each other emphasis added.
our case law likewise supports the notion that the appellants in this case play a sufficient role in administering b and other provisions to be named as the defendants in appellees suit.see rogers,at considering the facial constitutionality of b in a suit brought against secretary cortes himself belitskus,at reviewing the merits of a suit against the secretary of the commonwealth and the election commissioner challenging filing fees associated with accessing the pennsylvania ballot,noting that the secretary of the commonwealth is responsible for overseeing various aspects of the commonwealth election process,including receipt of candidates nomination petitions and filing fees and that the election commissioner has administrative responsibility for various aspects of the election process,including ballot access.while appellees suit challenges the combined effect of b and,it appears clear that,based on our own jurisprudence,b is sufficient to bring the named defendants into this suit.
despite the clear history of allowing suits to proceed against election officials in cases similar to this one,the commonwealth attempts to pin blame for the harm to the aspiring parties on everyone except the officials who were sued.first,the commonwealth claims that it is the commonwealth court that adjudicates the disputes,without the involvement of executive branch officials.appellants br.at.the commonwealth then argues that it is not actually the commonwealth court,but the individual challengers suing under who cause injury to the aspiring parties.thus,according to the commonwealth,because neither the commonwealth court nor private parties are obliged to follow the district court decision,secretary cortes and commissioner marks can not protect the aspiring parties from the operation of.stat.ann.this is because they have no ability to prevent private suit under the statute or to prevent how the commonwealth court will rule on the challenge.id.at.
this argument falls apart once one properly understands the district court opinion.the commonwealth seems to believe that,because both provisions are facially constitutional,the aspiring parties still have to gather signatures and submit them for review by the commonwealth this argument,again,misunderstands the fundamental difference between facial and challenges.as discussed above,the district court order prevents the commonwealth from enforcing the two provisions together against the aspiring parties.thus,the aspiring parties can not be forced to both collect the number of signatures required under b and defend those signatures in the challenge process.once viewed in this way,the argument that the two officials sued here have no connection to these election code provisions is,to say the least,off the mark.
indeed,the very actions of the two officials in this case show how incongruous the commonwealth position is.as brought to our attention by the aspiring parties in a rule j letter,the commonwealth department of state sent a letter to the aspiring parties explaining that,under b,all political body candidates for statewide office must collect signatures in.the letter then explained that because n o court has issued any decision altering the duty of candidates to comply with b,both secretary cortes and commissioner marks are obligated to follow b as usual and intend to do so in.the clear import of this letter is that the two named officials plan to enforce b and against the aspiring parties in.while this would be in clear violation of the district court order for the reasons discussed above,the letter on its face also refutes the claim that neither official has any connection to the enforcement of the challenged provisions 
even putting aside the admissions of the commonwealth,pennsylvania election code is replete with provisions discussing the role secretary cortes plays in administering it.section b,for example,vests in the secretary the statutory duty to receive and determine,as herein provided,the sufficiency of nomination papers.stat.ann.d id.b.indeed,according to the code,w hen any nomination petition,nomination certificate or nomination paper is presented in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth or of any county board of elections for filing,it shall be the duty of the said officer or board to examine the same.id.further,as we noted in aichele,t o appear on the general election ballot,minor parties and political bodies are required to file nomination papers with the secretary of the commonwealth.at emphasis added.in addition,it is up to the secretary of the commonwealth to determine which organizations are political parties within the state.stat
