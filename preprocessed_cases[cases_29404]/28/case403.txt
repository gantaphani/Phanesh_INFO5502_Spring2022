in this emergency appeal from the denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction,richard scott,who is a candidate for the republican party for governor of the state of florida,asks that we preliminarily enjoin the enforcement of a provision of the florida election campaign financing act that he contends violates his rights,under the first and fourteenth amendments,to spend unlimited sums of his personal funds and private donations to his campaign in furtherance of his candidacy.to date,scott,who has never run for public office and is largely his campaign,has spent more than million in the republican primary to defeat his main opponent,bill mccollum,the current attorney general of florida,who is participating in the public campaign financing system of florida,which provides participating candidates with matching public funds to spend on their campaigns.that system also provides participating candidates like mccollum with a subsidy when a nonparticipating opponent spends in excess of for each registered florida voter,which for this election means almost million.stat.
on july,as his campaign expenditures were rapidly approaching the million threshold,scott filed a complaint in the district court and asked the court to enjoin preliminarily the operation of the excess spending subsidy.scott argued that,under davis federal election commission,d,the excess spending subsidy severely burdened his first amendment rights and was not justified by a compelling state interest.the interim secretary of state,as the defendant in her official capacity,and mccollum,as an intervenor in his individual capacity,defended the excess spending subsidy.
the district court promptly convened a hearing for scott motion,carefully weighed the competing arguments,and agreed with the first part of scott complaint,but the district court concluded that the excess spending subsidy indirectly furthered the interest of florida in preventing actual or apparent corruption by encouraging participation in the florida public campaign financing system and was narrowly tailored to serve that end.we agree with the district court that davis requires florida to justify its excess spending subsidy by reference to the anticorruption interest,but conclude that florida can not satisfy its burden of establishing that its subsidy furthers that interest in the least restrictive manner possible.we reverse the judgment of the district court and preliminarily enjoin the secretary of state of florida from releasing funds to mccollum under the excess spending provision.
background 
to explain the background of this appeal,we first address the campaign for the republican nomination for governor of florida.we then discuss the florida campaign finance laws.finally,we discuss the procedural history of this appeal.
a.the campaign for the republican nomination for governor of florida 
richard scott is a candidate for governor of the state of florida and is currently seeking the nomination of the republican party for that office.despite having never held or campaigned for public office,scott announced his candidacy for governor in april.scott is wealthy and describes himself as a former health care executive and businessman.last year,he founded an organization,conservatives for patients rights,to promote free market principles in health care reform.regarding his candidacy,scott states that he is running as a conservative outsider who is a successful businessman with the experience to create jobs,hold government accountable,and turn the state around.
scott main opponent in the republican primary is ira william bill mccollum,the current attorney general of florida.mike mccalister is the other candidate for the republican nomination,is not a party to this appeal,and is described in the record as a nominal candidate.unlike scott,mccollum has a long history in florida politics.before the voters of florida elected mccollum attorney general in,mccollum had served for nearly years as a member of congress from florida.mccollum had also twice campaigned unsuccessfully as a candidate for united states senator from florida.by his own admission,mccollum has substantial experience running a campaign for statewide office in florida.consequently,he also has substantial experience in raising the funds necessary to finance a political campaign in a state such as florida in which the election law limits the amount that individuals can contribute to a candidate.mccollum is also familiar with the florida election campaign financing act,and he consider ed the benefits of the act,as well as the restrictions placed on a candidate by the act,when he decided to participate in the florida public campaign financing system.
mccollum elected to participate in the florida system of public campaign financing,but scott did not.scott contends that he believe s it is unfair to ask the taxpayers of florida to subsidize the campaigns of politicians,especially in these difficult economic times.rather than rely on public financing,scott has decided to fund his campaign substantially with his own money.
scott has funded a substantial campaign.according to scott,he has compensated for his relatively late entry into the race and the fact that his principal opponent is a politician who has been a fixture in florida politics since by spending,between april and july of this year,approximately million in support of his candidacy.scott maintains that he has spent this money on television,radio,and mail advertising travel and other voter education efforts.he explains that these expenditures have permitted him to introduce him self to florida voters,convey his political positions,and articulate his policy differences with mccollum and other gubernatorial candidates in a relatively short period of time.
not surprisingly,these large expenditures,in scott words,have proven to be extremely successful in assisting his candidacy.according to a poll of likely voters in the republican primary conducted by quinnipiac university,on june,scott led mccollum percent to percent.but opinion polls of random selections of voters are snapshots with margins of error,and campaigns are,to say the least,dynamic projects.
after mccollum campaign manager,jack williams,observed scott extensive radio and television campaign advertising throughout florida,the mccollum campaign responded to scott expenditures by altering its advertising strategy.the mccollum campaign purchased advertising many weeks before originally planned.according to williams,mccollum spent million on radio and television advertising through may and another million through july.as of july,mccollum had left to spend on his campaign,but mccollum is still scheduled to receive if he has not already received upwards of million in public funds to match private qualified contributions he has raised.
notwithstanding the apparent success of his expenditures,scott alleges he has recently curtailed his campaign spending to avoid triggering a public subsidy afforded to his opponent under the public financing system.the florida public financing system provides a subsidy to a participating candidate when an opposing candidate who has chosen not to participate in public financing exceeds the statutory expenditure limit,which for this election is,or for each registered voter.stat.under the public financing system,if scott spends over this amount,any participating opponent in the republican primary for the nomination of governor is entitled to one public dollar for every dollar scott spends over the limit.id.
in his declaration,scott alleged that,as he has approached this limit,he has reduced his campaign spending in a drastic manner to ensure that he is enabling mccollum campaign for as few days as possible.he stated that from june to july,he cut by roughly half the total amount of television time purchased for certain advertisements and limited the markets in which he ran those ads.scott alleged that he halted all television and radio advertisements from july to july.scott asserted that he also cut by percent the total amount of television time that he purchased for certain advertisements from july to july.scott stated that he relied more on advertising purchased by a section organization that he controls because the spending of that section organization does not count as a campaign expenditure.the advertising purchased by the section organization could not by law directly advocate scott election and was more expensive than advertisements that scott could have purchased through his campaign because campaigns receive a discount under florida law.scott also alleged that he had reduced campaign travel for the two weeks preceding july.scott also stated that he reduced spending on his absentee ballot program from approximately million to.scott asserted that he reduced mail limited staff hiring reduced the use of paid callers to contact potential voters and curtailed fundraising efforts.
despite these reductions,scott estimates that he will exceed the expenditure threshold well before the republican primary on august.scott does not expect that his reluctance to spend money on his campaign will abate when he exceeds that threshold.after he exceeds the threshold,scott will engage in less campaign speech than would be the case if his opponents were not eligible to receive subsidies under section.scott explains that he has a constitutional right to avoid providing his opponents with a competitive advantage and in turn permitting them to counteract and diminish his campaign speech.
b.the florida laws regarding the financing of election campaigns 
florida laws regulate campaign financing for all candidates,political committees,committees of continuous existence,electioneering communication organizations,and political parties.id.a candidate may not accept a contribution in excess of from any person,political committee,or committee of continuous existence during an election.id.a.the statute defines a person as an individual or a corporation,association,firm,partnership,joint venture,joint stock company,club,organization,estate,trust,business trust,syndicate,or other combination of individuals having collective capacity.id.for the purpose of contribution limits,the statute considers primary and general elections separate elections for all opposed candidates.id.c.by law,a candidate for statewide office may not accept contributions that exceed in the aggregate from national,state,or county executive committees of a political party.id.b.florida law does not limit the amount that a candidate may contribute personally to his campaign.id.b.all candidates must file regular reports of all contributions received and all expenditures made by or on behalf of such candidate with the division of elections.id.
florida law does not consider an expenditure made for,or in furtherance of,an electioneering communication a contribution to or on behalf of any candidate.id.c.an electioneering communication is defined as any communication that is publicly distributed by television,radio,satellite,newspaper,magazine,direct mail,or telephone,and that clearly identifie s a candidate for office without expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate.id.a.the parties understand florida law to permit a candidate to further his campaign by coordinating electioneering expenditures with organizations commonly known as section organizations,which draw their name from the internal revenue code that grants them status.see.section of the internal revenue code provides that an organization operated primarily for the purpose of directly or indirectly accepting contributions or making expenditures need not declare contributions,dues or fundraising proceeds as income if the money is used for the function of influencing or attempting to influence the selection,nomination,election,or appointment of any individual to any federal,state,or local public office.id.c,e.unlike political action committees that directly advocate for the election or defeat of a candidate,most section organizations indirectly support a candidate by electioneering communications and thus avoid regular disclosure of expenditures and contributions to the federal elections commission.see id.j.
in,the florida division of elections interpreted florida law to mean that expenditures of section organizations that were coordinated with candidates did not constitute contributions to those candidates.electioneering communications,de.div.of elections june.the secretary informed the district court that electioneering expenditures also do not constitute candidate expenditures.a recent federal court decision that invalidated the provision of florida election law upon which that interpretation is based calls into question whether this coordination remains legal.see broward coal.of,homeowners ass cmty.orgs.browning,cv smp,wl.may.regardless,the parties agree that candidates continue to coordinate with section organizations.
in,the florida legislature passed the florida election campaign financing act.sess.law serv.ch.codified at.stat.the act establishes a system that provides matching public funds to candidates for state political offices who agree to certain conditions.to be eligible to participate in the system,a gubernatorial candidate must submit an application for matching funds.admin.code ann.be an opposed candidate.stat.agree to abide by an expenditure limit,which for the election is,id.raise an initial in qualified contributions from florida residents before receiving any public funds,id.a agree to limit loans or contributions from his personal funds to,id.limit contributions from national,state,and county executive committees of a political party to in the aggregate this limit applies to all candidates participating or not,submit disclosure and reporting statements of each qualified contribution,id.a and submit a audit of the campaign account,id.the secretary represented to the district court that a participating candidate,like a nonparticipating candidate,remains free to coordinate electioneering expenditures with section organizations,and these expenditures do not count toward the participating candidate expenditure limit.see id.c.
after the division of elections for the state of florida certifies a candidate as eligible to participate in the system,the candidate is entitled to receive matching funds for certain qualifying contributions.id.participating candidates remain subject to the cap on campaign contributions from persons or committees,id.a,but become eligible as participants in the public financing system to receive matching state funds,up to,for each contribution made by a florida resident after september of the calendar year before the election,id.b.the state matches only for aggregate contributions from an individual that exceed.for each dollar of a qualifying contribution that makes up all or part of the initial in contributions a gubernatorial candidate must initially raise,the state provides the participating candidate in public funds.id.a.after the participating candidate raises the initial in contributions,the state matches qualifying contributions dollar for dollar.id.a.
in,the florida legislature adopted section,which includes the excess spending subsidy that is the focus of this appeal.section provides a subsidy to a participating candidate when an opposing candidate who does not participate in public financing exceeds the statutory expenditure limit,which for this election is.sess.law serv.ch.codified at.stat.unlike the public funds that a participating candidate receives from the state that match private contributions to that candidate,the excess spending subsidy is tied to the spending of the participating candidate opponent florida provides the participating candidate a dollar for every dollar his nonparticipating opponent expends above the statutory expenditure limit.stat.this subsidy is not a matching fund because the participating candidate receives the subsidy regardless of any effort that he makes to raise funds for his campaign.see id.these funds shall not be considered matching funds.this section also provides that a participating candidate is released from the expenditure limit to the extent that his nonparticipating opponent exceeds the limit.id.participating candidates remain eligible for matching funds up to the statutory expenditure limit for qualified private contributions and are released from a penalty that would require reimbursement of funds for contributions that exceed the expenditure limit.id.additionally,in enacting this subsidy,the legislature declared that i f any provision of the a ct,or the application thereof is held invalid,the invalidity shall not affect other provisions of the a ct which can be given effect without the invalid provision.sess.law serv.ch.
the florida legislature declared that it created the public financing system out of concern that the cost of running an effective campaign for statewide office discourage s persons from becoming candidates and limit s the persons who run for such office to those who are independently wealthy,or those who are supported by political committees or special interest groups that are capable of generating substantial contributions.stat.according to the enabling statute,the purpose of public campaign financing is to make candidates more responsive to the voters of the state of florida and as insulated as possible from special interest groups,and to dispel the misperception that government officials are unduly influenced by those special interests to the detriment of the public interest.id.that statute also provides that the public campaign financing system is intended to encourage qualified persons to seek statewide elective office who would not,or could not otherwise do so and to protect the effective competition by a candidate who uses public funding.id.the legislature declared its interest in strengthening the integrity of,and public confidence in,the electoral process.sess.law serv.ch,pmbl.
procedural history 
on july,after scott decided that his expenditures would trigger the public subsidy,scott filed a complaint against dawn roberts,the interim secretary of state of florida.scott asked the district court to declare unconstitutional the provision of section that creates the excess spending subsidy and to enjoin the secretary from enforcing it.scott complaint asserted two counts count one alleged that the excess spending subsidy chills free speech by imposing a substantial burden on scott right to spend his own funds in support of his own candidacy in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments and count two alleged that the excess spending subsidy treats candidates differently with respect to campaign expenditures based solely on whether the candidate has elected to participate in the public financing system.according to count two of the complaint,the excess spending subsidy requires florida to subsidize the campaign of a participant,but not of a nonparticipant,after a nonparticipant exceeds the expenditure threshold,in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.scott did not pursue count two in the district court and has not pursued it in this appeal.
also on july,scott moved the district court for a preliminary injunction and requested a hearing on his motion by july.in a memorandum of law that he filed with his motion,scott argued that the decision of the supreme court of the united states on june,to stay the mandate in an appeal from the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit,which involved a materially similar subsidy provision,and to lift the stay that the district court had entered after enjoining the provision,suggested that he was likely entitled to preliminary relief.see mccomish bennett,d see also mccomish bennett,cir.june,mccomish brewer,no.cv phx ros,wl.scott also argued that the harm caused by the excess spending subsidy to his constitutional rights had become ongoing and irreparable.
on july,the district court held a hearing about scott motion for a preliminary injunction.scott,the secretary,and mccollum,whom the district court permitted to intervene under federal rule of civil procedure b,participated in the hearing,and the district court permitted each side about one hour to make arguments.
the record before the district court consisted of five affidavits and the parties briefs.scott and mccollum submitted affidavits consistent with the facts above.jack williams,mccollum campaign manager,submitted an affidavit opposing the motion for a preliminary injunction that is consistent with the facts above.stephen hazelton,the president and director of a media placement company,submitted an affidavit on behalf of mccollum memorandum in opposition that explains,in his opinion,the costs associated with television advertisements in florida and the importance of establishing a strategic media plan early in a campaign.sarah bradshaw,the assistant director of the florida division of elections,who is responsible for overseeing the florida public financing system,submitted an affidavit that explains the system and verifies the applicable expenditure limit.
before the district court,scott argued that the first and fourteenth amendments guarantee him the right to spend unlimited amounts of his personal funds to support his campaign and guarantee his campaign the right to spend an unlimited amount to secure his election.see buckley valeo,d.he argued,based on davis federal election commission,d,that the excess spending subsidy severely burdened his exercise of that first amendment right and was thus subject to strict scrutiny,which it could not survive.scott did not contest that florida could release mccollum from the expenditure limit affecting participating candidates after scott exceeded that spending limit.scott urged the district court to grant a preliminary injunction because he was likely to prevail later on the merits,the injury he was experiencing and would be experiencing is irreparable,and the equities and public interest do not counsel against relief.
the secretary and mccollum responded that scott claims were unlikely to succeed on the merits because the subsidy did not burden scott speech rights.they argued that the subsidy only permitted scott opponents to speak.they asserted that any burden was justified by the interest of the state in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption as well as encouraging participation in the public campaign financing system as a means of preventing corruption.they argued that davis is inapposite because the florida system for public financing of campaigns does not at any point impose asymmetrical contribution limits on participating and nonparticipating candidates.finally,they urged the district court not to grant preliminary relief because scott was unlikely to prevail later on the merits and had unnecessarily delayed filing suit.moreover,they argued that it would be inequitable to force mccollum to rearrange his campaign strategy,which anticipated the subsidy,and deprive the public of two powerful and competing voices during the final weeks of the campaign.
after hearing from the parties,the district court stated,on the record,its thorough findings of the facts that deal with these candidates and this election.the district court found that mccollum had opted to participate in the public financing system,would receive public funds based upon his qualifying contributions,and was not going to exceed the expenditure cap governing participating candidates.the district court also found that scott had opted not to participate and that he would exceed the expenditure threshold and entitle mccollum to receive excess spending subsidies.the district court also found that mccollum would have participated in the public funding system and raised as much money as he had even if there had been no provision for an excess spending subsidy.it found that mccollum probably would have spent the same amount he has spent,or very nearly the same amount that he has spent,with or without a provision for an excess spending subsidy.mccollum probably spent mostly in response to scott expenditures,and not so much in reliance on the availability of a subsidy later on.the district court also found that mccollum could not reasonably have planned his campaign in reliance on the subsidy because the issue of its legality was out there,and it has been out there and will be after today.
the district court found that scott would have done just as he has done with or without the excess spending subsidy.the district court explained that there is no reason to conclude that scott has changed his behavior up to this point for fear that the subsidy would be triggered,but the district court found that the excess spending subsidy will make a substantial difference going forward.if the excess spending subsidy remains in place,scott probably will reduce his direct spending,either because he does not want to make funds available to mccollum,or because scott will be able to get his message out through,or in some indirect way.the district court stated that,if that happens,voters will hear only indirectly rather than directly from scott,which,of course,is a first amendment issue.
the district court denied scott motion for a preliminary injunction.the district court concluded that scott had established irreparable harm and that the equities and the public interest did not clearly favor one side over the other.for this reason,the district court stated that,if scott were likely to prevail on the merits,it would grant preliminary relief.with regard to the merits,the district court concluded that the subsidy provision was probably constitutional.the district court agreed with scott that,under davis,the subsidy provision imposed a substantial burden on scott right to free speech and could be justified only by a compelling government interest.according to the district court,the provision at issue in davis raised the cap for the opponent,so that the opponent could go out and raise money and possibly spend it against the candidate.here,it not just a potential dollar.it a certain dollar.the district court recognized that whether the excess spending subsidy was narrowly tailored to the anticorruption interest was a very close issue and it offered,under considerable time pressures,its best analysis of the law as it stands.
the district court concluded that florida had a compelling interest in preventing actual and apparent corruption that justified the excess spending subsidy.it adopted a theory that neither party had suggested and that the district court conceded had no basis in the statutory language or the legislative history.according to the district court,the legislature adopted a contribution limit applicable to all candidates to combat corruption or the appearance of corruption.but the legislature may not have wanted to hamstring a candidate.the district court posited that the legislature could have addressed that concern by raising the limit when a nonparticipant went over the cap.the court stated that such a solution would be permissible under davis because davis expressly said that,if the provision raised the contribution limit for both candidates,for all candidates,it would be constitutional.the district court,however,explained that the legislature may not have wanted to adopt that solution because keeping the limit fights corruption better.additionally,raising the limit late in the game is very workable because it would be difficult for candidates to go back to his or her contributors and seek more money.the district court concluded that the legislature could reasonably decide,i not going to raise the limit i do want to hamstring the candidate who has opted in and,thus,promoting the anticorruption goal.and so the legislator can reasonably say,what i going to do is match the expenditures by the candidate that goes over.that way,i have offset the effect of the cap on contributions.the district court conceded that it could find no legislative history that sets it out quite like that,but stated that it found it telling that the cap came in at the same time as public financing,and that the excess spending subsidy came in as part of it.

iii.discussion 
scott contends that he is entitled to a preliminary injunction because his complaint under the first and fourteenth amendments is likely to succeed,the burden on his right to free speech is irreparable,and,as the district concluded,the balance of the harms and the public interest do not counsel against an injunction.the secretary and mccollum disagree with all of those statements.we agree with scott.
we address the propriety of preliminary relief in four parts.first,we explain that scott is highly likely to succeed on his claim that the excess spending subsidy severely burdens his constitutional rights.second,we explain why scott injury is irreparable.third,we explain that the balance of the harms and considerations of the public interest do not counsel against relief.fourth,we conclude by addressing the propriety of preliminary relief in the light of our analysis in the first three sections.
scott first amendment claim is likely to succeed on the merits.
scott argues that the excess spending subsidy is unconstitutional because it severely burdens his right to spend in support of his candidacy and is thus subject to strict scrutiny,which it can not survive.he argues that davis compels this conclusion.the secretary and mccollum respond that the subsidy does not substantially burden scott right to spend in support of his candidacy and is not subject to strict scrutiny.they argue that davis is inapposite,but even if it applies,they argue that the subsidy survives strict scrutiny because it furthers the legitimate interest of florida in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption in politics.they contend that the subsidy encourages participation in the public campaign financing system and the public financing system prevents corruption and the appearance of corruption.
we agree with scott that davis requires us to subject the excess spending subsidy to strict scrutiny.we conclude that,even if the subsidy encourages participation in the public financing system and indirectly prevents corruption or the appearance of corruption,the excess spending subsidy is not the least restrictive means of doing so.
like the district court,we think it is obvious that the subsidy imposes a burden on nonparticipating candidates,like scott,who spend large sums of money in support of their candidacies.when a nonparticipant vying for public office in florida spends more than for each registered voter in support of his candidacy,florida provides direct financial support to his opponents.these participating opponents use this money to further their own candidacies and attempt to defeat the candidacy of the nonparticipant.when the participating candidates speak in support of their own candidacies,they raise the cost of their nonparticipating opponent speech in support of his candidacy.neither mccollum nor scott disagrees with this fact.indeed,that is why scott is seeking to invalidate the subsidy and mccollum is defending it.moreover,we know of no court that doubts that a subsidy like the one at issue here burdens nonparticipants,apart from whether it is a substantial burden under the first amendment.see green party of garfield,cir mccomish,at,acknowledging but not finding constitutionally significant the loss of competitive advantage in elections right to life comm.fund for indep.political expenditures leake,cir same daggett comm on governmental ethics election practices,cir same.
we agree with scott and the district court that,under davis,the burden of scott right of free speech is substantial.davis,a candidate for the united states house of representatives,sued to enjoin enforcement of section a of the bipartisan campaign reform act of,otherwise known as the millionaire amendment.at.section a provided that,if davis spent enough of his own personal funds in support of his candidacy so that he could be described as,his opponent could accept campaign contributions of up to.id.at.davis would still have been limited to accepting campaign contributions of or less.id.at.davis alleged that the asymmetrical contribution limits that applied when he his campaign unconstitutionally burdened his right to make unlimited expenditures in support of his campaign because making expenditures that create the imbalance has the effect of enabling his opponent to raise more money and to use that money to finance speech that counteracts and thus diminishes the effectiveness of his own speech.id.at.the supreme court agreed with this argument and invalidated the millionaire amendment because it did not satisfy a compelling government interest.id.at.davis described as an unprecedented penalty,a special and potentially significant burden,a drag,an abridgment,and a substantial burden the grant of the right to an opponent to raise funds under a relaxed contribution cap.id.at.that is,a candidate exercising his right to spend without restriction his personal funds on his campaign is burdened substantially when his opponent is permitted the opportunity to raise more money than he otherwise would have been permitted to raise.
like both the district court and the second circuit,we conclude that the burden that an excess spending subsidy imposes on nonparticipating candidates is harsher than the penalty in davis,as it leaves no doubt that the nonparticipants opponents will receive additional money.green party,at emphasis omitted.although davis concerned a discriminatory contribution system that burdened a candidate,what triggered strict scrutiny was the grant of a competitive advantage an increase in the ability of davis opponent to speak.at t he vigorous exercise of the right to use personal funds to finance campaign speech produces fundraising advantages for opponents in the competitive context of electoral politics.davis also cited day holahan,cir,which involved a subsidy to publicly financed candidates that was tied to independent expenditures against those candidates,for the proposition that the millionaire amendment imposed a special and potentially significant burden.at.that is,the supreme court equated the millionaire amendment with a statute that enabled the opponent of a complaining candidate.moreover,we doubt that the court would describe as such a significant burden the relaxation of a contribution limit that only ever applies to candidates who,by definition,are mostly not relying on contributions.finally,the majority opinion in davis,after establishing that the millionaire amendment warranted strict scrutiny,all but stated that it was not thinking about the law in terms of contribution limits.see id.at even if a were characterized as a limit on contributions rather than expenditures,it is doubtful whether it would survive.
although under davis the subsidy must be justified by a compelling state interest,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,the secretary and mccollum insist that the subsidy satisfies that test.they argue that the excess spending subsidy furthers the interest of the state in fighting corruption and the appearance of corruption,which the supreme court has suggested is probably the only compelling interest that can justify a substantial burden on expenditures.see id.at citing nixon shrink.gov t pac,d thomas,dissenting p reventing corruption or the appearance of corruption are the only legitimate and compelling government interests thus far identified for restricting campaign finances.internal quotation marks omitted.the secretary and mccollum contend that the subsidy furthers the anticorruption interest by encouraging participation in the public campaign financing system of florida,which in turn prevents corruption or the appearance of corruption.this argument is not novel.see gable patton,cir fed.election comm conservative political action,d white,dissenting.we are willing to assume,for the sake of argument,that the subsidy encourages participation in the public financing system of florida.see gable,at.
the parties have not sufficiently explained how the florida public financing system furthers the anticorruption interest.as we understand the system,it enables candidates who are willing to accept limits on personal expenditures and campaign expenditures,and it grants participating candidates public money.in all other respects,the system enables candidates who run campaigns that are indistinguishable from the campaigns of nonparticipants like scott.at this early stage,we outline our concerns as follows.
the limit that the public campaign financing system imposes on the personal expenditures of participating candidates does not appear to reduce corruption or the appearance of corruption.the supreme court has explained that the use of personal funds reduces the candidate dependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse of campaign contributions.buckley,at.at.the supreme court reaffirmed this principle in davis when it held that discouraging the use of personal funds by wealthy candidates for federal office disserves the anticorruption interest.at.thus,by encouraging individuals to accept a limit on personal expenditures,the subsidy does not appear to reduce corruption.
the limit on general campaign expenditures also does not appear to enable candidates who are,or may be perceived as being,less corrupt than their nonparticipating peers.as we have explained,in florida,every candidate for public office,whether participating or not,is subject to a limit on campaign contributions.stat.a.and when contributions are so limited,the supreme court has told us that a limit on general campaign expenditures does not serve the anticorruption interest.the major evil associated with rapidly increasing campaign expenditures is the danger of candidate dependence on large contributions.buckley,at.at.and t he interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of large contributions is served by contribution limitations.id.indeed,in a state like florida that aggressively limits campaign contributions,general campaign expenditures,excepting those of candidates,reflect the size and intensity of the candidate support.id.at.at.
at bottom,the florida public campaign financing system appears primarily to advantage candidates with little money or who exercise restraint in fundraising.that is,the system levels the electoral playing field,and that purpose is constitutionally problematic.id.at.at.the supreme court explained in davis,d ifferent candidates have different strengths and l eveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election.at see also buckley,at.at t he equalization of permissible campaign expenditures might serve not to equalize the opportunities of all candidates,but to handicap a candidate who lacked substantial name recognition or exposure of his views before the start of the campaign.the supreme court has explained that a state can not burden a candidate first amendment rights for the reason that,in scott words,he is a newcomer to the political scene who has the financial resources to mount a credible challenge to entrenched career politicians.
none of this is to say that the public financing system of florida does not benefit the people of florida or that public financing generally is not a system worthy of public resources.buckley,at.at explaining that a federal system of public financing of election campaigns represents a legislative effort not to abridge,restrict,o
