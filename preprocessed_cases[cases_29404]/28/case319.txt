federal campaign finance law says that n o person shall make a contribution in the name of another person.we hold that this law prohibits a person from providing money to others to donate to a candidate for federal office in their own names,when in reality they are merely straw donors.
background 
defendant pierce is alleged to have contributed of his money in to the edwards for president campaign through employees of his law firm as well as some of his relatives.according to the indictment,arranged for these individuals to donate ostensibly in their own names but with the understanding that he would either advance them funds or reimburse them after the donation was made.in accord with these allegations,the grand jury charged with,inter alia,contributing in the names of others in violation of.the district court dismissed the counts,and the government appeals.see.we reverse.

discussion 
the issue in this appeal is whether proscribes only false name contributions or,as the government contends,it also prohibits straw donor contributions.a false name contribution is a direct contribution from a to a campaign,where a represents that the contribution is from another person who may be real or fictional,with or without obtaining that person consent.a straw donor contribution is an indirect contribution from a,through b,to the campaign.it occurs when a solicits b to transmit funds to a campaign in b name,subject to a promise to advance or reimburse the funds to although employing different methods,false name and straw donor schemes both facilitate attempts by an individual or campaign to thwart disclosure requirements and contribution limits.argues as a matter of statutory interpretation that can not apply to straw donor contributions because,irrespective of a role in directing and reimbursing the money,the straw donor b has actually made the contribution,which is accurately reported in b name.we disagree.
statutory interpretation begins with the text.see state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins.to put the language of in context,we also consider how related language is used in a.see robinson shell oil,the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.finally,we analyze in light of its purpose of promoting disclosure and the broader structure of the federal election campaign act feca.see wilderness soc y fish wildlife,cir en banc t he structure and purpose of a statute may also provide guidance in determining the plain meaning of its provisions.relying on these tools of interpretation,we hold that unambiguously applies to straw donor contributions 
a.the text of 
section provides 
no person shall make a contribution in the name of another person or knowingly permit his name to be used to effect such a contribution,and no person shall knowingly accept a contribution made by one person in the name of another person.
under interpretation,only the person who personally transmits the contribution has actually made it.therefore,is violated only if that person provides a false name.he argues that his alleged scheme,in contrast,did not violate because the straw donors actually transmitted the contributions,and they properly used their own names.
the government agrees that false name contributions violate,but it argues that the language is sufficiently broad to reach straw donor contributions as well.under the government interpretation,the original source of funds has made the contribution even though it was actually transmitted by an intermediary,and if the intermediary is named as the source,the contribution has been made in the name of another.the intermediary,in turn,having acted at the direction and used the funds of the original source,has not made a contribution,but instead has knowingly permit ted his name to be used to effect such a contribution.there is no dispute that the contributions here were made in the names of intermediaries.the only question is whether such attribution violated because it was who actually made the contributions.
to determine which party in a straw donor scheme make s a contribution,we first look to the statute to understand the meaning of that phrase.a contribution is statutorily defined as any gift of money made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office.a i.the statutory definition clarifies what purpose is required for the gifts to be covered,and there is no dispute that the gifts here were made for the purpose of influencing the presidential primary election.the statutory definition,however,does not specifically address the salient question of who made the contributions.therefore,we look next to the first dictionary definition of contribute,which is t o give or supply in common with others give to a common fund or for a common purpose.am.heritage coll.dictionary ed.applying that definition,it is clear that gave the money at issue for the common purpose of advancing the edwards campaign.
in ordinary usage,when friend b delivers a gift that was provided by friend a,we say that it was friend a who gave that gift.in the context of gifts,the word giving connotes the idea of providing from one own resources rather than simply conveying,and thus we refer to the original source rather than the intermediary as the one who gave.section must be understood on this same common sense level.in a straw donor situation,the person who actually transmits the money acts merely as a mechanism,whereas it is the original source who has made the gift by arranging for his money to finance the donation.to identify the individual who has made the contribution,we must look past the intermediary essentially ministerial role to the substance of the transaction.accordingly,the statutory language applies when a defendant funds go to a campaign either directly from him or through an intermediary.in either case,for purposes of,the defendant has made that he has violated the statute if his own name was not provided as the source 
argues that this interpretation illogically would result in criminalizing conduct when the intermediary is later reimbursed rather than at the time the money is delivered to the candidate campaign.the concern,in other words,is that the defendant does not actually become the thus no offense takes the defendant reimburses the intermediary,after the donation with its attendant reporting obligation has already been made.consequently,a contribution that was lawful at the time it was made would become unlawful based on subsequent temporal sequence that seems anomalous should the language of be read as not concerned with anything that happens after the contribution is made.
we note preliminarily that this argument does not apply to the extent that was alleged to have advanced funds.when the funds are advanced rather than reimbursed,there is no timing anomaly made the contributions at the moment they were transmitted to the campaign because he would already have supplied the necessary funds.with regard to reimbursed gifts,we acknowledge that the timing objection would be troubling perhaps even decisive when,for example,a defendant reimburses the contributions made by others without any prior arrangements or understandings.we therefore express no view on whether would apply to that hypothetical defendant.in the present circumstances,however,we reject view that the contribution would not have been unlawful at the time it was made.when a defendant arranges to have an intermediary deliver a gift and promises reimbursement,the offense will at least have begun at the moment the contribution arrives at the campaign.because the indictment alleges that then actually followed through with the reimbursements,we need not decide whether a subsequent failure to actually reimburse the intermediary would negate the offense.our holding is limited to defendants who,as is alleged to have done,both prearrange for and follow through with the reimbursement of their intermediaries 
considering the plain language of itself,therefore,we conclude that it encompasses straw donor contributions,whether accomplished through the advancement or reimbursement of funds.because the context in which language is used is also relevant to plain meaning,we turn to arguments based on a.
reading in light of a 
argues that additional language in a but not present in requires interpreting the latter provision as having a more limited scope,an argument the district court found persuasive.argument focuses on two phrases in a 
for purposes of the limitations imposed by this section,all contributions made by a person,either directly or indirectly,on behalf of a particular candidate,including contributions which are in any way earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or conduit to such candidate,shall be treated as contributions from such person to such candidate.
a emphasis added.he argues that both of these italicized phrases would be unnecessary if the term contribution already encompassed indirect gifts delivered through an intermediary.from this language,he infers that contribution,standing alone,must refer to direct contributions delivered without the use of an intermediary.therefore,use of make a contribution without any reference to intermediaries or conduits indicates that the provision is limited to false name contributions.see russello united states,w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposefully in the disparate inclusion and exclusion.quoting united states wong kim bo,cir internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.
argument is unpersuasive for two reasons.first,congress enacted and a at different times,a fact that weakens the russello presumption.see potter,explaining that the russello presumption is strongest in those instances in which the relevant statutory provisions were considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted quoting lindh murphy.we have applied the russello presumption in at least one case in which the two provisions were not enacted at the same time.see united states youssef,cir per curiam.but in youssef,the two provisions were more similar in purpose and structure,and these parallels made the absence of a particular word more telling than it otherwise would have been.see see also city of columbus ours garage wrecker,the russello presumption grows weaker with each difference in the formulation of the provisions under inspection.and even if the parallels were stronger,was passed three years earlier than a,so the choice of wording in the latter offers little insight into the meaning of the former.see united states,declining to interpret provisions with reference to later enacted laws that did not,among other possibilities,declare the meaning of earlier law or reflect any direct focus by congress upon the meaning of the earlier enacted provisions.
second,the russello presumption applies with limited force here because the language used in is broad rather than specific.section does not,for example,include directly but omit the word indirectly.nor does specify a number of covered ways to make a contribution while omitting conduit from the list.in either of those situations,the absence of the words used in a could indicate an intention to exclude their application in.but it makes less sense to draw that inference when,as here,the provision at issue uses broader language that encompasses the meaning of the absent words and thus did not need to expressly include them.see royal foods,rjr holdings,cir merely because a statute plain language does not specify particular entities that fall under its definition,does not mean that the statute is ambiguous as to all those who do fall under it.
the comparison to a actually undermines interpretation,because the language of that provision shows that indirect gifts are merely particular types of contributions,subsumed within the general concept.if congress had understood a to reach more broadly than,there are several ways it could have so indicated.for example,a could have referred to contributions,which for purposes of this section include indirect gifts,a construction that would imply that the same word,used elsewhere,should not have that expanded meaning.similarly,the provision could have referred to contributions or conduit gifts,which would have suggested that conduit gifts are a distinct concept for which congress would use a distinct term.instead,a identification of indirect or conduit gifts as particular types of contributions reinforces our conclusion that the unqualified term,standing alone,should be accorded its full range of meaning.
finally,our examination of a demonstrates that timing argument regarding proves too much,because it would preclude liability for reimbursement schemes under the former provision as well.central to argument that does not reach his conduct is his contention that a separately requires that intermediaries report the original source of the funds that they donate.he thus relies on a to argue that his narrow reading of would not create a loophole for straw donor contributions.yet both provisions are subject to the same concern about the timing anomaly created by reimbursed gifts.although a includes additional language regarding indirect contributions,it does not specifically acknowledge that a person who receives the original source funds after transmitting a donation could still be considered an intermediary.thus,the language of both provisions could be read to focus only on the moment a contribution is made,so they would share the same supposedly anomalous feature of being dependent on the effect of subsequent events.if we agreed that objection warranted excluding reimbursement schemes from the reach of,we would have to conclude that a reference to indirect contributions similarly encompasses only funds that the original source has advanced to intermediaries.himself does not read a in this manner,which reinforces our earlier conclusion that covers such reimbursement schemes so long as they have been prearranged and effectuated.
an examination of statutory purpose reinforces our interpretation of the text.as noted earlier,congress originally enacted as part of the federal election campaign act of,which overall sought to regulate campaign finance through a regime of disclosure requirements.for example,in addition to prohibition,the act required campaigns to keep detailed information about all contributors who donated a minimum amount and to file regular public reports.see c,b.simultaneously,the act eliminated the individual contribution limi
