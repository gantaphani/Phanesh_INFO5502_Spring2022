the right to participate in democracy through political contributions is protected by the first amendment,but that right is not absolute.congress may regulate campaign contributions to protect against corruption or the appearance of corruption.see,buckley valeo.it may not,however,regulate contributions simply to reduce the amount of money in politics,or to restrict the political participation of some in order to enhance the relative influence of others.see,arizona free enterprise club freedom club pac bennett.
the federal election campaign act of feca,as amended by the bipartisan campaign reform act of bcra,imposes two types of limits on campaign contributions.base limits restrict how much money a donor may contribute to a particular candidate or committee while aggregate limits restrict how much money a donor may contribute in total to all candidates or committees.
in the election cycle,appellant mccutcheon contributed to different federal candidates,complying with the base limits applicable to each.he alleges that the aggregate limits prevented him from contributing to additional candidates and to a number of noncandidate political committees.he also alleges that he wishes to make similar contributions in the future,all within the base limits.mccutcheon and appellant republican national committee filed a complaint before a district court,asserting that the aggregate limits were unconstitutional under the first amendment.the district court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction and granted the government motion to dismiss.assuming that the base limits appropriately served the government anticorruption interest,the district court concluded that the aggregate limits survived first amendment scrutiny because they prevented evasion of the base limits.

a appellants substantial first amendment challenge to the current system of aggregate limits merits plenary consideration.
in buckley,this court evaluated the constitutionality of the original contribution and expenditure limits in feca.buckley distinguished the two types of limits based on the degree to which each encroaches upon protected first amendment interests.it subjected expenditure limits to the exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations on core first amendment rights of political expression.at.but it concluded that contribution limits impose a lesser restraint on political speech and thus applied a lesser but still rigorous standard of review,at,under which such limits may be sustained if the state demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of associational freedoms,at.because the court found that the primary purpose of feca preventing quid pro quo corruption and its appearance was a sufficiently important governmental interest,at,it upheld the base limit under the closely drawn test,at.after doing so,the court devoted only one paragraph of its opinion to the aggregate limit then in place under feca,noting that the provision ha d not been separately addressed at length by the parties.at.it concluded that the aggregate limit served to prevent circumvention of the base limit and was no more than a corollary of that limit,at.
there is no need in this case to revisit buckley distinction between contributions and expenditures and the corresponding distinction in standards of review.regardless whether strict scrutiny or the closely drawn test applies,the analysis turns on the fit between the stated governmental objective and the means selected to achieve that objective.here,given the substantial mismatch between the government stated objective and the means selected to achieve it,the aggregate limits fail even under the closely drawn test.
buckley ultimate conclusion about the constitutionality of the aggregate limit in place under feca does not control here.buckley spent just three sentences analyzing that limit,which had not been separately addressed by the parties.appellants here,by contrast,have directly challenged the aggregate limits in place under bcra,a different statutory regime whose limits operate against a distinct legal backdrop.most notably,statutory safeguards against circumvention have been considerably strengthened since buckley.the feca amendments added another layer of base limits capping contributions from individuals to political committees and an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees.since buckley,the federal election commission has also enacted an intricate regulatory scheme that further limits the opportunities for circumvention of the base limits through unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to a particular candidate,at.in addition to accounting for such statutory and regulatory changes,appellants raise distinct legal arguments not considered in buckley,including an overbreadth challenge to the aggregate limit.
b significant first amendment interests are implicated here.contributing money to a candidate is an exercise of an individual right to participate in the electoral process through both political expression and political association.a restriction on how many candidates and committees an individual may support is hardly a modest restraint on those rights.the government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.in its simplest terms,the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from fully contributing to the primary and general election campaigns of ten or more candidates,even if all contributions fall within the base limits.and it is no response to say that the individual can simply contribute less than the base limits permit to require one person to contribute at lower levels because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to penalize that individual for robustly exercis ing his first amendment rights.davis federal election comm n.
in assessing the first amendment interests at stake,the proper focus is on an individual right to engage in political speech,not a collective conception of the public good.the whole point of the first amendment is to protect individual speech that the majority might prefer to restrict,or that legislators or judges might not view as useful to the democratic process.
c the aggregate limits do not further the permissible governmental interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.
this court has identified only one legitimate governmental interest for restricting campaign finances preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption.see davis,supra,at.moreover,the only type of corruption that congress may target is quid pro quo corruption.spending large sums of money in connection with elections,but not in connection with an effort to control the exercise of an officeholder official duties,does not give rise to quid pro quo corruption.nor does the possibility that an individual who spends large sums may garner influence over or access to elected officials or political parties.citizens united federal election comm n.the line between quid pro quo corruption and general influence must be respected in order to safeguard basic first amendment rights,and the court must err on the side of protecting political speech rather than suppressing it.federal election comm wisconsin right to life,opinion of roberts.
the government argues that the aggregate limits further the permissible objective of preventing quid pro quo corruption.the difficulty is that once the aggregate limits kick in,they ban all contributions of any amount,even though congress selection of a base limit indicates its belief that contributions beneath that amount do not create a cognizable risk of corruption.the government must thus defend the aggregate limits by demonstrating that they prevent circumvention of the base limits,a function they do not serve in any meaningful way.given the statutes and regulations currently in effect,buckley fear that an individual might contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through unearmarked contributions to entities likely to support the candidate,at,is far too speculative.even accepting buckley circumvention theory,it is hard to see how a candidate today could receive massive amounts of money that could be traced back to a particular donor uninhibited by the aggregate limits.the government scenarios offered in support of that possibility are either illegal under current campaign finance laws or implausible.
the aggregate limits also violate the first amendment because they are not closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.buckley,supra,at.the government argues that the aggregate limits prevent an individual from giving to too many initial recipients who might then recontribute a donation,but experience suggests that the vast majority of contributions are retained and spent by their recipients.and the government has provided no reason to believe that candidates or party committees would dramatically shift their priorities if the aggregate limits were lifted.the indiscriminate ban on all contributions above the aggregate limits is thus disproportionate to the government interest in preventing circumvention.
importantly,there are multiple alternatives available to congress that would serve the government interest in preventing circumvention while avoiding unnecessary abridgment of first amendment rights.buckley,supra,at.such alternatives might include targeted restrictions on transfers among candidates and political committees,or tighter earmarking rules.transfers,after all,are the key to the government concern about circumvention,but they can be addressed without such a direct and broad interference with first amendment rights.
disclosure of contributions also reduces the potential for abuse of the campaign finance system.disclosure requirements,which are justified by a governmental interest in provid ing the electorate with information about the sources of spending,citizens united,supra,at,may deter corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity,buckley,supra at.disclosure requirements may burden speech,but they often represent a less restrictive alternative to flat bans on certain types or quantities of speech.particularly with modern technology,disclosure now offers more robust protections against corruption than it did when buckley was decided.
d the government offers an additional rationale for the aggregate limits,arguing that the opportunity for corruption exists whenever a legislator is given a large check,even if the check consists of contributions within the base limits to be divided among numerous candidates or committees.that rationale dangerously broadens the circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in prior cases.buckley confined its analysis to the possibility that massive amounts of money could be funneled to a particular candidate in excess of the base limits,at.recasting as corruption a donor widely distributed support for a political party would dramatically expand government regulation of the political process.and though the government suggests that solicitation of large contributions poses the corruption danger,the aggregate limits are not limited to any direct solicitation by an officeholder or candidate.

chief justice roberts announced the judgment of the court and delivered an opinion,in which justice scalia,justice kennedy,and justice alito join.
there is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in electing our political leaders.citizens can exercise that right in a variety of ways they can run for office themselves,vote,urge others to vote for a particular candidate,volunteer to work on a campaign,and contribute to a candidate campaign.this case is about the last of those options.
the right to participate in democracy through political contributions is protected by the first amendment,but that right is not absolute.our cases have held that congress may regulate campaign contributions to protect against corruption or the appearance of corruption.see,buckley valeo,per curiam.at the same time,we have made clear that congress may not regulate contributions simply to reduce the amount of money in politics,or to restrict the political participation of some in order to enhance the relative influence of others.see,arizona free enterprise club freedom club pac bennett,slip,at.
many people might find those latter objectives attractive they would be delighted to see fewer television commercials touting a candidate accomplishments or disparaging an opponent character.money in politics may at times seem repugnant to some,but so too does much of what the first amendment vigorously protects.if the first amendment protects flag burning,funeral protests,and nazi parades despite the profound offense such spectacles cause it surely protects political campaign speech despite popular opposition.see texas johnson,snyder phelps,national socialist party of america skokie,per curiam.indeed,as we have emphasized,the first amendment has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office.monitor patriot roy.
in a series of cases over the past years,we have spelled out how to draw the constitutional line between the permissible goal of avoiding corruption in the political process and the impermissible desire simply to limit political speech.we have said that government regulation may not target the general gratitude a candidate may feel toward those who support him or his allies,or the political access such support may afford.ingratiation and access are not corruption.citizens united federal election comm n.they embody a central feature of democracy that constituents support candidates who share their beliefs and interests,and candidates who are elected can be expected to be responsive to those concerns.
any regulation must instead target what we have called quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.see,at.that latin phrase captures the notion of a direct exchange of an official act for money.see mccormick united states.the hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo dollars for political favors.federal election comm national conservative political action.campaign finance restrictions that pursue other objectives,we have explained,impermissibly inject the government into the debate over who should govern.bennett,supra,at slip,at.and those who govern should be the last people to help decide who should govern.
the statute at issue in this case imposes two types of limits on campaign contributions.the first,called base limits,restricts how much money a donor may contribute to a particular candidate or committee.a.the second,called aggregate limits,restricts how much money a donor may contribute in total to all candidates or committees.a.
this case does not involve any challenge to the base limits,which we have previously upheld as serving the permissible objective of combatting corruption.the government contends that the aggregate limits also serve that objective,by preventing circumvention of the base limits.we conclude,however,that the aggregate limits do little,if anything,to address that concern,while seriously restricting participation in the democratic process.the aggregate limits are therefore invalid under the first amendment.
for the election cycle,the base limits in the federal election campaign act of feca,as amended by the bipartisan campaign reform act of bcra,permit an individual to contribute up to per election to a candidate total for the primary and general elections per year to a national party committee per year to a state or local party committee and per year to a political action committee,or pac.a fed.reg.a national committee,state or local party committee,or multicandidate pac may in turn contribute up to per election to a candidate.a 
the base limits apply with equal force to contributions that are in any way earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or conduit to a candidate.a.if,for example,a donor gives money to a party committee but directs the party committee to pass the contribution along to a particular candidate,then the transaction is treated as a contribution from the original donor to the specified candidate.
for the election cycle,the aggregate limits in bcra permit an individual to contribute a total of to federal candidates and a total of to other political committees.of that,only may be contributed to state or local party committees and pacs,as opposed to national party committees.a fed.reg.all told,an individual may contribute up to to candidate and noncandidate committees during each election cycle.
the base limits thus restrict how much money a donor may contribute to any particular candidate or committee the aggregate limits have the effect of restricting how many candidates or committees the donor may support,to the extent permitted by the base limits.
in the election cycle,appellant shaun mccutcheon contributed a total of to different federal candidates,in compliance with the base limits applicable to each.he alleges that he wished to contribute to each of additional candidates but was prevented from doing so by the aggregate limit on contributions to candidates.mccutcheon also contributed a total of to several noncandidate political committees,in compliance with the base limits applicable to each.he alleges that he wished to contribute to various other political committees,including to each of the three republican national party committees,but was prevented from doing so by the aggregate limit on contributions to political committees.mccutcheon further alleges that he plans to make similar contributions in the future.in the election cycle,he again wishes to contribute at least to various candidates and to political committees.brief for appellant mccutcheon.
appellant republican national committee is a national political party committee charged with the general management of the republican party.the rnc wishes to receive the contributions that mccutcheon and similarly situated individuals would like to make contributions otherwise permissible under the base limits for national party committees but foreclosed by the aggregate limit on contributions to political committees.
in june,mccutcheon and the rnc filed a complaint before a panel of the district court for the district of columbia.see bcra a,stat.mccutcheon and the rnc asserted that the aggregate limits on contributions to candidates and to noncandidate political committees were unconstitutional under the first amendment.they moved for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the challenged provisions,and the government moved to dismiss the case.
the district court denied appellants motion for a preliminary injunction and granted the government motion to dismiss.assuming that the base limits appropriately served the government anticorruption interest,the district court concluded that the aggregate limits survived first amendment scrutiny because they prevented evasion of the base limits.supp.
in particular,the district court imagined a hypothetical scenario that might occur in a world without aggregate limits.a single donor might contribute the maximum amount under the base limits to nearly separate committees,each of which might then transfer the money to the same single committee.ibid.that committee,in turn,might use all the transferred money for coordinated expenditures on behalf of a particular candidate,allowing the single donor to circumvent the base limit on the amount he may contribute to that candidate.ibid.the district court acknowledged that it may seem unlikely that so many separate entities would willingly serve as conduits for the single donor interests,but it concluded that such a scenario is not hard to imagine.ibid.it thus rejected a constitutional challenge to the aggregate limits,characterizing the base limits and the aggregate limits as a coherent system rather than merely a collection of individual limits stacking prophylaxis upon prophylaxis.ibid.
mccutcheon and the rnc appealed directly to this court,as authorized by law.in such a case,we ha ve no discretion to refuse adjudication of the case on its merits,hicks miranda,and accordingly we noted probable jurisdiction.
buckley valeo,presented this court with its first opportunity to evaluate the constitutionality of the original contribution and expenditure limits set forth in feca.feca imposed a per election base limit on contributions from an individual to a federal candidate.it also imposed a per year aggregate limit on all contributions from an individual to candidates or political committees.b,b,supp.iv.on the expenditures side,feca imposed limits on both independent expenditures and candidates overall campaign expenditures.e,c.
buckley recognized that contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an area of the most fundamental first amendment activities.at.but it distinguished expenditure limits from contribution limits based on the degree to which each encroaches upon protected first amendment interests.expenditure limits,the court explained,necessarily reduce the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed,the depth of their exploration,and the size of the audience reached.at.the court thus subjected expenditure limits to the exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations on core first amendment rights of political expression.at.under exacting scrutiny,the government may regulate protected speech only if such regulation promotes a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest.see sable communications of,fcc.
by contrast,the court concluded that contribution limits impose a lesser restraint on political speech because they permit the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but do not in any way infringe the contributor freedom to discuss candidates and issues.buckley,at.as a result,the court focused on the effect of the contribution limits on the freedom of political association and applied a lesser but still rigorous standard of review.at.under that standard,e ven a significant interference with protected rights of political association may be sustained if the state demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of associational freedoms.at quoting cousins wigoda.
the primary purpose of feca was to limit quid pro quo corruption and its appearance that purpose satisfied the requirement of a sufficiently important governmental interest,at.as for the closely drawn component,buckley concluded that the base limit focuses precisely on the problem of large campaign contributions while leaving persons free to engage in independent political expression,to associate actively through volunteering their services,and to assist to a limited but nonetheless substantial extent in supporting candidates and committees with financial resources.at.the court therefore upheld the base limit under the closely drawn test,at.
the court next separately considered an overbreadth challenge to the base limit.see,at.the challengers argued that the base limit was fatally overbroad because most large donors do not seek improper influence over legislators actions.although the court accepted that premise,it nevertheless rejected the overbreadth challenge for two reasons first,it was too difficult to isolate suspect contributions based on a contributor subjective intent,at.second,congress was justified in concluding that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent in the process of raising large monetary contributions be eliminated.ibid.
finally,in one paragraph of its opinion,the court turned to the aggregate limit under feca.as a preliminary matter,it noted that the constitutionality of the aggregate limit ha d not been separately addressed at length by the parties.at.then,in three sentences,the court disposed of any constitutional objections to the aggregate limit that the challengers might have had 
the overall ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support.but this quite modest restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate,or huge contributions to the candidate political party.the limited,additional restriction on associational freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus no more than a corollary of the basic individual contribution limitation that we have found to be constitutionally valid.ibid.
the parties and amici curiae spend significant energy debating whether the line that buckley drew between contributions and expenditures should remain the law.notwithstanding the robust debate,we see no need in this case to revisit buckley distinction between contributions and expenditures and the corollary distinction in the applicable standards of review.buckley held that the government interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance was sufficiently important,at we have elsewhere stated that the same interest may properly be labeled compelling,see national conservative political action,at,so that the interest would satisfy even strict scrutiny.moreover,regardless whether we apply strict scrutiny or buckley closely drawn test,we must assess the fit between the stated governmental objective and the means selected to achieve that objective.see,national conservative political action,supra,at randall sorrell,opinion of breyer.or to put it another way,if a law that restricts political speech does not avoid unnecessary abridgement of first amendment rights,buckley,at,it can not survive rigorous review.
because we find a substantial mismatch between the government stated objective and the means selected to achieve it,the aggregate limits fail even under the closely drawn test.we therefore need not parse the differences between the two standards in this case.
buckley treated the constitutionality of the aggregate limit as contingent upon that limit ability to prevent circumvention of the base limit,describing the aggregate limit as no more than a corollary of the base limit,at.the court determined that circumvention could occur when an individual legally contributes massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to entities that are themselves likely to contribute to the candidate.ibid.for that reason,the court upheld the aggregate limit.
although buckley provides some guidance,we think that its ultimate conclusion about the constitutionality of the aggregate limit in place under feca does not control here.buckley spent a total of three sentences analyzing that limit in fact,the opinion pointed out that the constitutionality of the aggregate limit ha d not been separately addressed at length by the parties.ibid.we are now asked to address appellants direct challenge to the aggregate limits in place under bcra.bcra is a different statutory regime,and the aggregate limits it imposes operate against a distinct legal backdrop.
most notably,statutory safeguards against circumvention have been considerably strengthened since buckley was decided,through both statutory additions and the introduction of a comprehensive regulatory scheme.with more targeted anticircumvention measures in place today,the indiscriminate aggregate limits under bcra appear particularly.
the feca amendments,for example,added another layer of base contribution limits.the version of feca had already capped contributions from political committees to candidates,but the version added limits on contributions to political committees.this change was enacted at least in part to prevent circumvention of the very limitations on contributions that this court upheld in buckley.california medical federal election comm n,plurality opinion see also,at blackmun,concurring in part and concurring in judgment.because a donor contributions to a political committee are now limited,a donor can not flood the committee with huge amounts of money so that each contribution the committee makes is perceived as a contribution from him.buckley,supra,at.rather,the donor may contribute only to the committee,which hardly raises the specter of abuse that concerned the court in buckley.limits on contributions to political committees consequently create an additional hurdle for a donor who seeks both to channel a large amount of money to a particular candidate and to ensure that he gets the credit for doing so.
the amendments also added an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees.see a cfr g.the government acknowledges that this antiproliferation rule forecloses what would otherwise be a particularly easy and effective means of circumventing the limits on contributions to any particular political committee.brief for appellee.in effect,the rule eliminates a donor ability to create and use his own political committees to direct funds in excess of the individual base limits.it thus blocks a straightforward method of achieving the circumvention that was the underlying concern in buckley.
the intricate regulatory scheme that the federal election commission has enacted since buckley further limits the opportunities for circumvention of the base limits via unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to a particular candidate,at.although the earmarking provision,a,was in place when buckley was decided,the fec has since added regulations that define earmarking broadly.for example,the regulations construe earmarking to include any designation,whether direct or indirect,express or implied,oral or written.cfr b.the regulations specify that an individual who has contributed to a particular candidate may not also contribute to a committee for that candidate.h.nor may an individual who has contributed to a candidate also contribute to a political committee that has supported or anticipates supporting the same candidate,if the individual knows that a substantial portion of his contribution will be contributed to,or expended on behalf of,that candidate.h.
in addition to accounting for statutory and regulatory changes in the campaign finance arena,appellants challenge raises distinct legal arguments that buckley did not consider.for example,presumably because of its cursory treatment of the aggregate limit,buckley did not separately address an overbreadth challenge with respect to that provision.the court rejected such a challenge to the base limits because of the difficulty of isolating suspect contributions.the propriety of large contributions to individual candidates turned on the subjective intent of donors,and the court concluded that there was no way to tell which donors sought improper influence over legislators actions.see,at.the aggregate limit,on the other hand,was upheld as an anticircumvention measure,without considering whether it was possible to discern which donations might be used to circumvent the base limits.see,at.the court never addressed overbreadth in the specific context of aggregate limits,where such an argument has far more force.
given the foregoing,this case can not be resolved merely by pointing to three sentences in buckley that were written without the benefit of full briefing or argument on the issue.see toucey new york life ins,departing from l oose language and a sporadic,decision when asked to resolve a question with our eyes wide open and in the light of full consideration hohn united states,departing from a prior decision where it was rendered without full briefing or argument we are confronted with a different statute and different legal arguments,at a different point in the development of campaign finance regulation.appellants substantial first amendment challenge to the system of aggregate limits currently in place thus merits our plenary consideration 
the first amendment is designed and intended to remove governmental restraints from the arena of public discussion,putting the decision as to what views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us,in the belief that no other approach would comport with the premise of individual dignity and choice upon which our political system rests.cohen california.as relevant here,the first amendment safeguards an individual right to participate in the public debate through political expression and political association.see buckley,at.when an individual contributes money to a candidate,he exercises both of those rights the contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views and serves to affiliate a person with a candidate.at.
those first amendment rights are important regardless whether the individual is,on the one hand,a lone pamphleteer or street corner orator in the tom paine mold,or is,on the other,someone who spends amounts of money in order to communicate his political ideas through sophisticated means.national conservative political action,at.either way,he is participating in an electoral debate that we have recognized is integral to the operation of the system of government established by our constitution.buckley,supra,at.
buckley acknowledged that aggregate limits at least diminish an individual right of political association.as the court explained,the overall ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support.at.but the court characterized that restriction as a quite modest restraint upon protected political activity.ibid.we can not agree with that characterization.an aggregate limit on how many candidates and committees an individual may support through contributions is not a modest restraint at all.the government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.
to put it in the simplest terms,the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from fully contributing to the primary and general election campaigns of ten or more candidates,even if all contributions fall within the base limits congress views as adequate to protect against corruption.the individual may give up to each to nine candidates,but the aggregate limits constitute an outright ban on further contributions to any other candidate beyond the additional that may be spent before reaching the aggregate limit.at that point,the limits deny the individual all ability to exercise his expressive and associational rights by contributing to someone who will advocate for his policy preferences.a donor must limit the number of candidates he supports,and may have to choose which of several policy concerns he will advance clear first amendment harms that the dissent never acknowledges.
it is no answer to say that the individual can simply contribute less money to more people.to require one person to contribute at lower levels than others because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to impose a special burden on broader participation in the democratic process.and as we have recently admonished,the government may not penalize an individual for robustly exercis ing his first amendment rights.davis federal election comm n.
the first amendment burden is especially great for individuals who do not have ready access to alternative avenues for supporting their preferred politicians and policies.in the context of base contribution limits,buckley observed that a supporter could vindicate his associational interests by personally volunteering his time and energy on behalf of a candidate.see,at.such personal volunteering is not a realistic alternative for those who wish to support a wide variety of candidates or causes.other effective methods of supporting preferred candidates or causes without contributing money are reserved for a select few,such as entertainers capable of raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in a single evening.davis,supra,at 
the dissent faults this focus on the individual right to engage in political speech,saying that it fails to take into account the public interest in collective speech.post,at opinion of breyer,j.this collective interest is said to promote a government where laws reflect the very thoughts,views,ideas,and sentiments,the expression of which the first amendment protects.post,at.
but there are compelling reasons not to define the boundaries of the first amendment by reference to such a generalized conception of the public good.first,the dissent collective speech reflected in laws is of course the will of the majority,and plainly can include laws that restrict free speech.the whole point of the first amendment is to afford individuals protection against such infringements.the first amendment does not protect the government,even when the government purports to act through legislation reflecting collective speech.united states alvarez,wooley maynard,west virginia bd.of ed.barnette.
second,the degree to which speech is protected can not turn on a legislative or judicial determination that particular speech is useful to the democratic process.the first amendment does not contemplate such ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.united states stevens,see also united states playboy entertainment group,what the constitution says is that value judgments are for the individual to make,not for the government to decree,even with the mandate or approval of a majority 
third,our established first amendment analysis already takes account of any collective interest that may justify restrictions on individual speech.under that accepted analysis,such restrictions are measured against the asserted public interest usually framed as an important or compelling governmental interest.as explained below,we do not doubt the compelling nature of the collective interest in preventing corruption in the electoral process.but we permit congress to pursue that interest only so long as it does not unnecessarily infringe an individual right to freedom of speech we do not truncate this tailoring test at the outset.
with the significant first amendment costs for individual citizens in mind,we turn to the governmental interests asserted in this case.this court has identified only one legitimate governmental interest for restricting campaign finances preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption.see davis,supra,at national conservative political action,at.we have consistently rejected attempts to suppress campaign speech based on other legislative objectives.no matter how desirable it may seem,it is not an acceptable governmental objective to level the playing field,or to level electoral opportunities,or to equaliz e the financial resources of candidates.bennett,at slip,at davis,supra,at buckley,supra,at.the first amendment prohibits such legislative attempts to e the electoral process,no matter how well intentioned.bennett,supra,at slip,at.
as we framed the relevant principle in buckley,the concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment.at.the dissent suggestion that buckley supports the opposite proposition,see post,at,simply ignores what buckley actually said on the matter.see also citizens against rent for fair housing berkeley,buckley made clear that contributors can not be protected from the possibility that others will make larger contributions 
moreover,while preventing corruption or its appearance is a legitimate objective,congress may target only a specific type of corruption quid pro quo corruption.as buckley explained,congress may permissibly seek to rein in large contributions that are given to secure a political quid pro quo from current and potential office holders.at.in addition to actual quid pro quo arrangements,congress may permissibly limit the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions to particular candidates,at see also citizens united,at when buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption,that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption 
spending large sums of money in connection with elections,but not in connection with an effort to control the exercise of an officeholder official duties,does not give rise to such quid pro quo corruption.nor does the possibility that an individual who spends large sums may garner influence over or access to elected officials or political parties,at see mcconnell federal election comm n,kennedy,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part.and because the government interest in preventing the appearance of corruption is equally confined to the appearance of quid pro quo corruption,the government may not seek to limit the appearance of mere influence or access.see citizens united,at.
the dissent advocates a broader conception of corruption,and would apply the label to any individual contributions above limits deemed necessary to protect collective speech.thus,under the dissent view,it is perfectly fine to contribute to nine candidates but somehow corrupt to give the same amount to a tenth.
it is fair to say,as justice stevens has,that we have not always spoken about corruption in a clear or consistent voice.at opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.the definition of corruption that we apply today,however,has firm roots in buckley itself.the court in that case upheld base contribution limits because they targeted the danger of actual quid pro quo arrangements and the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of such a system of unchecked direct contributions,at.buckley simultaneously rejected limits on spending that was less likely to be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.at.in any event,this case is not the first in which the debate over the proper breadth of the government anticorruption interest has been engaged.compare citizens united,at majority opinion,with,at opinion of stevens.
the line between quid pro quo corruption and general influence may seem vague at times,but the distinction must be respected in order to safeguard basic first amendment rights.in addition,i n drawing that line,the first amendment requires us to err on the side of protecting political speech rather than suppressing it.federal election comm wisconsin right to life,opinion of roberts.
the dissent laments that our opinion leaves only remnants of feca and bcra that are inadequate to combat corruption.see post,at.such rhetoric ignores the fact that we leave the base limits undisturbed those base limits remain the primary means of regulating campaign contributions the obvious explanation for why the aggregate limits received a scant few sentences of attention in buckley 
when the government restricts speech,the government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of its actions.united states playboy entertainment group,at.here,the government seeks to carry that burden by arguing that the aggregate limits further the permissible objective of preventing quid pro quo corruption.
the difficulty is that once the aggregate limits kick in,they ban all contributions of any amount.but congress selection of a base limit indicates its belief that contributions of that amount or less do not create a cognizable risk of corruption.if there is no corruption concern in giving nine candidates up to each,it is difficult to understand how a tenth candidate can be regarded as corruptible if given,and all others corruptible if given a dime.and if there is no risk that additional candidates will be corrupted by donations of up to,then the government must defend the aggregate limits by demonstrating that they prevent circumvention of the base limits.
the problem is that they do not serve that function in any meaningful way.in light of the various statutes and regulations currently in effect,buckley fear that an individual might contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to entities likely to support the candidate,at,is far too speculative.and importantly we have never accepted mere conjecture as adequate to carry a first amendment burden.nixon shrink missouri government pac.
as an initial matter,there is not the same risk of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance when money flows through independent actors to a candidate,as when a donor contributes to a candidate directly.when an individual contributes to a candidate,a party committee,or a pac,the individual must by law cede control over the funds.see a cfr.the government admits that if the funds are subsequently to a particular candidate,such action occurs at the initial recipient discretion not the donor.see brief for appellee.as a consequence,the chain of attribution grows longer,and any credit must be shared among the various actors along the way.for those reasons,the risk of quid pro quo corruption is generally applicable only to the narrow category of money gifts that are directed,in some manner,to a candidate or officeholder.mcconnell,at opinion of kennedy.
buckley nonetheless focused on the possibility that unearmarked contributions could eventually find their way to a candidate coffers,at.even the validity of buckley circumvention theory,it is hard to see how a candidate today could receive a massive amount of money that could be traced back to a particular contributor uninhibited by the aggregate limits.ibid.the government offers a series of scenarios in support of that possibility.but each is sufficiently implausible that the government has not carried its burden of demonstrating that the aggregate limits further its anticircumvention interest.
the primary example of circumvention,in one form or another,envisions an individual donor who contributes the maximum amount under the base limits to a particular candidate,say,representative smith.then the donor also channels massive amounts of money to smith through a series of contributions to pacs that have stated their intention to support smith.see,brief for appellee tr.of oral arg.
various earmarking and antiproliferation rules disarm this example.importantly,the donor may not contribute to the most obvious pacs those that support only smith.see cfr h see also a.nor may the donor contribute to the slightly less obvious pacs that he knows will route a substantial portion of his contribution to smith.h.
the donor must instead turn to other pacs that are likely to give to smith.when he does so,however,he discovers that his contribution will be significantly diluted by all the contributions from others to the same pacs.after all,the donor can not give more than to a pac and so can not dominate the pac total receipts,as he could when buckley was decided.a c.he can not retain control over his contribution,cfr h,direct his money in any way to smith,a,or even imply that he would like his money to be recontributed to smith,cfr b.his salience as a smith supporter has been diminished,and with it the potential for corruption.
it is not clear how many candidates a pac must support before our dedicated donor can avoid being tagged with the impermissible knowledge that a substantial portion of his contribution will go to smith.but imagine that the donor is one of ten equal donors to a pac that gives the highest possible contribution to smith the pac may give no more than per election to smith.of that sum,just will be attributable to the donor intent on circumventing the base limits.thus far he has hardly succeeded in funneling massive amounts of money to smith.buckley,supra,at.
but what if this donor does the same thing via,say,different pacs his contribution will balloon to,ten times what he may contribute directly to smith in any given election.
this scenario is highly implausible.in the first instance,it is not true that the individual donor will necessarily have access to a sufficient number of pacs to effectuate such a scheme.there are many pacs,but they are not limitless.for the election cycle,the fec reported about nonconnected pacs excluding pacs that finance independent expenditures only.and not every pac that supports smith will work in this scheme for our donor pro rata share of a pac contribution to smith to remain meaningful,the pac must be funded by only a small handful of donors.the antiproliferation rules,which were not in effect when buckley was decided,prohibit our donor from creating pacs of his own,or collaborating with the nine other donors to do so.see a all contributions made by political committees established or financed or maintained or controlled by any other person,or by any group of such persons,shall be considered to have been made by a single political committee 
moreover,if pacs were to contribute to smith and few other candidates,and if specific individuals like our ardent smith supporter were to contribute to each,the fec could weigh those circumstantial factors to determine whether to deem the pacs affiliated.cfr g ii.the fec analysis could take account of a common or overlapping membership and similar patterns of contributions or contributors,among other considerations.g ii d,j.the fec has in the past initiated enforcement proceedings against contributors with such suspicious patterns of pac donations.see,conciliation agreement,in re riley,matters under review,fec.
on a more basic level,it is hard to believe that a rational actor would engage in such machinations.in the example described,a dedicated donor spent donating the full to different pacs to add just to smith campaign coffers.that same donor,meanwhile,could have spent unlimited funds on independent expenditures on behalf of smith.see buckley,at.indeed,he could have spent his entire advocating for smith,without the risk that his selected pacs would choose not to give to smith,or that he would have to share credit with other contributors to the pacs.
we have said in the context of independent expenditures that t he absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate.citizens united,at quoting buckley,supra,at.but probably not by percent.and at least from the donor point of view,it strikes us as far more likely that he will want to see his full spent on behalf of his favored candidate even if it must be spent independently rather than see it diluted to a small fraction so that it can be contributed directly by someone else 
another circumvention example is the one that apparently motivated the district court.as the district court crafted the example,a donor gives a check to a joint fundraising committee composed of a candidate,a national party committee,and most of the party state party committees actually,of the.supp,at.the committees divide up the money so that each one receives the maximum contribution permissible under the base limits,but then each transfers its allocated portion to the same single committee.that committee uses the money for coordinated expenditures on behalf of a particular candidate.if that scenario seem s unlikely,the district court thought so,too.ibid.but because the district court could imagine that chain of events,it held that the example substantiated the government circumvention concerns.ibid.
one problem,however,is that the district court speculation relies on illegal earmarking.lest there be any confusion,a joint fundraising committee is simply a mechanism for individual committees to raise funds collectively,not to circumvent base limits or earmarking rules.see cfr c.under no circumstances may a contribution to a joint fundraising committee result in an allocation that exceeds the contribution limits applicable to its constituent parts the committee is in fact required to return any excess funds to the contributor.see c i.
the district court assumed compliance with the specific allocation rules governing joint fundraising committees,but it expressly based its example on the premise that the donor would telegraph his desire to support one candidate and that many separate entities would willingly serve as conduits for a single contributor interests.supp,at.regardless whether so many distinct entities would cooperate as a practical matter,the earmarking provision prohibits an individual from directing funds through an intermediary or conduit to a particular candidate.even the implicit agreement imagined by the district court,supp,at,would trigger the earmarking provision.see cfr b.so this circumvention scenario could not succeed without assuming that nearly separate party committees would engage in a transparent violation of the earmarking rules and that they would not be caught if they did.
moreover,the district court failed to acknowledge that its example can not apply to most candidates.it crafted the example around a presidential candidate,for whom donations in the thousands of dollars may not seem remarkable especially in comparison to the nearly billion spent by the presidential candidates.the same example can not,however,be extrapolated to most house and senate candidates.like contributions,coordinated expenditures are limited by statute,with different limits based on the state and the office.see d.the coordinated expenditure limit for most house races is,well below the in coordinated expenditures envisioned by the district court.the limit for senate races varies significantly based on state population.see fed.reg.a scheme of the magnitude imagined by the district court would be possible even in theory for no house candidates and the senate candidates from just the most populous states.ibid.
further,to the extent that the law does not foreclose the scenario described by the district court,experience and common sense do.the government provides no reason to believe that many state parties would willingly participate in a scheme to funnel money to another state candidates.a review of fec data of republican and democratic state party committees for the election cycle reveals just total instances in which a state party committee contributed to a house or senate candidate in another state.no surprise there.the iowa democratic party,for example,has little reason to transfer money to the california democratic party,especially when the iowa democratic party would be barred for the remainder of the election cycle from receiving another contribution for its own activities from the particular donor.
these scenarios,along with others that have been suggested,are either illegal under current campaign finance laws or divorced from reality.the three examples posed by the dissent are no exception.the dissent does not explain how the large sums it postulates can be legally rerouted to a particular candidate,why most state committees would participate in a plan to redirect their donations to a candidate in another state,or how a donor or group of donors can avoid regulations prohibiting contributions to a committee with the knowledge that a substantial portion of the contribution will support a candidate to whom the donor has already contributed,cfr h.
the dissent argues that such knowledge may be difficult to prove,pointing to eight fec cases that did not proceed because of insufficient evidence of a donor incriminating knowledge.see post,at.it might be that such guilty knowledge could not be shown because the donors were not guilty a possibility that the dissent does not entertain.in any event,the donors described in those eight cases were typically alleged to have exceeded the base limits by or less.the fec failure to find the requisite knowledge in those cases hardly means that the agency will be equally powerless to prevent a scheme in which a donor routes millions of dollars in excess of the base limits to a particular candidate,as in the dissent example two.and if an fec official can not establish knowledge of circumvention or establish affiliation when the same ten donors contribute each to newly created pacs,and each pac writes a check to the same ten candidates the dissent example three then that official has not a heart but a head of stone.see post,at.
the dissent concludes by citing three briefs for the proposition that,even with the aggregate limits in place,individuals have transferred large sums of money to specific candidates in excess of the base limits.post,at.but the cited sources do not provide any examples of circumvention of the base limits along the lines of the various hypotheticals.the dearth of fec prosecutions,according to the dissent,proves only that people are getting away with it.and the violations that surely must be out there elude detection because in the real world,the methods of achieving circumvention are more subtle and more complex than the hypothetical examples.ibid.this sort of speculation,however,can not justify the substantial intrusion on first amendment rights at issue in this case.
buckley upheld aggregate limits only on the ground that they prevented channeling money to candidates beyond the base limits.the absence of such a prospect today belies the government asserted objective of preventing corruption or its appearance.the improbability of circumvention indicates that the aggregate limits instead further the impermissible objective of simply limiting the amount of money in political campaigns.
quite apart from the foregoing,the aggregate limits violate the first amendment because they are not closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.buckley,at.in the first amendment context,fit matters.even when the court is not applying strict scrutiny,we still require a fit that is not necessarily perfect,but reasonable that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served,that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.board of trustees of state of fox,quoting in re.here,because the statute is poorly tailored to the government interest in preventing circumvention of the base limits,it impermissibly restricts participation in the political process.
the government argues that the aggregate limits are justified because they prevent an individual from giving to too many initial recipients who might subsequently recontribute a donation.after all,only recontributed funds can conceivably give rise to circumvention of the base limits.yet all indications are that many types of recipients have scant interest in regifting donations they receive.
some figures might be useful to put the risk of circumvention in perspective.we recognize that no data can be marshaled to capture perfectly the counterfactual world in which aggregate limits do not exist.but,as we have noted elsewhere,we can nonetheless ask whether experience under the present law confirms a serious threat of abuse.federal election comm colorado republican federal campaign.it does not.experience suggests that the vast majority of contributions made in excess of the aggregate limits are likely to be retained and spent by their recipients rather than rerouted to candidates.
in the election cycle,federal candidates,political parties,and pacs spent a total of billion,according to the fec.in particular,each national political party spending ran in the hundreds of millions of dollars.the national republican senatorial committee nrsc,national republican congressional committee nrcc,democratic senatorial campaign committee dscc,and democratic congressional campaign committee dccc,however,spent less than million each on direct candidate contributions and less than million each on coordinated expenditures.brief for nrsc et as amici curiae,nrsc brief.including both coordinated expenditures and direct candidate contributions,the nrsc and dscc spent just of their total funds on contributions to candidates and the nrcc and dccc spent just.
likewise,as explained previously,state parties rarely contribute to candidates in other states.in the election cycle,the republican and democratic state party committees in all states and the district of columbia contributed a paltry to house and senate candidates in other states.the state party committees spent over half a billion dollars over the same time period,of which the in contributions to other states candidates constituted just.
as with national and state party committees,candidates contribute only a small fraction of their campaign funds to other candidates.authorized candidate committees may support other candidates up to a base limit.e b.in the election,house candidates spent a total of billion.contributions among house candidates totaled million,making up just of candidates overall spending.nrsc brief.the most that any one individual candidate received from all other candidates was around.brief for appellee.the fact is that candidates who receive campaign contributions spend most of the money on themselves,rather than passing along donations to other candidates.in this arena at least,charity begins at home 
based on what we can discern from experience,the indiscriminate ban on all contributions above the aggregate limits is disproportionate to the government interest in preventing circumvention.the government has not given us any reason to believe that parties or candidates would dramatically shift their priorities if the aggregate limits were lifted.absent such a showing,we can not conclude that the sweeping aggregate limits are appropriately tailored to guard against any contributions that might implicate the government anticircumvention interest.
a final point it is worth keeping in mind that the base limits themselves are a prophylactic measure.as we have explained,restrictions on direct contributions are preventative,because few if any contributions to candidates will involve quid pro quo arrangements.citizens united,at.the aggregate limits are then layered on top,ostensibly to prevent circumvention of the base limits.this approach requires that we be particularly diligent in scrutinizing the law fit.wisconsin right to life,at opinion of roberts,see mcconnell,at opinion of thomas.
importantly,there are multiple alternatives available to congress that would serve the government anticircumvention interest,while avoiding unnecessary abridgment of first amendment rights.buckley,at.
the most obvious might involve targeted restrictions on transfers among candidates and political committees.there are currently no such limits on transfers among party committees and from candidates to party committees.see a cfr c.perhaps for that reason,a central concern of the district court,the government,multiple amici curiae,and the dissent has been the ability of party committees to transfer money freely.if congress agrees that this is problematic,it might tighten its permissive transfer rules.doing so would impose a lesser burden on first amendment rights,as compared to aggregate limits that flatly ban contributions beyond certain levels.and while the government has not conceded that transfer restrictions would be a perfect substitute for the aggregate limits,it has recognized that they would mitigate the risk of circumvention.see tr.of oral arg.
one possible option for restricting transfers would be to require contributions above the current aggregate limits to be deposited into segregated,nontransferable accounts and spent only by their recipients.such a solution would address the same circumvention possibilities as the current aggregate limits,while not completely barring contributions beyond the aggregate levels.in addition or as an alternative,if congress believes that circumvention is especially likely to occur through creation of a joint fundraising committee,it could require that funds received through those committees be spent by their recipients or perhaps it could simply limit the size of joint fundraising committees.such alternatives to the aggregate limits properly refocus the inquiry on the delinquent actor the recipient of a contribution within the base limits,who then routes the money in a manner that undermines those limits.see citizens united,supra,at bartnicki vopper.
indeed,congress has adopted transfer restrictions,and the court has upheld them,in the context of state party spending.see b.levin funds are donations permissible under state law that may be spent on certain federal election activity namely,voter registration and identification,efforts,or generic campaign activities.levin funds are raised directly by the state or local party committee that ultimately spends them.b b iv.that means that other party committees may not transfer levin funds,solicit levin funds on behalf of the particular state or local committee,or engage in joint fundraising of levin funds.see mcconnell,at.mcconnell upheld those transfer restrictions as justifiable anticircumvention measures,though it acknowledged that they posed some associational burdens,at.here,a narrow transfer restriction on contributions that could otherwise be recontributed in excess of the base limits could rely on a similar justification.
other alternatives might focus on earmarking.many of the scenarios that the government and the dissent involve at least implicit agreements to circumvent the base limits agreements that are already prohibited by the earmarking rules.see cfr.the fec might strengthen those rules further by,for example,defining how many candidates a pac must support in order to ensure that a substantial portion of a donor contribution is not rerouted to a certain candidate.h.congress might also consider a modified version of the aggregate limits,such as one that prohibits donors who have contributed the current maximum sums from further contributing to political committees that have indicated they will support candidates to whom the donor has already contributed.to be sure,the existing earmarking provision does not define the outer limit of acceptable tailoring.colorado republican federal campaign,at.but tighter rules could have a significant effect,especially when adopted in concert with other measures.
we do not mean to opine on the validity of any particular proposal.the point is that there are numerous alternative approaches available to congress to prevent circumvention of the base limits.
finally,disclosure of contributions minimizes the potential for abuse of the campaign finance system.disclosure requirements are in part justified based on a governmental interest in provid ing the electorate with information about the sources of spending.citizens united,at quoting buckley,supra,at.they may also deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity.at.disclosure requirements burden speech,but unlike the aggregate limits they do not impose a ceiling on speech.citizens united,supra,at but see mcconnell,supra,at opinion of thomas.for that reason,disclosure often represents a less restrictive alternative to flat bans on certain types or quantities of speech.see,federal election comm massachusetts citizens for life.
with modern technology,disclosure now offers a particularly effective means of arming the voting public with information.in,the court observed that congress could regard disclosure as only a partial measure.buckley,at.that perception was understandable in a world in which information about campaign contributions was filed at fec offices and was therefore virtually inaccessible to the average member of the public.see brief for cause of action institute as amicus curiae.today,given the internet,disclosure offers much more robust protections against corruption.see citizens united,supra,at.reports and databases are available on the fec web site almost immediately after they are filed,supplemented by private entities such as and.because massive quantities of information can be accessed at the click of a mouse,disclosure is effective to a degree not possible at the time buckley,or even mcconnell,was decided.
the existing aggregate limits may in fact encourage the movement of money away from entities subject to.because individuals direct contributions are limited,donors may turn to other avenues for political speech.see citizens united,supra,at.individuals can,for example,contribute unlimited amounts to c organizations,which are not required to publicly disclose their donors.see d.such organizations spent some million on independent expenditures in the election cycle.
at oral argument,the government shifted its focus from buckley anticircumvention rationale to an argument that the aggregate limits deter corruption regardless of their ability to prevent circumvention of the base limits.see tr.of oral arg.the government argued that there is an opportunity for corruption whenever a large check is given to a legislator,even if the check consists of contributions within the base limits to be appropriately divided among numerous candidates and committees.the aggregate limits,the argument goes,ensure that the check amount does not become too large.that new rationale for the aggregate limits embraced by the dissent,see post,at does not wash.it dangerously broadens the circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in our prior cases,and targets as corruption the general,support of a political party.
in analyzing the base limits,buckley made clear that the risk of corruption arises when an individual makes large contributions to the candidate or officeholder himself.see,at.buckley analysis of the aggregate limit under feca was similarly confined.the court noted that the aggregate limit guarded against an individual funneling through circumvention massive amounts of money to a particular candidate.at emphasis added.we have reiterated that understanding several times.see,national conservative political action,at quid pro quo corruption occurs when e lected officials are influenced to act contrary to their obligations of office by the prospect of financial gain to themselves or infusions of money into their campaigns emphasis added citizens against rent for fair housing berkeley,buckley holding that contribution limits are permissible relates to the perception of undue influence of large contributors to a candidate mcconnell,at opinion of kennedy,quid pro quo corruption in buckley involved contributions that flowed to a particular candidate benefit emphasis added.
of course a candidate would be pleased with a donor who contributed not only to the candidate himself,but also to other candidates from the same party,to party committees,and to pacs supporting the party.but there is a clear,administrable line between money beyond the base limits funneled in an identifiable way to a candidate for which the candidate feels obligated and money within the base limits given widely to a candidate party for which the candidate,like all other members of the party,feels grateful.
when donors furnish widely distributed support within all applicable base limits,all members of the party or supporters of the cause may benefit,and the leaders of the party or cause may feel particular gratitude.that gratitude stems from the basic nature of the party system,in which party members join together to further common political beliefs,and citizens can choose to support a party because they share some,most,or all of those beliefs.see tashjian republican party of.to recast such shared interest,standing alone,as an opportunity for quid pro quo corruption would dramatically expand government regulation of the political process.california democratic party jones,recognizing the government role to play in structuring and monitoring the election process,but rejecting the proposition that party affairs are public affairs,free of first amendment protections 
the government suggests that it is the solicitation of large contributions that poses the danger of corruption,see tr.of oral arg,see also post,at,but the aggregate limits are not limited to any direct solicitation by an officeholder or candidate.mcconnell,supra,at,opinion of kennedy,rejecting a ban on soft money contributions to national parties,but approving a ban on the solicitation of such contributions as a direct and necessary regulation of federal candidates and officeholders receipt of quids we have no occasion to consider a law that would specifically ban candidates from soliciting donations within the base limits that would go to many other candidates,and would add up to a large sum.for our purposes here,it is enough that the aggregate limits at issue are not directed specifically to candidate behavior.
for the past years,our campaign finance jurisprudence has focused on the need to preserve authority for the government to combat corruption,without at the same time compromising the political responsiveness at the heart of the democratic process,or allowing the government to favor some participants in that process over others.as edmund burke explained in his famous speech to the electors of bristol,a representative owes constituents the exercise of his mature judgment,but judgment informed by the strictest union,the closest correspondence,and the most unreserved communication with his constituents.the speeches of the right edmund burke burke ed.constituents have the right to support candidates who share their views and concerns.representatives are not to follow constituent orders,but can be expected to be cognizant of and responsive to those concerns.such responsiveness is key to the very concept of through elected officials.
the government has a strong interest,no less critical to our democratic system,in combatting corruption and its appearance.we have,however,held that this interest must be limited to a specific kind of corruption quid pro quo corruption in order to ensure that the government efforts do not have the effect of restricting the first amendment right of citizens to choose who shall govern them.for the reasons set forth,we conclude that the aggregate limits on contributions do not further the only governmental interest this court accepted as legitimate in buckley.they instead intrude without justification on a citizen ability to exercise the most fundamental first amendment activities.buckley,at.
the judgment of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

i adhere to the view that this court decision in buckley valeo,per curiam,denigrates core first amendment speech and should be overruled.see randall sorrell,thomas,concurring in judgment federal election comm beaumont,thomas,dissenting federal election comm colorado republican federal campaign,colorado ii thomas,dissenting nixon shrink missouri government pac,thomas,dissenting colorado republican federal campaign comm.federal election comm n,colorado i thomas,concurring in judgment and dissenting in part.
political speech is the primary object of first amendment protection and the lifeblood of a people.colorado ii,supra,at thomas,dissenting.contributions to political campaigns,no less than direct expenditures,generate essential political speech by fostering discussion of public issues and candidate qualifications.shrink missouri,supra,at thomas,dissenting see also,at.buckley itself recognized that both contribution and expenditure limits operate in an area of the most fundamental first amendment activities and implicate fundamental first amendment interests.at.but instead of treating political giving and political spending alike,buckley distinguished the two,embracing a bifurcated standard of review under which contribution limits receive less rigorous scrutiny,at.
as i have explained before,t he analytic foundation of buckley was tenuous from the very beginning and has only continued to erode in the intervening years.shrink missouri,supra,at thomas,dissenting.to justify a lesser standard of review for contribution limits,buckley relied on the premise that contributions are different in kind from direct expenditures.none of the court bases for that premise withstands careful review.the linchpin of the court analysis was its assertion that w hile contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views to the voters,the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor.at.but that speech by proxy rationale quickly breaks down,given that e ven in the case of a direct expenditure,there is usually some that facilitates the dissemination of the spender message for instance,an advertising agency or a television station.colorado i,supra,at opinion of thomas.moreover,we have since rejected the proxy speech approach as affording insufficient first amendment protection to the voices of those of modest means as opposed to those sufficiently wealthy to be able to buy expensive media ads with their own resources.federal election comm national conservative political action,see shrink missouri,supra,at thomas,dissenting.
the remaining justifications buckley provided are also flawed.for example,buckley claimed that contribution limits entail only a marginal speech restriction because a contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views,but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support.at.but this court has never required a speaker to explain the reasons for his position in order to obtain full first amendment protection.instead,we have consistently held that speech is protected even when the underlying basis for a position is not given.shrink missouri,supra,at,thomas,dissenting see,city of ladue gilleo,sign reading for peace in the gulf texas johnson,flag burning tinker des moines independent community school,black armband signifying opposition to vietnam war see also colorado i,supra,at opinion of thomas,even a pure message of support,unadorned with reasons,is valuable to the democratic process 
equally unpersuasive is buckley suggestion that contribution limits warrant less stringent review because t he quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution,and a t most,the size of the contribution provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributor support for the candidate.at.contributions do increase the quantity of communication by amplifying the voice of the candidate and help ing to ensure the dissemination of the messages that the contributor wishes to convey.shrink missouri,supra,at thomas,dissenting.they also serve as a quantifiable metric of the intensity of a particular contributor support,as demonstrated by the frequent practice of giving different amounts to different candidates.buckley simply failed to recognize that we have accorded full first amendment protection to expressions of intensity.at,see also cohen california,protecting the use of an obscenity for emphasis.
although today decision represents a faithful application of our precedents,the plurality discussion of buckley omits any reference to these discarded rationales.instead,the plurality alludes only to buckley last remaining reason for devaluing political contributions relative to expenditures.see ante,at quoting buckley,at.the relevant sentence from buckley reads as follows 
a limitation on the amount of money a person may give to a candidate or campaign organization thus involves little direct restraint on his political communication,for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor freedom to discuss candidates and issues.ibid.
that proposition,read in full,can not be squared with a key premise of today decision.
among the government justifications for the aggregate limits set forth in the bipartisan campaign reform act of bcra is that an individual can engage in the symbolic act of contributing to as many entities as he wishes.brief for appellee.that is,the government contends that aggregate limits are constitutional as long as an individual can still contribute some token amount a dime,for example to each of his preferred candidates.the plurality,quite correctly,rejects that argument,noting that i t is no answer to say that the individual can simply contribute less money to more people.ante,at.that is so because t o require one person to contribute at lower levels than others because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to impose a special burden on broader participation in the democratic process.ibid.
what the plurality does not recognize is that the same logic also defeats the reasoning from buckley on which the plurality purports to rely.under the plurality analysis,limiting the amount of money a person may give to a candidate does impose a direct restraint on his political communication if it did not,the aggregate limits at issue here would not create a special burden on broader participation in the democratic process.ibid.i am wholly in agreement with the plurality conclusion on this point t he government may not penalize an individual for robustly exercis ing his first amendment rights.ibid.quoting davis federal election comm n.i regret only that the plurality does not acknowledge that today decision,although purporting not to overrule buckley,continues to chip away at its footings.
in sum,what remains of buckley is a rule without a rationale.contributions and expenditures are simply two sides of the same first amendment coin,and our efforts to distinguish the two have produced mere word games rather than any cognizable principle of constitutional law.buckley,supra,at,burger,concurring in part and dissenting in part.for that reason,i would overrule buckley and subject the aggregate limits in bcra to strict scrutiny,which they would surely fail.see colorado i,at opinion of thomas,i am convinced that under traditional strict scrutiny,broad prophylactic caps on both spending and giving in the political process are unconstitutional 
this case represents yet another missed opportunity to right the course of our campaign finance jurisprudence by restoring a standard that is faithful to the first amendment.until we undertake that reexamination,we remain in a halfway house of our own design.shrink missouri,at kennedy,dissenting.for these reasons,i concur only in the judgment.

the overall ceiling does impose an ultimate restriction upon the number of candidates and committees with which an individual may associate himself by means of financial support.but this quite modest restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate,or huge contributions to the candidate political party.the limited,additional restriction on freedom imposed by the overall ceiling is thus no more than a corollary of the basic individual contribution limitation that we have found to be constitutionally valid.at.
today a majority of the court overrules this holding.it is wrong to do so.its conclusion rests upon its own,not a,view of the facts.its legal analysis is faulty it misconstrues the nature of the competing constitutional interests at stake.it understates the importance of protecting the political integrity of our governmental institutions.it creates a loophole that will allow a single individual to contribute millions of dollars to a political party or to a candidate campaign.taken together with citizens united federal election comm n,today decision eviscerates our nation campaign finance laws,leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intended to resolve.
the plurality concludes that the aggregate contribution limits unnecessar ily abridg e first amendment rights.ante,at,quoting buckley,supra,at.it notes that some individuals will wish to spen d substantial amounts of money in order to communicate their political ideas through sophisticated means.ante,at quoting federal election comm national conservative political action,ncpac.aggregate contribution ceilings limit an individual ability to engage in such broader participation in the democratic process,while insufficiently advancing any legitimate governmental objective.ante,at.hence,the plurality finds,they violate the constitution.
the plurality conclusion rests upon three separate but related claims.each is fatally flawed.first,the plurality says that given the base limits on contributions to and political committees,aggregate limits do not further any independent governmental objective worthy of protection.and that is because,given the base limits,s pending large sums of money in connection with elections does not give rise to corruption.ante,at.in making this argument,the plurality relies heavily upon a narrow definition of corruption that excludes efforts to obtain influence over or access to elected officials or political parties.ibid.quoting citizens united,supra,at accord,ante,at.
second,the plurality assesses the instrumental objective of the aggregate limits,namely,safeguarding the base limits.it finds that they do not serve that function in any meaningful way.ante,at.that is because,even without the aggregate limits,the possibilities for circumventing the base limits are implausible and divorced from reality.ante,at.
third,the plurality says the aggregate limits are not a reasonable policy tool.rather,they are poorly tailored to the government interest in preventing circumvention of the base limits.ante,at quoting board of trustees of state of fox.the plurality imagines several alternative regulations that it says might just as effectively thwart circumvention.accordingly,it finds,the aggregate caps are out of proportion to the anticorruption interest served.ante,at quoting fox,supra,at.
the plurality first claim that large aggregate contributions do not give rise to corruption is plausible only because the plurality defines corruption too narrowly.the plurality describes the constitutionally permissible objective of campaign finance regulation as follows congress may target only a specific type of corruption quid pro quo corruption.ante,at.it then defines quid pro quo corruption to mean no more than a direct exchange of an official act for money an act akin to bribery.ante,at.it adds specifically that corruption does not include efforts to garner influence over or access to elected officials or political parties.ante,at quoting citizens united,supra,at.moreover,the government efforts to prevent the appearance of corruption are equally confined to the appearance of quid pro quo corruption,as narrowly defined.ante,at.in the plurality view,a federal statute could not prevent an individual from writing a million dollar check to a political party by donating to its various committees,because the rationale for any limit would dangerously broade n the circumscribed definition of quid pro quo corruption articulated in our prior cases.ante,at.
this critically important definition of corruption is inconsistent with the court prior case law with the possible exception of citizens united,as i will explain below.it is virtually impossible to reconcile with this court decision in mcconnell,upholding the bipartisan campaign reform act of bcra.and it misunderstands the constitutional importance of the interests at stake.in fact,constitutional interests indeed,first amendment interests lie on both sides of the legal equation.
in reality,as the history of campaign finance reform shows and as our earlier cases on the subject have recognized,the anticorruption interest that drives congress to regulate campaign contributions is a far broader,more important interest than the plurality acknowledges.it is an interest in maintaining the integrity of our public governmental institutions.and it is an interest rooted in the constitution and in the first amendment itself.
consider at least one reason why the first amendment protects political speech.speech does not exist in a vacuum.rather,political communication seeks to secure government action.a politically oriented marketplace of ideas seeks to form a public opinion that can and will influence elected representatives.
this is not a new idea.years ago,justice brandeis wrote that the first amendment protection of speech was essential to effective democracy.whitney california,concurring opinion.chief justice hughes reiterated the same idea shortly thereafter a fundamental principle of our constitutional system is the maintenance of the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people.stromberg california,emphasis added.in citizens united,the court stated that s peech is an essential mechanism of democracy,for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the people.at emphasis added.
the framers had good reason to emphasize this same connection between political speech and governmental action.an influential continental philosopher had argued that in a representative democracy,the people lose control of their representatives between elections,during which interim periods they were in chains.rousseau,an inquiry into the nature of the social contract transl.
the framers responded to this criticism both by requiring frequent elections to federal office,and by enacting a first amendment that would facilitate a chain of communication between the people,and those,to whom they have committed the exercise of the powers of government.wilson,commentaries on the constitution of the united states of america.this chain would establish the necessary communion of interests and sympathy of sentiments between the people and their representatives,so that public opinion could be channeled into effective governmental action.the federalist,cooke ed.madison accord,benton,abridgement of the debates of congress,from to,explaining that the first amendment will strengthen american democracy by giving the people a right to publicly address their representatives,privately advise them,or declare their sentiments by petition to the whole body quoting james madison.accordingly,the first amendment advances not only the individual right to engage in political speech,but also the public interest in preserving a democratic order in which collective speech matters.
what has this to do with corruption it has everything to do with corruption.corruption breaks the constitutionally necessary chain of communication between the people and their representatives.it derails the essential tie.where enough money calls the tune,the general public will not be heard.insofar as corruption cuts the link between political thought and political action,a free marketplace of political ideas loses its point.that is one reason why the court has stressed the constitutional importance of congress concern that a few large donations not drown out the voices of the many.see,buckley,at.
that is also why the court has used the phrase subversion of the political process to describe circumstances in which e lected officials are influenced to act contrary to their obligations of office by the prospect of financial gain to themselves or infusions of money into their campaigns.ncpac,at.see also federal election comm national right to work,the government interests in preventing corruption directly implicate the integrity of our electoral process internal quotation marks and citation omitted.see generally post,citizens divided campaign reform and the constitution,forthcoming arguing that the efficacy of american democracy depends on electoral integrity and the responsiveness of public officials to public opinion.
the appearance of corruption can make matters worse.it can lead the public to believe that its efforts to communicate with its representatives or to help sway public opinion have little purpose.and a cynical public can lose interest in political participation altogether.see nixon shrink missouri government pac,t he cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance democracy,the court has often said,can not work unless the people have faith in those who govern.united states mississippi valley generating.
the upshot is that the interests the court has long described as preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption are more than ordinary factors to be weighed against the constitutional right to political speech.rather,they are interests rooted in the first amendment itself.they are rooted in the constitutional effort to create a democracy responsive to the people a government where laws reflect the very thoughts,views,ideas,and sentiments,the expression of which the first amendment protects.given that end,we can and should understand campaign finance laws as resting upon a broader and more significant constitutional rationale than the plurality limited definition of corruption suggests.we should see these laws as seeking in significant part to strengthen,rather than weaken,the first amendment.to say this is not to deny the potential for conflict between the need to permit contributions that pay for the diffusion of ideas,and the need to limit payments in order to help maintain the integrity of the electoral process.but that conflict takes place within,not outside,the first amendment boundaries.
since the kinds of corruption that can destroy the link between public opinion and governmental action extend well beyond those the plurality describes,the plurality notion of corruption is flatly inconsistent with the basic constitutional rationale i have just described.thus,it should surprise no one that this court case law citizens united excepted insists upon a considerably broader definition.
in buckley,for instance,the court said explicitly that aggregate limits were constitutional because they helped prevent evasion through huge contributions to the candidate political party,at the contrary to what the plurality today seems to believe,see ante,at.moreover,buckley upheld the base limits in significant part because they helped thwart the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.at emphasis added.and it said that congress could reasonably conclude that criminal laws forbidding the giving and taking of bribes did not adequately deal with the reality or appearance of corruption.at.bribery laws,the court recognized,address only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action.ibid.the concern with corruption extends further.
other cases put the matter yet more strongly.in beaumont,for example,the court found constitutional a ban on direct contributions by corporations because of the need to prevent corruption,properly understood not only as quid pro quo agreements,but also as undue influence on an officeholder judgment.federal election comm beaumont.in federal election comm colorado republican federal campaign,colo rado ii,the court upheld limits imposed upon coordinated expenditures among parties and candidates because it found they thwarted corruption and its appearance,again understood as including undue influence by wealthy donors.in shrink missouri,the court upheld limitations imposed by the missouri legislature upon contributions to state political candidates,not only because of the need to prevent bribery,but also because of the broader threat from politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contributors.at.
most important,in mcconnell,this court considered the constitutionality of the bipartisan campaign reform act of,an act that set new limits on soft money contributions to political parties.soft money referred to funds that,prior to bcra,were freely donated to parties for activities other than directly helping elect a federal candidate activities such as voter registration,get out the vote drives,and advertising that did not expressly advocate a federal candidate election or defeat,at.bcra imposed a new ban on soft money contributions to national party committees,and greatly curtailed them in respect to state and local parties,at.
the court in mcconnell upheld these new contribution restrictions under the first amendment for the very reason the plurality today discounts or ignores.namely,the court found they thwarted a significant risk of corruption understood not as quid pro quo bribery,but as privileged access to and pernicious influence upon elected representatives.
in reaching its conclusion in mcconnell,the court relied upon a vast record compiled in the district court.that record consisted of over pages of material and included testimony from more than witnesses.see supp,dc per curiam.what it showed,in detail,was the web of relationships and understandings among parties,candidates,and large donors that underlies privileged access and influence.see mcconnell,at.the district judges in mcconnell made clear that the record did not contain any evidence of bribery or vote buying in exchange for donations of nonfederal money.supp,at opinion of,emphasis added.indeed,no one had identified a single discrete instance of quid pro quo corruption due to soft money,at opinion of henderson.but what the record did demonstrate was that enormous soft money contributions,ranging between million and million among the largest donors,enabled wealthy contributors to gain disproportionate access to federal lawmakers and the ability to influenc e legislation.at opinion of.there was an indisputable link between generous political donations and opportunity after opportunity to make one case directly to a member of congress.
testimony by elected officials supported this conclusion.see,ibid.large donors of both hard and soft money receive special treatment simpson,at donations,including soft money donations to political parties,do affect how congress operates.it only natural,and happens all too often,that a busy senator with minutes to spare will spend those minutes returning the call of a large soft money donor boren,at at a minimum,large soft money donations purchase an opportunity for the donors to make their case to elected officials mccain.furthermore,testimony from party operatives showed that national political parties had created major donor programs,through which they openly offer ed greater access to federal office holders as the donations gr e w larger.at.i have placed in appendix a more examples of the kind of evidence that filled the district court record in mcconnell.
this court upheld bcra limitations on soft money contributions by relying on just the kind of evidence i have described.we wrote 
the evidence in the record shows that candidates and donors alike have in fact exploited the loophole,the former to increase their prospects of election and the latter to create debt on the part of officeholders.plaintiffs argue that without concrete evidence of an instance in which a federal officeholder has actually switched a vote in exchange for soft money,congress has not shown that there exists real or apparent corruption p laintiffs conceive of corruption too narrowly.our cases have firmly established that congress legitimate interest extends beyond preventing simple corruption to curbing undue influence on an officeholder judgment,and the appearance of such influence.at,quoting colorado ii,at emphasis added paragraphs and paragraph breaks omitted.
we specifically rejected efforts to define corruption in ways similar to those the plurality today accepts.we added 
just as troubling to a functioning democracy as classic quid pro quo corruption is the danger that officeholders will decide issues not on the merits or the desires of their constituencies,but according to the wishes of those who have made large financial contributions valued by the officeholder.at.
insofar as today decision sets forth a significantly definition of corruption,and hence of the public interest in political integrity,it is flatly inconsistent with mcconnell.
one case,however,contains language that offers the plurality support.that case is citizens united.there,as the plurality points out,ante,at,the court said that w hen buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption,that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption.at.further,the court said that quid pro quo corruption does not include influence over or access to elected officials,because generic favoritism or influence theory is at odds with standard first amendment analyses.ibid.quoting mcconnell,supra,at kennedy,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part.
how should we treat these statements from citizens united now they are not essential to the court holding in the case at least insofar as it can be read to require federal law to treat corporations and trade unions like individuals when they independently pay for,television advertising during the last days of a federal election.citizens united,supra,at.taken literally,the statements cited simply refer to and characterize court cases.they do not require the more absolute reading that the plurality here gives them.
more than that.read as the plurality reads them today,the statements from citizens united about the proper contours of the corruption rationale conflict not just with language in the mcconnell opinion,but with mcconnell very holding.see supra,at.did the court in citizens united intend to overrule mcconnell i doubt it,for if it did,the court or certainly the dissent would have said something about it.the total silence of all opinions in citizens united with respect to this matter argues strongly in favor of treating the language quoted above as dictum,as an overstatement,or as limited to the context in which it appears.citizens united itself contains language that supports the last mentioned reading,for it says that buckley did not extend this rationale about the reality or appearance of corruption to independent expenditures,and the court does not do so here.at emphasis added.and it adds that,while t he bcra record establishes that certain donations to political parties,called soft money,were made to gain access to elected officials,t his case,however,is about independent expenditures,not soft money.at emphasis added.
the plurality use of citizens united narrow definition of corruption here,however,is a different matter.that use does not come accompanied with a limiting context independent expenditures by corporations and unions or limiting language.it applies to the whole of campaign finance regulation.and,as i have pointed out,it is flatly inconsistent with the broader definition of corruption upon which mcconnell holding depends.
so does the court intend today to overrule mcconnell or does it intend to leave mcconnell and bcra in place the plurality says the latter.ante,at,our holding about the constitutionality of the aggregate limits clearly does not overrule mcconnell holding about soft money but how does the plurality explain its rejection of the broader definition of corruption,upon which mcconnell holding depends compare ante,at,with mcconnell,at.
the plurality invalidates the aggregate contribution limits for a second reason.it believes they are no longer needed to prevent contributors from circumventing federal limits on direct contributions to individuals,political parties,and political action committees.ante,at.buckley,at aggregate limits prevent evasion of base contribution limits.other campaign finance laws,combined with experience and common sense,foreclose the various circumvention scenarios that the government hypothesizes.ante,at.accordingly,the plurality concludes,the aggregate limits provide no added benefit.
the plurality is wrong.here,as in buckley,in the absence of limits on aggregate political contributions,donors can and likely will find ways to channel millions of dollars to parties and to individual candidates,producing precisely the kind of corruption or appearance of corruption that previously led the court to hold aggregate limits constitutional.those opportunities for circumvention will also produce the type of corruption that concerns the plurality today.the methods for using today opinion to evade the law individual contribution limits are complex,but they are well known,or will become well known,to party fundraisers.i shall describe three.
example one gifts for the benefit of the party.campaign finance law permits each individual to give over two years to a national party committee.a b fed.reg.the two major political parties each have three national committees.ante,at.federal law also entitles an individual to give to a state party committee over two years.a d.each major political party has such committees.those individual limits mean that,in the absence of any aggregate limit,an individual could legally give to the republican party or to the democratic party about million over two years.see appendix b,table,infra,at.to make it easier for contributors to give gifts of this size,each party could create a joint party committee,comprising all of its national and state party committees.the titular heads could be the speaker of the house of representatives and the minority leader of the house.a contributor could then write a single check to the joint party committee and its staff would divide the funds so that each constituent unit receives no more than it could obtain from the contributor directly for a national committee over two years,for a state committee over the same.before today decision,the total size of rich donor check to the joint party committee was capped at the aggregate limit for donations to political parties over a election cycle.see a b fed.reg.after today decision,rich donor can write a single check to the joint party committee in an amount of about million.
will political parties seek these large checks why not the recipient national and state committees can spend the money to buy generic party advertisements,say television commercials or bumper stickers saying support republicans,support democrats,or the like.they also can transfer the money to party committees in battleground states to increase the chances of winning hotly contested seats.see a permitting national or state political committees to make unlimited transfers to other committees of the same political party 
will party officials and candidates solicit these large contributions from wealthy donors absolutely.such contributions will help increase the party power,as well as the candidate standing among his colleagues.
will elected officials be particularly grateful to the large donor,feeling obliged to provide him special access and influence,and perhaps even a quid pro quo legislative favor that is what we have previously believed.see mcconnell,at large donations at a candidate or officeholder behest give rise to all of the same corruption concerns posed by contributions made directly to the candidate or officeholder at opinion of kennedy,the making of a solicited gift is a quid both to the recipient of the money and to the one who solicits the payment colorado ii,at,explaining how a candidate can become a player in his party beyond his own race by directing donations to the party and making sure that the party knows who raised the money,and that the donor influence is multiplied in such instances.and,as the statements collected in appendix a,infra,make clear,we have believed this with good reason.
example two donations to individual candidates the million check.the first example significantly understates the problem.that is because federal election law also allows a single contributor to give to each party candidate over a election cycle assuming the candidate is running in both a primary and a general election.a a fed.reg.there are party candidates for house seats and party candidates for senate seats in any given election year.that makes an additional million in allowable contributions.thus,without an aggregate limit,the law will permit a wealthy individual to write a check,over a election cycle,for million all to benefit his political party and its candidates.see appendix b,table a,infra,at.
to make it easier for a wealthy donor to make a contribution of this size,the parties can simply enlarge the composition of the joint party committee described in example one,so that it now includes party candidates.and a party can proliferate such joint entities,perhaps calling the first the smith victory committee,the second the jones victory committee,and the like.see cfr c.i say perhaps because too transparent a name might call into play certain earmarking rules.but the federal election commission fec database of joint fundraising committees in shows similarly named entities,landrieu wyden victory fund,
as i have just said,without any aggregate limit,the law will allow rich donor to write a single check to,say,the smith victory committee,for up to million.this check represents the total amount that the contributor could contribute to all of the participants in the committee over a cycle.c.the committee would operate under an agreement that provides a formula for the allocation of fundraising proceeds among its constituent units.c.and that formula would divide the proceeds so that no committee or candidate receives more than it could have received from rich donor directly,or.see c.
so what is wrong with that the check is considerably larger than example one check.but is there anything else wrong the answer is yes,absolutely.the law will also permit a party and its candidates to shift most of rich donor contributions to a single candidate,say smith.here is how 
the law permits each candidate and each party committee in the smith victory committee to write candidate smith a check directly.for his primary and general elections combined,they can write checks of up to from each candidate authorized campaign committee and from each state and national committee.e b,a a cfr b.this yields a potential from candidates plus from party committees.thus,the law permits the candidates and party entities to redirect million of rich donor million check to candidate smith.it also permits state and national committees to contribute to smith general election campaign through making coordinated expenditures in amounts that range from to million for a general election depending upon the size of smith state and whether he is running for a house or senate seat.fed.reg.see appendix b,table b,infra,at.
the upshot is that candidate smith can receive at least million and possibly the full million contributed by rich donor to the smith victory committee,even though the funds must first be divided up among the constituent units before they can be rerouted to smith.nothing requires the smith victory committee to explain in advance to rich donor all of the various transfers that will take place,and nothing prevents the entities in the committee from informing the donor and the receiving candidate after the fact what has transpired.accordingly,the money can be donated and rerouted to candidate smith without the donor having violated the base limits or any other fec regulation.and the evidence in the mcconnell record reprinted in appendix a,infra with respect to soft money contributions makes clear that candidate smith will almost certainly come to learn from whom he has received this money.
the parties can apply the same procedure to other large donations,channeling money from rich donor two to candidate jones.if or candidates face particularly tight races,party committees and party candidates may work together to channel rich donor one multimillion dollar contribution to the most embattled candidate,candidate smith,rich donor two multimillion dollar contribution to the second most embattled candidate,candidate jones,and so on down the line.if this does not count as evasion of the base limits,what does present aggregate limits confine the size of any individual gift to.today opinion creates a loophole measured in the millions.
example three proliferating political action pacs.campaign finance law prohibits an individual from contributing more than to any candidate in a federal election cycle,and more than to a pac in a calendar year.a a,c fed.reg.it also prohibits any pac from contributing more than to any candidate in an election cycle.a a.but the law does not prohibit an individual from contributing within the current biannual aggregate limit to each of an unlimited total number of pacs.and there,so to speak,lies the rub.
here is how,without any aggregate limits,a party will be able to channel million from each of ten rich donors to each of ten embattled candidates.groups of party supporters individuals,corporations,or trade unions create pacs.each pac claims it will use the funds it raises to support several candidates from the party,though it will favor those who are most endangered.each pac qualifies for multicandidate status because it has received contributions from more than persons and has made contributions to five federal candidates at some point previously.a cfr e.over a election cycle,rich donor one gives to each pac per year yielding million total.rich donor does the same.so,too,do the other eight rich donors.this brings their total donations to million,disbursed among the pacs.each pac will have collected,and each can use its money to write ten checks of to each of the ten most embattled candidates in the party over two years.see appendix b,table,infra,at.every embattled candidate,receiving a check from pacs,will have collected million.
the upshot is that ten rich donors will have contributed million each,and ten embattled candidates will have collected million each.in this example,unlike example two,the recipient candidates may not know which of the ten rich donors is personally responsible for the million he or she receives.but the recipient candidate is highly likely to know who the ten rich donors are,and to feel appropriately grateful.moreover,the ability of a small group of donors to contribute this kind of money to threatened candidates is not insignificant.in the example above with ten rich donors giving million each,and ten embattled candidates receiving million each the contributions would have been enough to finance a considerable portion of,and perhaps all of,the candidates races in the elections.see appendix c,table,infra,at showing that in,the average winning house candidate spent million and the average winning senate candidate spent million.
the plurality believes that the three scenarios i have just depicted either pose no threat,or can not or will not take place.it does not believe the scenario depicted in example one is any cause for concern,because it involves only general,support of a political party.ante,at.not so.a candidate who solicits a multimillion dollar check for his party will be deeply grateful to the checkwriter,and surely could reward him with a quid pro quo favor.the plurality discounts the scenarios depicted in example two and example three because it finds such circumvention tactics illegal under current campaign finance laws,implausible,or divorced from reality.ante,at.but they are not.
the plurality view depends in large part upon its claim that since this court decided buckley in,changes in either statutory law or in applicable regulations have come to make it difficult,if not impossible,for these circumvention scenarios to arise.hence,it concludes,there is no longer a need for aggregate contribution limits.see ante,at.but a closer examination of the five legal changes to which the plurality points makes clear that those changes can not effectively stop the abuses that i have depicted.
first,the plurality points out that in a few months after this court decided buckley congress added limits on contributions to political committees,to pacs.ante,at accord,stat.codified at a c.but example three,the example,takes account of those limits,namely,to a pac in any given year.and it shows that the limit does not matter much when it comes to the potential for circumvention,as long as party supporters can create dozens or hundreds of pacs.federal law places no upper limit on the number of pacs supporting a party or a group of party candidates that can be established.and creating a pac is primarily a matter of paperwork,a knowledgeable staff person,and a little time.
second,the plurality points out that in,congress also added an antiproliferation rule prohibiting donors from creating or controlling multiple affiliated political committees.ante,at.the rule provides that all contributions made by political committees established or financed or maintained or controlled by the same corporation,labor organization,person,or group of persons,shall be considered to have been made by a single political committee.a.but different supporters can create different pacs.indeed,there were roughly nonconnected pacs,pacs not connected to a specific corporation or labor union operating during the elections.ante,at.in a future without aggregate contribution limits,far more nonconnected pacs will likely appear.the plurality also notes that the fec can examine certain circumstantial factors,such as common or overlapping membership or similar patterns of contributions,to determine whether a group of pacs are affiliated.ante,at quoting cfr g ii.but the ultimate question in the affiliation inquiry is whether one committee or organization has been established,financed,maintain or controlled by another committee or sponsoring organization.ibid.just because a group of multicandidate pacs all support the same party and all decide to donate funds to a group of endangered candidates in that party does not mean they will qualify as affiliated under the relevant definition.this rule appears inadequate to stop the sort of circumvention depicted in example three.
third,the plurality says that a regulation has strengthened the statute earmarking provision.ante,at.namely,the plurality points to a rule promulgated by the fec in,specifying that earmarking includes any designation whether direct or indirect,express or implied,oral or written.ibid.quoting cfr b accord,fed.reg.this means that if rich donor were to give to a pac while designat ing in any way that the money go to candidate smith,those funds must count towards rich donor total allowable contributions to smith per election cycle.but the virtually identical earmarking provision in effect when this court decided buckley would have required the same thing.that provision also counted,when applying the base contribution limits,all contributions made by a person,either directly or indirectly,on behalf of a particular candidate,including contributions which are in any way earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary or conduit to a candidate.stat.accord,a same.what is the difference 
fourth,the plurality points out that the fec regulations specify that an individual who has contributed to a particular candidate committee may not also contribute to a committee for that candidate.ante,at citing cfr h emphasis added.the regulations,however,do not prevent a person who has contributed to a candidate from also contributing to multicandidate committees that support the candidate.indeed,the rules specifically authorize such contributions.see h a person may contribute to a candidate and also contribute to a political committee which has supported,or anticipates supporting,the same candidate in the same election,as long as the political committee is not the candidate principal campaign committee or a single candidate committee emphasis added.example three illustrates the latter kind of contribution.and briefs before us make clear that the possibility for circumventing the base limits through making such contributions is a realistic,not an illusory,one.see brief for appellee demonstrating that many pacs today explain in their public materials just what fairly small group of candidates they intend to support brief for americans for campaign reform as amicus curiae similar.
fifth,the plurality points to another fec regulation also added in,which says that an individual who has contributed to a candidate may not also contribute to a political committee that has supported or anticipates supporting the same candidate if the individual knows that a substantial portion of his contribution will be contributed to,or expended on behalf of,that candidate.ante,at quoting cfr h brackets in original accord,fed.reg.this regulation is important,for in principle,the fec might use it to prevent the circumstances that examples two and three set forth from arising.and it is not surprising that the plurality relies upon the existence of this rule when it describes those circumstances as implausible,illegal,or divorced from reality.ante,at.
in fact,however,this regulation is not the strong weapon that the plurality imagines.despite the plurality assurances,it does not disarm the possibilities for circumvention.ante,at.that is because the regulation requires a showing that donors have knowledge that a substantial portion of their contributions will be used by a pac to support a candidate to whom they have already contributed.h emphasis added.and knowledge is hard to prove.
i have found nine fec cases decided since the year that refer to this regulation.in all but one,the fec failed to find the requisite knowledge despite the presence of example two or example three circumstances.see factual and legal analysis,in re transfund pac,matter under review mur,fec,june,although the donor might reasonably infer that some portion of his contribution to a candidate leadership pac would be used to support the candidate,such an inference alone does not suggest that he had actual knowledge of such factual and legal analysis,in re john shadegg friends,mur,fec,t here is no basis on which to conclude that the donors knew that the funds they contributed to lead pac would be used to support the shadegg committee even though congressman shadegg solicited the donations and lead pac was congressman shadegg leadership pac factual and legal analysis,in re walberg for congress,mur,fec,finding seven contributors,who gave to a candidate and to a pac that provided of the candidate financing,had not shown knowledge factual and legal analysis,in re matt brown for senate,mur,fec,though it may be reasonable to infer that the individual donors solicited by brown gave to the state parties under the assumption that some portion of their contribution might then be donated to the brown committee,such an inference alone is insufficient to find reason to believe cfr h has been violated first general counsel report,in re liffrig for senate,mur,fec,similar first general counsel report,in re nesbitt,mur,fec,similar first general counsel report,in re keystone,mur,fec,similar general counsel report,in re boston capital,mur,fec,recommending the fec take no action with respect to the h issue.given this record of fec in activity,my reaction to the plurality reliance upon agency enforcement of this rule as an adequate substitute for congress aggregate limits is like oscar wilde after reading dickens account of the death of little nell one must have a heart of stone,said wilde,to read it without laughing.oxford dictionary of humorous quotations sherrin ed.
i have found one contrary example the single example to which the plurality refers.ante,at citing conciliation agreement,in re riley,murs,fec.in that case,the fec found probable cause to believe that three individual contributors to several pacs had the requisite knowledge that the pacs would use a substantial portion of their contributions to support a candidate to whom they had already contributed sam brownback,a candidate for the senate for two of the contributors,and robert riley,a candidate for the house for the third.the individuals had made donations to several pacs operating as a network,under the direction of a single political consulting firm.the two contributors to sam brownback were his,and the fec believed they might be using the pac network to channel extra support to him.the contributor to robert riley was his son,and the fec believed he might be doing the same.the facts in this case are unusual,for individual contributors are not typically relatives of the candidates they are seeking to support,and ordinary pacs do not tend to work in coordination under the direction of a firm.in any event,this single swallow can not make the plurality summer.
thus,it is not surprising that throughout the many years this fec regulation has been in effect,political parties and candidates have established ever more joint fundraising committees numbering over in the last federal elections candidates have established ever more leadership pacs numbering over in the last elections and party supporters have established ever more multicandidate pacs numbering over in the last elections.see appendix c,tables,infra,at fec,committee summary reporting the number of qualified or multicandidate pacs in,online at all internet materials as visited,and available in clerk of court case file.
using these entities,candidates,parties,and party supporters can transfer and,we are told,have transferred large sums of money to specific candidates,thereby avoiding the base contribution limits in ways that examples two and three help demonstrate.see brief for appellee,brief for campaign legal center,et as amici curiae brief of democratic members of the united states house of representatives as amici curiae.they have done so without drawing fec prosecution at least not according to my and apparently the plurality search of publicly available records.that is likely because in the real world,the methods of achieving circumvention are more subtle and more complex than our stylized examples two and three depict.and persons have used these entities to channel money to candidates without any individual breaching the current aggregate limit.the plurality now removes that limit,thereby permitting wealthy donors to make aggregate contributions not of,but of several millions of dollars.if the fec regulation has failed to plug a small hole,how can it possibly plug a large one 
the plurality concludes that even if circumvention were a threat,the aggregate limits are poorly tailored to address it.ante,at.the first amendment requires a fit that is reasonable,and there is no such fit here because there are several alternative ways congress could prevent evasion of the base limits.ibid.quoting fox,at.for instance,the plurality posits,congress or the fec could tighten transfer rules it could require contributions above the current aggregate limits to be deposited into segregated,nontransferable accounts and spent only by their recipients it could define how many candidates a pac must support in order to ensure that a substantial portion of a donor contribution is not rerouted to a certain candidate or it could prohibit donors who have contributed the current maximum sums from further contributing to political committees that have indicated they will support candidates to whom the donor has already contributed.ante,at quoting cfr h.
the plurality,however,does not show,or try to show,that these hypothetical alternatives could effectively replace aggregate contribution limits.indeed,it does not even opine on the validity of any particular proposal,ante,at presumably because these proposals themselves could be subject to constitutional challenges.for the most part,the alternatives the plurality mentions were similarly available at the time of buckley.their hypothetical presence did not prevent the court from upholding aggregate limits in.how can their continued hypothetical presence lead the plurality now to conclude that aggregate limits are poorly tailored see ante,at.how can their continued hypothetical presence lead the court to overrule buckley now 
in sum,the explanation of why aggregate limits are needed is complicated,as is the explanation of why other methods will not work.but the conclusion is simple there is no substantial mismatch between congress legitimate objective and the means selected to achieve it.ante,at.the court,as in buckley,should hold that aggregate contribution limits are constitutional.
the district court in this case,holding that buckley foreclosed mccutcheon constitutional challenge to the aggregate limits,granted the government motion to dismiss the complaint prior to a full evidentiary hearing.see supp,dc.if the plurality now believes the district court was wrong,then why does it not return the case for the further evidentiary development which has not yet taken place 
in the past,when evaluating the constitutionality of campaign finance restrictions,we have typically relied upon an evidentiary record amassed below to determine whether the law served a compelling governmental objective.and,typically,that record contained testimony from members of congress or state legislators explaining why congress or the legislature acted as it did.see,mcconnell,at upholding federal restrictions on soft money by drawing on an extensive district court record that contained declarations from current and former members of congress colorado ii,at upholding federal limits on coordinated expenditures between parties and candidates on the basis of a summary judgment record that contained declarations from party operatives,fundraisers,and members of congress shrink missouri,at upholding missouri contribution limits on the basis of the lower court record,which contained similar declarations.if we are to overturn an act of congress here,we should do so on the basis of a similar record.
for one thing,an evidentiary record can help us determine whether or the extent to which we should defer to congress own judgments,particularly those reflecting a balance of the countervailing first amendment interests i have described.determining whether anticorruption objectives justify a particular set of contribution limits requires answering empirically based questions,and applying significant discretion and judgment.to what extent will unrestricted giving lead to corruption or its appearance what forms will any such corruption take to what extent will a lack of regulation undermine public confidence in the democratic system to what extent can regulation restore it 
these kinds of questions,while not easily answered,are questions that congress is far better suited to resolve than are judges.thus,while court review of contribution limits has been and should be rigorous,buckley,at,we have also recognized that deference to legislative choice is warranted.beaumont,at.and that deference has taken account of facts and circumstances set forth in an evidentiary record.
for another thing,a comparison of the plurality opinion with this dissent reveals important differences of opinion on matters.we disagree,for example,on the possibilities for circumvention of the base limits in the absence of aggregate limits.we disagree about how effectively the plurality alternatives could prevent evasion.an evidentiary proceeding would permit the parties to explore these matters,and it would permit the courts to reach a more accurate judgment.the plurality rationalizes its haste to forgo an evidentiary record by noting that the parties have treated the question as a purely legal one.ante,at.but without a doubt,the legal question whether the aggregate limits are closely drawn to further a compelling governmental turns on factual questions about whether corruption,in the absence of such limits,is a realistic threat to our democracy.the plurality itself spends pages citing figures about campaign spending to defend its legal conclusion.ante,at.the problem with such reasoning is that this court expertise does not lie in marshaling facts in the primary instance.that is why in the past,when answering similar questions about the constitutionality of restrictions on campaign contributions,we have relied on an extensive evidentiary record produced below to inform our decision.
without further development of the record,however,i fail to see how the plurality can now find grounds for overturning buckley.the justification for aggregate contribution restrictions is strongly rooted in the need to assure political integrity and ultimately in the first amendment itself.part ii,supra.the threat to that integrity posed by the risk of special access and influence remains real.part iii,supra.even taking the plurality on its own terms and considering solely the threat of quid pro quo corruption,exchanges,the aggregate limits are a necessary tool to stop circumvention.ibid.and there is no basis for finding a lack of fit between the threat and the means used to combat it,namely the aggregate limits.part iv,supra.
the plurality reaches the opposite conclusion.the result,as i said at the outset,is a decision that substitutes judges understandings of how the political process works for the understanding of congress that fails to recognize the difference between influence resting upon public opinion and influence bought by money alone that overturns key precedent that creates huge loopholes in the law and that undermines,perhaps devastates,what remains of campaign finance reform.
with respect,i dissent.
