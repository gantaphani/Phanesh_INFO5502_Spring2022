four political committees stop reckless economic instability caused by democrats stop pac,tea party leadership fund the fund,alexandria republican city committee arcc,and american future pac american future collectively,appellants appeal a district court order granting summary judgment against them in their claims challenging the constitutionality of certain contribution limits established by the federal election campaign act of feca,see.we conclude that two of the three claims became moot before the district court granted summary judgment,and we therefore vacate the merits judgment on those counts and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss them for lack of jurisdiction.regarding the third claim,we affirm.
feca regulates many different types of donors and recipients.see,formerly.to understand the issues before us in this appeal,it is necessary to understand some of feca basic concepts and limits.
to begin,feca defines a political committee as any committee,club,association,or other group of persons that,during a calendar year,received contributions or made expenditures in excess of.a formerly a see the real truth about abortion,fec,cir.feca defines expenditures and contributions as encompassing spending or fundraising for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office.a i,a i formerly a i,a i see also buckley valeo,limiting feca requirements to organizations that are controlled by a candidate or whose major purpose is to nominate or elect a candidate the real truth about abortion,inc,at.a group that has met the criteria must register with the federal election commission fec.see a formerly a.
there are different types of political committees.some are associated with a particular candidate or entity.see,providing that a national committee is a political committee responsible for the operation of a national political party providing that a state committee is a political committee that is responsible for the operation of a political party at the state level e providing that each candidate must designate a political committee to serve as the candidate principal campaign committee.and others are not associated with any candidate or entity political committees.
feca sets different contribution limits for different classes of donors and recipients.a contribution made by a political committee to an individual candidate is governed by the restriction limiting contributions by persons generally.a a.persons include individual s,partnership s,committee s,association s,corporation s,labor organization s,or any other organization s or group s other than the federal government.in,the limit for contributions by persons was per election,with primaries and general elections counting as separate elections however,political committees,unlike other types of persons,qualified for an elevated limit of on contributions to individual candidates if and when they satisfied three criteria they must have been registered with the fec for a period of not less than months the waiting period,received contributions from more than persons,and made contributions to or more candidates for federal office.a see a a.a political committee satisfying these criteria is referred to as a multicandidate political committee mpc.id.
feca also limits contributions that persons and political committees can make to political party committees.see a b,d,a b c.with regard to contributions to these committees,the limits decrease when the political committee becomes an mpc.when this case was commenced in april,persons including political committees that did not qualify as mpcs could contribute per year to national party committees and combined to state political party committees and their local affiliates,while the corresponding limits for mpcs were and.see a price index adjustments for contribution and expenditure limitations and lobbyist bundling disclosure threshold.
on december,congress amended feca to create a new category of limits.under the amended law,national party committees can create up to three segregated accounts to fund their presidential nominating convention,building headquarters,and legal expenses.see consolidated and further continuing appropriations act,div.n,stat,codified as amended at u.a b,a b,a.the annual limits for contributions made to such segregated accounts are three times the limits on other contributions to national party committees.see id.
the plaintiffs in this suit,stop pac,the fund,and arcc,filed their initial complaint against the fec on april,and filed an amended complaint on july,the amended complaint.the amended complaint alleged the following facts regarding the parties.
plaintiff stop pac is a political committee that registered with the fec on march.as of april,stop pac had over contributors and had made contributions to five candidates for federal office.on or around april,stop pac contributed the maximum to candidate niger innis in the nevada primary for the republican nomination for a seat in the house of representatives on or around june,stop pac contributed the same amount to candidate dan sullivan in the alaska primary for the republican nomination for the senate.stop pac wished to contribute more to each candidate as it could have had it been an mpc but its waiting period would not expire until september,after the primaries were held.
stop pac also contributed to congressman joe heck,republican nominee for congress from nevada congressional district,in connection with his general election.stop pac wished to contribute more to heck immediately,but it was prohibited from doing so until its waiting period expired.
the fund is a mpc that registered with the fec in,has over contributors,and has contributed to dozens of federal candidates.because the fund was an mpc,the maximum amounts it could contribute annually to a state political party committee and its local affiliates and to a national party committee each year were and,respectively.see a b c a.
plaintiff arcc is a local political party committee affiliated with the virginia republican state committee,which is a state political party committee.the fund contributed the statutory maximum of to arcc on april.for the year,the fund wished to contribute an additional to arcc and to the national republican senatorial committee nrsc,both of which feca would have allowed had the fund not yet become an mpc.see a b,d,a b c see.at.
the amended complaint contains three claims,each of which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.counts i and ii pertain to feca per election limit on contributions made to individual candidates by political committees that have not yet become mpcs.see a a.in count i,stop pac alleges that that limit,as applied to stop pac,violates the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause because feca applies a higher limit to mpcs than it does to political committees that have not completed the waiting period but have satisfied the other mpc criteria.in count ii,stop pac alleges that the waiting period,as applied to stop pac,violates its first amendment rights to free speech and free association.in count iii,arcc and the fund allege that feca annual limits on contributions made by mpcs to national party committees,see a b,and to state party committees,see a c,violate the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause insofar as political committees that have not yet completed the waiting period but that have satisfied the other mpc criteria enjoy the higher limits of and,respectively.
on august,the plaintiffs moved to join american future in the suit as an intervening plaintiff concerning counts i and ii.american future is a political committee that registered with the fec on august.as of august,american future had raised from contributors.it contributed to candidate tom cotton general election campaign in arkansas for the senate,and each to four other candidates.american future wished to contribute more to cotton for the general election,but feca prevented it from doing so since american future waiting period was not due to expire before the november election.american future also wished to contribute more than to cotton immediately but could not do so until he filed paperwork concerning the primary election.finally,american future desired to contribute more than as soon as possible to other candidates for their primaries.on october,the district court entered an order allowing american future to intervene pursuant to federal rule.see.
on september,before the district court ruled on the plaintiffs joinder motion,the parties filed for summary judgment.in support of its motion,the fec,in addition to arguing that none of the challenged limitations were unconstitutional,asserted that the district court lacked jurisdiction over stop pac claims counts i and ii.in particular,it argued that stop pac claims should be dismissed for lack of standing since it caused its own injury by not registering as early as november,in time to become an mpc before the three elections concerning which it wished to make additional contributions.the fec also argued that stop pac claims were moot because it became an mpc on september,and was thus no longer subject to the limit that it challenged,and never would be again.
in response,the plaintiffs contended that stop pac established standing.in that regard,they objected to the fec attempt to effectively blame stop pac for failing to organize itself more than six months before the primaries,when in fact m ost ordinary people are not especially interested in becoming involved in the political process until shortly before an election.memo.in opp to fec mot.for summ.as for the fec suggestion that stop pac claims were moot,the plaintiffs invoked the exception for claims that are capable of repetition,yet evading review.southern pac.term.icc.although the plaintiffs acknowledged that this exception is generally applied only when the plaintiff itself faces a risk that it will be subject to the same challenged provisions in the future,the plaintiffs argued that the requirement need not be met in cases.
on february,as the parties waited for the district court to rule on their summary judgment motions,the fec filed a notice with the district court raising additional arguments regarding mootness.in the notice,the fec informed the district court that on february,american future had become an mpc.as it had argued regarding stop pac,the fec contended that american future,as an mpc,was no longer affected by the limit it was challenging and never would be again.the fec filing also informed the court of the december,change in the law allowing contributions to the specified segregated accounts of national parties of three times the limits on other contributions to national party committees.the fec maintained that that change mooted the fund challenge to the limits on an mpc contributions to national party committees.
the district court subsequently granted summary judgment to the fec on all claims.see stop reckless econ.instability caused by democrats fec,d stop.regarding each of the three claims,the district court assumed that the fec arguments regarding standing and mootness failed,see id.at,and ruled that the fec was entitled to summary judgment on the merits,see id.at.as for count ii,alleging a first amendment violation,the district court concluded that stop pac and american future can not show that they have suffered a cognizable constitutional injury as a result of the waiting period,even if they would have made a higher contribution,had they been permitted to do so.id.at citing buckley valeo,and california med.ass fec.regarding counts i and iii,alleging violation of the plaintiffs equal protection rights under the fifth amendment,the district court concluded that stop pac and the fund were not similarly situated to each other,and thus that feca does not improperly discriminate among such committees and does not violate the plaintiffs rights under the fifth amendment.id.at.the district court alternatively ruled that any discrimination was justified under either or intermediate scrutiny.see id.
with regard to each of the three counts,appellants argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against them.in response,the fec maintains that the district court should never have addressed the merits of the claims because it lacked jurisdiction over them.see.h if the court determines at any time that it lacks jurisdiction,the court must dismiss the action.alternatively,the fec argues that the district court decision regarding the merits was correct.
without jurisdiction the court can not proceed at all in any cause.jurisdiction is power to declare the law,and when it ceases to exist,the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.ex parte mccardle.accordingly,the supreme court has stated in no uncertain terms that federal courts are not free to simply assume that they possess jurisdiction and then proceed to decide the merits of the issues before them when their jurisdiction remains in doubt.see steel citizens for a better env t.rather,federal courts must determine whether they have jurisdiction over a claim before proceeding to address its merits.see id.the district court erred in failing to follow this course in this case.
we therefore begin our analysis by addressing the fec contentions that the district court did not have jurisdiction when it granted summary judgment to the fec.
article iii gives federal courts jurisdiction only over c ases and c ontroversies.const.art.iii,cl.one essential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so,which requires the litigant to prove that he has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct,and is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.hollingsworth perry.
to qualify as a case fit for adjudication,an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.arizonans for official english arizona,internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.chafin chafin,some internal quotation marks omitted.
a case that would otherwise be moot is not so if the underlying dispute is capable of repetition,yet evading review.southern pac.term,at.the supreme court has explained 
that in the absence of a class action,the capable of repetition,yet evading review doctrine was limited to the situation where two elements combined the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.
weinstein bradford,per curiam see id.holding that doctrine did not prevent the case from being moot because the case,not a class action,clearly does not satisfy the latter element.
regarding counts i and ii,the fec repeats its argument presented below that stop pac lacked standing to prosecute counts i and ii.the fec also repeats its alternative contention that counts i and ii became moot once stop pac and intervenor american future became mpcs,since that change in status ensured that they would never again be bound by the limit they are challenging.we agree with this latter argument.see united states juvenile male,per curiam holding that exception requirement was not met when plaintiff challenging special conditions of juvenile supervision had turned and thus would never again be subject to an order imposing such special conditions.because we conclude that counts i and ii became moot before the district court granted summary judgment,we do not address the fec contention that stop pac never established standing to assert these claims in the first place.see arizonans for official english,at declining to decide standing issue when claim was moot.
appellants do not deny that once stop pac and american future became mpcs and the contribution limit they are challenging therefore ceased to apply to them,the district court was no longer in position to prevent any threatened injury or provide redress for any past injury.nevertheless,appellants argue that the capable of repetition,yet evading review doctrine applied to prevent counts i and ii from becoming moot.in this regard,appellants do not dispute the fact that there was no longer any reasonable expectation that they would be subject to the same limit again.rather,they maintain that in cases,the element need not be satisfied.we disagree.
in support of their argument,appellants rely primarily on justice scalia dissent in honig doe,scalia,dissenting.in the dissent,justice scalia cited abortion and election cases in which he argued the court had dispens ed with the requirement and focus ed instead upon the great likelihood that the issue will recur between the defendant and the other members of the public at large.id.emphasis in original 
since honig was decided,courts have taken different views regarding whether the cases cited in justice scalia dissent indicated a deliberate decision by the supreme court not to apply the requirement in election cases.partially as a result of this disagreement,courts have reached different results when considering arguments like the ones appellants now raise.compare van wie pataki,cir applying requirement in an election case,and barilla ervin,cir same,with catholic leadership coal.of reisman,cir concluding that requirement need not be met in election cases,lawrence blackwell,cir same,and majors abell,cir same.
in the end,we need not decide whether we believe the supreme court has sub silentio limited,or created an exception to,the requirements of the capable of repetition,yet evading review doctrine.that is so because even were we to conclude that the supreme court has actually sub silentio excused compliance with the rule in some election cases,we would be obligated to follow the rule that the court has actually articulated.see,shalala illinois council on long term care,this court does not normally overturn,or so dramatically limit,earlier authority sub silentio.hohn united states,u,our decisions remain binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider them,regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts about their continuing vitality.agostini felton,explaining that if a supreme court precedent directly controls,yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,the court of appeals should follow the case which directly controls,leaving to the supreme court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions internal quotation marks omitted id.explaining that lower courts should not conclude that the supreme court more recent cases have,by implication,overruled its earlier precedent mackall angelone,cir en banc applying agostini and refusing to create an exception to a general rule articulated by the supreme court even though a subsequent supreme court case had noted that in a future case the court might adopt the exception we were considering.
moreover,the supreme court has actually applied the rule in two relatively recent election cases.fec wisconsin right to life,concerned an challenge to a federal prohibition on the use of corporate funds to finance electioneering communications during a day period.see id.at.with the period long over,the supreme court considered whether the case met the requirements of the capable of repetition,yet evading review doctrine.the court explained that t he second prong requires a reasonable expectation or a demonstrated probability that the same controversy will recur involving the same complaining party.id.at emphasis added.the court concluded that the requirement was met in that case because the plaintiff credibly claimed that it planned on running materially similar future targeted broadcast ads mentioning a candidate within the blackout period,and there is no reason to believe that the fec will refrain from prosecuting violations of the challenged statute.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in davis fec,the supreme court reviewed a challenge from a candidate to certain requirements to which he was subject.see id.at.with the litigation having continued after the election occurred,the court again considered whether the capable of repetition,yet evading review doctrine applied.the court again applied the requirement,and determined it was satisfied because the candidate had publicly announced that he intended to run again as a candidate.see id.at.
like the supreme court,we have also applied the requirement in recent election cases.most recently,in lux judd,cir,we reviewed a constitutional challenge to a state requirement that each signature on a petition for ballot placement by an independent candidate for congress be witnessed by a district resident.see id.at.in considering whether the case satisfied the requirements of the capable of repetition,yet evading review doctrine,we noted that e disputes qualify as capable of repetition when there is a reasonable expectation that the challenged provisions will be applied against the plaintiffs again during future election cycles.id.at.we concluded that that requirement was satisfied in that case.see id.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that we are bound to apply the doctrine that we and the supreme court have articulated and recently applied and we must leave to the supreme court the decision of whether it wishes to create an exception to,or otherwise limit,that rule.accordingly,because appellants can not satisfy the requirement,the capable of repetition,yet evading review doctrine does not apply,and the district court erred in not dismissing counts i and ii for lack of jurisdiction.we therefore vacate the district court merits ruling regarding the claims and remand them to the district court for dismissal in accordance with rule h.
the fec contends that the district court erred in declining to dismiss count iii on mootness grounds as well.we disagree.
in count iii the fund and arcc challenge the constitutionality of the annual limit that applies to contributions from mpcs to state political party committees and their local affiliates,and the fund challenges the constitutionality of the annual limit on contributions from mpcs to national party committees.see a b c.the fec advances distinct mootness arguments concerning each of these two challenges.
regarding the challenge to the limit on contributions to state party committees and their local affiliates,the fec notes that the amended complaint alleges that the fund wished to immediately contribute an additional to arcc,which would bring its total contributions to arcc for the year to.the fec argues that,once ended,this challenge was moot because the district court could not grant the fund the right to contribute additional amounts to arcc in.
we conclude,however,that this challenge,unlike those presented in counts i and ii,easily fits into the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception.it is undisputed that the election cycle is too short in duration for election disputes to be fully litigated within a single cycle.see moore ogilvie.and the fund very well may wish to contribute more than to the arcc in future years.to invoke the exception,appellants are not required to forecast evidence that they were so inclined.see north carolina right to life comm.fund for indep.political expenditures leake,cir holding that constitutional challenges to system of public financing for judicial elections,brought by two political committees and a candidate,were not mooted by the election even though neither the political committees nor the candidate had specifically alleged an intent to participate in future election cycles concluding that there is a reasonable expectation that the challenged provisions will be applied against the plaintiffs again during future election cycles rejecting the argument that an claims may be capable of repetition yet evading review only if the specifically alleges an intent to run again in a future election see also honig,at our concern in these cases,as in all others involving potentially moot claims,was whether the controversy was capable of repetition and not whether the claimant had demonstrated that a recurrence of the dispute was more probable than not.emphasis
