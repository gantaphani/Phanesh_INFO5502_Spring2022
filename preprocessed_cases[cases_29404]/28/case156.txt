this case presents the question of first impression before our court of whether a plaintiff can sustain his attack on the constitutionality of congressional district apportionment by alleging that the challenged districts are bizarrely drawn.
appellant,robert duckworth,sued various maryland agencies and officials,appellees,alleging that their enforcement of the state congressional reapportionment statute,laws of maryland chapter,violated the one vote principle embodied within article i,section of the united states constitution,the first amendment and the fourteenth amendment,by apportioning anne arundel county voters into four different congressional districts.the district court dismissed the case for failure to comply with federal rule of civil procedure b.on appeal,duckworth does not challenge the dismissal of his article i,section and his first amendment claims.he appeals only the district court dismissal of his fourteenth amendment political gerrymandering claim.having reviewed duckworth pleadings,we too conclude that he failed to state a valid claim,and so,for the reasons given below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the central pleadings within duckworth fourteenth amendment complaint are that the state apportionment of anne arundel county voters into four different congressional districts intentionally,arbitrarily and invidiously debases and dilutes the votes of the residents of anne arundel county,first amended complaint,at,that the apportionment is an illegal and intentional prearrangement of voters that ensures the election of democratic candidates and thereby consistently degrades plaintiff participation in and influence on the elective and political process as a whole,id.at,and that the challenged districts have bizarre shapes and are not contiguous.he argues that the bizarre appearance of the districts,and their alleged lack of contiguity,are proof of the state districting manipulations,of the assured electoral victory of democratic candidates,and of illegal repression of his political voice.
the district court rejected duckworth fourteenth amendment complaint,relying principally upon a decision by a district court in anne arundel county republican central comm.state admin.bd.of election laws.in that case,republican and democratic committees from anne arundel county challenged the prior congressional apportionment,similarly claiming that the apportionment of county residents into four separate,districts diluted the political voice of county residents.the court,after trial and consideration of proof,rejected the plaintiffs claims,and the supreme court summarily affirmed,d.
the district court concluded that since duckworth complaint did not differ materially from the anne arundel county republican central comm.complaint and since it alleged no particular changed circumstances between the prior apportionment and the new,the complaint failed to state a claim.see district court memorandum opinion,at as duckworth fails to allude to any facts that suggest his claims are based on any particular provision in the plan,he can not argue now that his claims hinge on a distinction between the plan at issue in the case and chapter.the district court reinforced its conclusion that duckworth had not pled facts sufficient to state a claim by examining the facts at issue in anne arundel county republican central comm.and demonstrating that duckworth failed to allege certain equivalent facts here.see at.
having concluded that duckworth complaint stated no claim,the court reasoned that the questions presented by the pleadings were insubstantial.as a result,the court did not forward duckworth complaint to a court,as provided for by a providing that a district court of three judges be convened to hear cases challenging congressional districting as unconstitutional,and instead dismissed the case itself on the authority of this court precedent in simkins gressette,cir noting that convening a court is not required to address insubstantial claims.
duckworth now appeals from that dismissal.
we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss under rule b,inquiring solely whether duckworth pleadings adequately state a set of facts,which,if proven to be true,would entitle duckworth to judicial relief.see chisolm transouth financial,cir.if,as the district court concluded,duckworth pleadings do not state a claim,then by definition they are insubstantial and so properly are subject to dismissal by the district court without convening a court.see simkins,at.
the district court conclusion that duckworth failed to state a claim rested on errant reasoning,and so we do not rely on it in affirming that court judgment.while the district court rightly noted that duckworth pleading omitted certain facts pled in anne arundel county republican central comm.in particular the court noted the absence here of allegations as to the lack of political success by county republicans and that the omitted facts represented elements of the claim,the court improperly evaluated whether the facts duckworth did plead satisfied the elements the omitted facts might have otherwise satisfied and thus sufficed to state a claim on their own.
the district court rejected the adequacy of the facts duckworth did plead via a analysis.first,the court concluded that duckworth alleged no changed circumstances from the prior suit,anne arundel county republican central comm.and then on that basis the court reasoned that the prior decision required the conclusion that duckworth claims were not well stated.in reaching this conclusion the court did not assert principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel,but instead relied on the precedential value of the earlier case.
two points make evident the lower court error in its analysis.first,though the court concluded that duckworth pled no new changes in the districting,he did in fact plead changes.because duckworth claim involves a different apportionment plan than was involved in anne arundel county republican central,the maps of the districts that were and are alleged to be unconstitutionally drawn differ.and,since part of duckworth claim is that the districts general appearance is bizarre,and that that bizarreness evinces unconstitutional political gerrymandering,the pleading of the new districts general appearance,though utilizing verbatim recitations,necessarily differs from the prior districts general appearance pleading.
secondly,the case on which the district court relied was decided on the merits after full review of the facts.see anne arundel county republican central.at.thus,that court did not conclude as a matter of law that the pleadings were inadequate to state a claim.indeed it implied the opposite,proceeding to trial and concluding that the proffered facts did not prove the presumably well pled claim.
the district court was therefore both presented with new allegations as to general appearance and with a decision from anne arundel county republican central comm.that at least implied that pleadings as to general appearance might state a valid political gerrymandering claim on their own.in light of these circumstances,the lower court conclusion that duckworth claims were foreclosed by precedent was in error.
notwithstanding the district court analytical error,we nonetheless conclude that its judgment of dismissal was proper.this is so because none of duckworth allegations,including his general appearance pleadings,are adequate to prove an unconstitutional political gerrymander,as that claim has been defined by the supreme court.
the supreme court established that political gerrymandering claims are justiciable in federal courts in davis bandemer,d.there,importantly,the court also gave clear definition to what is otherwise,by virtue of its widespread use in common parlance,a somewhat confusing term subject to different understandings the political gerrymander.
first,the court made clear that a political gerrymander refers not just to,the drawing of election district lines in a fashion intended to achieve certain advantageous political effect but also refers to other political action that affects electoral processes so as to advantage some citizens over others.thus,the court referred to all the complained of conduct that was before it as political gerrymandering,even though that conduct included both claims that the particular district lines were drawn in an unconstitutional fashion and that the mix of and multimember districts were intended to and did violate their constitutional rights.id.at.
secondly,by articulating specific elements required to be proven in order to prevail on a political gerrymandering suit,davis made clear that not all political gerrymandering is unconstitutional.rather,the court explained,political gerrymandering of the unconstitutional sort is conduct possessed of two particular characteristics intentional discrimination against an identifiable group and actual discriminatory effect on that group,denial of that group chance to influence the political process effectively.see id.at.white,plurality opinion citing mobile bolden,d 
that a political gerrymander might be either constitutional or unconstitutional is a critical insight with respect to cases challenging political gerrymanders,for it relieves courts from having to pretend that a legislature has not engaged in political gerrymandering when it is obvious that the legislature has in fact gerrymandered its districts,but in a constitutionally permissible fashion.see,davis,at.white,plurality opinion.thus,when a plaintiff fails to proffer sufficient evidence to satisfy davis elements,the resulting conclusion is not that no political gerrymander exists,but that any gerrymander that did occur was constitutional.because judicial honesty is as important to the law as analytical rigor,distinguishing between constitutional and unconstitutional political gerrymanders in this way adds valuable candor to judicial consideration of claims such as these.
as a consequence of the court holding in davis,no plaintiff alleging an unconstitutional political gerrymander can survive a motion to dismiss,such as that duckworth faces,by simply alleging that political gerrymandering has occurred.rather,he must plead facts adequate to prove davis two required elements that there has been intentional discrimination against an identifiable group and an actual discriminatory effect on that group.
simple,formulaic restatements of davis two required elements can not sustain a suit alleging unconstitutional political gerrymandering.just as in the antitrust context we have said that the pleader must provide,whenever possible,some details of the time,place,and alleged effect of the conspiracy,estate const.miller smith holding,cir,so too here must duckworth do more than merely offer conclusory charges that there has been intentional discrimination against an identifiable group and that that group has suffered discriminatory effect under chapter.
we conclude that the district court judgment of dismissal was proper because none of duckworth allegations,including his general appearance pleadings,adequately state the second element of a political gerrymandering claim under davis actual discriminatory effect.since duckworth has not sufficiently pled this more onerous second element,we do not reach the adequacy of his pleadings as to the first.
duckworth pleadings contain principally two types of allegations of discriminatory effect conclusory statements that the necessary discriminatory effect exists and factual allegations that the challenged districts have a bizarre appearance.for example,emblematic of his conclusory statements,duckworth complains that chapter fails to recognize the right of an individual,political group or association to effectively influence and participate in the political process.at.and,emblematic of his general appearance allegations,he complains that chapter creates districts that are laboriously and elaborately twisted,elongated and contrived to an extreme and excessive degree.at.
the first category of his allegations,by virtue of their conclusory nature,are insufficient to state a claim for relief.see estate const,at.duckworth many and varied assertions,made without causal reasoning,that chapter dilutes political voice and causes discriminatory effects fall into this category.
the second category of duckworth pleadings allegations that the districts have a bizarre appearance are not probative as to the discriminatory effect that must be proven in political gerrymandering cases because no reasonable inference can be drawn from the fact of a bizarre appearance that supports the conclusion that districting has caused such effects.at most it may be fairly inferred from bizarreness that the apportionment was the result of intentional political action and resulted in political effect.but,of course,political effect itself is an expected,and indeed intended,result of apportionment.see gaffney cummings,d the reality is that districting inevitably has and is intended to have substantial political consequences.that bizarreness may establish political effect is therefore an unobjectionable,and in fact expected,conclusion.but to conclude that bizarreness may establish political discrimination requires a very different inference,for the fact that members of a majority have acted politically is not evidence that they have caused discriminatory effects,even if their actions are disfavored by the minority.davis,at.white,plurality opinion noting that the shape of a district may support a finding that an intention to discriminate was present and that districts were drawn in accordance with that intention,but they do not show any actual disadvantage.
discriminatory political effects instead emanate from majority action that establishes political mechanics that preclude minority participation,to some degree,in the political process writ large.bizarre looking congressional districts do not imply such action because,despite their strange appearance,all affected voters still have a congressional representative,cast equally weighted votes for that representative,and so enjoy true representation the essence of participation in the political process.there is thus no rationale for inferring from a district appearance that it has discriminatory political effects,as opposed to political effects.
it may be objected to this reasoning that general appearance allegations are probative as to discriminatory effect in racial gerrymandering cases,and so should likewise be considered probative in the context of political gerrymandering cases.but the supreme court precedent establishing that such evidence is so probative in racial gerrymandering cases does not,by its own logic,extend to political gerrymandering cases.
in shaw reno,d,the supreme court instructed that courts could adjudge a district general appearance bizarre in racial gerrymandering cases and from such bizarreness infer discriminatory racial effect.see id.appellants contend that redistricting legislation that is so bizarre on its face that it is unexplainable on grounds other than race demands the same close scrutiny that we give other state laws that classify citizens by race.our voting rights precedents support that conclusion.id.at.r eapportionment is one area in which appearances do matter.a reapportionment plan that includes in one district individuals who belong to the same race,but who are otherwise separated by geographical and political boundaries,and who may have little in common with one another but the color of their skin,bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid.it reinforces the perception that members of the same racial group think alike.the court based this conclusion on its prior racial discrimination cases dealing with voting rights,see id.at,and in so doing,on the unique nature of race in american history and the particular barriers the fourteenth amendment erects against race discrimination.see id.at.
of critical importance to the case at hand,the supreme court conclusion that bizarreness could be adjudged was not a conclusion that bizarreness could be adjudged simply as a matter of general appearance,but that it could be adjudged bizarre in the context of a racial gerrymandering claim if on its face it is unexplainable o
