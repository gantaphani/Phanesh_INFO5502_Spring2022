eleven american indian plaintiffs appeal the district court judgment in favor of the defendants,the governor and secretary of state of montana.the plaintiffs contend that the redistricting plan for montana state house of representatives and senate dilutes the voting strength of american indians in violation of of the voting rights act of.plaintiffs further urge that montana districting and apportionment commission adopted the redistricting plan with a discriminatory purpose,an action that would also violate of the voting rights act.
following a bench trial,the district court rejected both of plaintiffs claims.we agree with the district court that there was insufficient evidence of discriminatory purpose on the part of commission members in adopting the plan,and affirm the court ruling on that claim.we conclude,however,that the district court finding that the redistricting plan did not dilute the voting strength of american indians was based upon two errors that require its reversal.first,the district court erred in relying in part on the electoral success of indian candidates in house districts when it concluded that white bloc voting in house districts was not legally significant.see thornburg gingles,d second,the district court erred in concluding that,under montana redistricting plan,american indians were proportionally represented.because these two errors contributed to the district court ultimate finding of no dilution,we reverse the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.in so ruling,we do not decide the ultimate question whether,in light of the totality of the circumstances,vote dilution has occurred that is,whether under the redistricting plan american indians in montana have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.b see johnson de grandy,d.we leave that finding of fact to be made in the first instance by the district court,after correction of the two noted errors.
factual background 
demographics 
american indians comprise approximately of the total population of the state of montana,according to the federal census.but the indian population is relatively young,and comprises only of the state voting age population.montana american indian population is also growing more quickly than the state population as a whole.between and,the total population of the state increased by,but the american indian population of the state increased by.
montana house of representatives consists of single member districts.each member of the house serves for a term.the montana senate consists of single member districts each senate district is composed of two adjoining house districts.members of the senate are elected for terms,with half of the senate seats up for election every two years.
under the redistricting plan adopted in,indians comprised a majority of the voting age population in of the house districts.that district included the blackfeet reservation in glacier county in the northwest part of the state.indians did not represent a majority of the voting age population in any of the senate districts.by,these demographics had changed with the growth of the indian population.the census revealed that american indians comprised a majority of the voting age population in of house districts and of senate districts.
montana redistricting plan 
since,montana constitution has granted the exclusive power to adopt a redistricting plan to a districting and apportionment commission.although the montana legislature can make recommendations to the commission,it has no direct power over the geographic composition of legislative districts.the commission itself is reconstituted every ten years in advance of the federal census.commission members may not be public officials,although four of the five are appointed by majority and minority leaders of each house of the state legislature.the four commission members select the fifth member.
the federal census in revealed that population changes in montana between and had caused some legislative districts in montana to become malapportioned,and potentially violative of the requirement embodied in the fourteenth amendment.the districting and apportionment commission therefore was required to draw a new redistricting plan.none of the five commission members selected was an american indian.
the commission held twelve regional public hearings beginning on april.nine of these regional hearings were preceded by planning meetings that were open to the public.all of these hearings and meetings were recorded on audio tape portions of these tapes were summarized or transcribed in the official minutes of the commission.statements made by commissioners at these hearings and meetings form the basis for plaintiffs claim that commission members acted with a discriminatory purpose.american indians appearing before the commission presented alternative districting plans.one of these plans,referred to as the plan,contained an alternative districting proposal for the four challenged house districts that are the subject of this appeal.
after submitting its redistricting plan to the legislature for comment,the commission filed its statewide redistricting plan with the secretary of state on february.the plan which we,like the district court,will continue to refer to as the redistricting plan then became law,and the commission dissolved.
the redistricting plan increased the number of house districts hds from four to five,hds,and.see appendix i montana legislative districts appearing in appellee supplemental excerpts of record at.one of these districts,house district,is included in the four districts challenged on appeal.house district contains the blackfeet indian reservation in glacier county.of the five districts in the state plan,hd has by far the largest indian voting age population for hd,as opposed to in hd,in hd,in hd,and in hd.
house districts by percentage indian voting age population vap indicates district lines are challenged on appeal 
of the remaining house districts in the state,only three have an indian voting age population of or more in hd,in hd,and in hd.these three districts,hds,and,are the remaining three house districts whose boundaries are challenged on appeal.
the redistricting plan contains one senate district sd.that district,sd,is located in the southeast portion of the state,and contains an indian voting age population of.sd is not a subject of this appeal.
standard of review 
we review for clear error the district court findings of fact,including its ultimate finding whether,in the totality of circumstances,vote dilution exists in violation of.thornburg gingles,d smith salt river project agric.improvement power,cir.we retain the power,however,to correct errors of law,including those that may infect a mixed finding of law and fact,or a finding of fact that is predicated on a misunderstanding of the governing rule of law.gingles,at.salt river,at.
vote dilution 
before addressing the errors underlying the finding of no vote dilution,we address a threshold issue arising from the scope of appeal.at trial,plaintiffs alleged vote dilution in two separate geographic areas of the state,each involving four house districts.the district court found no vote dilution in either area.on appeal,plaintiffs challenge the district court finding only with regard to the first area,which includes hds,and in the northwest part of the state plaintiffs offered the plan as an alternative to the redistricting plan for this area.plaintiffs have not appealed the district court finding with regard to the second area,which includes hds,and in the northeast part of the state plaintiffs offered the rocky peck plan as a substitute for this region 
the district court analyzed the evidence of vote dilution in the eight challenged districts taken together because the geographic scope challenged on appeal is narrower than that challenged at trial,the question arises whether we review the district court analysis of vote dilution in the eight districts challenged at trial,or review only the record evidence of vote dilution relevant to the four districts challenged on appeal we conclude that we need not decide this question under either approach,we conclude that the district court erred in two of its subsidiary findings.to reach this conclusion,we address the evidence from both points of view.
to establish a violation of of the voting rights act,the american indian plaintiffs must show that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by american indians,a language minority group protected by the act under e in that their members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.b.as the district court properly understood,the inquiry requires a process.first,plaintiffs must show three existing threshold conditions known as the gingles factors the population of american indians is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district american indians are politically cohesive and the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable the absence of special circumstances,usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate.thornburg gingles,d district see growe emison,d districts.
second,if all three gingles factors have been established,the court must decide the ultimate question of vote dilution it must determine whether,on the totality of circumstances,american indians have been denied an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.b.as part of this inquiry,the court considers a list of factors set out in the legislative history to the voting rights act as well as cases interpreting it.see johnson de grandy,d.one of these factors,proportionality,relates the number of districts to the american indians share of the relevant population.id.at.
we turn now to the vote dilution analysis.
gingles one and two compactness and political cohesiveness 
as an alternative to the legislative boundaries drawn by the state for hds,and,plaintiffs offered the plan.that plan would create a new house district by enlarging hd.see appendix ii house district and for flathead,lake,glacier and pondera counties appearing in appellee supplemental excerpts of record at.it would also create a new senate district by reconfiguring the existing hd,already a district,and combining it with enlarged hd 
under the plan,the indian voting age population of hd would increase from under the redistricting plan to under the proposed plan.the indian voting age population in hd would decline from to.american indians would represent of the voting age population in the proposed combined senate district.
the district court found that the population of american indians residing on the blackfeet and flathead indian reservations is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in an additional single member house district and an additional single member senate district.the district court also found that the proposed house and senate districts in the plan are reasonably compact and regular,and that their shape is not materially different from that of other districts adopted by the commission.the parties do not dispute these findings.
the state does claim,however,that the districts proposed by plaintiffs would be insufficient to confer effective voting power.the evidence proffered by the state does not support its claim,however,even were we to conclude that gingles required such a finding.see gingles,at.requiring only a majority in a district.badillo city of stockton,cir,on which the state relies,does not address this factor.the district court finding was not clearly erroneous.the first factor of the gingles analysis is therefore satisfied.see gingles,at.
the second gingles factor is also satisfied.american indian voters are politically cohesive if they have expressed clear political preferences that are distinct from those of the majority.gomez city of watsonville,cir see also gingles,at.the state expert,jeffrey zax,presented evidence that showed american indians were politically cohesive in more than of the general elections,retention elections and ballot issue elections that he examined in the eight house districts.plaintiffs expert,joe floyd,presented evidence that american indians were politically cohesive in more than of the elections that he examined in which a white candidate opposed an american indian candidate for a position in state,federal or county government the district court had no need to inquire more deeply into these statistical findings.the parties stipulated that american indian voters were politically cohesive in all eight districts challenged at trial.the parties do not challenge this stipulation as it applies to the four districts challenged on appeal.
gingles three white bloc voting 
under the third gingles factor,the court must determine whether the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable the absence of special circumstances,usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate.gingles,at.in such a case,white bloc voting is said to be legally significant.id.at.the district court followed a process for ascertaining the existence of white bloc voting in a particular contest the process requires the court to determine the candidate preferred by indian voters and to determine whether whites voted as a bloc to defeat the candidate.we previously employed this approach in ruiz city of santa maria,cir,cert.denied,d,and valladolid city of national city,cir.
the district court applied this process and found that white majority voters did not usually,more than half of the time vote to defeat the preferred candidate of indian voters.but this finding rests on an error of method.in calculating the incidence of white bloc voting,the district court drew no distinction between jurisdictions in which indian voters constitute a majority of the voting age population,and those jurisdictions in which white voters were in the majority.the third gingles factor directs the court inquiry to those jurisdictions where there is a white majority.gingles,at.this issue did not arise in gingles,of course,because there were no majority black jurisdictions in the challenged plan.johnson de grandy,decided eight years later,is more instructive.there the court faced a phenomenon,a challenge to a plan that already included some districts.the court described this kind of challenge as a claim of partial submergence not the chance for some electoral success in place of none,but the chance for more success in place of some.de grandy,at.
in de grandy,the court ratified the district court conclusion that the third gingles factor had been satisfied where there was a tendency of whites to vote as a bloc to bar minority groups from electing their chosen candidates except in a district where a given minority makes up a voting majority.id.at.emphasis added citing de grandy wetherell,aff in part and rev in part sub nom.johnson de grandy,d see also id.at.following de grandy,we consider indian electoral success in districts only in the inquiry into the totality of the proportionality and proportional representation.see id.at.to do otherwise would permit white bloc voting in a district to be washed clean by electoral success in neighboring districts.such an approach would be antithetical to the directive in gingles that legally significant white bloc voting be determined on a district to district basis.gingles,at.
the district court also considered white bloc voting to be probative only if the candidate won with a minimum of of the white vote.plaintiffs contest this standard,and argue that white bloc voting is per se probative if it is sufficient to defeat the candidate.see id.relevant white bloc voting varies according to a number of factors,including the percentage of registered voters in the district who are members of the minority group.we assume,without deciding,that the district court employed the proper threshold.even under this more demanding standard,the third gingles factor is satisfied.
evidence of white bloc voting 
at trial,the parties presented statistical evidence of racial polarization and bloc voting by white voters in and,the two election years prior to discovery in which the redistricting plan was in effect this evidence addressed racial polarization and white bloc voting in the eight districts challenged at trial,including the four districts challenged on appeal the four districts affected by the plan.we conclude this evidence showed legally significant white bloc voting.
the district court relied upon the statistical evidence presented by the state expert witness,zax.zax analyzed precinct election returns using a standard statistical technique known as bivariate ecological regression analysis bera.the bera analyses compared the votes a candidate received in an election with the racial composition of the electorate,and produced estimates of the voting behavior of american indian and white voters.the analyses did not determine the voting behavior of individual voters or determine the exact behavior of a group of voters.the bera analyses performed by zax were independent for each district there was no aggregation of data across districts.
zax produced results for the eight districts challenged at trial including the four districts challenged on appeal.zax first determined the number of indians and whites of voting age in the relevant election precincts.he did so by examining the census data on racial composition of the population by census block,then overlaying a precinct map on top of the census bloc maps,and apportioning the racial population data accordingly when the precinct boundaries and census bloc boundaries were not coterminous,zax assumed the population was distributed uniformly.once the racial composition of the election precincts was determined,zax ran the bera analysis to estimate minority and white voting percentages by candidate and by election contest.
zax bera analysis produced results for election contests in the eight districts challenged at trial including the contests in the four districts challenged on appeal.these contests included general elections,ballot initiatives and retention elections at the state and federal level.zax considered an election between two candidates to be an individual race,and voting with respect to a race in a given district was a contest.thus,a race taking place in all eight districts,the presidential election was considered to be eight contests.
zax also performed supplemental bera analyses on twelve primary election and fifteen general election contests occurring in the eight districts challenged at trial in which a white candidate opposed an indian candidate.he did so by performing a new bera analysis on data compiled by plaintiffs expert floyd.some of these contests were also included in the general elections previously analyzed by zax 
election contests between indian and white candidates 
elections between white and minority candidates are the most probative in determining the existence of legally significant white bloc voting.see ruiz,at nipper smith,cir.in this case,the indian and candidate was usually defeated by the white majority voting as a bloc.
in and,there were election contests in the four challenged house districts hds,and in which an indian candidate opposed a candidate for a position in the state or federal government.see table.
election contests in hds,and 
of these contests,there were in hds,and and in lake county in which american indians constituted a minority of the voting age population.in each of these contests,a majority of white and indian voters preferred a different candidate,it was a election.in of these elections,the indian candidate who was also the candidate lost.in each of those losses,over of white voters supported the white candidate.
in of the elections two in hd and one in glacier county,american indians constituted a majority of the voting age population.in each of those contests,whites and indians preferred a different candidate.in each case,the american indian and indian preferred candidate won.
if all eight of the districts challenged at trial are considered,the statistics are similar.there were contests between white and indian candidates subject to bera analysis,primary and general election contests.of the contests in jurisdictions,the indian and candidate won all.of the contests in jurisdictions,the indian and candidate was defeated in contests by a white vote in excess of.all of the victories by an indian candidate in a jurisdiction were represented by the victory of democrat bill yellowtail in the democratic primary for montana sole seat in the house of representatives.thus,the contests between white and indian candidates suggest white bloc voting was legally significant within the meaning of the third gingles factor.
elections between white candidates 
in and there were general election contests held in the four challenged house districts involving two white candidates.of these elections,american indian voters and white voters preferred different candidates in contests in districts and in districts.in jurisdictions with a voting age population,the candidate preferred by indian voters lost of elections in of those elections the candidate was defeated by a white bloc vote in excess of.in jurisdictions with a voting age population,the candidate preferred by indian voters won all contests.
during the same period,there were election contests for the state house of representatives or senate for which bera analyses were performed.we consider these contests,occurring in the challenged districts and involving the same public office subject to challenge,to be more probative than election contests for other offices.naacp city of niagara falls,cir.of these,white and indian voters preferred different candidates in of the contests.see table below.
legislative general elections in hds,and 
in districts with a voting age population hds,and,the candidate preferred by indian voters lost all election contests in each case,white bloc voting exceeded.in the district with a voting age population,the candidate preferred by indian voters won the sole election contest.
an analysis of elections in all eight of the districts challenged at trial produces similar evidence that white bloc voting usually defeats the candidate.of the contests analyzed,white and indian voters preferred different candidates in elections in jurisdictions and in jurisdictions.in districts,the candidate was defeated of times more than of white voters voted as a bloc to defeat the candidate in of those election contests.in districts,the white candidate won of contests.if only state legislative elections are considered,the candidate was defeated in all contests,and in of those instances by a white bloc voting in excess of.in contrast,the candidate won both of the elections in a district.thus,an analysis of contests reveals legally significant white bloc voting as defined by gingles.
the state urges us to consider,as the district court did not,the extent to which a majority of white and indian voters agreed on candidates in the relevant electoral contests.in askew city of rome,cir,it was error for the district court to consider only those elections in which black and white voters preferred different candidates.in askew,black candidates who were also ran in elections.id.at.in elections the white majority preferred the black candidate and the black candidate won all of those contests.id.at.in the contests in which the white majority did not prefer the black candidate,the black candidate lost.id.at.the district court considered only the contests to be probative.the eleventh circuit disagreed,and held that the excluded contests were probative as well.id.
askew has no analog here.of the contests between white and indian candidates considered by the district court,in both and jurisdictions,the majority of white voters preferred the white candidate out of times.in the sole remaining contest,the white vote was split between the two candidates.it is true that there was more agreement between white and indian voters when no indian candidates were in the race.but we have no evidence to suggest that most of these contests that the state claims to evidence racial agreement actually touched on issues of heightened concern to the indian community.in fact the scant evidence is to the contrary in addition,none of the contests to which the state points for support are state legislative elections.without more,we can not conclude that the district court erred by failing to consider the extent to which white and indian voters did not have split preferences in contests.
other elections 
zax also produced evidence of white bloc voting with respect to ballot initiatives and retention elections.there were ballot initiatives in the four districts challenged on appeal.of the contests,indian and white voters preferred different options in contests.in districts,white voters defeated the alternative in of contests,but did so by a bloc exceeding of white voters on only of instances.there were contests in districts,and the alternative was defeated in only one of those instances.
results were similar if all eight districts challenged at trial are considered.of the contests,were elections.white voters defeated the alternative in of contests,but in only of those instances did white voters vote by a bloc in excess of.
of the retention elections,white and indian voters did not prefer different alternative in any of those contests.
gingles three analysis of white bloc voting 
considering all this evidence in the aggregate,we conclude that the white majority in the four districts challenged on appeal votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the american indians preferred candidate.gingles,at.this conclusion holds even if we assume,as did the district court,that at least of the white majority must vote for a candidate to constitute a white bloc.in the contests between white and indian candidates that are most probative of white bloc voting,the indian and candidate was usually defeated by white bloc voting in jurisdictions in of the contests in the four districts challenged on appeal and in of the contests in the eight districts challenged at trial.similarly,in contests between white candidates in districts in which white and indian voters expressed a preference for different candidates,the candidate was usually defeated by white bloc voting in four districts and eight districts of the contests analyzed.in state legislative races between white candidates,which are the most probative contests,see city of niagara falls,at,the candidate lost of elections in districts as a result of white bloc voting in the four districts,and of contests in the eight districts challenged at trial.in no case listed above does the rate at which candidates are defeated by white bloc voting fall below in the contests that are most probative of white bloc voting,the percentages are far above that threshold.this evidence is more than sufficient to establish legally significant white bloc voting within the meaning of the third gingles factor.see at.
in contrast,indian and candidates experienced strong electoral success in jurisdictions.indian candidates all of whom were also won of the contests in the four challenged districts,and of the contests in the eight districts.white candidates won all of the contests in the four districts,and of the contests in the eight districts.as we noted above,the presence of electoral success in jurisdictions does not lessen the significance of white bloc voting in neighboring jurisdictions.
the state does not accept our standard for determining legally significant white bloc voting.pointing to abrams johnson,d,the state urges that white bloc voting can not satisfy the third gingles factor when at least to of white voters cross over and vote for the candidate.see id.at.we reject such a test.as the gingles court observed,there is no simple doctrinal test for the existence of legally significant racial bloc voting.at.the reason the degree of racial bloc voting that is cognizable as an element of a vote dilution claim will vary according to a variety of factual circumstances.id.at.see also de grandy,at.the gingles court itself invalidated districts in which white voting for black candidates ranged from to in primary elections,and from to in general elections.at.
nor do the factual circumstances of abrams suggest that such a standard is applicable here.in abrams the district court found that black and candidates received from both black and white voters.abrams,at.white voting was so significant that two black incumbents won to congress in districts.id.at.no such present here.we decline to apply the threshold urged by the state,even on a basis.
finally,the state offers an alternative rationale,which we reject,for the district court finding on white bloc voting.losses by indian candidates,contends the state,can fairly be ascribed to partisan politics and not race,at least where democratic indian candidates lose in majority republican districts.a plurality of the supreme court rejected this argument in gingles.see gingles,at.plurality opinion with respect to part see also sanchez colorado,cir collins city of norfolk,cir.in any event,we need not address this question because the evidence on the record does not support the state argument.indian candidates generally received a lower percentage of white votes than did white candidates in the same district.we therefore decline to attribute white bloc voting in the four challenged districts to mere partisan politics.
totality of the circumstances 
having determined that the plaintiffs have satisfied the three gingles factors,we now address the question whether the district court correctly analyzed the factors relevant to its decision that,under the totality of the circumstances,the redistricting plan did not impermissibly impair the ability of american indians to elect their preferred representatives.see gingles,at.ruiz,at.we conclude that the district court erred with regard to the factor of proportionality.because that error may have affected its ultimate determination of no dilution,we reverse the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
in the senate judiciary committee produced a list of factors the senate factors that a court should consider in examining the totality of the circumstances this list is exemplary,and not exhaustive,and there is no requirement that any particular number of factors be proved,or that a majority of them point one way or the other.gingles,at.the most important of the senate factors are racial polarization,the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized,and proportional representation,the extent to which american indians have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.id.at.a third important factor is proportionality,the relation of the number of voting districts to the american indians share of the relevant population.de grandy,at.these factors are not to be applied woodenly as the senate judiciary committee noted,and the supreme court has reiterated,the question whether the political processes are equally open depends upon a searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality,and on a functional view of the political process.gingles,at.quoting,at senate report,reprinted in,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the district court found that some of the senate factors favored a finding of a violation.there was a history of discrimination by the federal government and the state of montana from the until as recently as.american indians have a lower status than whites in montana these social and economic factors hinder the ability of american indians in montana to participate fully in the political process.these two findings are not contested by the state.the district court also noted that most of the elections in the eight challenged districts involving an american indian and a white candidate were racially polarized.finally,it noted that in at least two recent elections in lake county,which is within the four districts challenged on appeal,there had been overt or subtle racial appeals.
the district court also found evidence that,it concluded,supported a contrary finding.first,montana does not have unreason
