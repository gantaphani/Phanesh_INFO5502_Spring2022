towing operator roger whitmore and his company sued gary del re,gary stryker,and others for violation of the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act rico and for retaliation based on constitutionally protected speech.the district court granted summary judgment to the remaining defendants on all counts and,later,granted motions for attorneys fees and awarded costs.the plaintiffs appeal both the summary judgment and the award of fees.we affirm the order granting summary judgment on the merits.as to the award of fees,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
large municipalities make extensive use of towing services to deal with stranded vehicles,accidents,and the like.the towing fees can be quite expensive for motorists and profitable to the companies furnishing the tow trucks.since at least,the lake county,illinois,sheriff department has implemented a system that spreads this wealth among certain of the county towing operators.the department maintains a list of approved towers,each of which is assigned a particular territory within the county.when the department requires the services of a tow truck,the sheriff dispatcher calls the towing company of the vehicle operator choice if no tower is specified,the dispatcher calls the listed tower whose territory includes the location of the vehicle in question.
the various lake county sheriffs implementing this system over the years have done so without the benefit of any local ordinances or written procedures,guidelines,or rules to govern the selection of which towing companies receive a spot on the list and an assigned territory.these assigned towing areas are occasionally redrawn and towers added or removed from the list,particularly following elections.from,there were about a dozen towers on the list.
roger whitmore roger,president of roger whitmore automotive services,roger,operates a listed towing service that has done work for the sheriff department since.in,roger was allocated a specific towing territory in the northeastern corner of lake county and retained that area with some adjustments through at least.according to roger,inclusion on the list does not come cheap.three different sheriffs had,over the years,personally visited roger in order to sell tickets for political fund raisers.for example,sheriff thomas brown made personal appearances at roger with tickets in hand.sheriff mickey babcox came to roger,placed tickets on the counter,and collected checks from roger.sheriff clinton grinnell did likewise.sheriff deputies often followed up these visits,to pick up checks or to verify that roger would be attending the fund raisers.
roger felt pressured to purchase the tickets for several reasons.for one,the officers appeared at roger business openly displaying badge and gun.plus,roger had heard rumors that a towing company refusing to purchase tickets had found itself kicked off the approved list.roger therefore felt intimidated and concluded that he had no choice but to purchase the tickets,because otherwise maybe they would take his business away.even when some sheriffs mailed tickets,rather than making personal appearances,roger felt slightly uncomfortable.until,roger always supported the incumbent sheriff during elections.
del re campaign for sheriff 
in,sheriff grinnell retired,and the county board appointed undersheriff gary del re as grinnell replacement for the remainder of the term.when del re assumed the helm as grinnell replacement,he delegated responsibility for all towing matters to gary stryker,his replacement as undersheriff.in,del re kicked off a campaign to be elected sheriff in his own right.del re duly formed a campaign committee that included stryker and several others.the committee was officially in charge of obtaining campaign contributions for del re and for filing all required disclosure forms.del re also enlisted the services of tom crichton,a real estate broker,who had extensive experience including fund raising in various political campaigns in lake county and statewide.
during the campaign,crichton introduced del re,who was relatively new to lake county,to various business owners in the county.the parties dispute whether del re were for the purpose of soliciting campaign funds of the businesses del re visited,only three of them were towing shell,and max johnson auto center.johnson was a used car dealership that provided the sheriff department with a number of vehicles for use in undercover investigations.johnson was also a backup tower for the sheriff department and not on the approved list.
roger initially supported del re campaign for sheriff.in february,however,roger decided to switch his support to willie smith,del re challenger in the primary election.roger change of heart came about following a conversation with another towing operator,ernie vole.vole passed on a rumor that wildwood towing service had the ear of sheriff del re and was working to exclude roger from a new towing area coming open due to an operator being dropped from the list.according to the rumor,del re had planned to split the new territory between roger and wildwood,but wally herman,wildwood owner,convinced del re to screw roger and give wildwood the entire territory.
shortly after his conversation with vole,roger contacted undersheriff stryker and asked about the rumors.stryker denied them as nonsense,but roger was not convinced.he also believed that willie smith had a decent shot of winning the election and would be more accessible than del re,who,roger believed,did like to return his phone calls and stuff like that.thereafter,roger attended several fund raisers for smith.smith promised roger that he would be fair in towing area distributions,which roger interpreted to mean that smith would divvy the new towing area between roger and wildwood.roger donated to smith for his primary challenge.roger also lent smith a van from his shop at no charge for use in campaigning.and ernie wrecker service owned by vole,both on the approved list,also supported smith and donated money to his primary campaign and,respectively.
later,roger informed undersheriff stryker that he and his brother randy who owned whitmore service,another approved tow operator had decided to support smith.stryker expressed disappointment with the brothers decision.
unfortunately for smith and his backers,however,del re won the primary election in april.shortly thereafter,in june,roger donated to del re general election campaign.other smith backers,including,ernie wrecker service,and roger brother,did likewise,contributing various sums.del re went on to win the general election in november of,and towing matters proceeded as normal for the remainder of.roger continued to tow for the sheriff department as it had before,and for a while,roger did not notice any difference in the way his company was being treated by the department.
del re modification of towing areas 
sometime in early,del re decided to change the towing boundaries.del re discussed his decision with stryker and brought up the possibility of having max johnson do some towing for the department.during del re campaign,johnson had spoken to crichton to ask how he might receive towing referrals from the department.the parties dispute whether johnson contacted the sheriff department directly to request a towing area,or if he spoke only with crichton.at any rate,del re decided to include johnson on the list.del re ordered one of his deputies to inspect johnson auto center as soon as possible to ensure that it met all the requirements of the illinois vehicle code.
when devising the new towing boundaries,stryker split off part of roger territory to give to johnson because his business was located within roger geographic area,and roger received substantially more calls than most of the towers on the list.in april,upon del re approval of stryker plan,the sheriff department sent letters to each of the twelve towers on the list advising them of the changes.the letter stated that the department planned to slightly modify assigned territories in order to maintain organizational efficiency.
as a result of the new plan,at least five of the towers experienced changes in their towing boundaries.roger believed that his business suffered significant loss of territory due to the split with johnson.ernie wrecker service picked up all of illinois route,whereas before it had only isolated portions of the roadway.boundaries changed slightly or not at all.randy,roger brother,lost a busy intersection.the areas of other listed towers,including h h towing,snyder,and wildwood,were modified slightly or remained the same.
del re fund raising 
unlike his predecessors,del re established a policy that no uniformed officers could solicit campaign contributions instead,he solicited the purchase of tickets through the mail.all told,del re received in campaign contributions from towing operators,out of about in total contributions to his primary and general election campaigns.
after winning the general election,del re carried considerable campaign debt.in late summer of,crichton formulated a plan to raise money to pay off del re campaign debt.after consultation with stryker,crichton planned a event for that purpose.crichton broached the idea with towing operators fred moser,ed kohlmeyer,and wally herman.four towing companies on the approved,johnson auto center,wildwood,and ray to the fund raiser.kevin towing,a company not on the approved list,donated to del re campaigns.
roger lawsuit 
roger was dissatisfied with del re new towing plan,believing that it had an adverse effect on his business.in april,within weeks of receiving del re new plan,roger and his company filed a two count complaint against lake county and del re seeking damages and injunctive relief pursuant to for alleged retaliation by del re for roger support of smith in the primary election.on april,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding stryker,del re campaign committee,crichton,and a host of roger rival towing operators.the amended complaint also added various rico and fraud claims.the plaintiffs later filed a second amended complaint further refining the rico allegations and dropping several defendants.
after several rounds of dismissals weeded out various parties and claims,the plaintiffs had remaining a handful of claims against a few important for our purposes,two rico counts against del re and stryker and two retaliation claims brought under against del re.in march,the district court granted summary judgment in the defendants favor on all remaining counts.the defendants also filed a motion for attorneys fees pursuant to,which the district court granted.roger appeals the grant of summary judgment in del re and stryker favor,as well as the grant of attorneys fees 
ii.discussion 
roger devotes much,if not most,of his briefs and argument to an extensive critique of the district court memorandum opinion.it is the district court judgment that we review,however,and we do so de novo.see corley rosewood care,cir.we view the facts and make all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,roger.id.summary judgment is appropriate if the record as a whole reveals no genuine issue of material fact for trial,and the moving party therefore is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.thus,summary judgment is not appropriate if a dispute about a material fact is genuine,that is,if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.the nonmoving party must offer something more than a scintilla of evidence to overcome summary judgment,see id.at,and must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
the gravamen of roger complaint is that del re and stryker punished roger for supporting willie smith in the primary race for sheriff.roger also broadly alleges that del re and stryker operated a corrupt system for towing in lake county,in which the defendants intimidated towing operators into donating money to del re campaign to remain on the towing list and solicited bribes from towing operators seeking to buy a spot on the approved list.in sum,roger legal claims are that del re retaliated against roger for exercising his constitutional right to support the political candidate of his choice counts and,and the defendants accepted bribes,engaged in extortion,and otherwise acted corruptly in violation of rico counts and.we take these arguments in turn.
retaliation claims 
roger brings his retaliation claims pursuant to,alleging that he was punished for exercising his free speech rights under the federal and illinois constitutions.the legal basis for roger claims comes from companion supreme court decisions issued on the same day.bd.of county comm rs,wabaunsee county umbehr,d truck,city of northlake,d.in both cases,the court recognized the right of independent contractors not to be retaliated against by the government on the basis of their exercise of free speech,expression,or association.
involved facts superficially similar to those before us in this case.was a towing operator that,like roger,was on a rotation list of available towers,at.had been on the list for nearly thirty years and its owner had an understanding that would remain on the list as long as it provided good service.id.northlake new mayor,elected in,indicated that he was pleased with work and would continue using and referring its services.id.four years later,the mayor reelection committee asked owner for a campaign contribution.id.owner refused,however,and threw his support behind the mayor opponent.id.shortly thereafter,was removed from the towing rotation list in retaliation for his stance during the campaign.id.at.
brought suit under,alleging that the retaliation violated his first amendment right of political association.the district court dismissed complaint,and this court affirmed,because controlling caselaw at the time did not recognize that independent contractors enjoyed such a right.see id.at.the court disagreed,however,concluding that had stated a valid constitutional claim.id.at.the court held that independent contractors,like public employees,are protected against retaliation by public entities for their political beliefs,consistent with the principles set forth in prior free speech and political affiliation cases.see id.at.see also id.at.branti finkel,d elrod burns,d pickering bd.of educ.of twp.high sch.dist,d.the court left open whether case should be governed by the line of cases,which governs political patronage and affiliation claims,or the pickering line,which governs government employee free speech claims.see,at.
umbehr involved facts less similar to ours an independent contractor alleged that the defendant county commissioners terminated his contract in retaliation for his public criticism of the county and the board.umbehr,at.the court concluded that summary judgment in the county board favor was not appropriate and held,echoing,that independent contractors may not be retaliated against for the exercise of protected expression.id.at.like the lower courts,the court assumed that the plaintiff had in fact suffered retaliation and concluded that the pickering rule was the appropriate test to evaluate the propriety of the government actions.see id.at.
the principles set forth in the line of cases guide our analysis of roger retaliation claims.there is some uncertainty regarding which legal standard applies in political retaliation cases depending on whether the case involves political patronage or.see heideman wirsing,cir.as noted,even the supreme court in,which was factually similar to this case,left this determination open on remand.
regardless of which of these tests is the better fit,for a plaintiff to prevail in a political retaliation case,it is clear that two fundamental requirements must be satisfied the expression at issue must be protected,and it must have brought about the retaliatory action complained of.see umbehr,at.the first amendment protects government employees from termination because of their speech on matters of public concern to prevail,an employee must prove that the conduct at issue was constitutionally protected,and that it was a substantial or motivating factor in the termination.emphasis in original,citation omitted spiegla hull,cir kokkinis ivkovich,cir nelms modisett,cir accord curinga city of clairton,cir lucas monroe county,cir.we may resolve roger retaliation claim in light of these two basic requirements,so this framework shall suffice for our purposes.
as to whether roger political support of smith was constitutionally protected,the parties quibble over whether the support was for public or private purposes.the district court agreed with the defendants that roger support of smith was for selfish reasons,because roger contribut ed to smith hoping to get beneficial treatment by the newly elected sheriff and thus benefit from the same type of alleged unlawful patronage that he alleges harmed him.the record does seem to support the district court conclusion that roger motives were less than pure,but that determination is irrelevant to this inquiry.we shall assume that roger campaign contributions themselves were expressions of protected political speech or affiliation,no matter what motives roger may have had in making them,buckley valeo,d.so roger satisfies the first requirement.
it is at the second requirement,however,where roger retaliation case founders.as noted,roger must present an indication of a causal link between the protected act and the alleged the act was a substantial or motivating factor in the retaliation.umbehr,at.although roger campaign support of smith was constitutionally protected,roger presents very little evidence that his political support for smith was a substantial or motivating factor in the modification of his towing area.in fact,much of roger evidence is simply that his towing area changed at some point after he failed to support del re in the primary election.beyond this,roger points,for example,to the sheriff department lack of written guidelines for devising towing areas as evidence of del re opportunity to punish dissenters like roger and reward supporters.roger claims that his brother randy who also supported smith lost a busy intersection under the new plan.roger also points to stryker being upset that roger chose not to support del re in the primary,and he suggests that del re use of the phrase organizational efficiency was nothing but a sham because some towers on the list did not lose territory.
this evidence does not carry the day for roger.indeed,it is almost as if roger points to the lack of evidence as proof that his case should go to first time he failed to support an incumbent in a primary race,he suffered a loss in towing territory.as roger sees it,the loss in territory,which occurred in april,could only have come as retaliation for supporting smith in early,and thus his case must proceed to trial.this is a classic post hoc ergo propter hoc logical fallacy,which might make the grade at the pleading stage.but to defeat summary judgment,roger must present something by which a jury could connect the dots between the propter and the post,and at best he has presented only bare speculation or a scintilla of evidence,neither of which will suffice.see,anderson,at.beard whitley county remc,cir a party who bears the burden of proof on a particular issue may not rest on its pleading,but must affirmatively demonstrate,by specific factual allegations,that there is a genuine issue of material fact which requires trial.emphasis in original.
on the record before us,we believe no rational jury could conclude that del re modified roger towing area in retaliation for roger support of smith.indeed,the record appears to contain ample evidence cutting against roger position.for example,we note the substantial lapse in time between roger support of smith and the alleged fourteen months.such a long stretch between the protected conduct and alleged retaliation significantly weakens any inference of a causal connection.wallscetti fox,cir hughes derwinski,cir.
in addition,roger and his brother were not the only towing operators whose assigned areas changed under the new plan.the towing area for,which donated even more money than roger did to willie smith primary campaign,was modified slightly or not at all.the towing area of ernie vole,who donated to smith and whose rumor mongering helped induce roger to do likewise,actually increased under the new plan.even roger concedes that he was unaware of any retaliation these two towers may have suffered as a result of their support of smith.as for his own towing area,roger claims that the new plan resulted in a significant loss,though we note that undisputed evidence indicates that since,roger ranked either second or third among all twelve listed towing companies in terms of volume of business generated by sheriff department referral.
in any event,however roger may measure the magnitude of his loss,he must show the required causal link.this he has not done,so this case is distinguishable from facially similar cases in which plaintiffs provided evidence of causation that precluded summary judgment.see,lucas,at finding that the plaintiffs presented overwhelming evidence that their removal from a tow call list was motivated by their constitutionally protected public criticism of the sheriff department.
finally,aside from the causation shortcomings noted above,roger points to no local laws,regulations,or guidelines that require sheriff del re to maintain a list of favored towing operators,let alone to do so in a prescribed fashion.therefore,as long as del re did not act in a manner that offended towers constitutional rights,he was free to add or remove them from the list as he saw fit,at.kevin thompson,cir collecting authority.roger argues simply that his monthly towing volume and therefore revenue dropped,but that of course is consistent with the reduction in his towing area.he has not,however,shown that the reduction in towing area was,in retaliation for his protected expression.the fact that the constitution extends some first amendment protection to independent contractors like roger does not mean that he enjoys some constitutional guarantee to a particular towing area.
for all of these reasons,the district court properly granted summary judgment on roger retaliation claims.
rico claims 
roger rico claims purport violations of c and d.we first tackle the c claims.to prove a violation of c,a plaintiff must establish that there has been conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.see sedima,imrex,d.a pattern of racketeering activity consists of at least two predicate acts of racketeering committed within a period.
roger asserts that the enterprises in question are del re election committee and the lake county sheriff department.he argues that the racketeering activity consists of the defendants solicitation and acceptance of various contributions relating to del re primary and general elections.in essence,roger claims that the defendants enforced a corrupt system in which towers bribed their way onto the approved list or felt intimidated into making sizable campaign contributions so that del re would not take their business away.roger alleges the following predicate acts in connection with defendants scheme extortion in violation of the hobbs act,mail fraud,wire fraud,and bribery and intimidation in violation of illinois law.comp.stat.and.
at the outset,we note that it is far from clear that the defendants deeds qualify as racketeering activity,particularly the alleged violations of the hobbs act.it is undisputed that the ultimate object of the alleged predicate acts was to raise money for del re primary and general election campaigns.campaign contributions,of course,are not in and of themselves illegal,and they reflect the nature of the american political system for better or worse,mccormick united states,d united states giles,cir united states allen,cir.illinois law authorizes the sort of solicitation of campaign contributions at issue in this case.see.comp.stat.yet roger claims that the defendants engaged in hobbs act extortion,defined as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear,or under color of official right.b.
in cases in which color of official right extortion is alleged,it can be difficult to separate political contributions from the shady.giles,at c ampaign contributions often are made with the hope that the recipient,if elected,will further interests with which the contributor agrees there is nothing illegal about such contributions.the supreme court therefore requires proof of a quid pro quo.evans united states,d t he plaintiff need only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled,knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.giles,at to distinguish legal from illegal campaign contributions,it makes sense to require the plaintiff to prove that a particular contribution was made in exchange for an explicit promise or undertaking by the official.for the other type of hobbs act extortion at victim fear must be reasonable.see sutherland,cir.
for either type of extortion,roger evidence is woefully inadequate.roger offers no objective evidence that the defendants were extorting the campaign funds from him or other towing operators.instead,roger merely points to evidence that del re accepted money from him and other towers which,of course,is undisputed and contends that the contributions could only have been in exchange for presence on the list or from fear of being removed from the list.roger relies heavily on subjective belief that the payments were a sort of quid pro quo or offered out of fear.for example,he offers the fact that towers made up a disproportionate percentage of del re campaign contributions.he claims that the defendants received one contribution of cash in an envelope,and argues that del re violated his rule prohibiting solicitation.roger also testified to his discomfort at having sheriffs sporting guns and badges personally pick up contributions and cites isolated testimony from a fellow tower that it helps to make contributions to the incumbent sheriff.all of this,roger contends,is proof that the defendants extorted funds from towers.
we do not believe a rational jury could find in roger favor on the basis of this evidence.for one,it should hardly be surprising that towers made up a disproportionate percentage of del re campaign contributions,given the manner in which the lake county sheriff department has long used a list of approved towers.allen,at it would be naive to suppose that contributors do not expect some for favorable legislation,for their contributions.this is the very nature of politics,and in the absence of evidence indicating some wrongdoing independent of legal solicitation of campaign contributions,this proportional disparity is evidence of nothing.as stated,illinois law expressly allows for solicitation of contributions like del re,so merely accepting cash is not evidence of extortion,especially when there is no separate evidence of an explicit,promised quid pro quo.see evans,at.united states martin,cir collecting authority.
likewise,roger bald assertion that he and other towers had been intimidated does not carry the day.as noted,any fear that roger or the others may have felt must be reasonable.this is where roger failure to present some objective evidence of example,historical data tying the award or denial of towing to contributions made or not a serious problem for roger case.if a plaintiff subjective discomfort with uniformed and armed law enforcement officers dropping by for contributions is enough to qualify as hobbs act extortion,it wo be long before all police fund raisers for political or other purposes come to an end.there must be objective evidence to indicate that the plaintiff fears are reasonable and otherwise to allow a jury to find hobbs act extortion we find none in this record to satisfy roger burden of establishing a material issue of fact for trial.
in any event,we need not delve into a discussion of whatever flaws there may be in the remaining predicate acts that allegedly amount to racketeering activity.even if we generously assume that all of the remaining acts in question so qualify,roger still must show a pattern of racketeering activity.the supreme court long ago made clear that the statutory definition of a racketeering acts within ten not so much define a pattern of racketeering activity as state a minimum necessary condition for the existence of such a pattern.bell,d.to establish a pattern of racketeering activity,a plaintiff must show continued criminal activity or the threat thereof and relationship between the predicate standard commonly dubbed the continuity plus relationship test.see id.at.
relatedness of the alleged predicate acts does not pose a problem here.all of the acts complained of were indisputably for the purpose of raising funds for del re primary and general election campaigns or paying off his campaign debt,so we shall assume that roger meets the relationship prong.see id.at.teaching that predicate acts are related if they have the same or similar purposes,results,participants,victims,or methods of commission,or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events citation omitted.
roger does not,however,supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the continuity prong.as the court has noted,continuity is both a closed and concept.id.at.as its name suggests,a closed period of racketeering activity involves a course of criminal conduct that has ended.a plaintiff may demonstrate a closed period of continuity by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.id.at.on the other hand,an period of racketeering is a course of criminal conduct that lacks the duration and repetition to establish continuity.a plaintiff may nevertheless satisfy continuity by showing past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.see id.to summarize,a rico plaintiff can satisfy the continuity prong either by demonstrating a series of conduct that existed for such an extended period of time that a threat of future harm is implicit,or an series of conduct that,while,shows clear signs of threatening to continue into the future.see midwest grinding spitz,cir.
this court has analyzed continuity under a multifactor test,in which we consider the number and variety of predicate acts and the length of time over which they were committed,the number of victims,the presence of separate schemes,and the occurrence of distinct injuries.see morgan bank of waukegan,cir.no one factor is dispositive of a claim.olive can martin,cir.rather,our analysis of the continuity prong is and undertaken with the goal of achieving a natural and commonsense result,consistent with congress concern with criminal conduct.see see also vicom,harbridge merch,cir citations omitted sutherland,at.
analysis of the various factors present in this case leads us to conclude that roger has not shown continuity.as previously noted,roger rico claim is against both del re and stryker.the campaign contributions at issue spanned at most about two,when del re started off his campaign for sheriff,to,when del re solicited donations to pay off his campaign debt.perhaps the most important element of rico continuity is its temporal aspect.see,midwest grinding,at.although we have not employed a rule for how long a closed period must be to satisfy continuity,we have not hesitated to find that closed periods of several months to several years did not qualify as substantial enough to satisfy continuity.see id.citing and collecting additional authority.
likewise,the number of predicate acts alleged is not large.roger points to several different instances of what he believes to be mail of solicitations for purchase of tickets and del re notice to towers that the towing areas would be revised.roger also claims that various phone calls between johnson and crichton and the department constituted wire fraud.finally,roger broadly asserts that the handful of meetings between the defendants and some towing operators constituted bribery and intimidation.the fairly small number of predicate acts cuts against showing continuity,particularly when a large proportion of the acts involved wire or
