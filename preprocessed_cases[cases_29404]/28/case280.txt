we consider the constitutionality of tucson unusual system for electing members of its city council.
tucson elections are ordinary in many ways.the city is divided into six wards of approximately equal population,and each ward is allotted one seat on the city council.a candidate for city council must run for the seat in the ward where he resides.see tucson city charter ch.iii,ch.xvi.from there,things take an odd turn.
in some american cities,council seats are filled at large,with the entire city voting for each seat in the primary and general elections.in other cities,council members are nominated and elected by the residents of particular districts.tucson splits the difference since,the city has used a hybrid system that combines primaries with general elections.
the first step in the hybrid system is a partisan primary.each ward holds its own primary limited to residents of that ward.the winners of the ward primaries advance to the general election,where they compete against the other candidates nominated from that ward.in the general election,all tucson residents can vote for one council member from each ward that held a primary during the same election cycle.see charter ch.xvi.thus,a resident of ward ca vote in the ward primary,but can vote for one of the ward candidates in the general election.the parties agree that,once elected,council members represent the entire city,not just the ward from which they were nominated.see city of tucson state,tucson council members,although nominated by ward,represent the entire city,just as do council members elected at large in other cities.see also dallas cty.reese,e lected officials represent all of those who elect them fortson dorsey,similar.
council seats are filled in staggered elections,with three council members elected every other year.once elected,a council member serves a term.see charter ch.xvi.the council members from wards,and will be elected in,and the council members from wards,and will be elected in.because only half of the council seats are up for election in any given year,only half of tucsonans can vote in a primary in each election cycle.and approximately percent of the electorate that votes for any given council seat in the general election has no say in selecting the nominees competing for that seat.
plaintiffs are five tucson voters and a corporation called the public integrity alliance collectively pia.pia concedes that the city could use primaries and general elections without offending the constitution.similarly,the city could use primaries and general elections.but pia argues that combining these two options into a hybrid system violates the federal and arizona by depriving tucson voters of their right to vote in primary elections for individuals who will ultimately serve as their representatives.pia sued the city seeking to enjoin the hybrid system and secure a declaration that the scheme is unconstitutional.the district court ruled in favor of the city.we have jurisdiction under.
discussion 
we start by resolving a dispute between the parties that has a substantial bearing on our analysis and,ultimately,on the result we reach are tucson primary and general elections two separate contests,each governed by rules that must be judged independently of one another as the city contends or are they two parts of a single election cycle,which must be considered in tandem when determining their constitutionality as pia claims the difference matters a great deal.if the two elections were separate,pia constitutional objections would largely evaporate and this would become a simple case.this is so because there would be no mismatch between the voting constituency and the represented constituency in the two elections.it only if we view the two elections as one that serious constitutional doubts arise.
unfortunately,the easy solution is not available because it is perfectly clear that the two contests are not independent.instead,they are complementary components of a single election.although the two contests are separated in time by ten weeks,they are entirely.without the primary,there could be no candidate to compete in the general election without the general election,the primary winners would sit on their hands.because a candidate must win a primary in order to compete in the general election,the right to choose a representative is in fact controlled by the primary.united states classic.thus,the supreme court has held that the primary and general elections are a single instrumentality for choice of officers.smith allwright,see newberry united states,pitney,concurring in part noting that the primary and general elections are essentially but parts of a single process.
because the primary and general elections are two parts of a unitary process,allwright,at,a citizen right to vote in the general election may be meaningless unless he is also permitted to vote in the primary.if a voter preferred candidate is defeated in a primary from which the voter is excluded,the voter would never have the chance to cast a ballot for his candidate of choice.morse republican party of,invalidating registration fee for virginia senatorial nominating convention because the fee limited voters influence on the field of candidates whose names would appear on the ballot and thus weaken ed the effectiveness of their votes cast in the general election itself bullock carter,t he primary election may be more crucial than the general election classic,at observing that the practical influence of the choice of candidates at the primary may be so great as to affect profoundly the choice at the general election ayers schaffner distefano,cir noting that the ability to vote in the general election is not a satisfactory alternative for those voters not allowed to vote in the primary,as the candidate of their choice may have been excluded in the preliminary election from which they were barred.
this case illustrates the point.although arizona as a whole generally votes republican,tucson generally votes democratic.this means that the democratic nominee from each ward will likely win the general election regardless of whether the ward from which he was nominated is principally republican or democratic.indeed,the city current mayor and all six council members are democrats.see tucson city council democratic incumbents re elected,arizona public media,available at.in most cases,then,the democratic ward primary is the only election that matters the general election is a mere formality.even if electing the democratic nominee is not automatic,there is no dispute that the democratic nominee enters the general election with an enormous advantage.thus the vote in the primary and particularly the democratic primary has a commanding influence on the outcome of the general election.yet of tucson voters have not even a theoretical possibility of participating in the primary that will,for all practical purposes,determine who will represent them in the city council.
the supreme court has indicated that,o nce the geographical unit for which a representative is to be chosen is designated,all who participate in the election are to have an equal vote no matter where their home may be in that geographical unit.gray sanders.gray defines the geographical unit by reference to the constituency of the representative to be chosen.id.at see id.at stewart,concurring within a given constituency,there can be room for but a single constitutional rule one voter,one vote.emphasis added.all parties before us agree that the constituency of each tucson council member is the entire city.thus,the relevant geographical unit is the city at large.because the constituency of the representative to be elected remains static throughout the election process,the geographical unit must also remain static throughout that process 
if the city were permitted to change the geographical unit between the primary and general elections,it could decouple the representative to be elected from his constituency.for example,tucson could decree that only voters living on main street are eligible to vote in primaries,thereby forcing the entire city to choose among nominees selected by a tiny minority of residents.or the state of new york,in an effort to cap its number of senators,could limit the primary for its junior senator to manhattanites and the primary for its senior senator to the rest of the state.we do not believe that such mismatches between voters at different stages of a single election cycle are constitutionally permissible.
given the city concession that each council member represents all of tucson,it clear that the representational nexus runs between the city and the council member,not between the ward and the council member.but the hybrid system makes the tenure of each council member largely dependent on the preferences of voters of his home ward without their support,a council member could not be nominated or in the first place.given that reality,each council member will be disproportionately responsive to voters from his home ward,especially those of his own party.the city claims that this is a redeeming benefit of its hybrid system.the exact opposite is true.the practical effect of the tucson system is to give some of a representative constituents those in his home ward a vote of disproportionate weight.that is the very result the supreme court one person,one vote jurisprudence is meant to foreclose.see reynolds sims.we can not endorse an election system that encourages representatives to prioritize kissing babies and currying favor in their home wards over the interests of their constituents who happen to live in other parts of the city.as the supreme court itself has noted,an representative must be vigilant to serve the interests of all the people in the city,and not merely those of people in his home ward.fortson,at.
we hold that every otherwise eligible voter who will be a constituent of the winner of the general election must have an equal opportunity to participate in each election cycle through which that candidate is selected.just as the city could not exclude a resident of ward from voting in the general election for his council member from ward,so the city may not exclude that resident from a primary election for the same official.see allwright,at t he same tests to determine the character of discrimination or abridgement should be applied to the primary as are applied to the general election.classic,at the right of participation in the nominating process is protected just as is the right to vote at the election.
the city final argument is that the hybrid system is a reasonable residency restriction on the right to vote.but when two groups of citizens share identical interests in an election,the city may not use a residency requirement to exclude one group while including the other.see town of lockport citizens for comm.action at the local level,residency requirements must be premised on a genuine difference in the relevant interests of the groups that the state electoral classification has created id.excluded group must be permitted to vote if it has substantially identical interests as included group evans cornman,residents of federal enclave within maryland could be excluded from the franchise because they had a stake equal to that of other maryland residents see also holt civic club city of tuscaloosa,suggesting that a city might be required to enfranchise if it were exercising precisely the same governmental powers over them as it does over those residing within its corporate limits in this case,the tucsonans who are excluded from the ward primaries have precisely the same interests in those primaries as do the ward residents who are permitted to participate.the nominees selected in the ward primaries will advance to the general election if elected there,they will represent the entire city.because all tucsonans have an equal interest in determining who the nominees will be,the city may not exclude voters from the primaries.
little thunder south dakota,cir,is instructive.that case involved a challenge to south dakota scheme for governing its unorganized counties.the residents of the unorganized counties were governed by elected officials in the nearest organized county,but only the residents of the organized county were allowed to vote for those officials.the state defended this scheme as a reasonable residency requirement.id.at.in its view,the residents of the unorganized counties who were mainly native americans did not share the same interests in the elections as did the residents of the organized counties.the eighth circuit rejected the argument.citing cornman,that court held that a state may not use a residency requirement to prevent citizens from voting for those who will function as their elected officials.id.at.the court applied strict scrutiny and invalidated the scheme.id.
the fact that two groups live on opposite sides of a political boundary does not necessarily mean they can be treated differently for voting purposes.this is the teaching of little thunder.at see english bd.of educ.of town of boonton,cir united states south dakota,cir see also holt civic club,at,brennan,dissenting cautioning against ced ing to geography a talismanic significance.if two groups are represented by the same politician,they are necessarily part of a single unit of local government.little thunder,at.any boundary that purports to that single unit is hopelessly arbitrary,and any residency restriction that disenfranchises citizens based on where they live in relation to that arbitrary boundary can not stand.excluding voters from the primary election discriminates among residents of the same governmental unit in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
there are certain times when a federal court may tell a municipality how to run its local elections.this is not one of them.tucson hybrid election system does not invidiously discriminate against voters based on their race,ethnicity,gender,or wealth.rather,plaintiffs argue and the majority agrees that tucson unconstitutionally denies its citizens the right to vote by setting different geographical units for its councilmanic primary and general elections.because i conclude that the constitution does not require tucson to draw its district borders in a particular way for different local elections,i respectfully dissent.
the constitution grants states broad power to prescribe the times,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,art.i,cl,which power is matched by state control over the election process for state offices.clingman beaver.the united states supreme court has recognized that government is the science of experiment and that states are afforded wide leeway when experimenting with the appropriate allocation of state legislative power.holt city of tuscaloosa,citing anderson dunn,wheat.however,a state power over its electoral procedures is not absolute and must pass muster against the charges of discrimination or of abridgment of the right to vote.moore ogilvie.
conspicuously absent from the majority opinion is any mention of the appropriate standard of review.in burdick takushi,the supreme court announced the standard for evaluating laws respecting the right to vote.although we typically invoke strict scrutiny to evaluate state laws that implicate fundamental rights,burdick requires courts to apply a more deferential level of scrutiny to most state election laws that abridge the fundamental right to vote.id.at dudum arntz,cir recognizing that burdick creates a sliding scale standard of review.courts determine the appropriate level of scrutiny to evaluate a state election law by examining the burden the law imposes on voters rights and then weighing that burden against the state legitimate interest in maintaining the law.burdick,at citing anderson celebrezze,lauren watts,reexamining crawford poll worker error as a burden on voters,discussing the framework.
under this standard,the rigorousness of our inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens first and fourteenth amendment rights.burdick,at.strict scrutiny review is appropriate only if the burdens are severe otherwise,the state election law is constitutional so long a
