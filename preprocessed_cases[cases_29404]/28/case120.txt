opinion of the court 
this appeal,considered on an extremely expedited basis,arises out of a challenge to new jersey state legislative reapportionment plan.on april,the new jersey apportionment commission,charged under the state constitution with the task of apportioning voters among the legislative districts following each decennial census,adopted a districting plan supported by the commission five democratic members as well as the commission neutral eleventh member.the adoption of this plan came just before the april,filing deadline for candidates for the upcoming state legislative election.the primary election is as of the time of this opinion scheduled to occur on june,with the general election to follow in november.
on april,the day after the apportionment commission adoption of the districting plan,plaintiffs appellants in the current appeal filed a complaint in the district court for the district of new jersey,alleging that the commission plan violated of the voting rights act of and the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution.we set forth the relevant text in the margin named in the complaint as plaintiffs are several registered voters and residents of essex county several hispanic registered voters and residents of essex or hudson county and the republican members of the new jersey senate and general assembly.we have,and will hereinafter,refer to these individuals collectively as plaintiffs.named as defendants are the apportionment commission the commission five democratic members the commission eleventh member,professor larry bartels new jersey secretary of state and new jersey attorney general.we will hereinafter refer to these parties collectively as defendants.
the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint is one of vote dilution.more specifically,plaintiffs contend that new jersey new apportionment scheme deprives voters in essex county of their ability to have the representatives of their choice elected to the new jersey legislature.for support,plaintiffs rely primarily on the fact that,under new jersey old apportionment plan,three districts located principally in essex county had populations that were majority,while under new jersey apportionment plan,the population in two of these districts drops below fifty percent,and in the third,stands at of the total population.plaintiffs contend that this elimination and weakening of formerly state legislative districts was a deliberate act on the part of defendants,intended to dilute and having the effect of diluting the vote of the population in the essex county region of new jersey.
upon filing this complaint,plaintiffs sought and received from the district court a temporary restraining order preventing defendants from putting the new apportionment plan into effect.four days later,on april,the district court conducted a hearing concerning plaintiffs application for further relief,in connection with which both sides presented declarations from experts concerning,inter alia,voting patterns in essex county,new jersey.plaintiffs submissions,based upon analysis of recent elections,and buttressed by a letter from martin luther king iii,head of the southern christian leadership conference,maintained that the reapportionment plan would reverse significant electoral and political gains that voters have secured and threatened to frustrate future opportunities for the vigorous participation of voices in the political marketplace.
defendants countered that the apportionment plan did not dilute voting strength,but rather enhanced it.according to defendants,because of the existence of significant racial voting between,whites,and hispanics in new jersey generally and in essex county specifically,an group need not constitute a numerical majority in any single legislative district in or der to possess the effective ability to elect preferred representatives.in a submission similarly based upon analysis of recent election trends,defendants contended that the retention of the three districts advocated by plaintiffs actually impedes the ability of to elect the representatives of their choice,as it packs unnecessarily large numbers of voters in the same legislative district,preventing them from exerting electoral influence in other parts of the state.
after hearing these presentations,the district court issued a bench opinion denying plaintiffs application for relief.plaintiffs timely appealed from that denial,and we agreed to hear that appeal on an extremely expedited basis.this appeal largely concerns the events that transpired at the april,hearing,and the precise nature of the district court disposition of plaintiffs application for relief on that date.
crucial to our resolution of this appeal is the existence of a special procedural mechanism for constitutional challenges to statewide legislative apportionment schemes.that mechanism,codified at,requires that a district court of three judges,rather than a single judge,hear action s filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of any statewide legislative body.although a single district judge has certain limited powers,including the power to issue temporary restraining orders,until the convening of a court,a single judge does not have the power to entertain applications for preliminary injunctive relief.see b.in this case,the district court did not request the convening of a court,nor did it determine whether such a request was necessary in light of plaintiffs claims.accordingly,we must decide whether the district court disposition of plaintiffs relief application,given the requirements imposed by,was error.
we conclude that it was,and remand to the district court so that a court can be convened to hear the plaintiffs voting rights act and constitutional claims.in addition,we decline to grant plaintiffs request that we provide for interim relief pending action in the lower courts because of our belief that under the present circumstances,we should avoid undue disruption of new jersey impending legislative elections.moreover,as we explain below,we have no jurisdiction to grant interim injunctive relief in this case.
the new jersey legislature comprises a state senate consisting of members and a general assembly consisting of members.for the purpose of selecting these representatives,new jersey is divided into legislative districts,with each district selecting one senator and two assembly members.the new jersey constitution provides that,following each federal decennial census,the senate districts and assembly districts shall be established,and the senators and members of the general assembly shall be apportioned among them.const.art.iv.to discharge this task,the constitution authorizes the creation of an apportionment commission to consist initially of ten members,five to be appointed by the chairman of the state committee of each of the two political parties whose candidates for governor receive the largest number of votes at the most recent gubernatorial election.id.the constitution further provides that the state committee chairs are to make such appointments on or before november of the year in which the census is taken,and that the secretary of state is to certify those appointments on or before december of that same year.see id.
within one month of receipt by the governor of new jersey of the official decennial census of the united states,or on or before february of the year following the year in which the census was taken,whichever is later,the commission is required to certify to the secretary of state the apportionment of voters among the districts.see id.certification occurs by an affirmative vote of the majority of the whole number of the commission members.id.if the commission fails to certify an apportionment on or before the deadline,or determines prior to that date that it will be unable to do so,the constitution mandates that the chief justice of the supreme court of new jersey appoint an eleventh member of the commission.id.within one month after the appointment of this eleventh member,the commission,again by a majority vote,is required to certify the apportionment of the legislative districts to the secretary of state.see id.
the most recent united states decennial census was taken in the year,and,pursuant to its constitutional directive,new jersey followed the legislative district apportionment procedure delineated above.an apportionment commission was appointed and certified in november,consisting of five members each from the state democratic and republican parties quite obviously,these were the two political parties whose candidates for governor receive d the largest number of votes at the most recent gubernatorial election.id.this commission was unable to agree on a district apportionment plan,necessitating the appointment of the eleventh member by the chief justice of the supreme court of new jersey.on march,the chief justice selected for that position larry bartels,a professor of politics and public affairs at princeton university,a founding director of the center for the study of democratic politics at the woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs,a past president of the methods section of the american political science association,and a former chair of the board of overseers of the national election studies.professor bartels has studied and written extensively on electoral politics and statistical models.
following preliminary discussions both with the commission republican and democratic delegations to review procedures and standards for the commission apportionment work,the commission set about the apportionment task,convening the first meeting on april.during the period between april,and april,the democratic and republican contingents submitted several proposed apportionment plans and districting maps to professor bartels,which he and his staff received and evaluated.according to professor bartels,each proposed plan was evaluated against a number of specified criteria,including minimizing population deviations between the districts,in order to secure compliance with the one person,one vote rule established under the federal constitution ensuring the fair representation of minority voters,as required by the voting rights act and the federal constitution keeping each of the forty existing districts contiguous keeping each of the existing districts reasonably compact respecting municipal boundaries by not splitting towns smaller than newark and jersey city among different districts respecting boundaries avoiding any bias in favor of one or the other political party ensuring that some seats remained competitive and minimizing voter disruption.
on april,the commission adopted a modified version of an apportionment plan,labeled,earlier submitted by the commission democratic membership.the final vote was,with all democratic members and professor bartels,the eleventh member,voting in support of the plan,and with four of the five republican members of the commission abstaining.in adopting the plan,the commission rejected a competing plan,labeled,submitted by the republican contingent the previous day,april.
the instant litigation commenced almost simultaneously with the commission adoption of the plan.on april,the day following this adoption,plaintiffs filed a verified complaint in the district court.the first and second counts alleged violations of of the voting rights act,the third count claimed an infringement of plaintiffs due process and equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment,and the fourth count asserted a violation of the fifteenth amendment.that same day,plaintiffs requested and received from the district court an order to show cause with temporary restraints.the order to show cause immediately and temporarily restrained from employing,ratifying,or in any way putting into effect,directly or indirectly,the apportionment map purportedly approved by the new jersey apportionment commission on april,and further commanded the parties to appear on april,for a hearing before the district court as to why an order should not be entered against the defendants restraining and enjoining the d efendants from employing,ratifying or in any way putting into effect,directly or indirectly,the apportionment map,purportedly approved by the new jersey apportionment commission on april.
on april,the district court conducted the hearing and,shortly after the hearing conclusion,issued an order denying plaintiffs application.the events that transpired at this april hearing,and the precise nature of the district court disposition of plaintiffs application are our central focus,as they go to the significant and dispositive jurisdictional issue raised by this appeal.accordingly,we will reserve discussion of these matters for section ii below.
although the district court denied plaintiffs application for relief,it concurrently issued an oral temporary stay,enjoining the printing of ballots for the upcoming election until noon on april.plaintiffs immediately filed an emergency motion before us,requesting that we continue in effect the district court stay of the ballot printing and that we expand the stay to reimpose the general prohibition against the implementation of the reapportionment plan that the district court had initially granted in its april,order to show cause with temporary restraints.on april,judge leonard garth heard plaintiffs emergency motion and,sitting as a single judge of the court of appeals pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure c,ordered that the stay entered by the district court be continued until noon on april,that same day,plaintiffs noticed their timely appeal to this court.in light of new jersey impending legislative noted above,the deadline for candidates to file in the senate and assembly races was set to expire on april,and the primary election is at the time of this opinion set for june,agreed to hear this appeal on an expedited basis.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a.
the matter of the district court jurisdiction,given the specialized procedural requirements imposed by for challenges made to state apportionment plans,forms the heart of the instant appeal.the central inquiry before us can be stated as follows given the constraints that imposes on the actions of a single district judge in proceedings in which a court is required,did the district court act outside of its authority when,in its april,order,it denied plaintiffs application for an order restraining the implementation of the apportionment plan we further note that our own appellate jurisdiction over the merits of plaintiffs claims is a function of the district court jurisdiction.see idlewild bon voyage liquor epstein,d per curiam explaining that a court of appeals may not review the merits of a case that should originally have been determined by a court of three judges,although it may review the district judge decision not to request such a court.
in general,authorizes the convening of a district court composed of three judges,specifies the situations in which such a court is required,and outlines the procedure that such a court is to follow the two provisions most pertinent to this appeal are contained in a and b.section a identifies those situations in which the convening of a court is compulsory 
a district court of three judges shall be convened when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of any statewide legislative body.
a emphasis added.section b delineates the scope of a single district judge authority to act and thus his or her jurisdiction in proceedings that require the establishment of a district court 
a single judge may conduct all proceedings except the trial,and enter all orders permitted by the rules of civil procedure except as provided in this subsection.he may grant a temporary restraining order on a specific finding,based on evidence submitted,that specified irreparable damage will result if the order is not granted,which order,unless previously revoked by the district judge,shall remain in force only until the hearing and determination by the district court of three judges of an application for a preliminary injunction.a single judge shall not appoint a master,or order a reference,or hear and determine any application for a preliminary or permanent injunction or motion to vacate such an injunction,or enter judgment on the merits.any action of a single judge may be reviewed by the full court at any time before final judgment.
id.b emphasis added.the provisions of a and b are necessarily interdependent the constraints imposed by b on a single district judge authority to act are not triggered unless the action is one that is required,under the terms of a,to be heard by a district court of three judges.grants or denials of injunctive relief by a court are directly appealed to the united states supreme court.see.
our analysis of the district court actions on april,will thus proceed in two stages.first,we will ascertain the exact nature of the district court denial of plaintiffs application.if the district court merely denied an application for a temporary restraining order,we would clearly lack appellate jurisdiction over that denial see,robinson lehman,cir the denial of a temporary restraining order is not generally appealable unless its denial decides the merits of the case or is equivalent to a dismissal of the claim.if,however,the district court decision constituted a denial of a preliminary injunction,we would have to consider the propriety of such action under b,which proscribes a single district judge from hear ing and determin ing any application for a preliminary injunction in matters in which the convening of a district court is required.should we find that the district court denied a preliminary injunction,it will then be necessary to proceed to the second stage of our analysis,whether plaintiffs suit represented an action challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of any statewide legislative body within the meaning of a.we turn now to the first stage of our analysis.
at the outset,it should be noted that the district court april,order and bench opinion accompanying that order are less than pellucid as to the exact nature of the court disposition.the text of the order itself merely recites that plaintiff sic application is denied,without specifying whether this action is a denial of a temporary restraining order,or of a preliminary injunction.there is record evidence,specifically a portion of the april,hearing before the district court,which suggests that plaintiffs counsel understood that proceeding at least at its outset to be one concerning the extension of a temporary restraining order,rather than one related to preliminary injunctive relief 
nonetheless,after reviewing the full text of the transcript,we are convinced that the district court decision constituted a denial of preliminary injunction relief.most significantly,the district court,in issuing its bench opinion,explicitly stated that t his,of course,is an application for a preliminary injunction,and proceeded to summarize its analysis under each of the four prongs of the test for preliminary injunctive relief.accordingly,we are convinced that the district court april,order amounted to a denial of a preliminary injunction.we now proceed to the second,and more involved,stage of our jurisdictional analysis.
as noted above,the bar imposed by b on a single district judge authority to hear and determine a preliminary injunction application is triggered only in proceedings in which the convening of a district court is required.phrased in statutory terms,the jurisdictional issue at this second stage of our analysis is whether the suit instituted by plaintiffs in the district of new jersey constitutes an action challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of any statewide legislative body within the meaning of a.
plaintiffs verified complaint contests the new jersey apportionment commission adopted redistricting plan on both constitutional and statutory grounds.counts one and two allege vote dilution on the part of defendants in violation of of the voting rights act,while counts three and four present fourteenth and fifteenth amendment challenges to the apportionment plan.moreover,in the april,hearing,plaintiffs counsel presented both the voting rights act and the constitutional grounds for restraining implementation of the apportionment plan to the district court.had plaintiffs counsel only brought the fourteenth and fifteenth amendment claims before the district court,and had the court denied the preliminary injunction as to those claims,our jurisdictional answer would be simple and straightforward plaintiffs action was clearly one challenging the constitutionality of new jersey statewide apportionment scheme under a,and thus the district court,acting as single district judge,was explicitly proscribed from hearing let alone denying the application for preliminary injunctive relief under b.
at the outset of its bench opinion on april,the district court recognized that plaintiffs had presented both statutory and constitutional challenges to the new jersey apportionment commission redistricting plan,observing that plaintiffs claims arise under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of the united states constitution and the voting rights act of.in rendering its decision,however,the district court stated that the principal issue before it was whether the apportionment plan violates section of the voting rights act of and then,taking up the first of the four factors for assessing the propriety of preliminary injunctive relief,announced that there is no likelihood that plaintiffs will ultimately prevail on the merits.we read the district court as confining its ruling only to the voting rights act claim,and remaining silent on the constitutional claims.
thus,from a procedural perspective,we are faced with a situation in which the district court had before it both voting rights act and constitutional challenges to a statewide apportionment scheme,and proceeded to the merits of only the statutory claim.insofar as plaintiffs did not waive their constitutional challenge during the district court proceedings we must determine whether the district court had authority under to render such a disposition.for the reasons set forth below,we believe that the district court acted outside of its authority in entertaining the preliminary injunction application,and thus its decision must be vacated.
our starting point is the statutory language a straightforward reading of the pertinent language suggests that the entire case,and not just the constitutional claims,must be heard by a court.this is because the language of itself is broadly applicable to actions not narrowly to claims challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of a statewide legislative body.under this view,because the action in this case includes a challenge brought under of the voting rights act,the challenge,as well as the fourteenth and fifteenth amendment challenges,are subject to a requirement that they be heard by a district court 
however,our analysis can not be so simple,largely because of the precedent that was generated under older statutory versions of the court requirements.prior to,the three judge court act mandated that a court be convened to hear any action in which plaintiffs sought to enjoin the enforcement of a state statute on constitutional grounds.because the scope of the act was potentially quite broad,with resulting disruptions and inefficiencies in the administration of cases,the supreme court determined that the act should be construed to require a court in as few situations as possible.see,swift,wickham,d phillips united states.consequently,decisions from both the supreme court and the courts of appeals leaned toward the view that when a case was presented that included some issues requiring the convening of a district court and some issues that could be ruled upon by a single district judge,there existed no jurisdictional bar to a single judge disposing of the issues properly within his or her province.see,rosado wyman,d.further,some courts appeared to suggest that even where a single district judge improperly considered issues that should have been referred to a court,the courts of appeals would have jurisdiction to consider appeals based solely on the aspects of the judge ruling that could have been legitimately decided by a single judge.see,stone philbrook,cir.
these rules reached their zenith with the supreme court decision in hagans lavine,d.in that case,the plaintiffs challenged a state statute both on the ground that it conflicted with federal law,and on constitutional grounds.under the old court requirements,the constitutional claims could only be heard by a court,but there was no such requirement for the statutory challenge.thus,in the lower court proceedings in hagans,a single district judge,without requesting a court,considered the statutory issues alone and held in the plaintiffs favor.then,because the case had been resolved on statutory grounds,the judge determined that the convening of a court to entertain the constitutional challenge was not required.
the case made its way to the supreme court,which upheld the district judge choice to adjudicate the statutory claims before determining whether the convening of a court was necessary.the court rested its holding on several policy considerations,chiefly concerns for judicial efficiency,and the fact that,had the court been convened at the outset,the statutory issues might still have been remanded for the single judge resolution.see id.at.thus,a straightforward application of hagans might well lead us to conclude that the district court had authority to act upon and thus that we have appellate jurisdiction over the merits of plaintiffs voting rights act claim.we believe,however,that hagans is not apposite to the precise situation before us.
in,congress amended the three judge court act in response to complaints that the system was cumbersome,labyrinthine,and unnecessary.the new statute,as described at the outset of this section,only requires a district court for certain apportionment challenges,and when another act of congress specifically requires one.see a.thus,the amendments limited the scope of the three judge court act considerably,making it questionable whether the policy considerations that drove the original,narrow construction are still applicable today.these revisions militate in favor of our broader reading of a scope.
one could respond to this analysis by arguing that congress deliberately intended to exclude apportionment challenges brought under of the voting rights act from the court requirement imposed by a.in support of this argument,one could point to,which necessitates the convening of a court to hear claims brought under the preclearance requirements of of the voting rights act.this might suggest that congress made a deliberate choice to require a court for only particular types of voting rights act cases,exempting claims brought under.if such were the case,then there would be no reason not simply to follow hagans and allow a single judge to resolve the statutory questions first.
however,although this argument is plausible,we believe it must ultimately fail.we do not believe that congress made a deliberate choice to distinguish between constitutional apportionment challenges and apportionment challenges brought under of the voting rights act.this is because,when the court statutes were revised in to require that this specialized tribunal hear challenges to the constitutionality of the apportionment of any statewide legislative body,of the voting rights act was not available to litigants seeking to challenge apportionment.at that time,apportionment challenges were generally constitutional in nature.see holder hall,d thomas,concurring in the judgment explaining the history of apportionment and vote dilution claims.section of the voting rights act did not become widely used for apportionment challenges until the amendments to that provision,and the supreme court subsequent decision in thornburg gingles,d.in fact,as late as,the supreme court had not even definitively determined whether of the voting rights act created a private right of action for voters.see city of mobile bolden,d.when congress,in,revised to limit the court requirement to those actions in which the constitutionality of the apportionment of any statewide legislative body was challenged,the established statutory basis for such apportionment challenges was of the voting rights act,see allen state bd.of elections,d,whose own statutory provisions required the convening of a court,see.
further,the legislative history of the revisions to clearly demonstrates that congress was concerned less with the source of the law on which an apportionment challenge was based than on the unique importance of apportionment cases generally.the senate report,for example,consistently states that courts would be retained in any case involving congressional reapportionment or the reapportionment of any statewide legislative body,reprinted in,and goes on to explain that t he bill preserves courts for cases involving the reapportionment of a statewide legislative body because it is the judgment of the committee that these issues are of such importance that they ought to be heard by a court,id.at see also allen,at.harlan,concurring in part and dissenting in part concluding that,unlike in other cases involving the court requirement,the requirement of of the voting rights act should not be interpreted narrowly,because generally a plaintiff attacking a state statute under could also make at least a substantial constitutional claim.
based upon this history,we conclude that because statutory voting rights act challenges to statewide legislative apportionment are generally inextricably intertwined with constitutional challenges to such apportionment,those claims should be considered a single action within the meaning of a.thus,when a single district judge is presented with both types of claims,he or she may not resolve the voting rights act issues in isolation while reserving the constitutional claims to a district court rather,the single district judge should adhere to the limitations on his or her authority imposed by b.
finally,we note that practical and policy considerations support our construction of.questions regarding the legitimacy of the state legislative apportionment and particularly its review by the federal courts are highly sensitive matters,and are regularly recognized as appropriate for resolution by a district court.see,chapman meier,d referring to apportionment challenges as regular grist for the court.as the supreme court has explained,in such redistricting challenges,the potential for federal disruption of a state internal political structure is great,counseling in favor of the establishment of a specialized adjudicatory machinery congress has determined that courts are desirable in a number of circumstances involving confrontations between state and federal power or in circumstances involving a potential for substantial interference with government administration.allen,at.thus,challenges to apportionment are the kinds of claims requiring what has been described as the special and extraordinary procedure represented by the convening of a district court.kennedy,d.
more significantly,it is clear that questions regarding the legitimacy of an apportionment scheme,whether under the constitution or under the voting rights act of,are intimately related,armour ohio,cir en banc,and are intensely,depending entirely on the facts and circumstances of each case.voinovich quilter,d.these observations inveigh against permitting a single district judge to reach the merits only as to statutory voting rights act claims.under a scheme in which a single district judge can legitimately adjudicate the merits of a voting rights act challenge while leaving resolution of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendment claims to a court,two tribunals would be considering closely similar,albeit not perfectly identical,challenges to the same state government action.not only does this cleavage seem unnecessarily redundant,but it creates the danger that the single district judge conclusions with regard to the statutory his or her factual well have the effect of dictating the outcome of the constitutional claims,thereby thwarting the expressed congressional policy of requiring a specialized court for the disposition of such singularly important matters 
for these reasons,we conclude that when plaintiffs mount challenges to statewide legislative apportionment schemes on both voting rights act and constitutional grounds,both sets of claims must be hear d by a district court.a single district judge may act on these claims only to the extent permitted by the procedure set forth in b.
our analysis can not end here,however,as we still must consider the argument that the district court effectively complied with the procedure set forth in b in its april,disposition of plaintiffs preliminary injunction request.more specifically,our holding leaves open the possibility that a single district judge before whom both voting rights act and constitutional challenges to a statewide apportionment scheme are raised could decline to convene a court and could reach the merits of the statutory claims if he or she were to conclude that the plaintiffs constitutional challenge was legally frivolous and insubstantial.the authority for this proposition comes from the supreme court decision in goosby osser,d,in which the court stated that the convening of a district court is not required when the plaintiffs constitutional attack on state government action is insubstantial.id.at.see also bailey patterson,d per curiam concluding,under the older version of the three judge court act,that a district court is required only when an injunction is sought upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of a state government act,and that t here is no such ground when the constitutional issue presented is essentially fictitious.thus,deeming the district court decision on april,to be in compliance with the procedure set forth in b would require us to characterize the district court decision in the following terms we would have to conclude that,in its april,order and bench opinion,the district court found plaintiffs constitutional claims to be frivolous,and then proceeded to consider the merits of only their voting rights act claim.we can not reach such a conclusion,for two reasons.
first,having read the transcript of the district court proceedings on april,we believe that the court never reached the requisite conclusion as to plaintiffs fourteenth and fifteenth amendment claims.quite clearly,the court never explicitly held that the claims were frivolous or insubstantial.moreover,to the extent that a single district judge can reach an implicit conclusion that a claim is frivolous,we do not believe that the district court reached such a conclusion in this case.even were we to interpret the court statement in its bench opinion that there is no likelihood that plaintiffs will ultimately prevail on the merits as a comment on the constitutional,as well as the statutory,claims,it can not properly be characterized as a ruling that plaintiffs constitutional claims are insubstantial,as it is that a district court conclusion that a party will lose or is likely to lose on the merits of a claim is not equivalent to a conclusion of frivolousness for the purposes of establishing jurisdiction.see bell hood.
second,we believe that plaintiffs fourteenth and fifteenth amendment challenges are not constitutionally frivolous or insubstantial,as assessed under the standard announced in such supreme court cases as goosby and bailey.goosby and bailey set an extremely high bar for frivolousness to be deemed frivolous,a constitutional claim must be essentially fictitious,wholly insubstantial,and legally speaking,bailey,at.the goosby decision elaborated on this rigorous standard 
in the context of the effect of prior decisions upon the substantiality of constitutional claims,claims are constitutionally insubstantial only if the prior decisions inescapably render the claims frivolous previous decisions that merely render claims of doubtful or questionable merit do not render them insubstantial a claim is insubstantial only if its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of this court,the supreme court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the questions sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.
at.internal citations and quotations omitted.plaintiffs constitutional claims,on their face,can not be deemed constitutionally frivolous or insubstantial indeed,defendants did not press this point at oral argument.
an apportionment scheme will be subject to strict scrutiny under the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause if race is the predominant factor in the drawing of district lines.bush vera,d plurality opinion see also shaw reno,d explaining that legislative districting schemes can violate the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause if they can not be understood as anything other than an effort to separate voters on the basis of race.such a redistricting scheme may also violate the fifteenth amendment,at least if done with the purpose of depriving a racial minority group of the right to vote.see,city of mobile bolden,d plurality opinion gomillion lightfoot,d holding that when a legislature singles out a readily isolated segment of a racial minority for special discriminatory treatment,such as by reconfiguring city boundaries so as to deprive residents of the right to vote in municipal elections,such action violates the fifteenth amendment.
plaintiffs have alleged both fourteenth and fifteenth amendment violations in counts three and four of the verified complaint they filed before the district court.the legal theories and factual support underlying these constitutional claims are not yet fully developed,but this is understandable given the fact that plaintiffs brought their complaint only one day after the apportionment commission adopted and certified the latest districting plan for the state of new jersey.as goosby and bailey teach,our inquiry here is not whether plaintiffs have a probability or even a possibility of prevailing on their constitutional arguments,but whether such claims are inherently implausible on their face,because they are clearly foreclosed by existing precedent.examining plaintiffs constitutional claims,underdeveloped as they may be,we can not say that they are legally implausible.
throughout the admittedly brief period of this litigation,plaintiffs have pleaded in their papers and continue to contend that defendants acted with a discriminatory a discriminatory purpose targeted at voters in essex that defendants sought to dilute the effective strength of the vote in that region.plaintiffs principally allege that this discriminatory and dilutive intent is obvious from the fact that,under the plan supported by defendants,the percentage of the population in two of the three existing legislative districts in essex county districts and would be reduced to below fifty per cent,while in the third district,the majority would be preserved by a mere.
plaintiffs amplify their argument by contending that these three districts were created as part of the reapportionment with the goal of safeguarding the strength of the vote in essex county,and that,in the intervening decade,no changes in conditions or circumstances occurred that justify the elimination of such districts.according to plaintiffs,the inference that must therefore be drawn is that defendants purposefully sought to reduce and dilute the strength of the vote in the essex county region.further,plaintiffs assert that,in at least one of these three districts district,the reduction in population was done with the deliberate intent of safeguarding the incumbent senator seat by transforming his constituency from a to a one.
if plaintiffs claims are factually correct,then such purposeful action on the part of defendants may arguably amount to a violation of either the fourteenth or fifteenth amendments.as noted above,at this nascent stage of the litigation,the evidence supporting plaintiffs contentions as to the defendants motivation in favoring the apportionment plan is scant at best.but goosby frivolousness standard is not a test of the sufficiency of plaintiffs evidence rather,it is an inquiry into whether,on their face,plaintiffs constitutional claims are essentially fictitious,wholly insubstantial,and legally speaking.we can not say that they are 
thus,we conclude that the district court committed error by failing to follow the procedure specified in b.when presented with an action involving both statutory voting rights act and constitutional challenges to the apportionment of a statewide legislative body,a single district judge can not reach the merits of the statutory claims unless he or she concludes that the constitutional claims are legally frivolous and insubstantial.the district court made no such ruling in this case,and our own review leads us to conclude that plaintiffs fourteenth and fifteenth amendment claims are not legally frivolous.accordingly,we will vacate the district court april,order,with instructions to the district court to initiate the procedure for convening a court to hear both the voting rights act and the constitutional challenges brought by the plaintiffs.
having reached and explained our conclusion as to the district court error,we are obliged to address one additional matter,the issue of further interim relief.on april,plaintiffs requested and received orally from the district court a temporary stay enjoining defendants from printing ballots for the upcoming legislative elections.this stay was set to expire at noon on the following day,april.on april,plaintiff requested and received from our court acting through judge garth,sitting as a single judge an extension of the district court stay this extended stay is scheduled to expire at noon on april.judge garth declined plaintiffs request for an expansion of the stay that would generally enjoin defendants from implementing the apportionment commission redistricting plan.on this appeal,plaintiffs ask that we grant them further and broader interim relief,in order to prevent in some fashion the implementation of the redistricting plan.we decline to do so.
first,we are unsure as to the exact nature and scope of the relief that plaintiffs request.in the conclusion of their brief to this court,plaintiffs ask us to impose interim injunctive relief against defendants to enjoin and restrain implementation or reliance on the legislative redistricting plan.to the extent that plaintiffs are asking us to grant preliminary injunctive relief,we are powerless to oblige.it is beyond cavil that the district court,and not this court,is the proper forum for seeking such an interim injunction.neither are we faced with a request for an injunction pending appeal.with this opinion and the accompanying judgment,the present appeal is over moreover,given the nascent stage of these proceedings,and the heavy factual development that will likely need to occur prior to a final disposition of this matter,it would not,at all events,seem appropriate either to extend or expand the current stay,which judge garth had entered with the understanding that it would be temporary in nature.for all these reasons,we will simply allow that stay to expire at its scheduled time,at noon on april.
in reaching these conclusions,we also note our own keen awareness of the significant disruption that action on our part or on the part of any federal court issuing interim relief will have on the upcoming new jersey legislative elections.the original deadline for filing a state senate or general assembly candidacy,april,has already passed.we are also fast approaching the date of this summer upcoming legislative primary,scheduled as of the time of this opinion to occur on june,in conjunction with the gubernatorial primary and the primaries for certain local races any interim injunctive or restraining action on our part,particularly action that broadly proscribes the implementation of the redistricting plan adopted by the apportionment commission,would likely delay or suspend the legislative elections.further,if the legislative elections were delayed in this fashion,the state of new jersey,if it desired to avoid also postponing the concurrent gubernatorial and local elections,would be required to hold two separate primaries and general elections for its state offices,at great expense to the taxpayers.defendants have forcefully spun out the implications of such disruption in their briefs federal court intervention that would create such a disruption in the state electoral process is not to be taken lightly.this important equitable consideration,going to the heart of our notions of federalism,was expressed quite cogently by the supreme court in reynolds sims,d 
u nder certain circumstances,such as where an impending election is imminent and a state election machinery is already in progress,equitable considerations might justify a court in withholding the granting of immediately effective relief in a legislative apportionment case,even though the existing apportionment scheme was found invalid.in awarding or withholding immediate relief,a court is entitled to and should consider the proximity of a forthcoming election and the mechanics and complexities of state election laws,and should act and rely upon general equitable principles.
id.at.emphasis added.this warning in sims on the issue of relief was delivered after the supreme court found,on the merits,that a state legislative apportionment plan violated the constitution.if aggressive federal court intervention is not necessarily appropriate following an adjudication of unconstitutionality,then surely it can not be any more appropriate at this early stage of the proceedings.see chisom roemer,cir vacating a district court preliminary injunction of a state election,on the rationale that intervention by the federal courts in state elections has always been a serious business,not to be lightly engaged in internal quotations and citations omitted.
moreover,in undertaking the equitable calculus suggested by sims,we certainly must account for the scant factual record brought before the district court and before us.for instance,plaintiffs principal legal challenge to new jersey apportionment plan thus far has been a vote dilution claim brought under of the voting rights act.it is that,to make out a claim that a legislative districting scheme has diluted a minority group vote in contravention of,a plaintiff must demonstrate,as a threshold matter,the existence of three factors first articulated in thornburg gingles,d that the minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single member district that the minority group is politically cohesive,that it votes as a racial bloc and that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it to defeat the minority preferred candidate.id.at.see also jenkins red clay consol.sch,cir.it is also clear that a plaintiff showing of these three factors is necessarily,requiring a careful and searching examination of the specific circumstances of each case.see,voinovich quilter,d growe emison,d gingles,at.t he results test does not assume the existence of racial bloc voting plaintiffs must prove it.
but it is not just plaintiffs whose claims require factual development.thus far,defendants have principally argued that,although the apportionment scheme may reduce the percentage in previously districts to below fifty percent,that reduction does not dilute the group voting power in violation of of the voting rights act because,at least in essex county,there is significant voting between white,and hispanic groups.we note here that the supreme court has expressly reserved a final decision as to several of the issues raised by defendants argument,whether an influence district in which a minority group comprises less than half the population can nonetheless comport with requirements,given the existence of voting by the majority group,see,voinovich,at.recognizing the possibility of influence districts in which minority group members could elect their candidate of choice if they are numerous enough and their candidate attracts sufficient votes from white voters but noting that w e have not yet decided whether claims such as appellees are viable under and resolving not to decide that question today and whether the presence of two minority groups,and hispanics,can be aggregated for purposes of determining voting strength and effectivenes
