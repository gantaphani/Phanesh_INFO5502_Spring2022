kenneth blackwell,in his official capacity as the secretary of state of the state of ohio the secretary,moves this court to stay or vacate a temporary restraining order tro and associated orders to the secretary and county boards of elections that restrain enforcement of certain absentee voter identification provisions under ohio ann.e,a.the orders were entered by the district court on october.northeast ohio coalition for the homeless and service employees international union,local the organizations move to dismiss this appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the state of ohio moves to intervene to represent the interests of the people of ohio and the general assembly in defending the constitutionality of the statute.for the following reasons,we deny the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,grant the motion to intervene,and grant in part the motion to stay or vacate the district court orders.
on january,the ohio general assembly passed house bill,ohio comprehensive election reform bill voter id law,and the governor signed the bill the same day.the bill amended the ohio election code to require that voters provide any of several specific types of identification in order to cast a regular ballot in state and federal elections held in ohio.some voter id law provisions went into effect on may,and the remaining provisions went into effect on june.portions of the challenged statutes relating to applications for absentee ballots were enacted as part of hb,which was effective on january.
the provisions of the voter id law that require voters to provide any of several specific types of identification when casting their ballots are mandatory for all persons who cast their votes by regular ballot on election day.ohio ann.a.these new laws are not mandatory for voters who cast their votes by absentee ballot,whether by mail or at their boards of elections,before or on election day.ohio ann.however,like the sections governing voting,the voter id law also includes other provisions relating to absentee voter identification requirements,and it is these provisions to which the tro relates.
three sections of the voter id law relate to absentee ballots.section e requires that an application for an absentee ballot contain 
e one of the following 
the elector driver license number 
the last four digits of the elector social security number 
a copy of the elector current and valid photo identification,a copy of a military identification that shows the elector name and current address,or a copy of a current utility bill,bank statement,government check,paycheck,or other government document,other than a notice of an election mailed by a board of elections under section of the revised code or a notice of voter registration mailed by a board of elections under section of the revised code,that shows the name and address of the elector.
ohio ann.e.section b requires that with each absentee ballot the board of elections include an identification envelope requiring a voter to provide one of the following 
my driver license number is driver license number 
the last four digits of my social security number are last four digits of social security number 
in lieu of providing a driver license number or the last four digits of my social security number,i am enclosing a copy of one of the following in the return envelope in which this identification envelope will be mailed a current and valid photo identification,a military identification that shows my name and current address,or a current utility bill,bank statement,government check,paycheck,or other government document,other than a notice of an election mailed by a board of elections under section of the revised code or a notice of voter registration mailed by a board of elections,that shows my name and address.
ohio ann.b.section a provides that when returning the absentee ballot 
if the elector does not provide the elector driver license number or the last four digits of the elector social security number on the statement of voter on the identification envelope,the elector also shall include in the return envelope with the identification envelope a copy of the elector current valid photo identification,a copy of a military identification that shows the elector name and current address,or a copy of a current utility bill,bank statement,government check,paycheck,or other government documents,other than a notice of an election mailed by a board of elections under section of the revised code or a notice of voter registration mailed by board of elections under section of the revised code,that shows the name and address of the elector.
ohio ann.a.absentee voting pursuant to these laws for the november election began in early october.
on october,the secretary issued directive in an effort to ensure that the november elections are conducted uniformly throughout the state.in the directive the secretary defines the term current as used in the voter id law as dated not more than six months from the date that it is presented to the election official.the directive defines government document to include any local,state or federal government document that shows the voter name and current address.finally,the directive includes a section intended to clarify what was meant by driver license number.this section acknowledges that a driver license has two numbers in close proximity to one another,but noted that u pon receipt of an absentee ballot,which purports to contain the driver license number but contains the number above the photograph or some other number which is not the driver license sic number,acceptable proof of identity has not been provided.
on october,the organizations filed suit in the district court claiming in relevant part that the voter identification laws for absentee ballots are confusing,vague,impossible to apply,and in fact are being applied differently by ohio boards of elections,causing the november election to be conducted in a manner that is fundamentally unfair in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment count one the voter identification laws for absentee ballots can not and will not be applied uniformly by boards of elections,violating the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment count two and the requirement of proof of current address for submission of absentee ballots,when other voters are not required to provide a current address,violates the fourteenth amendment and a a b counts eight,nine,and ten counts three through seven and eleven through thirteen assert claims not relevant to the tro request.
after a hearing on october,the district court issued a tro restraining the enforcement of the absentee voting identification requirements in ohio ann.e,a quoted above.specifically,the district court concluded the phrases current,other government document,military identification,and driver license number were unconstitutionally vague and were being unequally applied by the boards of elections.although the effect of the clarifying directive issued by the secretary was discussed at the hearing,it is not addressed in the tro.in addition to enjoining enforcement of these provisions,the district court ordered the secretary to issue a directive to the boards of elections requiring that they not enforce the enjoined provisions,preserve all absentee ballots in their present form,and inform absentee voters that compliance with the enjoined provisions was not required.by its terms,the tro remains in effect until the district court disposes of the organizations motion for a preliminary injunction,for which an evidentiary hearing is scheduled on november.
as the secretary did not wish to file an appeal of the tro,the attorney general of ohio on behalf of the state of ohio the state filed a motion to intervene in the case.the district court held a hearing on october,and denied the motion to intervene as of right,concluding that although the state had the requisite interest in the outcome of the case,that interest was adequately represented by the secretary,who was also represented in the case by the attorney general office.the district court also denied permissive intervention,concluding that because the state interests were adequately represented by the secretary,intervention would present redundant arguments and waste the time of the district court and the attorney general office.
the attorney general office,on behalf of the secretary,filed a timely appeal of the tro,which was docketed as,moving to stay or vacate the district court orders.the organizations filed a motion to dismiss that appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the state moved to intervene in the appeal of the tro.the state filed a separate appeal of the denial of its motion to intervene as of right in the district court case,which was docketed as.when parties have filed separate timely notices of appeal,the appeals may be joined or consolidated by this court.fed.of app.b providing that the court may consolidate appeals on its own motion see also in re cannonsburg envtl.associates,cir.because both cases present common questions of law and fact,we consolidate the two cases.the analysis that follows in part iv,pertaining to the matter of the state intervention,thus applies to both cases.
the organizations move to dismiss appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that a does not allow for an interlocutory appeal of the district court tro.this court has jurisdiction of appeals from i nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the united states granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions.a.in contrast,this court generally lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal of the district court decision to grant or deny a tro.see office of pers.mgmt.am.fed of gov t employees,d leslie penn cent,cir.the rationale for this rule is that tros are of short duration and usually terminate with a prompt ruling on a preliminary injunction,from which the losing party has an immediate right of appeal.see vuitton white,cir.therefore,an appeal of the tro is not necessary to protect the rights of the parties,see,and practical reasons favor waiting for an appeal of the preliminary injunction,see dilworth riner,cir noting that an appeal is normally not feasible within the short time available and that orderly procedure requires the trial judge pass on the question presented with full development of the facts and the law connell dulien steel,cir.
however,the label attached to an order by the trial court is not decisive,and the court looks to the nature of the order and the substance of the proceeding below to determine whether the rationale for denying appeal applies.see in re carroll,cir adams vance,morning powers,cir dilworth,at connell,at.an order may be appealed under section a if it has the practical effect of an injunction and further s the statutory purpose of permit ting litigants to effectually challenge interlocutory orders of serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence.carson am.brands,d quoting baltimore contractors,bodinger.see sims varner assocs.blanchard,cir.accordingly,courts have allowed interlocutory appeal of tros which threatened to inflict irretrievable harms before the tro expired.see ross rell,cir berrigan sigler,united states wood,cir.furthermore,courts have allowed interlocutory appeal of tros that do not preserve the status quo but rather act as a mandatory injunction requiring affirmative action.see adams,at belknap leary,cir.when a tro does not merely preserve the status quo pending further proceedings,but rather directs action so potent with consequences so irretrievable,we provide an immediate appeal to protect the rights of the parties.adams,at see am.fed of gov t employees,at.citing adams with approval,noting that o nly if the district court granted the temporary restraining order would it have disturbed the status quo by preventing the implementation of new regulations,and implying that appellate jurisdiction would be available summit county democratic cent.and executive comm.blackwell,cir issuing a stay of a tro affecting election day requirements without analysis of jurisdiction.
the tro at issue in this case both threatens to inflict irretrievable harm before it expires and acts as a mandatory injunction that does not preserve the status quo.the tro requires the secretary to direct county boards of elections not to enforce the disputed voter identification requirements and,in fact,to instruct voters affirmatively that they need not comply with the identification requirements.any absentee ballot cast during the operation of the tro must necessarily be considered valid,regardless of whether the voter has complied with the identification requirements.as it will be difficult,if not impossible,to equitably enforce the voter identification requirements retroactively for these ballots,the tro permanently exempts these ballots from the disputed law,regardless of the ultimate resolution of this case,inflicting an irretrievable harm on the state of ohio.thus the tro goes far beyond preserving the status quo,which could be achieved by restraining the state from discarding any ballots that it found to be in violation of the identification requirements.the nature and effect of this tro necessitate an immediate interlocutory appeal,and the court has subject matter jurisdiction over it.the motion to dismiss is denied.
the attorney general of ohio seeks to intervene on behalf of the state pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a and b in order to defend the constitutionality of ohio,et,ohio voter identification statutes voter id law.state of ohio mot.to intervene at.the state both moves to intervene in the appeal of the tro before this court and appeals the district court denial of its motion to intervene as of right in the district court case.according to the state,the secretary stated desire not to appeal has led to this motion to intervene on behalf of the state of ohio and the general assembly,who wish to participate in arguing the constitutionality of the statutes at issue.id.this court may grant the motion to intervene pursuant to either as a matter of right under a or,alternatively,permit the absentee state to intervene under b.these same provisions govern the state intervention in the district court as well.
upon timely application,a permits anyone to intervene in an action when a statute of the united states confers an unconditional right to intervene or when the applicant claims an interest relating the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.a.
the state first argues that it has a statutory right to intervene pursuant to b,which provides i n any action,suit,or proceeding in a court of the united states to which a state or any agency,officer,or employee thereof is not a party,wherein the constitutionality of any statute of that state affecting the public interest is drawn in question,the court shall certify such fact to the attorney general of the state,and shall permit the state to intervene for presentation of evidence,if evidence is otherwise admissible in the case,and for argument on the question of constitutionality.b emphasis added.however,as noted by the state itself,this is not a case in which the duty to certify arises or b strictly applies.state of ohio mot.to intervene at.the secretary,an officer of the state,is already a party in this case and thus the provision is inapposite.any argument that the secretary intention not to appeal the matter results in the secretary not being a party to the matter for purposes of section b is contrary to the plain language of the statute.
the state does,however,satisfy the requirements of a,and thus has a right to intervene.under this court interpretation of rule a,a third party may qualify for intervention of right in the absence of a statute if the third party can satisfy four elements timeliness of application a substantial legal interest in the case impairment of the applicant ability to protect that interest in the absence of intervention and inadequate representation of that interest by parties already before the court.state miller,cir 
the first two factors are easily met.the state of ohio filed this motion within hours of the appeal by the defendant,and the application is therefore timely.under this circuit rather expansive notion of interest,the state also has a manifest legal interest in defending the constitutionality of ohio laws.bradley milliken,cir t his court has acknowledged that interest is to be construed liberally.
the state right to intervene then turns on the final two factors.the supreme court has emphasized that the requirement of impairment of a legally protected interest is a minimal one the requirement is met if the applicant shows that representation of his interest may be inadequate.trbovich united mine workers of,d citation omitted see also.state,at a intervenor must show only that impairment of its substantial legal interest is possible if intervention is denied.this burden is minimal.citation omitted.here,an adverse ruling could hinder the state ability to litigate the validity of the ohio law.see linton comm r of health env t,cir acknowledging that potential stare decisis effects can be a sufficient basis for finding an impairment of interest.further,this court has recognized that the nature of a case may be a factor in our intervention analysis.see ams.united for separation of church and state city of grand rapids,cir finding that the extra time involved in initiating a separate lawsuit to allow a intervenor to display a menorah on public property likely would have pushed the resolution beyond the coming chanukah season.the same timeliness concern exists here,as absentee voting is ongoing and the election is imminent.accordingly,the state of ohio has demonstrated impairment of its interest.
the state burden with respect to establishing that its interest is not adequately protected by the existing party to the action is a minimal one it is sufficient to prove that representation may be inadequate.linton,at.a intervenor is not required to show that the current representation will in fact be inadequate.state,at finding that it may be enough to show that the existing party who purports to seek the same outcome will not make all of the prospective intervenor arguments.in this case,the secretary primary interest is in ensuring the smooth administration of the election,while the state and general assembly have an independent interest in defending the validity of ohio laws and ensuring that those laws are enforced.further,the secretary stated desire not to appeal the district court grant of a tro illustrates how the interests of the secretary and the state of ohio potentially diverge.see.state,at.
accordingly,the organizations insistence that a intervenor must overcome the presumption of adequate representation that arises when they share the same ultimate objective as a party to the suit is misplaced.opp of to emergency mots.for reversal of denial of mot.to intervene at citation omitted.as discussed above,the state and the secretary do not have the same ultimate objective.the organizations emphasis on which lawyers from the attorney general office attended the tro hearing and the secretary intention to litigate the preliminary injunction is irrelevant.the difference of opinion regarding whether to appeal the tro is merely illustrative of the underlying divergent interests of the secretary and the state.
under the circumstances of this case,then,we conclude that the state of ohio has satisfied the four elements found in federal rule of civil procedure a and is entitled to intervention as of right,both in appeal and in the ongoing district court proceedings.accordingly,we need not address the state alternative argument for permissive intervention under rule b.
the organizations also argue that the attorney general has no authority to appeal the tro in the secretary of state name.opp of to emergency mot.to stay or vacate district order at citing insufficient time or space to brief this question.the state of ohio responded by noting that ohio constitution does vest the attorney general with independent authority to determine litigation,as that result inheres in the very structural decision to have an attorney general.state resp.to pls.mot.to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction at.
under ohio ann,the attorney general is the chief law officer for the state and all its departments and shall appear for the state in any tribunal in a case in which the state is a party when required by the governor or the general assembly.the attorney general,then,is both the state chief legal officer and a representative of the people and the public interest,but also a representative of an individual.see justin davids,state attorneys general and the relationship establishing the power to sue state officers,colum.soc.probs.
the exact extent of the attorney general litigation authority,however,is not clearly defined under ohio law.the ohio supreme court has not directly addressed the attorney general authority to litigate on behalf of a state officer when that officer no longer wishes to pursue the appeal.other states conclusions regarding the extent of the attorney general litigation authority vary widely,and there is no clear consensus.compare commonwealth ex rel.hancock paxton,concluding that in case of a conflict of duties the attorney general primary obligation is to the commonwealth,the body politic,rather than to its officers,departments,commissions,or agencies.and sanderson blue cross blue shield of,so d,holding that the attorney general had the authority to dismiss legal proceedings over the objection of an executive agency as the state chief legal officer,the has power,both under common law and by statute,to make any disposition of the state litigation that he deems for its best interest.with santa rita mining dep t of prop.valuation,holding that the attorney general lacked the authority to maintain an appeal without the approval of his agency client.
accordingly,the state motion to intervene in appeal is granted,and the state appeal of the district court denial of intervention in case is granted.in light of our holding that the state of ohio is entitled to intervention of right under a,and wary of determining an issue of ohio constitutional and common law where unnecessary,we decline to wade into the debate regarding the parameters of the attorney general litigation authority.
the district court decision to grant a temporary restraining order,when appealable,is reviewed by this court for abuse of discretion.beacon publ g,blackwell,cir.to determine whether a tro should be stayed,the court considers the same factors considered in determining whether to issue a tro or preliminary injunction.see summit county,at.those factors are whether the movant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits,whether the movant would suffer irreparable injury absent a stay,whether granting the stay would cause substantial harm to others,and whether the public interest would be served by granting the stay.nader blackwell,cir.these factors are not prerequisites that must be met,but are interrelated considerations that must be balanced together.coal.of radioactive material users,griepentrog,cir.for example,the probability of success that must be demonstrated is inversely proportional to the amount of irreparable injury the movants will suffer absent the stay.see id.
in evaluating plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits,we examine first the issue of standing.the district court correctly noted that an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.sevs.toc,d.in analyzing standing,the district court focused primarily on the concept that an association may have standing to sue on behalf of its members.we see the more pertinent inquiry here as whether the underlying requirements for associational standing have been met,that is,whether plaintiffs members would have standing to sue in their own right and whether the interests at s
