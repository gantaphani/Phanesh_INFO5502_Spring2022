eugene platt and the south carolina green party challenge the constitutionality of south carolina statute,as applied to platt green party candidacy for south carolina house seat the district court upheld the constitutionality of the statute as applied to platt candidacy and,for the following reasons,we affirm.
in,platt sought to become a fusion in the election for south carolina house seat,seeking the nomination of three political parties,the south carolina democratic party democratic party,the south carolina green party green party,and the south carolina working families party working families party.on march,platt filed a statement of intention of candidacy with the democratic party.ten days later,he filed a similar statement with the working families party.
on may,platt filed an additional statement of candidacy with the green party.that same day,the green party chose platt as its nominee during a state convention.on may,the working families party chose platt as its nominee.
on june,platt lost the democratic party primary election.after platt loss in the primary,the south carolina state election commission the election commission notified platt that based on south carolina statute,his name could not appear on the ballot for the general election as the nominee for the green party or for the working families party.the statute provides,in relevant part 
n o person who was defeated as a candidate for nomination to an office in a party primary or party convention shall have his name placed on the ballot for the ensuing general or special election 
platt,along with the green party and robert dunham,a registered south carolina voter who supported platt,collectively,the plaintiffs filed an action against the election commission and various other defendants collectively,the election commission,asserting that application of the statute violated the green party rights of association protected by the first and fourteenth amendments.after the parties filed for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the election commission and denied the plaintiffs motion,holding that the statute is constitutional as applied to platt green party candidacy.
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that the statute is unconstitutional when applied to the green party nominee,platt,because he successfully secured the nomination of the green party before losing his attempt to become the democratic party nominee.according to the plaintiffs,application of the statute to bar platt name from the general election ballot as the green party candidate imposed a severe burden on the green party association rights.the plaintiffs contend that application of the statute effectively permitted the democratic party primary voters to veto the green party preferred candidate and prevented the green party from nominating a substitute candidate.notably,the plaintiffs do not argue that platt individual rights of association have been affected by the election commission application of the statute.
the plaintiffs ask that we apply a strict scrutiny review to their claim in light of the allegedly severe burden imposed on the green party association rights.the plaintiffs contend that when a strict scrutiny standard is used,the statute is unconstitutional as applied because the statute is not narrowly tailored to advance south carolina interest in minimizing excessive factionalism.as a result,the plaintiffs maintain,this court should hold that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to platt candidacy with the green party.
in response,the election commission argues that the green party association rights were not severely burdened and,therefore,strict scrutiny should not apply to our review of the statute.the election commission contends that democratic primary voters did not effectively veto the green party selection of platt as its nominee because platt decision to run in the democratic primary,rather than any interference by democratic voters,placed him at risk of disqualification as the green party nominee.according to the election commission,south carolina statute serves to promote several important state regulatory interests.thus,the election commission asks that we hold that the statute is constitutional as applied to platt green party candidacy.

when analyzing whether a state election law impermissibly infringes on association rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments,courts must weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the state rule imposes on those rights against the interests the state contends justify that burden,and consider the extent to which the state concerns make the burden necessary.timmons twin cities area new party,quoting anderson celebrezze.regulations that impose a severe burden on association rights are subject to strict scrutiny,and a court applying this level of review may uphold the regulation only if it is narrowly tailored and advance s a compelling state interest.id.however,if a statute imposes only modest burdens,then a state important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions.id.quoting burdick takushi.
decisions in previous cases have recognized the various state interests furthered by statutes.in storer brown,the supreme court addressed a california provision,and emphasized the importance of statutes in discouraging feuding and in reserving major struggles for general election ballots.see also backus spears,cir.the supreme court later explained,in clingman beaver,that statutes prevent a candidate who has lost a party primary or nomination from effecting a splinter of a major political party,by joining a minor party while retaining the support of the major party voters,thereby undermining the major party in the general election.
we have recognized that south carolina statute is substantially identical to california provision discussed in storer.backus,at.we further have stated that south carolina statute is a justifiable measure for preventing splintering and factionalism within the major parties.cromer south carolina,cir.in the context of these statements,we consider the constitutionality of south carolina statute as applied to the green party association rights.
we first address whether the south carolina statute placed a severe burden on the green party right to choose its own candidate.the plaintiffs argue that the burden imposed by the statute is severe,because platt loss in the democratic primary occurred after the green party nominated platt and was unable to select a replacement candidate.the plaintiffs contend that the burden imposed on its association rights to choose a standard bearer is no less severe than the burden imposed by the california law at issue in jones.we disagree with the plaintiffs arguments.
