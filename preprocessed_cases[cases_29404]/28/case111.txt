opinion of the court 
the municipality of lebanon,by ordinance,requires canvassers who plan to hand pamphlets or other written material to residents or discuss with them issues of public or religious interest to first register with the police department.we conclude that this ordinance violates the first and fourteenth amendments guarantee that no state shall abridge the freedom of speech.
the plaintiffs are a local labor organization,service employees international union,local,and two volunteers,rachel canning and velvet hazard collectively,seiu,who were involved in a campaign preceding the presidential election.seiu recruited over volunteers to go in allegheny county,pennsylvania,including in lebanon,to emphasize the importance of the election,to encourage people to vote,and to help them locate their assigned polling places.
the defendant,lebanon,is one of a number of municipalities in allegheny county that regulate canvassing and solicitation.part of lebanon municipal code regulates those who solicit and canvass in lebanon.it provides,in pertinent part 
permit required.it shall be unlawful for any person to solicit in the municipality without first obtaining a permit therefor as provided in this part.it shall be unlawful for any person to canvass in the municipality without first registering with the police department as provided in this part.

seiu filed suit against lebanon just before the presidential election,alleging that the solicitation and canvassing ordinance violated the first amendment,both facially and as applied.seiu sought declaratory relief and preliminary injunctive relief.the complaint alleged that seiu volunteers planned to go in lebanon.compl,app.at.those volunteers,it alleged,will hand out literature,emphasize the importance of this year presidential election,encourage the people to vote,and help the voters determine their proper polling location.compl.app.at.seiu further alleged that it did not have the time and resources to register each canvasser individually.compl.app.at.
seiu simultaneously filed a motion for temporary restraining order preliminary injunction.after a hearing,seiu and lebanon resolved the motion through a consent order that delineated the terms under which the canvassers could canvass in the municipality until election day.the parties subsequently filed for summary judgment on seiu remaining claims for declaratory and permanent injunctive relief.
the district court ruled that seiu does not have standing to challenge the solicitation permitting requirement because the plaintiffs are not soliciting and have no plans to do so and there is no concrete injury in fact sufficient to create a justiciable case or controversy under article iii of the constitution.app.at.it granted summary judgment in favor of lebanon,however,with respect to the canvassing segment of the ordinance.this timely appeal followed.
seiu seeks to mount facial challenges both to lebanon regulation of canvassing and to its regulation of soliciting.we agree with the district court that seiu lacks standing to mount a challenge to lebanon regulation of soliciting.
at the outset,we note that under the terms of the ordinance,canvassing and soliciting are two distinct and mutually exclusive activities.further,separate regulatory requirements attach depending on which activity an individual plans to engage in.accordingly,we separately consider seiu two challenges to the ordinance,including seiu standing to bring each challenge.see allen city of louisiana.it is an elementary principle that the same statute may be in part constitutional and in part unconstitutional,and that if the parts are wholly independent of each other,that which is constitutional may stand while that which is unconstitutional will be rejected.granite state outdoor,city of clearwater,cir separately examining plaintiff for each provision of facially challenged ordinance contractors ass of eastern pennsylvania,city of philadelphia,cir severing statutes to limit standing promotes the twin goals of avoiding unnecessary constitutional adjudication and sharpening the presentation of the issues.
article iii of the constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to resolving cases and controversies.to satisfy the case or controversy requirement of article iii,which is the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,a plaintiff must,generally speaking,demonstrate that he has suffered injury in fact,that the injury is fairly traceable to the actions of the defendant,and that the injury will likely be redressed by a favorable decision.bennett spear,d.
the supreme court has also identified a number of prudential limits on standing.see sec y of state of joseph munson,d.among these prudential limits is the requirement that a plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.id.quoting warth seldin,d.in the first amendment context,however,courts relax the prudential requirement that a litigant raise his own rights and interests.under the first amendment overbreadth doctrine,even though a party whose conduct could constitutionally be proscribed by statute may not normally be heard to complain that the statute under which he is prosecuted is so broad that it proscribes constitutionally protected conduct,courts will allow the party to raise the claims of others when protected speech is at issue.courts do so out of concern that protected speech will be chilled by the statute.id.at.litigants,therefore,are permitted to challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated,but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.broadrick oklahoma,d.but such litigants,of course,must still meet the constitutional requirement of because their own constitutionally unprotected interests will be adversely affected by application of the statute.see note,standing to assert constitutional jus tertii,harv,o verbreadth attacks involve both the application of the challenged law to the claimant and a different,hypothetical application of the law to third parties.see also richard fallon,making sense of overbreadth,yale.
the supreme court decision in munson is illustrative.in that case,the supreme court allowed a professional fundraiser,munson,to raise the first amendment rights of his clients,charitable organizations.munson challenged a statute that prohibited charitable organizations,in connection with any fundraising activity,from paying or agreeing to pay as expenses more than of the amount raised.at.munson suffered actual and threatened injury from the statute because munson contracts called for payments in excess of percent of the funds raised for a given event and one of munson charitable clients was consequently reluctant to enter into a contract with munson.id.at.the court allowed munson to invoke the first amendment rights of his clients because he met the constitutional requirements for standing 
the fact that,because munson is not a charity,there might not be a possibility that the challenged statute could restrict munson own first amendment rights does not alter the analysis.facial challenges to overly broad statutes are allowed not primarily for the benefit of the litigant,but for the benefit of prevent the statute from chilling the first amendment rights of other parties not before the court.munson ability to serve that function has nothing to do with whether or not his own first amendment rights are at stake.the crucial issues are whether munson satisfies the requirement of,and whether it can be expected satisfactorily to frame the issues in the case.

lebanon ordinance only requires solicitors to obtain permits if they intend 
to go from door to door in the municipality i soliciting contributions or pledges for contributions,or ii selling or attempting to sell subscriptions,products or services,or taking orders or attempting to take orders for subscriptions,products or services from or to an occupant of a residence.
ordinance app.at.seiu has not alleged that it desires or intends to solicit in lebanon.its complaint alleges only that its volunteers will hand out literature,emphasize the importance of this year presidential election,encourage the people to vote,and help the voters to determine their proper polling location.compl.app.at.seiu is completely unaffected by the permitting requirement applicable to solicitors.consequently,it can not establish and lacks constitutional standing to challenge the permitting requirement either under the guise of a facial or an as applied challenge.see munson,at.harp,at.
seiu argues that we should apply the relaxed standing principles used in the first amendment overbreadth context.but,as noted,those principles are only applicable to prudential standing requirements,not the constitutional requirements of article iii jurisdiction we are not free to hear a party facial challenge to a municipal regulation that is wholly inapplicable to the party.while the canvassing registration requirement and the solicitation permitting requirements are both found within the ordinance,they clearly establish distinct and independent requirements for their application.overbreadth doctrine effectively allows a party to challenge separate and hypothetical applications of a regulation only when an otherwise valid application of that same regulation causes the party.it does not allow a party to challenge a regulation that is wholly inapplicable to the party,regardless of the regulation location in the statute books.based on seiu complaint,there is no reason to believe that seiu has or will suffer injury from the solicitation permitting requirement.
having thus limited the scope of permissible review,we now turn to seiu challenge to lebanon registration requirement for those who wish to canvass.in cases raising first amendment questions,an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.bose consumers union of united states,d united states various articles of,cir.
the latest supreme court precedent governing the regulation of door to door canvassing is watchtower bible tract soc y of,vill.of stratton,d.faithfully following the teachings of that precedent leads to the conclusion that lebanon regulation of canvassing does not pass constitutional muster.
here,as in watchtower,it is unnecessary to resolve the issue of whether the ordinance at issue should be subjected to strict scrutiny.this is the case because here,as there,the breadth of the speech affected by the ordinance and the nature of the regulation make it clear that the ordinance can not be sustained.id.at.our task here,as there described by the supreme court,is to look to the amount of speech covered by the ordinance and whether there is an appropriate balance between the affected speech and the governmental interest that the ordinance purports to serve.id.at.we must be astute to examine the effect of the challenged legislation and must weigh the circumstances and appraise the substantiality of the reasons advanced in support of the regulation.id.at.quoting martin city of struthers.quoting schneider state town of irvington.we agree with lebanon that this balancing test does not require it to show that its canvassing regulation is the least restrictive or least intrusive means of serving its legitimate governmental interests.nevertheless,to the extent that the ordinance is not tailored to the municipality stated interest,there is a commensurate reduction in the municipality interest in its enforcement.id.at.
in watchtower,an ordinance of the village of stratton,ohio,prohibited door to door canvassing for the purpose of promoting any cause without first obtaining a permit.id.at.like the lebanon ordinance,it contained an unchallenged provision under which residents could prohibit even those canvassing with permits.the watchtower court began its analysis by assessing the amount and character of the speech covered and the manner in which it was burdened 
t he village ordinance prohibits canvassers from going on private property for the purpose of explaining or promoting any cause,unless they receive a permit and the residents visited have not opted for a no solicitation sign the ordinance unquestionably applies,not only to religious causes,but to political activity as well.it would seem to extend to residents casually soliciting the votes of neighbors,or ringing doorbells to enlist support for employing a more efficient garbage collector.
the mere fact that the ordinance covers so much speech raises constitutional concerns.it is only to the values protected by the first amendment,but to the very notion of a free in the context of everyday public discourse a citizen must first inform the government of her desire to speak to her neighbors and then obtain a permit to do so.even if the issuance of permits by the mayor office is a ministerial task that is performed promptly and at no cost to the applicant,a law requiring a permit to engage in such speech constitutes a dramatic departure from our national heritage and constitutional tradition.
watchtower,at.footnote omitted.
the court went on to note three obvious examples to illustrate the pernicious effect of the ordinance.first,the ordinance burdened the significant number of persons who support causes anonymously by requiring them to identify themselves in the course of the permit application process.id.at.second,the permit requirement imposed an objective burden on those whose religious scruples will prevent them from applying for such a license and on those patriotic citizens whose firm convictions about their constitutional right to engage in uninhibited debate would lead them to prefer silence to speech licensed by a petty official.id.at.and third,the ordinance effectively banned a significant amount of spontaneous speech.id.the court reasoned that
