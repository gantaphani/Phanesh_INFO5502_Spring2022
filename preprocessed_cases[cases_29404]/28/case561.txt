proposition,an initiative passed by california voters in,allows the state to use private contractors to perform architectural and engineering services on public works.this case requires us to construe proposition and determine its effect on statutes.
in the published part of the decision,we affirm the judgment of the trial court in part.we hold that proposition impliedly repealed or amended government code sections,and to the extent that those statutes restrict caltrans authority to contract with private architects and engineers beyond the constraints of the initiative itself.further,we hold that there is no conflict between the initiative and caltrans use of a qualifications based selection procedure.
in the unpublished part of the opinion we reverse in part and remand with instructions to issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering caltrans to refrain from applying the regulations contained in its manuals until it fully complies with the administrative procedure act.
background 
proposition was the culmination of a legal struggle over when and how the department of transportation caltrans could contract with private architects and engineers on transportation projects.the struggle began in with a lawsuit between the main parties to the present case and played out through legislative action,trial court injunctions,court appeals and ultimately a constitutional ruling of the california supreme court,which struck down statutes expanding caltrans ability to use private contractors.see professional engineers department of transportation cal th,d,professional engineers.proponents of proposition wrote in the ballot materials that one purpose of the initiative was to reverse the effect of lawsuits that impeded caltrans use of private contractors.
in,the voters approved proposition,the fair competition and taxpayer savings initiative proposition the express intent of the initiative was to remove existing restrictions on contracting for architectural and engineering services to allow state government to use qualified private architectural and engineering firms to help deliver transportation projects safely,cost effectively and on time and to speed the completion of a dollar backlog of highway,bridge,transit and other projects,subds.a,d.
the initiative added article xxii to the state constitution,which provides that the state of california and all other governmental entities shall be allowed to contract with qualified private entities for architectural and engineering services for all public works of improvement.cal,art.xxii.section provides,nothing contained in article vii of this constitution shall be construed to limit,restrict or prohibit the state or any other governmental entities from contracting with private entities for the performance of architectural and engineering services.cal,art.xxii.
the initiative also enacted a new chapter of the government code,chapter,sections because these statutes were enacted by initiative,the legislature has only a limited ability to amend them.cal,art.ii,subd.c amwest surety ins.wilson cal th,d.the act may be amended only to further its purposes and only by a statute passed in each house by roll call vote entered in the journal,of the membership concurring,and signed by the governor.the statutes enacted by proposition do not provide detailed regulations of private contracting for architectural and engineering services.rather,they simply define architectural and engineering services clarify that state transportation improvement program stip projects are subject to article xxii impose procedural safeguards and ensure that the statutes are not construed to extend beyond contracting for architectural and engineering services.the statutes expressly provide that they are intended to comprehensively regulate the matters contained in the initiative provisions.they also provide that the initiative must be liberally construed to accomplish its purposes and that it prevails over any conflicting acts of the legislature.
following the voters approval of proposition,caltrans stopped complying with statutes that regulated private contracting,but continued to use a statutory procedure for selecting architectural and engineering contractors.the caltrans director issued a policy statement director policy establishing criteria for the private contracting of architectural and engineering services.
on november,professional engineers and a california taxpayer filed this mandamus action challenging caltrans contracting practices since the passage of proposition.they raise three main arguments in their petition.first,the statutes that regulated private contracting remain in effect and caltrans failure to comply with those statutes is unlawful.second,caltrans continued use of the qualifications based selection procedure often referred to as qbs violates proposition because section requires adopting a new fair,competitive selection process that gives greater weight to cost considerations.in the alternative,they argue that caltrans is not fully complying with the qualifications based selection procedure.third,caltrans is improperly enforcing underground regulations contained in its director policy and in two caltrans manuals without full compliance with the administrative procedure act apa.et the trial court denied the petition and entered judgment for caltrans.
a review of the litigation history assists in our understanding of the purpose,intent and effect of proposition.the constitutional context for the professional engineers litigation was a body of case law that interpreted article vii of the california constitution article vii as a restriction on state agencies authority to hire private contractors.article vii establishes the state civil service,which was created to promote efficiency and economy in state government by requiring appointments and promotions to be made on the basis of merit,efficiency and fitness.cal,art.vii,professional engineers,supra,cal th at,d.courts have construed article vii as a restriction on private contracting,relying on the necessity,implicit in article vii,of protecting the civil service system from dissolution and destruction.professional engineers,at,d.under what is known as the nature of the services rule,which was first announced by the supreme court in,private contracting is prohibited if the services can be performed adequately and competently by civil service employees.id.at,d,state compensation ins.fund riley cal d,discussing former cal,art.xxiv,predecessor of art.vii.under the new function rule,private contracting is allowed for a new function not previously undertaken by the state and not already covered by an existing department or agency.professional engineers,at,d.under the cost savings rule,cost savings may be considered in determining whether civil service employees can perform the tasks adequately and competently.id.at,d.
in,the legislature enacted section permitting caltrans to contract with private architects,added by stats,ch.the legislature amended the statute in,mandating that caltrans contract with qualified architects and engineers when the agency determines that obtainable staff is unable to perform particular work within the time the public interest requires the work to be done.we refer to section as the caltrans contracting law.
in,the legislature enacted section,which codifies the nature of the services,cost savings and new state function rules developed in article vii case law.professional engineers,supra,cal th at,d.section,which applies to all state agencies and to contracts for any personal services,describes the circumstances when it is permissible for agencies to hire private contractors.we refer to section as the personal services contracting statute.
in,professional engineers in california government professional engineers,a union representing state civil service employees and a plaintiff in the instant appeal,sued caltrans for unlawfully contracting with private architectural and engineering firms.professional engineers,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiffs alleged that caltrans had adopted a policy of using private contracting rather than hiring sufficient staff to perform the department work that caltrans used private contractors to perform work traditionally performed by civil service employees and that could have been timely performed by civil service employees had caltrans been adequately staffed and that caltrans failed to justify the private contracting as.id.at,d.
while professional engineers was pending in the trial court,the legislature enacted a statutory scheme to govern private contracting by caltrans for professional and technical services,added by stats,ch.we refer to sections to as the caltrans private contracting scheme.the scheme which is substantially similar today to the way it was in authorizes caltrans to contract with private architectural and engineering firms when certain conditions are met.the legislation includes findings that there is a compelling public interest in ensuring that all highway funds are captured and used in a timely manner that in order to maximize use of those funds caltrans needs to be that because of significant fluctuations in project development workload,private contracting allows caltrans to maintain a more stable workforce and avoid the costly process of hiring and layoff and that it is therefore the intent of the legislature that caltrans contract for architectural and engineering services whenever caltrans is inadequately staffed to satisfactorily carry out project development work in a timely and effective manner.the statutes instruct caltrans to adopt guidelines for private contracting that include consideration of the factors set forth in the statement of legislative findings and intent,and permit caltrans to hire private contractors whenever the director determines that the guidelines are applicable.private contractors shall not displace civil service employees.the statutes specifically provide that caltrans contracts for architectural and engineering services are not subject to section,the personal services contracting statute,subd.a.
in,the professional engineers trial court found that caltrans was contracting with private architects and engineers unlawfully and it enjoined caltrans from contracting for those services unless it complied with the caltrans contracting directive,the caltrans contracting scheme and article vii.professional engineers,supra,cal th at,d.the court specifically found that certain contracts that had been awarded by caltrans did not satisfy the statutory criteria and it enjoined the agency from continuing those contracts.id.at,d.
in,the legislature attempted to permit greater private contracting by caltrans with amendments to the caltrans contracting scheme,sections to,and.stats,ch.the bill expressed an intent to afford caltrans a new and independent basis upon which to justify contracting out through january.stats,ch.it contained a set of statutes effective until january,and a set of statutes effective on january.stats,ch.the first set of statutes declared that the use of private contractors was a new state function that did not duplicate the existing functions of caltrans that the seismic retrofit program enacted following the loma prieta earthquake was a workload demand and that caltrans was not required to staff at a level that would allow the civil service to meet caltrans needs,subds.a,d.section provided that contracts awarded on or before july,should not be terminated.the second set of statutes restored the law in effect before the amendments,as amended by stats,ch,eff.january.
after passage of the amendments,caltrans took the position that the professional engineers trial court injunction was no longer applicable.professional engineers,supra,cal th at,d.however,the trial court refused to dissolve or modify the injunction and in the california supreme court upheld the trial court order.id.at,d.the supreme court reaffirmed decisional law that interpreted article vii as a restriction on private contracting and held that the amendments effective until january,were invalid because they conflicted with article vii.id.at,d.it is against this historical backdrop that the voters passed proposition.

standard of review 
we review the trial court rulings on questions of law de novo and its factual findings for substantial evidence.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.
our review of the legality of caltrans contracting practices is de novo.in determining whether to accept a bid for a public contract,public officers as a rule perform not merely ministerial functions,but duties of a judicial or discretionary nature,and the courts,in the absence of fraud or an abuse of discretion,will not ordinarily interfere,so long as the officers comply with the controlling constitutional or legislative provisions.diablo beacon printing pub.city of concord d,quoting at.plaintiffs do not contest caltrans discretionary choice of one potential contractor over another.rather,they argue that caltrans is violating controlling law,proposition and other statutes and regulations,with its contracting practices.these claims are subject to nondeferential review.associated builders and contractors,san francisco airports com.cal th,d.to determine the controlling law,we must construe proposition,as well as other statutes and regulations.statutory construction is a legal determination we make independently.california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.
ii.implied repeal of statutes governing private contracting 
plaintiffs argue that proposition simply lifted the restrictions of article vii on the legislature power to authorize private contracting of architectural and engineering services on public works.because article vii no longer restricts the legislature power,plaintiffs argue,the legislature may authorize more extensive private contracting by caltrans or other state agencies if it chooses.unless and until the legislature amends or repeals the statutes that govern private contracting,those statutes remain in effect and are binding on state agencies.we disagree.
an express purpose of the initiative is to remove existing restrictions on private contracting for architectural and engineering services,subd.a.california constitution,article xxii expressly removes the constitutional restriction on private contracting that courts had inferred from article vii.cal,art.xxii.the initiative contains no parallel provision expressly repealing existing specific statutory restrictions on private contracting,but it does include several provisions that can only be given meaningful effect if the initiative as a whole is construed as impliedly repealing those statutory restrictions.
ordinarily,repeals or amendments by implication are strongly disfavored and will be found only when two acts are irreconcilable,clearly repugnant,and so inconsistent that the two can not have concurrent operation.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d,see mclaughlin state board of education th,d statutes may be amended by implication under same principles governing repeals by implication.nevertheless,an implied repeal or amendment will be found if the statute constitutes a revision of the entire subject,so that the court may say that it was intended to be a substitute for the first.citation.board of supervisors lonergan cal d.proposition expresses an intent to comprehensively regulate the subject of private contracting for architectural and engineering services on public works.it also expresses an intent to remove existing restrictions provides that it is to be liberally construed to accomplish its purposes provides that it prevails over conflicting acts of the legislature,subd.a,and provides that it can only be amended to further its purposes.collectively,these provisions compel the conclusion that proposition effected an implied repeal or amendment of existing statutes to the extent that they limit caltrans ability to hire private contractors to perform architectural and engineering services beyond the limitations of proposition.
the caltrans contracting scheme limits caltrans ability to use private contractors more restrictively than proposition because it requires that civil service staff not be displaced and it authorizes caltrans to use pri
