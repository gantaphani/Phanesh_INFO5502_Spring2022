introduction 
california statutory law enumerates seven specific grounds by which the results of an election can be contested see,so that,under certain circumstances,the election can be set aside and a new election held california case law holds that these seven grounds are the exclusive statutory grounds for challenges although election results can be challenged under section on the ground that the winner is ineligible,the statute does not contemplate challenges based on the fact that one of the is ineligible.
in the case before us now,a challenge has been brought on the theory that one of the losers in the candidate at ineligible for office and her presence affected the outcome.this challenge,as we explain in more detail below,should have been brought before the election.
ii.background 
on november,san diego held a runoff election for mayor.the candidates on the ballot were the two top vote getters from the primary,mayor dick murphy and county supervisor ron roberts.however,about five weeks before the election the city clerk had qualified a third person as a candidate,city councilmember donna frye.accordingly,the ballot also provided for.
it turned out to be a very close election indeed.mayor murphy and the candidate,councilmember frye,received about percent of the votes each with murphy apparently receiving a few more,with supervisor roberts receiving the rest.
we express no opinion on the issue as to whether the failure on the part of some voters who wrote in frye name to also blacken an oval next to it means that those votes should,or should not,be counted.as will be made clear,the particular case before is brought by a voter who wants another election without frye on the resolvable independent of the undarkened oval question.
the voter in question is thomas mckinney.in the wake of the election,mckinney filed a complaint on november,which as amended november,sought declaratory and injunctive relief and an election contest.in that complaint mckinney seeks a writ of mandate which would annul the san diego mayoral election and have the court order a new election on the theory that the qualification of frye candidacy by the city clerk was in contravention of san diego city charter.
the theory behind mckinney challenge goes like this in,the california supreme court in canaan abdelnour cal d,held that san diego could not preclude in its runoff election for mayor.however,in,the california supreme court held in edelstein city and county of san francisco cal th,d,that precluding in san francisco mayoral election was perfectly constitutional and even went on to overrule canaan to the extent that it held otherwise.since the san diego charter specifically says that the only candidates in the mayoral runoff election shall be the two top vote getters from the primary and canaan was overruled to the extent that it held san diego could preclude,it follows that the city clerk,in qualifying frye as a candidate,violated the city charter provision,now revived in the wake of edelstein.moreover,even though the city municipal code was amended to allow for in mayoral runoff elections in the wake of canaan,it is trumped by that now revived city charter domar electric,city of los angeles cal th,d.
we also do not express any opinion as to whether the qualification of frye by the city clerk was indeed in contravention of the charter.again,this case can be decided independent of that question as well.
an ex parte hearing was held on november on mckinney request to obtain temporary restraining orders to halt counting the votes and prevent subsequent certification of the election results.at that hearing the trial court denied the request for the restraining order in sweeping terms,indicating that mckinney was not entitled to any relief under his complaint at all.the reporter transcript of the hearing shows that the trial judge rejected mckinney position on two bases the candidacy was indeed authorized by virtue of the custom and practice of the city in allowing in runoff elections,but even if it was mckinney had waited too long to challenge the election and his complaint was barred by laches.
a few days later,the trial judge signed a minute order dismissing mckinney complaint nunc pro tunc as of the date of the denial of mckinney request for temporary restraining orders 
on tuesday november,mckinney filed this writ proceeding in division one of this district based in san diego,seeking not only to vacate the ex parte denial of his request for temporary restraining orders but also to reverse the dismissal of his case as provided in the signed minute order.the proceeding was transferred to this court based in santa ana that very day which was the day that certification of the results was scheduled.we immediately stayed the certification in order to maintain the status quo at least long enough to study the merits of the petition and receive written opposition.we scheduled oral argument for friday,december,and now write in the wake of that hearing.
iii.challenges must either be brought on enumerated statutory grounds or be based on the violation of constitutional rights 
mckinney should have brought this challenge before the election 
mckinney had a preelection remedy he could have exercised.section,subdivision a provides that any elector may seek a writ of mandate alleging that an error or omission has occurred,or is about to occur,in the placing of any name on,or in the printing of,a ballot,sample ballot,voter pamphlet,or other official matter,or that any neglect of duty has occurred,or is about to occur.
kilbourne city of carpinteria d.nicely illustrates the rule that one can not pass up a preelection remedy in favor of a challenge.kilbourne involved a special recall election of a city council member,but there was a ballot error misspelling his name.the city council member did not seek a writ of mandate until after the election was held to invalidate the election based on the ballot error.the appellate court held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to invalidate the election because the postelection relief sought was not found in statute.the city council member should have sought relief preelection,as provided in the statute.see id.at.statute allowing for correcting ballot errors contemplates action which obviously must be done before the election.
the bases for a challenge,an election contest,are enumerated in section.and,as our supreme court pointed out in friends of sierra madre city of sierra madre,supra,cal th,d,these grounds are exclusive that the court authority to invalidate an election is limited to the bases for contest specified in elections code section and that section is exclusive is strongly suggested by the nature of the grounds for contest therein enumerated.id.at,d,see also bradley perrodin,supra th at,d election results may only be challenged on one of the grounds specified in section.people ex rel.kerr county of orange,supra,th,d rejecting arguments that attack on impartial analysis in ballot could be brought because it was not framed as an election contest horwath city of east palo alto d.most of the time analysis ends with determination of whether plaintiff is attacking election on one of the grounds specified for election contest in section alden superior court d.a proceeding to contest an election may be brought only when and as authorized by statute.
at oral argument counsel for mckinney specifically disavowed any reliance on section,and we take that as a formal withdrawal of his complaint to the degree that it requests relief in the form of an election contest.accordingly,we express no opinion here whether any of the subdivisions of section would otherwise apply to this case.
rather,mckinney theory is that the court must enforce the city charter or at least his interpretation of the charter in terms of a request for writ of mandate.but having passed up the chance to challenge frye qualification and provision in the ballot for,mckinney can not bring that challenge now,after the election.he had a remedy prior to the election if he had been willing to exercise it.
any arguable violation of the charter does not rise to a constitutional l
