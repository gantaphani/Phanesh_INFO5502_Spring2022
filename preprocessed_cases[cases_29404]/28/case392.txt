article section of the oklahoma constitution provides that the justices of the oklahoma supreme court shall choose a chief justice and justice from among their members.having failed in his desire to be chosen once again chief justice of the oklahoma supreme court,justice marian opala seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts in his effort to achieve that end.he brings to us claims that he was discriminated against on the basis of his age in violation of the equal protection clause and that his due process rights were violated when his colleagues on the oklahoma supreme court changed the rule of rotation for elevation of a chief justice from one which precluded to that position for more than one consecutive term to one which lifted that prohibition and joseph watt as chief justice.
after justice opala named his judicial colleagues as defendants in federal proceedings,they responded by asserting several defenses,including sovereign immunity,qualified immunity,and legislative immunity.the district court disagreed with the defendants,concluded that federal jurisdiction was properly invoked,and denied the motion to dismiss.defendants bring an interlocutory appeal.we take a quite different view of the jurisdictional issue,and for the reasons that follow,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.
implementation of the oklahoma constitutional provision for choosing a chief justice and a justice is set forth in rule of the internal operating procedures of the oklahoma supreme court conference.prior to november,rule provided 
the term of office of chief justice shall rotate among eligible members of the court every two years.a justice is eligible to become chief justice when each sitting justice at the time of the justice appointment has completed a term as chief justice or waived his or her right to do so.no justice shall succeed himself or herself as chief justice,nor shall a justice be eligible hereunder until he or she has completed six years service as justice of this court.
old rule.in his complaint,justice opala claims that this rule,and his status as justice at the time,created a reasonable expectation that he would be nominated for chief justice.
on november,all members of the oklahoma supreme court,save justice opala,convened a conference to vote on a proposed change to rule.justice opala was aware of the meeting,but chose not to attend in protest.the defendants voted to amend the rule,which now reads 
the term of office of chief justice shall rotate among eligible members of the court every two years.the next senior justice who has never served as chief justice should be considered for election as chief justice,provided that the justice has served at least four years on this court including service as justice.if the next senior justice has not served at least four years on the court including service as justice,the incumbent chief justice or any other justice who has served as chief justice may be elected to another term as chief justice.otherwise,the chief justice will serve only one term.
new rule.according to justice opala,the practical effects of this amendment were to cause justice joseph watt to have top priority for being to the position of chief justice,and to prohibit justice opala himself from being elected as chief justice.specifically,justice opala asserted that because of his tenure as a justice of the court,he was the only justice eligible to be nominated for the office of chief justice because each of the other justices that had satisfied the qualification of completing six years of service as justice opala had completed a term of chief justice.the duly voted pursuant to new rule,and chief justice watt.justice james winchester was elected to justice.
on december,justice opala filed suit in federal district court against the other members of the oklahoma supreme court challenging the constitutionality of new rule.he argued that the amendment to old rule violated his rights to equal protection of the laws pursuant to the fifth and fourteenth amendments because it was motivated in part by his age justice opala was at the time of filing.he also asserted that he was deprived of a liberty interest in the chief justiceship in violation of the procedural component of the due process clause because the amendment did not provide for any hearing.the only redress he sought was a declaration that new rule violated the constitution.
as noted,defendants moved to dismiss invoking legislative immunity,sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment,qualified immunity,and failure to present a substantial federal question.the district court denied the motion,finding that legislative immunity did not apply because the amendment was an administrative and not a legislative act the suit fell within the ex parte young,exception to eleventh amendment sovereign immunity because justice opala was seeking relief qualified immunity did not apply because justice opala was not seeking money damages and determining whether justice opala asserted a substantial federal question was infeasible without discovery.defendants subsequent motion for reconsideration of the denial of their motion to dismiss was denied by the district court.it was then that the defendants sought this interlocutory appeal.
we review de novo the district court denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.brumark samson resources,cir.we have jurisdiction to review the district court denial of defendants motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the collateral order exception to,which provides for interlocutory appeal of orders denying motions to dismiss brought on the basis of eleventh amendment immunity as the basis for appellate jurisdiction.before justice opala filed this suit,chief justice watt was to his post,and justice opala was succeeded as justice by justice winchester.because we are only permitted to grant prospective equitable relief under ex parte young,we can not undo this election.moreover,a declaration that new rule is unconstitutional will not remedy justice opala claimed injury that he was not able to stand for election under old rule while serving as justice.accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of defendants motions to dismiss,and remand with instructions that the district court dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction.
