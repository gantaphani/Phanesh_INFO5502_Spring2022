the pivotal question presented by this appeal is whether speech of elected state and local government officials made pursuant to their official duties,like speech of public employees,is less protected by the first amendment than other speech.the district court held that the first amendment affords absolutely no protection to speech by elected officials made pursuant to their official duties.we disagree.the first amendment protection of elected officials speech is full,robust,and analogous to that afforded citizens in general.furthermore,when a state seeks to restrict the speech of an elected official on the basis of its content,a federal court must apply strict scrutiny and declare that limitation invalid unless the state carries its burden to prove both that the regulation furthers a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.in the present case,because the district court dismissed the elected officials challenge to a state statute that regulates their speech on the basis of its content without applying the required strict scrutiny analysis,we reverse the district court judgment and remand the case for the performance of that task.
the plaintiffs,elected city council members,were indicted in state court for violations of the criminal provisions of the texas open meetings act toma by acting as a quorum in exchanging private emails discussing whether to call a council meeting to consider a public contract matter.after prosecuting the charges for several months,the district attorney dismissed them without prejudice.the plaintiffs,alleging fear of future prosecutions and undue restriction of their first amendment speech rights,brought this action in federal district court for declaratory and injunctive relief against the state attorney general and the district attorney,challenging as speech regulations the criminal provisions of toma.the district court dismissed the plaintiffs claims,holding that under garcetti ceballos,d,elected officials,like public employees,enjoy no first amendment protection of their speech made pursuant to their official duties.the plaintiffs appealed and we now reverse and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
defendants assert that this case is nonjusticiable because the plaintiffs lack standing and their claims are moot.we agree with the district court that the plaintiff rangra has standing,and we conclude that the case is not moot 
to establish standing,the plaintiff must demonstrate injury,causation,and redressability.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.it is well established that a credible threat of present or future criminal prosecution will confer standing.see,virginia am.booksellers ass n,d holding that the requirement was met,in part,because plaintiffs have alleged an actual and fear that the law will be enforced against them steffel thompson,d i t is not necessary that a party first expose himself to actual arrest or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.doe bolton,d.this is because a credible threat of present or future prosecution is an injury sufficient to confer standing,even if there is no history of past enforcement,see bolton,at,and a speaker who fears prosecution may engage in,which is itself another injury,see am.booksellers,at.t he alleged danger of the challenged statute is,in large measure,one of.see also ashcroft aclu,d where a prosecution is a likely possibility speakers may rather than risk the perils of trial.there is a potential for extraordinary harm and a serious chill upon protected speech.
the in the phrase credible threat of prosecution is quite forgiving.w hen dealing with statutes that facially restrict expressive activity by the class to which the plaintiff belongs,courts will assume a credible threat of prosecution in the absence of compelling contrary evidence.
the district court held that the plaintiff established standing by demonstrating injury in fact,causation,and redressability through out of fear of prosecution under toma we agree.the plaintiff affidavits and trial testimony show that he has his speech to avoid prosecution under and thereby established injury moreover,the plaintiff has alleged threats of prosecution that can not be characterized as imaginary or speculative.see steffel,at.he has been indicted and prosecuted for his email discussion of setting up a city council meeting pertaining to council business,and the texas attorney general has warned that the speech the plaintiff claims is constitutionally protected and for which he has been indicted,communications,including emails,discussing public business or public policy,is subject to future prosecution the prosecution of the plaintiff for his email communications is ample demonstration that his concern with future indictment and prosecution is not chimerical.see id.citing poe ullman,d.in these circumstances,it is not necessary that the plaintiff first expose himself to actual arrest,indictment,or prosecution to be entitled to challenge a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.see id.citing epperson arkansas,d.
because the reasons for the plaintiff standing continue to exist,we also reject defendants argument that the case is moot 
the plaintiffs challenge the criminal provisions of toma as state regulations imposing an invalid restriction of free speech the supreme court has held that the strict scrutiny test governs challenges for assessing laws that regulate speech on the basis of its content 
strict scrutiny,a formula crafted by the supreme court for implementing constitutional values,is one of the most important elements of modern constitutional law strict scrutiny varies from ordinary scrutiny by imposing three hurdles on the government.it shifts the burden of proof to the government,requires the government to prove that its action or regulation pursues a compelling state interest,and demands that the government prove that its action or regulation is narrowly tailored to further that compelling interest 
we agree with the plaintiffs that the criminal provisions of toma are regulations of speech that require the state to satisfy the test in order to uphold them a speech regulation is if it defines the regulated speech by reference to its content for example,in burson freeman,d,the court found a statute prohibiting display of political campaign materials within feet of a polling place to be a speech restriction because w hether individuals may exercise their free speech rights near polling places depends entirely on whether their speech is related to a political campaign.the statute does not reach other categories of speech,such as commercial solicitation,distribution,and display.id.at.toma,which criminalizes the discussion of public matters by a quorum of public officials when outside of an open meeting,see.gov t code ann,a,is similarly content based because whether a quorum of public officials may communicate with each other outside of an open meeting depends on whether the content of their speech refers to public business or public policy over which the governmental body has supervision or control.
furthermore,because toma imposes a regulation,we conclude that the district court was required to apply the test and to make the state carry its burden of proving that the statute pursues a compelling interest which the law is narrowly tailored to further.the district court did not perform that task because it mistakenly concluded that elected officials speech made pursuant to their official duties is totally unprotected by the first amendment.for this reason,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs claims as not actionable without ever undertaking the analysis.consequently,we must vacate the district court judgment and remand the case to it for a proper application of the strict scrutiny test.before doing so,however,we will explain why the district court erred in assuming that the speech of elected officials made pursuant to their official duties is entitled to no protection under the first amendment.
the supreme court,in garcetti,held that the first amendment does not protect a government employee from discipline based on speech made pursuant to the employee official duties the district court assumed that there is no meaningful distinction between the speech of elected officials and that of public employees and held that,under garcetti,the plaintiffs speech pursuant to their official duties was not protected by the first amendment.
the district court premise that the first amendment protection of elected officials speech is limited just as it is for the speech of public employees,however,is incorrect.speech by public employees is clearly less protected than other speech because the court has held that government employees speech rights must be balanced with the government need to supervise and discipline subordinates for efficient operations the first amendment does not protect government employees speech unless the speech is about a matter of public concern,and even then,a government employee may be fired or disciplined for her speech if the government employer can show,on balance,that the efficient operation of the office justified the action.but when the state acts as a sovereign,rather than as an employer,its power to limit first amendment freedoms is much more attenuated that is because a state interest in regulating speech as sovereign is relatively subordinate as t he government can not restrict the speech of the public at large just in the name of efficiency.garcetti itself,like the court other public employee speech cases,recognizes the state very limited power as sovereign to infringe on first amendment freedoms none of the supreme court public employee speech decisions qualifies or limits the first amendment protection of elected government officials speech contrary to the district court reasoning,there is a meaningful distinction between the first amendment protection of public employees speech and other speech,including that of elected government officials.
indeed,the supreme court decisions demonstrate that the first amendment protection of elected officials speech is robust and no less strenuous than that afforded to the speech of citizens in general.for example,in the the court held in bond floyd,d,that state action excluding a state representative from membership in the legislature because of his statements criticizing the policy of the federal government in vietnam and the operation of the selective service laws violated his right of free expression under the first amendment.in wood georgia,d,the court held that statements by a sheriff questioning the advisability of a grand jury investigation into block voting by black citizens did not present a clear and present danger to the administration of justice,and,therefore,the use of the contempt power to punish the sheriff for the statements abridged his right of free speech.the court emphasized that t he role that elected officials play in our society makes it all the more imperative that they be allowed freely to express themselves on matters of current public importance.id.at.
recently,in republican party of minnesota white,d,the court held that a state supreme court canon of conduct,which prohibited candidates for judicial election from announcing their views on disputed legal or political issues,is a regulation of speech that the proper test to be applied to determine the constitutionality of such a restriction is the strict scrutiny test that the strict scrutiny test requires that the party defending the restriction has the burden to prove that the regulation is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest and that in order for that party to show that the speech regulation is narrowly tailored,that party must demonstrate that the regulation does not unnecessarily circumscribe protected expression.see id.in white,based on the record compiled in the district court on cross motions for summary judgment and the court of appeals decision,a majority of the supreme court agreed that the parties defending the speech regulation had failed to carry their burden of proving that it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest,and that the state prohibition on judicial candidates announcing their legal views was an unconstitutional abridgement of freedom of speech.see id.further,the court reaffirmed that t he role that elected officials play in our society makes it all the more imperative that they be allowed freely to express themselves on matters of current public importance.id.at.quoting wood georgia,at.
most significantly,this court in jenevein willing,cir,held that white,at,required us to apply the strict scrutiny test to determine whether a state judiciary commission order censuring an elected judge speech on the basis of its content violated his first amendment protected speech rights see jenevein,at.the censure order,which disciplined the judge for holding a press conference in which he addressed alleged abuses of the judicial process by lawyers in a pending case,shut down all communication between the elected judge and his constituents.see id.at.applying the strict scrutiny test prescribed by white,we held that the censure order,in substantial part,was an unconstitutional restriction of the elected official speech because the state had failed to prove that it was narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest.see jenevein,at 
in jenevein,we expressly declined the parties invitation to draw upon the line of cases for sorting the free speech rights of employees elected to state office.we noted that those cases categorical divisions of public and private speech fail to illuminate the state interest in constraining speech by an elected public official,political speech at the core of the first amendment,and its necessity.further,we noted that an elected official relationship with the state differs from that of an ordinary state employee,observing o ur employee is an elected official,about whom the public is obliged to inform itself,and the employer is the public itself,at least in the practical sense,with the power to hire and fire.it is true that the elected official was an employee of the state.it is equally true that as an elected holder of state office,his relationship with his employer differs from that of an ordinary state employee.
conclusion 
applying the foregoing precepts,we conclude that the district court incorrectly assumed that the line of decisions,rather than the strict scrutiny test as elaborated in white,governs the present case.accordingly,we reverse the district court judgment and remand the case to it for the application of the strict scrutiny formula to.gov t code in doing so,we point out,however,that the supreme court has rejected the notion that strict scrutiny is strict in theory,but fatal in fact.the fact that strict scrutiny applies says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law that determination is the job of the court applying that standard 
for these reasons,the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded to it for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

the record reflects that rangra is still a member of the city council,although monclova may not be.a case is not moot as long as a live controversy exists between at least one plaintiff and one defendant.see cutter wilkinson,d charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure ed.consequently,we need not address standing with respect to monclova.to the extent the issue remains open,we leave its consideration and determination to the district court on remand.
