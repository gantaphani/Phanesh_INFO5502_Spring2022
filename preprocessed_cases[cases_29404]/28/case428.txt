in this appeal,we are confronted with the question of whether a federal court must award relief on a vote dilution claim brought under section of the voting rights act of,where the circumstances of the case make clear that no form of relief available under section will empower the protected minority group with any meaningful opportunity to elect the candidate of its choice.we answer the question in the negative and therefore affirm the district court order dissolving a permanent injunction that the district court had imposed on appellee baldwin county commission the commission in,after concluding,nearly fifteen years later,that further section relief was unavailable.
facts and procedural history 
the epic history of this case began nearly twenty years ago,as an outgrowth of earlier proceedings in another case initiated by john dillard and other citizens of alabama collectively dillard in order to challenge the,election employed by nine alabama counties under section of the voting rights act and the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the united states constitution.see dillard crenshaw county.the district court found in that case that these election schemes were the product of,or tainted by,racially inspired enactments of the alabama legislature,id.at,and subsequently allowed dillard to expand his complaint to include cities,counties,and county school boards that were using similar voting systems.
the commission was among the entities added to dillard crenshaw county after the district court made its initial findings.at that time,the commission was composed of four commissioners that were elected under a system that included the challenged structural features.see dillard baldwin county comm n,dillard i.rather than litigate the entire dispute,the commission entered into a consent decree with dillard in which it agreed not to contest the plaintiffs claims that its present election system violates the voting rights act.however,the commission vigorously contested the issue of what would constitute an appropriate remedy for this conceded violation.id.
in proceedings conducted in the district court,the commission offered to increase the size of the commission from four to five and to abandon the challenged feature of its existing voting system.id.at.in theory,the resulting pure voting system would have improved minority voting strength by allowing candidates that were less popular with the white majority to win elections with a plurality of votes cast.
dillard argued that the commission proposed remedy itself violated the voting rights act,and urged the district court to carve baldwin county into seven districts,gerrymandered to create a district with an majority.id.according to dillard,increasing the commission to seven members was imperative because of the small and declining size of the population in baldwin county,which was projected to fall below of the county total population by.id.at.the district court agreed with dillard and entered a permanent injunction adopting dillard proposal.id.at the redistricting of the county created a district with an population that was expected to be over in.id.at.
six years after the district court entered its injunction,a plurality of the supreme court decided in holder hall,d,that a federal court can not modify the size of an elected governing body in order to remedy a section violation because t here is no principled reason why one size should be picked over another as the benchmark for determining whether vote dilution has occurred.id.at.at.subsequently,this court held in nipper smith,cir en banc,that under holder,federal courts may not mandate as a section remedy that a state or political subdivision alter the size of its elected bodies.id.at see also white alabama,cir holding,under holder and nipper,that the federal courts lacked the authority under section to require the state of alabama to increase the size of its appellate courts.
in light of these decisions,dale brown and other residents of baldwin county collectively brown moved to intervene in the case in october,seeking vacatur of the injunction on grounds that it exceeded the district court powers under the voting rights act,and that it violated the tenth and eleventh amendments.the district court allowed brown to intervene but then dismissed his complaint on grounds that he failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.dillard baldwin county comm n,d,dillard iii.on appeal from that decision,we reversed,holding that brown had stated a claim for relief cognizable both under section of the voting rights act and under for violations of the tenth and eleventh amendments.dillard baldwin county comm rs,cir dillard iv.we remanded the case to the district court to consider inter alia whether the injunction may have been an appropriate remedy under the fourteenth amendment,even though it had been improper under section of the voting rights act.id.at.
on remand,the district court conducted a bench trial,during which the evidence showed that the injunction had not increased voting power in baldwin county as intended because the proportion of voters in the county had continued to decline.as of the census,the county population had declined to,and baldwin county no longer had a district.faced with this reality,dillard now asked the district court to abandon the district scheme that he had demanded fifteen years earlier,and argued instead for the court to compel the commission to adopt a cumulative voting system or in the alternative,to order the commission to adopt a pure system,the remedy dillard complained was inadequate fifteen years earlier,when baldwin county population represented a substantially larger proportion of the county total population.in either case,dillard argued that the district court had no basis for reducing the commission to its size,in spite of the supreme court decision in holder,and this court en banc holding in nipper.dillard stressed that,although the injunction could be modified,it could not be modified against the interest of the minority class if the injunction had been a legitimate remedy in,as voting rights law was understood at that time,even though subsequent mandatory authority has made clear that it could never be a legitimate remedy for any future section plaintiff.
the district court rejected dillard arguments and concluded that it lacked any basis for retaining supervision of the commission election system.dillard baldwin county comm n,d,dillard v.after dillard moved to amend the district court judgment,the court explained that it could no longer find a section violation because t he political weakness of the community in baldwin county now results from its being less than of the voting age population and the fact that it does not live in a geographically compact community.dillard baldwin county comm n,d,dillard vi.the court further concluded that the cumulative voting system that dillard now sought was not an appropriate section results remedy because there is no objective and workable standard for choosing it as a reasonable benchmark over the many forms of government.id.internal quotations omitted.this appeal followed.
whether the district court abused its discretion by dissolving its injunction on the ground that the population of baldwin county is not numerically large enough to obtain relief on a vote dilution claim under section of the voting rights act.
iii.standard of review 
we review a district court decision to modify an injunction for abuse of discretion,and it is an abuse of discretion for the district court to fail to make modifications required by applicable law.wilson minor,cir.however,we review the district court factual findings underpinning its decision for clear error,and we review its analysis of applicable law de novo.see davis chiles,cir.in the section context,we afford the district court findings with special deference due to the court special vantage point and ability to conduct an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of a voting system.negron city of miami beach,cir internal quotations omitted.
iv.discussion 
section of the voting rights act prohibits states and their political subdivisions from imposing or applying a voting structure or practice in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right to vote on account of race or color.a.in addition,section provides a cause of action for protected minority groups that can establish,based on the totality of the circumstances,that their members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.id.b.numerically small minority groups have latched onto this participation provision as support for the theory that section provides a dilution of minority influence cause of action for any protected group that can demonstrate that its members have less opportunity than the electorate at large to participate in the political process.however,the supreme court made clear in thornburg gingles,d,that u nless minority voters possess the potential to elect representatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practice,they can not claim to have been injured by that structure or practice.id.at.at emphasis added.this precondition to recovery precludes minority groups from pursuing vote dilution claims unless they can meet some threshold level of numerical substantiality.see gingles edmisten,panel we are doubtful that either the supreme court in developing the dilution concept in constitutional voting rights litigation,or the congress in embodying it in amended section of the voting rights act intended an application as to voter group size.there must obviously be some size as well as dispersion limits on those aggregations of voters to whom the concept can be applied,aff in part,rev in part sub,gingles,at.at holding that a minority group that is so small in relation to the surrounding white population that it could not constitute a majority in a district,can not maintain that it would have been able to elect representatives of its choice in the absence of the multimember electoral structure see also mcghee granville county,cir commenting that gingles precludes small and unconcentrated minority groups from bringing vote dilution claims.
in gingles,the supreme court held that plaintiffs claiming vote dilution through the use of multimember districts must prove,as preconditions to relief,that the minority group challenging the existing election scheme is sufficiently large and geographically compact that the minority group is politically cohesive and that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate.gingles,at.at.pursuant to the first gingles precondition,which has particular relevance in this case,the protected group must demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to elect the candidate of its choice in the absence of the challenged structure or practice we agree with the district court finding that the minority group that dillard represents,comprising less than of the relevant electorate,can not possibly satisfy this precondition to relief under the circumstances presented in this case.see dillard vi,d at.
dillard argues that the district court erred in applying the first gingles precondition because of the commission agreement in not to contest the plaintiffs claims that its present election system violates the voting rights act.we conclude,however,that dillard has overstated the prospective impact of this ambiguous concession,in light of the interplay between t he inquiries into remedy and liability in the section context.nipper,at.we held in nipper that t he first gingles precondition,informed by the second,dictates that the issue of remedy is part of the plaintiff prima facie case in section vote dilution cases.see davis,at as part of any prima facie case under section two,a plaintiff must demonstrate the existence of a proper remedy.we further held that t he absence of an available remedy is not only relevant at the remedial stage of the litigation,but also precludes,under the totality of the circumstances inquiry,a finding of liability.nipper,at see also growe emison,d unless the gingles preconditions are established,there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.
in entering into the consent decree,the commission may have conceded that a section violation existed,and that an appropriate remedy could be crafted,as voting rights law was then understood.however,any remedy that could have been conceded as appropriate in was subsequently rendered inappropriate by holder and nipper.in light of the interplay between the inquiries into remedy and liability that we recognized in nipper,the district court was thus precluded from finding an ongoing section violation in this case.as such,the commission prior agreement not to contest the substantive liability issues in dillard section claim can have no bearing on how the gingles preconditions apply in this case,or,more generally,whether dillard has met his burden of establishing the existence of an appropriate remedy because the gingles preconditions are necessary prerequisites to all section vote dilution claims,they must also be necessary prerequisites to all demands that a district court perpetuate relief imposed under the aegis of section.
dillard urges us to conclude that numerically small minority groups can bring claims under section,so long as the group can point to a structure or practice that theoretically impairs its ability to influence electoral outcomes.his claim of influence dilution is distinguished only by the remedy he seeks from the claims of minority groups seeking the creation of influence districts,districts where minority voters may not be able to elect a candidate of choice but can play a substantial,although not decisive,role in the electoral process.rodriguez pataki,d,panel.this influence dilution concept,although apparently a question of first impression in this circuit,has been consistently rejected by other federal courts.see,cousin sundquist,cir holding that a claim of an impairment of the minority ability to influence the outcome of the election,rather than to determine it was not cognizable under the voting rights act mcneil springfield park,cir w e can not consider claims that districts merely impair plaintiffs ability to influence elections.plaintiffs ability to win elections must also be impaired.rodriguez,d at illinois legislative redistricting comm lapaille,panel turner arkansas,panel,aff,d hastert state bd.of elections,panel.the clear message of these cases,consistent with gingles,is that a minority group can not be awarded relief on a vote dilution claim unless it can demonstrate that a challenged structure or practice impedes its ability to determine the outcome of elections.
dillard suggests that this substantial body of adverse authority is inapposite and is evidence only of the general reluctance of federal courts to affirmatively create districts or to compel redistricting.according to dillard,the result should be different here,where the remedy sought is less intrusive.we disagree.
as an initial matter,we question whether the cumulative voting system that dillard seeks to impose on the commission is truly less intrusive than compelled redistricting.implicit in the first gingles requirement is a limitation on the ability of a federal court to abolish a particular form of government and to use its imagination to fashion a new system.nipper,at.because n othing in the voting rights act suggests an intent on the part of congress to permit the federal judiciary to force on the states a new model of government,any remedy for a voting rights act violation must come from within the confines of the state system of government,id.at.after reviewing the record,we agree with the district court finding that cumulative voting schemes simply do not occupy a traditional and accepted place in alabama legislatively enacted voting schemes.dillard v,d at.the federal courts have no authority to conjure up such an election scheme and impose it on a state government,regardless of the theoretical prospect of increasing minority voting strength.
in addition,we can find no evidence that the federal c
