the issue on appeal is the extent to which sovereign immunity protects a federally recognized indian tribe and its officers against suit.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the suit may proceed against the tribe officers but not against the tribe itself.
the cherokee nation shares with the united states a common stain on its history the cherokees owned african slaves.at the end of the civil war,during which the tribe sided with the confederacy,the cherokee nation and the united states entered into a treaty reestablishing relations.see treaty with the cherokee,july,stat.treaty.in the treaty,the cherokee nation renounced slavery and involuntary servitude,and promised to extend all the rights of native cherokees to the former cherokee slaves,who came to be known as freedmen.treaty,art.ix.
in,congress directed the dawes commission to create membership rolls for the five civilized tribes of oklahoma,which included the cherokee nation.see act of june,ch,stat.the rolls for the cherokees were completed in and resulted in two lists a blood roll for native cherokees,and a freedmen roll for former slaves and their descendants.these lists serve an important function because the tribal constitution of provides that citizenship in the cherokee nation must be proven by reference to the dawes commission rolls.the citizens of the cherokee nation choose their tribal leaders by popular election according to procedures approved by the secretary of the department of the interior secretary.see principal chiefs act of.see also letter from neal mccaleb,assistant sec y of indian affairs,dep t of interior,to chadwick smith,principal chief,cherokee nation,reaffirming continuing validity of the principal chiefs act,letter from neal mccaleb,assistant sec y of indian affairs,dep t of interior,to chadwick smith,principal chief,cherokee nation,disavowing letter of march,but reaffirming continuing validity of the principal chiefs act.
marilyn vann and other descendants of persons listed on the freedmen roll collectively,the freedmen allege they were not permitted to vote in two tribal elections because they lack an ancestral link to the blood roll.in the may,election,voters reelected chief chadwick smith,chose other tribal officers,and amended the tribal constitution to eliminate a provision requiring the secretary approval of amendments.the july,election saw further constitutional amendments and a for tribal officers.the freedmen,protesting their alleged disenfranchisement,asked the secretary to invalidate the may election.the secretary pressed the cherokee nation to address the freedmen concerns and submit its election procedures for federal review.see,letter from jeanette hanna,regional director,dep t of interior,to chadwick smith,principal chief,cherokee nation july,the principal chiefs act provides that the procedures for selecting the principal chief of the cherokee nation are subject to approval by the secretary of the interior.we are aware of no evidence that the secretary has approved the current procedures for the election of the principal chief.except for writing a few letters,the cherokee nation appears to have done little in response.the secretary nevertheless recognized chief smith election on august,referring any election disputes to the tribal courts.see letter from jeanette hanna,regional director,dep t of interior,to chadwick smith,principal chief,cherokee nation,stating that it is inappropriate and premature for the department to question the validity of the election of tribal officials.the secretary held the may constitutional amendment under review until chief smith eventually withdrew the tribe request for approval of that amendment in june.
the freedmen sued the secretary under the administrative procedure act in the united states district court for the district of columbia,alleging that their exclusion from the tribal elections,along with the secretary recognition of those elections,violated the thirteenth amendment,the fifteenth amendment,the cherokee constitution,the treaty,the principal chiefs act,and the indian civil rights act.the freedmen sought a declaratory judgment that the secretary had behaved arbitrarily and capriciously.a.the freedmen also sought to enjoin the secretary from recognizing the results of the elections,or of any future elections from which the freedmen would be excluded.
the district court granted the cherokee nation leave to intervene for the limited purpose of challenging the suit under federal rule of civil procedure.the cherokee nation then moved to dismiss on the grounds that although it was a necessary and indispensable party,sovereign immunity barred its joinder see.b if a person who is required to be joined if feasible as defined in subparagraph a can not be joined,the court must determine whether,in equity and good conscience,the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.the freedmen responded with a motion for leave to file an amended complaint naming as defendants the cherokee nation,chief smith,and other tribal officers,all of whom were alleged to have violated the thirteenth amendment and the treaty.after determining that the tribe was a necessary party under rule a,the district court concluded that the tribe and its officers could be joined because the tribe did not enjoy sovereign immunity against the freedmen suit.accordingly,the district court denied the motion to dismiss and granted the motion for leave to file.
the cherokee nation appeals the denial of its motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds.under and the collateral order doctrine,we may hear an interlocutory appeal from the denial of such a motion.see kilburn socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,citing aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d,and cohen beneficial indus.loan.wisconsin nation,cir a district court determination that a tribe sovereign immunity has been waived by the tribe or abrogated by congress falls within the ambit of the collateral order doctrine.we review de novo the district court conclusion that the cherokee nation and its officers do not enjoy tribal sovereign immunity.see cherokee nation babbitt.
indian tribes did not relinquish their status as sovereigns with the creation and expansion of the republic on the north american continent.the courts of the united states have long recognized that the tribes once were,and remain still,independent political societies,worcester georgia,pet.cherokee nation georgia,pet.perhaps the most basic principle of all indian law,supported by a host of decisions,is that those powers lawfully vested in an indian nation are not,in general,delegated powers granted by express acts of congress,but rather inherent powers of a limited sovereignty which has never been extinguished.felix cohen handbook of federal indian law a,at nell jessup newton,hereinafter,cohen handbook quoting united states wheeler,d.that said,congress may whittle away tribal sovereignty as it sees fit.see santa clara pueblo martinez,d noting that congress has plenary authority to limit,modify or eliminate the powers of local which the tribes otherwise possess wheeler,at.noting that tribes are subject to ultimate federal control fisher district court,d referring to tribes status united states kagama.referring to tribes as cherokee nation,pet.at referring to tribes as domestic dependent nations whose relation to the united states resembles that of a ward to his guardian.
as sovereigns,indian tribes enjoy immunity against suits.kiowa tribe,d.tax comm citizen band potawatomi indian tribe,d santa clara pueblo,at.puyallup tribe,dep t of game,d united states fid.guar.wichita affiliated tribes hodel.this immunity flows from a tribe sovereign status in much the same way as it does for the states and for the federal government.see seminole tribe florida,d noting the presupposition that i t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent quoting hans louisiana.quoting the federalist alexander hamilton clinton rossiter.congress power to limit the scope of a tribe sovereignty extends to tribal sovereign immunity.this aspect of tribal sovereignty,like all others,is subject to the superior and plenary control of congress.santa clara pueblo,at.see also.tax comm n,at.congress has always been at liberty to dispense with such tribal immunity or to limit it.but abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity requires an explicit and unequivocal statement to that effect.c l,citizen band potawatomi indian tribe,d to abrogate tribal immunity,congress must unequivocally express that purpose.quoting santa clara pueblo,at.cherokee nation,at any waiver of a tribe sovereign immunity,whether by congress or by the tribe itself,can not be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.quoting santa clara pueblo,at.
has there been an abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity in our case the district court concluded that congress clearly indicated its intent to abrogate the cherokee nation immunity with respect to violations of the thirteenth amendment as evidenced by the treaty of.vann kempthorne,d.the district court reasoned as follows.see id.at.the thirteenth amendment,which applies to indian tribes,eradicates the badges and incidents of slavery.the treaty implements similar principles for the cherokee nation.see treaty,art.ix abolishing slavery and granting freedmen all the rights of native cherokees id.art.vi declaring that the cherokee nation laws shall be uniform throughout said nation id.art.xii acknowledging supremacy of federal law.later historical developments,including an statute forcing the cherokee nation to share its assets with the freedmen,further demonstrate congress intent to protect the freedmen against discrimination.by repeatedly imposing such limitations on the sovereignty of the cherokee nation in order to protect the freedmen,congress has unequivocally indicated its intent to abrogate the tribe immunity with regard to racial oppression prohibited by the thirteenth amendment.vann,d at.denying the freedmen the right to vote in tribal elections violates the thirteenth amendment and the treaty,so the cherokee nation can not claim tribal sovereign immunity against a suit complaining of such a badge and incident of slavery.
the district court is mistaken to treat every imposition upon tribal sovereignty as an abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity sovereignty and immunity are related,alden maine,d,the latter being an attribute of the former,aqueduct sewer,at.but it is possible to cut back sovereignty in a way that leaves sovereign immunity intact.kiowa tribe,at.to say substantive state laws apply to conduct,however,is not to say that a tribe no longer enjoys immunity from suit there is a difference between the right to demand compliance with state laws and the means available to enforce them.congress can impose substantive constraints upon a tribe without subjecting the tribe to suit in federal court to enforce those constraints,as the supreme court made clear in santa clara pueblo.in that case,an individual indian sued her tribe in federal court,alleging gender discrimination in violation of the equal protection guarantee of the indian civil rights act icra.despite the icra imposition of substantive constraints upon the tribe,the supreme court held the suit barred by tribal sovereign immunity and sent the plaintiff to pursue her claim in tribal court.see at.see also nero cherokee nation,cir.noting the santa clara pueblo distinction between a substantive constraint and an abrogation of sovereign immunity.absent explicit and unequivocal language to the contrary,the imposition of substantive constraints upon a tribe sovereignty can not be interpreted as an abrogation of its sovereign immunity.
we must determine for ourselves whether anything in the thirteenth amendment or the treaty worked an abrogation of the cherokee nation sovereign immunity.again,we will only acknowledge such an abrogation if the text is express and unequivocal.see santa clara pueblo,at.holding the icra not to abrogate tribal sovereign immunity because n othing on the face of title i of the icra purports to subject tribes to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in civil actions for injunctive or declaratory relief.paraplegic,ass miccosukee tribe,cir holding the americans with disabilities act not to abrogate tribal sovereign immunity and declaring,congress abrogates tribal immunity only where the definitive language of the statute itself states an intent either to abolish indian tribes common law immunity or to subject tribes to suit under the act bassett mashantucket pequot tribe,cir holding the copyright act not to abrogate tribal sovereign immunity,where nothing on the statute face could be so construed 
we find no express and unequivocal abrogation of the cherokee nation sovereign immunity in the texts upon which the freedmen rely.nothing in of the thirteenth amendment so much as hints at a federal court suit by a private party to enforce the prohibition against badges and incidents of slavery against indian tribes.const.amend.xiii,neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,shall exist within the united states,or any place subject to their jurisdiction.although of the thirteenth amendment gives congress the power to generate express and unequivocal language abrogating tribal sovereign immunity to allow for such suits,that promise remains unfulfilled absent some further legislative enactment.id.congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.the treaty similarly lacks any clear abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity,as the tenth circuit correctly concluded in nero,at.the freedmen point to articles vi,ix,and xii of the treaty,but these say nothing about federal court suits against the cherokee nation.
the freedmen argue that our search for intent to abrogate is misguided because the thirteenth amendment and the treaty predate the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity,such that the drafters of those texts could not have foreseen the interpretive rule requiring express and unequivocal abrogation.freedmen br.at.this argument misapprehends the nature of tribal sovereign immunity,which is not the product of any enactment but an inherent attribute of a tribe sovereignty.tribal sovereign immunity existed at the founding,as surely as did tribal sovereignty,and our only concern is whether the thirteenth amendment or the treaty later abrogated that immunity.the rule reflects the belief,as true in the nineteenth century as it is today,that lawmakers do not lightly discard sovereign immunity.we see no reason to depart from the established interpretive rule based on the vintage of the texts.
because nothing in the thirteenth amendment or the treaty amounts to an express and unequivocal abrogation of tribal sovereign immunity,the cherokee nation can not be joined in the freedmen federal court suit without the tribe consent.we reverse the district court determination to the contrary.
having found the tribe sovereign immunity intact,we must now assess whether tribal officers enjoy the same immunity from suit as does the tribe itself.we do not approach this question from scratch,for ex parte young,and related cases have come to apply to questions of tribal sovereign immunity.see santa clara pueblo,at.citing ex parte young bassett,at citing ex parte young tenneco oil sac fox tribe of indians,cir citing larson domestic foreign commerce.recent case,harv,suggesting extension of ex parte young to tribal sovereign immunity context.
the basic doctrine of ex parte young can be simply stated.a federal court is not barred by the eleventh amendment from enjoining state officers from acting unconstitutionally,either because their action is alleged to violate the constitution directly or because it is contrary to a federal statute or regulation that is the supreme law of the land.charles alan wright.arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and proceduree ed hereinafter wright miller citations omitted.in ex parte young,a private party was allowed to pursue an injunction in federal court against minnesota attorney general to prohibit his enforcement of a state statute alleged to violate the fourteenth amendment.this result rested upon the fiction that the suit went against the officer and not the state,thereby avoiding sovereign immunity bar.pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d noting the fiction kenneth culp davis,suing the government by falsely pretending to sue an officer,chi.same.the officer,so the reasoning goes,can not take refuge in the state immunity if he contravenes federal law,and is stripped of his official or representative character and subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.ex parte young,at.the supreme court recently confirmed the ease with which this stripping rationale can be applied.in determining whether the doctrine of ex parte young avoids an eleventh amendment bar to suit,a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.verizon.pub.serv.comm n,d citation and quotation marks omitted.
applying the principle of ex parte young in the matter before us,we think it clear that tribal sovereign immunity does not bar the suit against tribal officers.santa clara pueblo,which relied on ex parte young to hold a tribal officer not protected by the tribe immunity from suit,dictates this result.see at.the freedmen allege that the cherokee nation officers are in violation of the thirteenth amendment and the treaty,and seek an injunction preventing chief smith from holding further elections without a vote of all citizens,including the freedmen.pls.second am.compl.faced with allegations of ongoing constitutional and treaty violations,and a prospective request for injunctive relief,officers of the cherokee nation can not seek shelter in the tribe sovereign immunity.
in an attempt to avoid the straightforward application of ex parte young,the cherokee nation raises three arguments,which we consider in turn.finding none of them persuasive,we conclude that sovereign immunity is no bar to the freedmen suit against the tribe officers,and therefore affirm the district court determination to the same effect.
invoking larson domestic foreign commerce,the cherokee nation argues that tribal sovereign immunity bars the suit against its officers because the requested relief really runs against the tribe itself.this is reminiscent of the losing argument in ex parte young.see at.rejecting state officer objection that the suit is,in effect,one against the state of minnesota.the argument is no more persuasive a century later.due to an unfortunate footnote in the larson opinion,however,we must explain our reasoning at some length.
larson involved a contract dispute between the federal war assets administration and a private party to whom it had sold surplus coal,the domestic foreign commerce corporation.the war assets administration understood the contract of sale to require payment in advance of delivery of the coal.when the corporation insisted instead on depositing the funds upon receipt,the war assets administration considered the contract breached and sold the coal to a third party.the corporation sued in federal court for declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the federal administrator from delivering the coal to the third party,claiming entitlement to the coal under the original contract of sale.
the supreme court considered whether the sovereign immunity of the united states barred the suit against a federal officer.the court acknowledged ex parte young stripping rationale,albeit with no direct citation to that case.
there may be,of course,suits for specific relief against officers of the sovereign which are not suits against the sovereign w here the officer powers are limited by statute,his actions beyond those limitations are considered individual and not sovereign actions his actions are ultra vires his authority and therefore may be made the object of specific relief a second type of case is that in which the statute or order conferring power upon the officer to take action in the sovereign name is claimed to be unconstitutional here,too,the conduct against which specific relief is sought is beyond the officer powers and is,therefore,not the conduct of the sovereign these two types have frequently been recognized by this court as the only ones in which a restraint may be obtained against the conduct of government officials.
larson,at.citing phila.stimson.citing ex parte young see also id.at.under our constitutional system,certain rights are protected against governmental action and,if such rights are infringed by the actions of officers of the government,it is proper that the courts have the power to grant relief against those actions.the stripping rationale did not apply to the administrator because the corporation claim did not show him to have acted outside his authority.see id.at.accordingly,the court held the suit barred by federal sovereign immunity,concluding that the suit was actually against the united states and not its officer.id.at.
given the obvious distinction between our own case and the one just described,the cherokee nation reliance on larson seems curious.unlike the federal officer in larson,who was only alleged to have breached a contract,the tribal officers in our case are said to have violated the thirteenth amendment and the treaty.these allegations bring our case within the stripping rationale set forth in ex parte young and described in larson,such that tribal sovereign immunity should not bar the freedmen suit against the officers of the cherokee nation.
undeterred,the cherokee nation pins its hopes to footnote of the larson opinion,which provides 
of course,a suit may fail,as one against the sovereign,even if it is claimed that the officer being sued has acted unconstitutionally or beyond his statutory powers,if the relief requested can not be granted by merely ordering the cessation of the conduct complained of but will require affirmative action by the sovereign or the disposition of unquestionably sovereign property.north carolina temple.
larson,at.the cherokee nation claims that the freedmen improperly seek affirmative action on the part of tribal officers.the second amended complaint requests an injunction preventing chief smith from holding further elections without a vote of all citizens,including the freedmen.pls.second am.compl.according to the tribe,this injunction would restrain the nation from holding its elections and require the nation to take action to amend its constitution and voting laws to include plaintiffs as citizens with voting rights.cherokee nation br.at.at oral argument,counsel for the tribe said further,what the relief would do is,it would paralyze the nation,it would stop the nation from having any elections,unless the nation took affirmative steps to amend its constitution.oral arg.recording at.citing decisions of our sister circuits,fletcher united states,cir shermoen united states,cir,the tribe tells us that t he ex parte young fiction simply does not survive plaintiffs requested relief.cherokee nation br.at.
whatever the larson court meant when it referred to affirmative action,we conclude that this dicta does not limit the force of ex parte young in the case at hand.we begin with an examination of footnote,a delphic pronouncement that has been the subject of great judicial and scholarly attention.see,knight new york,cir friendly,the larson footnote has become the subject of microscopic scholarly scrutiny.david currie,sovereign immunity and suits against government officers,there was a grain of truth in this wholly gratuitous dictum,but its principal effect was to sow confusion.david shapiro,wrong turns the eleventh amendment and the pennhurst case,harv,referring to the larson court troublesome footnote antonin scalia,sovereign immunity and nonstatutory review of federal administrative action some conclusions from the cases,noting the possible significance of the supreme court failure to cite footnote in malone bowdoin,d,which otherwise relied heavily on larson.we then consider whether the supposed prohibition against affirmative action in footnote reaches the freedmen suit.
before going any further,however,we note that the continuing force of larso
