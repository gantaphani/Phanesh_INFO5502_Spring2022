during the to the presidential election,the commission on presidential debates cpd excluded all candidates from the live audience of the first debate.the excluded candidates complained to the federal election commission,accusing the cpd of violating fec regulations prohibiting organizations from endors ing,support ing,or oppos ing political candidates or political parties.rejecting the complaint,the fec found that the cpd acted not out of any preference for candidates or animus toward candidates,but rather because it feared one or more candidates would disrupt the debate.because we conclude that substantial evidence supports the fec decision,we reverse the district court decision to the contrary and remand with instructions to enter judgment for the fec.
under the federal election campaign act feca,organizations that stage presidential and debates may accept corporate contributions,see b ii f,so long as they do not,in the words of the federal election commission fec implementing regulation,endorse,support,or oppose political candidates or political parties,a.since,presidential and debates have been staged by the commission on presidential debates.formed by the democratic and republican parties,the cpd are frank fahrenkopf,former head of the republican national committee,and paul kirk,former head of the democratic national committee.
under feca,a ny person who believes a violation of the act has occurred,may file a complaint with the fec.a.after reviewing the complaint and providing an opportunity for a response,the commissioners vote on whether they have reason to believe a violation has occurred,id.a.if four of the six commissioners find reason to believe,the fec begins an investigation.id.but if no majority finds reason to believe,the fec dismisses the complaint,and the complainant may seek district court review of whether the dismissal is contrary to law.id.a.
setting the stage for the issue before us,we begin with an earlier challenge to the cpd handling of the debates.only the two major party president al gore and governor george the cpd eligibility criteria for debate participation.several candidates complained to the fec,arguing among other things that the cpd allowed the two major parties to control the debate,depriving candidates of extensive television exposure and media coverage and send ing a signal that the excluded candidates are somehow less credible than the other two candidates invited to the debate.see admin.compl.mur at hereinafter buchanan admin.compl.internal quotation marks omitted.in one of their complaints,the candidates pointed out that the cpd is currently,and has always been chaired by the former chairmen of the rnc and the dnc,that the cpd board of directors is divided among representatives of the democratic and republican parties and includes elected officials from those parties,and that at its inception the republican and democratic parties billed the cpd as a bipartisan organization created to implement joint sponsorship of general election debates by the national republican and democratic committees between their respective nominees.id.at alterations and omissions in original quoting joint press release,dnc and rnc.according to the complaint,this dominance of the cpd combined with the allegedly partisan nature of the eligibility criteria demonstrated that the cpd endorse d,support ed,or oppose d political candidates or political parties,a,rendering it ineligible to stage debates and making illegal its receipt of corporate donations.see buchanan admin.compl.at citing,f see also first counsel report murs,at hereinafter buchanan counsel report.
the fec general counsel,whose report to the fec customarily provides the basis for its action,see fec democratic senatorial campaign,d dscc,and the record on which a court may base a deferential decision,id.quoting democratic senatorial campaign comm.fec,per curiam,found that the challengers had failed to provide evidence that the cpd is controlled by the dnc or the rnc,that any officer or member of the dnc or the rnc is involved in the operation of the cpd,or that the dnc and the rnc had input into the development of the cpd candidate selection criteria for the presidential election cycle.buchanan counsel report at.the general counsel therefore recommended that the fec find no reason to believe that the cpd had violated fec regulations.see id.at.the fec adopted this finding,ending prospects for any further administrative action.see a a.
the complainants sought review in the district court for the district of columbia.see id.although the district court thought that the evidence plaintiffs have marshaled in support is not insubstantial and that the general counsel terse explanation could have been more clear and thorough,it nevertheless upheld the fec,explaining that in the absence of any contemporaneous evidence of influence by the major parties over the debate criteria,the fec found evidence of possible past influence simply insufficient to justify disbelieving the cpd sworn statement and,under the extremely deferential standard of review,the fec is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.buchanan fec,d.the fec,the district court concluded,did not abuse its discretion in finding no reason to believe that the cpd currently is in violation of section a of the fec regulations.id.at.
this brings us,then,to the challenge now before us.saying it feared that green party presidential candidate ralph nader and possibly other candidates might disrupt the first debate,the cpd instructed its ticket takers to deny admission to all such candidates.to ensure that ticket takers would know whom to exclude,the cpd gave them a that included photographs of candidates.
citing their exclusion from the debate audience and claiming they now had the contemporaneous evidence found missing in buchanan,nader and other candidates again complained to the fec.in their complaint,they reiterated the allegations,rejected in the buchanan proceedings by the fec in a ruling upheld by the district court,that the major parties control the cpd.they also argued that while the cpd facilitated campaigning by the major parties during the debates,it explicitly prohibited campaigning by candidates,including the modicum of campaigning purportedly entailed in attending the debates.admin.compl.mur at.in support of this allegation,they cited a deposition statement by cpd general counsel lewis loss that the cpd concern was that if a third party candidate who had not qualified for participation in the debate went to the trouble to get a ticket and attended the debate that it would be for the purpose of campaigning in some way,which seemed to imply the potential for disruption.loss dep.at emphasis added.though neither feca nor fec regulations address the composition of debate audiences,the complainants argued that their evidence demonstrated the cpd support of candidates and its opposition to candidates,making it ineligible to stage debates.see a.in addition to nader,the complainants included his running mate,winona laduke john hagelin,natural law party presidential candidate patrick buchanan,reform party presidential candidate howard phillips,constitution party presidential candidate and the green party of the united states,the constitution party,and the natural law party.throughout this opinion,we shall refer to the complainants collectively as hagelin.
in its response to the hagelin complaint,the cpd asserted that nader and his supporters engaged in conduct that reasonably led cpd to be concerned about the risk of disruption of the live debate.cpd resp.at.such conduct included large rallies at which the rallying cry was let ralph debate,public statements by nader strongly suggesting that he sought to disrupt the boston debate,and protests and a at the cpd offices by nader supporters.id.in conclusion the cpd argued 
i t is evident that the decision alleged in the complaint was made for the purpose of preventing disruption of the live international television broadcast of the debate indeed,the very testimony cited in the complaint makes plain that the cpd,having determined the participants in its debates by lawful proces
