anonymous pamphlets,leaflets,brochures and even books have played an important role in the progress of mankind.persecuted groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and laws either anonymously or not at all even the federalist papers,written in favor of the adoption of our constitution,were published under fictitious names.it is plain that anonymity has sometimes been assumed for the most constructive purposes.
talley california,d.
we are asked in this case to rule on the constitutionality of a nevada statute that requires certain groups or entities publishing any material or information relating to an election,candidate or any question on a ballot to reveal on the publication the names and addresses of the publications financial sponsors.after the district court found no constitutional infirmities,we remanded for a determination of plaintiffs standing.now satisfied that standing has been established,we hold that the statutory provision is facially unconstitutional because it violates the free speech clause of the first amendment,as explicated by mcintyre ohio elections commission,d.
background 
nevada revised statutes requires persons either paying for or responsible for paying for the publication of any material or information relating to an election,candidate or any question on a ballot to identify their names and addresses on any published printed or written matter or any photograph.advertising by candidates and political parties is exempted if the advertising refers only to a candidate and displays his or her name prominently.in addition,if monies used for a publication have been reported by the candidate as a campaign contribution,then he or she may approve and pay for that publication without being subject to the nevada statute requirements.
in mcintyre,the supreme court addressed the validity of an ohio statute prohibiting the distribution of written political communications unless the publication contained the name and address of the chairman,treasurer,or secretary of the organization issuing the same,or the person who issues,makes,or is responsible therefor.mcintyre,at.margaret mcintyre had distributed leaflets,attributed to concerned parents and tax payers,regarding an imminent referendum on the school tax levy,which was scheduled to be discussed at the meeting.id.at.there was no suggestion that the text of her message was false,misleading,or libelous except for the help provided by her son and a friend,who placed some of the leaflets on car windshields in the school parking lot,mcintyre acted independently.id.at.the court struck down ohio statutory provision,describing it as a regulation of pure speech,a direct regulation of the content of speech.id.at.
in,nevada amended,originally enacted in,in an effort to respond to mcintyre.the amendment added only an exception for a natural person who acts independently and not in cooperation with or pursuant to any direction from a business or social organization,nongovernmental legal entity or governmental entity.c 
the american civil liberties union of nevada and its executive director,gary peck,together aclun brought this first amendment facial overbreadth challenge to the nevada statute.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the state defendants,reasoning that 
this statute protects the integrity of the election process by promoting truthfulness in campaign advertising.this statute is also important in increasing the wealth of information available to the electorate.the state of nevada interest in preserving the integrity of the election process by preventing actual and perceived corruption has been found to be a compelling state interest by the united states supreme court.
the aclun appealed.in an unpublished order,we remanded the case because the pleadings and record did not demonstrate that the plaintiffs had standing to bring this suit on remand,the district court found that the aclun second amended complaint the complaint did establish article iii standing because the aclun alleged in the complaint specific instances in which the organization wished to engage in speech but refrained from doing so for fear of being prosecuted under the nevada statute.
on the present record,the aclu of nevada,suing for itself and on behalf of its members,and gary peck,as one of its members,satisfy article iii standing requirements.standing requires plaintiffs to demonstrate injuries that are actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,d quotation marks and citation omitted.we recently explained in the first amendment context that it is sufficient for standing purposes that the plaintiff intends to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest and that there is a credible threat that the challenged provision will be invoked against the plaintiff.right to life political action comm.bayless,cir quotation marks and citation omitted see also cal.council,getman,cir describing the constitutionally recognized injury of.
the present complaint alleges that the nevada statute has already prohibited and continues to restrict the protected speech of the aclun,its members,gary peck,and other parties,and provides examples of such restrictions.as found by the district court,
the aclun indicated that its members wished to engage in anonymous did not on account of nrs regard to an upcoming city of las vegas referendum concerning pay raises for the city council and mayor and a city of north las vegas ballot initiative concerning public comment at city council meetings.specifically,aclun members wish to engage in coordinated efforts of anonymous political speech,that is,anonymous speech in conjunction with the social organization of which they are a part,which is prohibited by nrs.
similarly,aclun members had wanted to engage in the production and distribution of anonymous political flyers on various ballot initiatives in the election but did not for fear of prosecution under nrs.the aclun also demonstrated that its members have previously been prosecuted for violations of the statute.
the complaint states that the aclun was prevented from anonymous involvement with literature concerning ballot initiatives,because,u nder nrs,it would have been unlawful for the aclun to be involved with groups opposing a las vegas redistricting plan in a public information campaign concerning this issue,as it related to the upcoming election,unless the aclun had its name on all written material dispensed to the public.
plaintiffs also introduced affidavits by peck and another aclun member,tom skancke,who was prosecuted for violations of nrs.peck affidavit describes,with reference to recent nevada elections and ballot initiatives,his wish contrary to the provisions of nrs,to involve himself with organizations speaking out on a ballot initiative issue,including the production and distribution of flyers,without attaching his name so as not to create an appearance that his personal opinion represents the official position of the aclun.peck added that aclun members who have expressed a desire to engage in anonymous political speech wish to do so not only as natural persons acting independently,but also as participants acting in concert and cooperation with other persons and groups,as prohibited by nrs.
the complaint also alleges an intent to continue to engage in conduct barred by the nevada statute in the future.the complaint states that t he aclun and its members have also been involved with various groups who have in the past,and plan in the future,to circulate petitions to place certain referendum measures on statewide or local ballots,and that nrs has and continues to discourage aclun and its members from engaging in anonymous political speech critical of elected officials and of the election process itself.emphases added.as a result,alleges the complaint,the aclun and its members will continue to be forced to choose to concerning past and present matters,but also those that will inevitably arise in the future.emphases added.
in first amendment cases,i t is sufficient for standing purposes that the plaintiff intends to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest and that there is a credible threat that the challenged provision will be invoked against the plaintiff.lso,stroh,cir.the complaint meets that standard.
both the aclun,as an organization and on behalf of its members,and peck,one of its members,have thus alleged concrete and particularized injury stemming from the challenged statute.see lujan,at.see also warth seldin,d there is no question that an association may have standing in its own right to seek judicial relief from injury to itself and to vindicate whatever rights and immunities the association itself may enjoy.the complaint description of the aclun encounters and those of its members with the challenged nevada statutory provision therefore amply justify the district court standing determination.
narrowing construction 
nevada argues that should be construed to apply only to express advocacy.such a limited interpretation,nevada contends,would cure any overbreadth concerns.relying on our decision in fec furgatch,cir,the state regards express advocacy as that speech which is directed to influence a particular outcome of an election,as opposed to issue advocacy that focuses on the merits of a particular issue without regard for an election outcome.furgatch definition of express advocacy as the term appears in the federal election campaign act of feca,et,included speech that must,when read as a whole,and with limited reference to external events,be susceptible of no other reasonable interpretation but as an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.at.
nevada argument was made before the supreme court decision in mcconnell fec,d.mcconnell stated that,despite the emphasis on express advocacy in buckley valeo,d,with regard to the scope of the reporting and disclosure requirements of feca,the express advocacy restriction was an endpoint of statutory interpretation,not a first principle of constitutional law.mcconnell.at.after mcconnell,the line between express and all other speech is not constitutionally material,as the court was not persuaded that the first amendment erects a rigid barrier between express advocacy and issue advocacy.id.at see also id.at rejecting the notion that the first amendment requires congress to treat issue advocacy differently from express advocacy.
a limitation of the nevada statute to express advocacy,whether defined in accord with our decision in furgatch,or more narrowly,see cal.council,at discussing the distinction between the magic words and the furgatch approaches to defining express advocacy,would therefore likely not have any determinative impact on our evaluation of the statute constitutional validity.nevertheless,as stated recently by the sixth circuit,mcconnell left intact the ability of courts to make distinctions between express advocacy and issue advocacy,where such distinctions are necessary to cure vagueness and in statutes which regulate more speech than that for which the legislature has established a significant governmental interest.anderson spear,cir.by addressing nevada proffered limitation of the statute reach to express advocacy,we can begin to illuminate the narrow tailoring concerns that will recur in this opinion.we therefore start by responding to nevada contentions that this court should apply a narrowing construction of,or,alternatively,that it is appropriate for us to certify the question to the nevada supreme court 
federal courts are without power to adopt a narrowing construction of a state statute unless such a construction is reasonable and readily apparent.stenberg carhart,d quoting boos barry,d.according to its text,the nevada statute applies to any material or information relating to an election,candidate or any question on a ballot.an interpretation of this language to apply only to express advocacy concerning a candidate or ballot question is not readily apparent from the statute itself.the language of is not limited to advocacy,much less express advocacy.
the nevada statute applies to information,not a term that suggests any kind of exhortation to action.information has been understood in constitutional jurisprudence to refer to matters of fact rather than advocacy.see,schneider new jersey.repeatedly using the phrase information or opinion,as in the freedom to speak,write,print or distribute information or opinion.
the nevada statute,moreover,applies to material or information relating to an election,candidate or any question on a ballot.emphasis added.as such,the language reaches objective publications that concern any aspect of an election,candidate,or ballot,for example,discussions of election procedures,analyses of polling results,and nonpartisan drives,such as those conducted by the league of women voters.
further,other provisions of nevada revised statutes title,elections,make clear that the legislature explicitly uses language to indicate a limitation to advocacy speech when it intends such a limitation.see.referring in part to expenditures made to advocate expressly the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate or group of candidates regulating e very person or group of persons organized formally or informally who advocates the passage or defeat of a question or group of questions on the ballot same.the existence of these provisions provides context for our reading of,which is conspicuous in its failure to contain such limiting language.
we therefore can not adopt a construction of the statute limiting its reach to express advocacy,however advocacy is defined.for similar reasons,we also decline to certify a question to the nevada supreme court.certification of a question is appropriate only where the statute is fairly susceptible to a narrowing construction.stenberg,at.as already discussed,the nevada statute is not so susceptible 
the nevada statute language indicates clearly what the legislature sought to accomplish.that language is not fairly susceptible to the narrowing construction proposed by nevada,and the question of an express advocacy limitation,even if it is relevant after mcconnell,is not one that is appropriate to certify to the nevada supreme court.see stenberg,at.we therefore decline to construe the nevada statute to encompass only express advocacy,or to certify the issue to the nevada supreme court.
the first amendment 
critical to our first amendment analysis,as will appear,is the central similarity between this case and mcintyre both involve campaign statutes that go beyond requiring the reporting of funds used to finance speech to affect the content of the communication itself.this case and mcintyre therefore involve governmental proscription of the speech itself unless it conforms to prescribed criteria.this distinction between direct regulation of the content of political speech and requiring the later reporting of the funding of speech has not always been given weight in some of the case law yet while the supreme court recent opinion in mcconnell casts new light on some other aspects of the first amendment principles applicable to regulation of speech,nothing in mcconnell undermines mcintyre understanding that proscribing the content of an election communication is a form of regulation of campaign activity subject to traditional strict scrutiny we therefore begin with mcintyre,which remains fully governing law.
after noting and explicating the respected tradition of anonymity in the advocacy of political causes,mcintyre,at,mcintyre underscored that the speech in which mcintyre out leaflets in the advocacy of a politically controversial the essence of first amendment expression.id.at.no form of speech is entitled to greater constitutional protection than mcintyre.id.requiring a political communication to contain information concerning the identity of the speaker is no different from requiring the inclusion of other components of the document content that the author is free to include or exclude.id.at.
mcintyre then explained that there are two distinct reasons why forbidding anonymous political speech is a serious,direct intrusion on first amendment values first,t he decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation,by concern about social ostracism,or merely by a desire to preserve as much of one privacy as possible.id.at.second,
an advocate may believe her ideas will be more persuasive if her readers are unaware of her identity.anonymity thereby provides a way for a writer who may be personally unpopular to ensure that readers will not prejudge her message simply because they do not like its proponent.thus,even in the field of political rhetoric,where the identity of the speaker is an important component of many attempts to persuade,city of ladue gilleo,d footnote omitted,the most effective advocates have sometimes opted for anonymity.
id.at.we,too,following mcintyre,have recognized that d epriving individuals of this anonymity is a broad intrusion,discouraging truthful,accurate speech by those unwilling to disclose their identities and applying regardless of the character or strength of an individual interest in anonymity.initiatives now rippie,cir quoting am.const.law.found.meyer,cir second alteration in original.
the nevada statute here at issue is,in almost all pertinent respects,similar to the statute invalidated in mcintyre.indeed,in one important way the nevada statute before us is broader in restricting speech than the ohio statute at issue in mcintyre the nevada statute,like the ohio statute,covers both candidate and issue elections,but the ohio statute was limited to publications designed to promote the nomination or election or defeat of a candidate or to promote the adoption or defeat of any issue,or to influence the voters in any election mcintyre,at.the nevada statute,in contrast,reaches any material or information relating to an election,candidate or any question on a ballot.emphasis added.nevada nonetheless maintains that there are sufficient differences in coverage and purpose to render the nevada statute valid,mcintyre notwithstanding.we disagree.
mcintyre and the individual 
nevada primary submission is that,because the statute now contains an exemption for a natural person acting independently and without the cooperation of,inter alia,any business or social organization,it would not apply to the fact situation in mcintyre and is therefore constitutional.
the court in mcintyre did stress the particular harshness of ohio punishment of mcintyre as the sole advocate for her cause.but nothing in the decision indicates that if she had been allied with other individuals,or with a business or social organization,the result would have been different.the anonymity protected by mcintyre is not that of a single cloak.
although we do not think the precise scope of the natural person exception in the nevada statute is of dispositive import,it is worth noting at the outset that it is exceedingly narrow.first,the exception applies only to a natural person,acting both independently and not in cooperation with or pursuant to any direction from several kinds of organizations and entities.so two or more individuals working together,although not in conjunction with any organization,are required to disclose their identities on any publication,as is a single individual cooperating with an organization.
second,as defined in the statute,a business or social organization is distinct from a nongovernmental legal entity.defining person to include a ny form of business or social organization or a ny nongovernmental legal entity.the latter is defined as including,without limitation,a corporation,partnership,association,trust,unincorporated organization,labor union,committee for political action,political party and committee sponsored by a political party id.at.as most formal or permanent groups of individuals could be described as association s and unincorporated organization s,the separate category,any form of business or social organization,must cover temporary and informal,loosely affiliated groups.
the reasons given by mcintyre for protecting anonymous speech apply regardless of whether an individual,a group of individuals,or an informal business or social organization is speaking.two or more individuals working together or with informal social organizations or more formal associations can harbor fear of economic or official retaliation,or concern about social ostracism,mcintyre,at,just as can lone individuals.
similarly,just as a lone advocate may believe her ideas will be more persuasive if her readers are unaware of her identity,because readers may otherwise prejudge her message simply because they do not like its proponent,id.at.citation omitted,so,too,groups or individuals working in cooperation with groups may be concerned about readers prejudging the substance of a message by associating their names with the message.in fact,groups are more likely to be associated with a certain viewpoint than are individuals,greenpeace,the aclu,the national rifle association.so a particular group concern that its message may be prejudged based on its association with the group could be even more than an individual similar concern.anonymity may allow speakers to communicate their message when preconceived prejudices concerning the,if identified,would alter the reader receptiveness to the substance of the message.like other and format decisions,the presence or absence of information identifying the speaker is no less a content choice for a group or an individual cooperating with a group than it is for an individual speaking alone.
the court in mcintyre also recognized that the choice to speak anonymously may be motivated by a desire to preserve as much of one privacy as possible.id.at.see also id.at.a written a often a personally crafted statement of a political viewpoint i dentification of the author against her will is particularly intrusive it reveals unmistakably the content of her thoughts on a controversial issue.this basis for protecting anonymous speech does not apply as clearly to groups as it does to individuals.a group as a whole lacks the same personal interest in its thoughts.id.at.nonetheless,the fact that individuals in a group,or an individual cooperating with a group,have shared their political thoughts with the members of the group does not mean that they have no privacy interest in concealing from the general public their endorsement of those beliefs.this observation has particular force when the group is small enough that readers will associate individual members with the thoughts conveyed.exposing the identity of the group publishing its views,or of an individual publishing the views of a group,thus infringes to some degree on the privacy interests of the individuals affiliated with the group 
finally,although the court in mcintyre referred to individuals acting independently and using only their own modest resources,at,we think it doubtful that the court used independently to mean individually.that would have been redundant.independence,in this context of campaign regulation,usually refers to the absence of ties between someone like mcintyre or ten allied mcintyres and a political campaign.see,the term independent expenditure means an expenditure by a person a expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate and b that is not made in concert or cooperation with or at the request or suggestion of such candidate,the candidate authorized political committee,or their agents,or a political party committee or its agents.as to modest resources,the nevada statute has no financial threshold it requires identification of the person who paid for or is responsible for the publication,even if the only cost is for paper,pen,and ink and it applies even where a natural person pays for the publication,if that person cooperates with a business or social organization in doing so.
in short,the nevada statute,like the ohio statute in mcintyre,applies to circumstances in which the interests in circulation of anonymous communications are at their strongest.we therefore reject nevada proposed limitation of the holding in mcintyre to communications for which an individual working entirely alone is responsible 
government interests in regulating speech 
quite aside from the suggestion that the natural person exception saves the statute,the state maintains that its interests are different from and stronger than those relied upon by ohio in mcintyre.we have considered carefully nevada submissions,as well as the case law upon which nevada relies,mcconnell included.although the cases,including mcconnell,indicate a fairly wide berth for state reporting and disclosure statutes promoting interests similar to those upon which nevada here relies,those later cases do not support the validity of a statute based on the asserted governmental interests nevada asks us to consider.
the constitutionally determinative distinction between identity disclosure requirements and reporting requirements has been noted and relied upon both by the supreme court and by this circuit.in buckley american constitutional law foundation,d,for example,the supreme court was presented with a challenge to colorado regulation of circulators.one of the challenged provisions required paid circulators to wear an identification badge,indicating the circulator name and the name and number of the circulator employer.id.at.the state interest in requiring the badges was to enable the public to identify,and the state to apprehend,petition circulators who engage in misconduct.id.at.a second provision,not challenged in the supreme court,required each circulator to complete and attach an affidavit to every petition,stating,among other information,the circulator name and address.id.at.this affidavit was then filed with the secretary of state along with the completed petition.id.at.
although both provisions required the circulator to reveal his or her name,the court struck down the badge requirement,contrasting it with the affidavit requirement 
while the affidavit reveals the name of the petition circulator and is a public record,it is tuned to the speaker interest as well as the state.unlike a name badge worn at the time a circulator is soliciting signatures,the affidavit is separated from the moment the circulator speaks t he name badge requirement forces circulators to reveal their identities at the same time they deliver their political message it operates when reaction to the circulator message is immediate and may be the most intense,emotional,and unreasoned.the affidavit,in contrast,does not expose the circulator to the risk of heat of the moment harassment.
id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted.in other words,it is not just that a speaker identity is revealed,but how and when that identity is revealed,that matters in a first amendment analysis of a state regulation of political speech.see.initiatives now,at even when it does not have the effect of facilitating harassment,the requirement of disclosure of the names and addresses of paid circulators chills speech by inclining individuals toward silence.
this distinction between requiring a speaker to reveal her identity while speaking and requiring her to reveal it in an reporting submission to a governmental agency was also recognized in mcintyre.there,the supreme court noted 
true,in a portion of the buckley valeo opinion we expressed approval of a requirement that independent expenditures in excess of a threshold level be reported to the federal election commission.but that requirement entailed nothing more than an identification to the commission of the amount and use of money expended in support of a candidate.though such mandatory reporting undeniably impedes protected first amendment activity,the intrusion is a far cry from compelled on all election related writings.a written a often a personally crafted statement of a political viewpoint as such,identification of the author against her will is particularly intrusive it reveals unmistakably the content of her thoughts on a controversial issue.disclosure of an expenditure and its use,without more,reveals far less information.it may be information that a person prefers to keep secret,and undoubtedly it often gives away something about the spender political views.nonetheless,even though money may talk,its speech is less specific,less personal,and less provocative than a as a result,when money supports an unpopular viewpoint it is less likely to precipitate retaliation.
at.see also cal.council,at citing mcintyre and noting the distinction between prohibiting the distribution of anonymous literature and the mandatory disclosure of expenditures and contributions emphasis in original.
as these precedents indicate,requiring a publisher to reveal her identity on her communication is considerably more intrusive than simply requiring her to report to a government agency for later publication how she spent her money.the former necessarily connects the speaker to a particular message directly,while the latter may simply expose the fact that the speaker spoke.see majors ii,at recognizing that the statutory provisions requiring mandatory identification related to electioneering communications that mcconnell upheld do not even require identifying the specific ads financed by the reporting contributor.statutes like the one here at issue and the ohio statute in mcintyre,consequently,must be,and have been,viewed as serious,direct proscription of political speech if certain content appears on the communication,it may be circulated if the content is absent,the communication is illegal and may not be circulated.
as a limitation on core political speech,the nevada statute must receive the most exacting scrutiny under the first amendment.mcintyre,at.quoting meyer grant,d see also mcconnell.at citing riley fed of the blind,d,for the proposition that a regulation that alters or impairs the political message is subject to strict scrutiny.such restriction will survive strict scrutiny only if it is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest.mcintyre,at.more specifically,a regulation of constitutionally protected speech must use the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest.foti city of menlo park,cir.
nevada offers three pertinent state interests,contending that they are sufficiently compelling to justify restrictions,and that the statute is sufficiently narrowly tailored to further these interests.nevada argues that w hether the identity of the author would help evaluate the usefulness of the information makes this case different from mcintyre mcintyre left open the possibility that preventing fraud and libel may be a valid compelling interest during the course of an election and the state interest in the enforcement of disclosure and contribution election laws is furthered by.we examine these three governmental interests in turn,with particular attention to the details of nevada overall scheme of regulating election campaigns.
information 
nevada argues that is justified as a measure to aid prospective voters in evaluating information provided to them.in mcintyre,the court firmly rejected ohio proffered justification that its statute served the purpose of more thoroughly informing the electorate than would otherwise be the case 
the simple interest in providing voters with additional relevant information does not justify a state requirement that a writer make statements or disclosures she would otherwise omit.moreover,in the case of a handbill written by a private citizen who is not known to the recipient,the name and address of the author add little,if anything,to the reader ability to evaluate the document message.thus,ohio informational interest is plainly insufficient to support the constitutionality of its disclosure requirement.
mcintyre,at.
we perceive no relevant distinction between mcintyre and this case that would support the constitutionality of the nevada statute on the ground that the statute,as the state claims,foster s an informed electorate.in fact,the impact of the statute may be quite the opposite.the premise of mcintyre is that if anonymous speech is banned,some useful speech will go unsaid.given the breadth of the nevada statute particular,its inclusion of information related to an likely result is all the more serious.as the aclun correctly points out,under the statute,a nonymous statements,even if true,that allege voter disenfranchisement or bias in how different voters are treated are banned by the nevada law.the result could be a,not a,electorate.
that the nevada statute contains a natural person exception does not affect this analysis,for two reasons 
first,the nevada statute still requires individual private citizens who publish any material in cooperation with an organization or governmental or nongovernmental entity to include their names and addresses.an aclu member,for example,who discusses an issue before the electorate on a ballot initiative at an aclu meeting and then volunteers to compose,publish,and circulate a flyer concerning the organization views on the matter is required to put her name,not the aclu,on the document.see.a b.that a certain,unknown individual supplied the paper,computer,and time involved in producing a given communication add s little,if anything,to the reader ability to evaluate the document.mcintyre,at.
second,in many instances,requiring publishers to include the names of business or social organizations or legal entities responsible for publishing an communication is unlikely to supply much useful information.as the court noted in mcconnell,individuals and entities interested in funding speech often join together in ad hoc organizations with creative but misleading names.at listing examples of such mysterious sponsors of issue ads as american family voices and coalition to make our voices heard.while reporting and disclosure requirements can expose the actual contributors to such groups and thereby provide useful information concerning the interests supporting or opposing a ballot proposition or a candidate,simply supplying the name and address of the organization on the communication itself does not provide useful that is all the nevada statute requires.
moreover,and more fundamentally,one premise of mcintyre and the line of first amendment cases concerning anonymous speech upon which mcintyre relies is that,far from enhancing the reader evaluation of a message,identifying the publisher can interfere with that evaluation by requiring the introduction of potentially extraneous information at the very time the reader encounters the substance of the message.as mcintyre stated after reviewing the illustrious role of anonymous and pseudonymous communications in our history and that of other nations of course,the identity of the source is helpful in evaluating ideas.but the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.at.quotation marks and citations omitted.the simple interest in providing voters with additional relevant information does not justify a state requirement that a writer make statements or disclosures she would otherwise omit.id.at.
we reiterate that mcintyre evaluation of the inadequacy of a pure information rationale,and ours,pertain only to requirements that the disclosure be included on the communication itself.campaign regulation requiring reporting of expenditures made to finance communications does not involve the direct alteration of the content of a communication.such reporting requirements also serve considerably more effectively the goal of informing the electorate of the individuals and organizations supporting a particular candidate or ballot proposition.see,cal.council,at suggesting that california may well have a compelling interest in informing its voters of the source and amount of funds expended on express advocacy via contribution and expenditure reporting requirements.compared to requirements such as the one imposed by the nevada statute,the imposition on freedom of speech of such reporting requirements is less,while the fit between the regulation and the interest it serves is superior.
that reporting and disclosure requirements have been consistently upheld as comporting with the first amendment based on the importance of providing information to the electorate therefore supports rather than detracts from our conclusion that mcintyre rejection of the additional information rationale remains binding on us.see buckley am.const.law,at.this notarized submission stating the names of petition circulators,available to law enforcers,renders less needful the state provision for personal names on identification badges.emphasis added.the availability of the less reporting and disclosure requirement confirms that a statute like the one here at issue can not survive the applicable narrow tailoring standard.
the state first claimed interest supporting is therefore not sufficiently compelling to justify the nevada statute.
nor does nevada interest in combating sham advocacy justify,in light of mcintyre.the nevada statute,like the ohio provision struck down in mcintyre,covers both true and false speech,relating to both candidate and ballot elections.
in mcintyre,ohio representations regarding its fraud interest were inadequate to render the considerably narrower statute there at issue constitutional 
ohio has not shown that its interest in preventing the misuse of anonymous speech justifies a prohibition of all uses of that speech.the state may,and does,punish fraud directly.but it can not seek to punish fraud indirectly by indiscriminately outlawing a category of speech,based on its content,with no necessary relationship to the danger sought to be prevented.one would be hard pressed to think of a better example of the pitfalls of ohio approach than the facts of the case before us.
id.at.see also riley fed of the blind,d in striking down this portion of the act,we do not suggest that states must sit idly by and allow their citizens to be defrauded.north carolina has an antifraud law,and we presume that law enforcement officers are ready and able to enforce it.further,north carolina may constitutionally require fundraisers to disclose certain financial information to the state if this is not the most efficient means of preventing fraud,we reaffirm simply and emphatically that the first amendment does not permit the state to sacrifice speech for efficiency.citation omitted.
mcintyre did recognize that during election campaigns,the state interest in preventing fraud and libel carries special weight.at.but the court prohibited ohio from using identity disclosure regulations during election campaigns as an aid to enforcement of the specific prohibitions and as a deterrent to the making of false statements by unscrupulous prevaricators.id.at.
in any event,the nevada statute is not limited to speech during election campaigns when false statements,if credited,may have serious adverse consequences for the public at large.mcintyre,at.as the state itself noted,would have prevented an anonymous mailing many months before a general election in response to an elected official vote in favor of a casino.nevada representation demonstrates that speech subject to the statute compelled requirement can be far removed from the thrust and parry of election campaigns.instead,the nevada statute could prevent speech well before,and long after,a campaign is underway.mcconnell.at finding certain statutory provisions applying to activity that occurs within days before a federal election reasonably tailored,with various temporal and substantive limitations designed to focus the regulations on the important interests to be served emphasis added id.at noting that statutory definition of electioneering communications,for which disclosure requirements were upheld,includes time limitations of either or days before an election.
moreover,the nevada statute is not only temporally to the special concerns regarding fraud during an election campaign but substantively as well.the statute applies to communications made with neither the intent nor the effect of influencing any election.an academic paper analyzing opinion polls regarding an upcoming election could be a publication of information relating to an election,requiring inclusion of the source of any grants supporting the research.nor is there is any requirement that any member of the pertinent electorate be exposed to,or influenced by,the publication.mcconnell.at new feca f c further provides that a communication is targeted to the relevant electorate if it can be received by or more persons in the district or state the candidate seeks to represent.for this reason as well,the nevada statute is not narrowly tailored to reach only that speech necessary to further its asserted interest in discouraging the impact of fraud on election results.
nevada also posits that its statute is narrowly tailored to protect candidates from unscrupulous attacks by requiring that those who seek to mislead the electorate into thinking that the candidate has taken certain positions disclose their identity.we disagree.far more speech,such as speech in no way misleading,is affected by than necessary to protect candidates from others playing ventriloquist.majors i,at.
additionally,the statute contains exceptions for communications by candidates and political parties.see,infra.no reason appears why candidates and political parties are less likely to engage in fraud than other groups and entities if anything,one would expect the opposite to be the case.for this reason as well,the statute forwards the asserted interest in fraud prevention poorly if at all.
in sum,mcintyre concern for fraud and libel prevention during election campaigns can not serve to justify the nevada statute intrusion on speech,due to the extremely broad purview of the statute.section is not limited to speech during election campaigns,but covers all publications relating to an election,candidate or any question on a ballot.it covers ballot proposition elections,in which libel is a remote concern.it is riddled with exceptions that do not comport with the asserted interest in fraud prevention.the information it requires is unlikely to be of any real assistance to voters.
the state has therefore not established that is narrowly tailored to further its interest in fraud prevention.
iii.campaign finance 
nevada posits a third state interest the enforcement of disclosure and contribution election laws.nevada argues that directly advances the state ability to investigate and enforce other campaign finance laws that are,in fact,constitutional.to evaluate such an argument,one must pay close attention to the relationship between the challenged regulation and the particular set of laws it purportedly helps to enforce.we therefore begin by looking closely at nevada campaign reporting requirements.
nevada election laws include the following reporting requirements every person who is not under the direction or control of a candidate for office must report to the secretary of state campaign contributions received in excess of,and expenditures made on behalf of a candidate for office.every person who advocates the passage or defeat of a question on the ballot must report to the secretary of state campaign contributions received in excess of.every person who is not under the direction or control of a candidate for an office must report to the secretary of state expenditures made on behalf of the candidate in excess of.every person or group of persons organized formally or informally who advocates the passage or defeat of a question on the ballot must report to the secretary of state expenditures made on behalf of or against the question on the ballot in excess of.
because of the dichotomy established in the case law between regulation of elections and regulation of candidate elections,and because the nevada statute applies to both varieties of elections,we are confronted by the initial question of whether the reporting requirements pertaining to advocacy themselves are constitutional.if nevada entire regulation of advocacy were unconstitutional,then enforcing such unconstitutional election laws could not possibly constitute a compelling state interest.
california council getman stated that w hether a state may regulate speech advocating the defeat or passage of a ballot measure is an issue of first impression in the federal courts of appeal,at,as opposed to the regulation of speech advocating the defeat or election of a candidate in california council,the court did not decide whether california had the requisite compelling interest in regulating advocacy by imposing a reporting requirement on those engaged in it,but instead held that such speech was not absolutely protected,and therefore may be regulated if the state regulation passes strict scrutiny.id.at.
we do not need to go any further than california council in deciding whether reporting requirements like nevada are constitutional.even if the reporting requirements are constitutional,and even if the state interest in enforcing those reporting requirements is overriding,we conclude,for a number of reasons,that nevada identity disclosure requirement is not narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of enforcing the reporting requirements.
first,nevada reporting requirements themselves largely belie the asserted governmental enforcement interest in requiring identification.the identity disclosure requirement does not apply to any candidate or to the political party of that candidate which pays for or is responsible for paying for any billboard,sign or other form of advertisement which refers only to that candidate and in which the candidate name is prominently displayed.a.also,disclosure is not required i f the material is expressly approved and paid for by the candidate and the cost of preparation and publishing has been reported by the candidate as a campaign contribution pursuant to nrs.b.so,far from aiding in the enforcement of the disclosure requirement,the statute excludes many of the most important instances in which reporting is required and makes reporting a substitute for identification in some instances.
even in those situations where the identification requirements might assist the state in enforcing the other campaign finance statutes,the nevada statute does not match up with those statutes.for one thing,requires no statement of how much money was contributed to produce a publication and contains no financial threshold.it thus affects a person spending,like mcintyre,in the same manner as a person spending million.as stated by the aclun,under the nevada statute an anonymous flyer created by a single rich individual for a million dollars is permitted while a small group that can raise a few hundred dollars for an anonymous political flyer is in violation.mcconnell.at challenged amendments to feca mandate disclosure only if and when a person makes disbursements totaling more than in any calendar year to pay for electioneering communications.
buckley valeo recognized that an anonymous political advertisement may be a surreptitious campaign finance violation.at.section,however,has no disclosure requirements beyond the sacrifice of anonymity.one can not tell from an accurate disclosure mandated by the statute whether the cost of producing the communication later reported by an organization or entity bears any resemblance to reality,or even whether the person identified has a reporting obligation at all or is instead below the financial threshold for reporting.moreover,nevada has not explained why a group willing to violate the reporting and disclosure laws by failing accurately to report its expenditures would not be willing to violate as well,by including no identifying information or inaccurate identifying information.the assistance provided by the nevada statute toward enforcing the campaign finance laws is therefore minimal.initiatives now,at the state interest in educating voters through campaign finance disclosure is more adequately served by a panoply of the state other requirements that have not been challenged.
section also covers far more speech than is necessary to publicize the identities of people otherwise subject to financial reporting requirements under the core provisions of nevada campaign finance law.section,for instance,requires for designated annual periods that 
every person who is not under the direction or control of a candidate for an office at a primary election,primary city election,general election or general city election,of a group of such candidates or of any person involved in the campaign of that candidate or group who makes an expenditure on behalf of the candidate or group which is not solicited or approved by the candidate or group,and every committee for political action,political party or committee sponsored by a political party which makes an expenditure on behalf of such a candidate or group of candidates shall report each expenditure made during the period on behalf of the candidate,the group of candidates or a candidate in the group of candidates in excess of 
emphasis added section,however,reaches speech in addition to that covered by the reporting and disclosure requirements.as noted,the statute has no minimum spending requirement,so it covers communications that need not be reported.and the statute,as also noted,pertains to expression regardless of whether it is on behalf of a candidate or ballot question,although such neutral communications need not be reported under nevada law.section,for example,would require the publishers of two flyers costing more than,one stating spoil your ballots they all crooks and the other vote for jones,to include their names,while the publishers of the former would not have to report their expenditure under because it is not on behalf of any candidate.
our decision in arizona right to life political action committee bayless provides a helpful analogue for assessing the adequacy in this regard of the fit between the nevada statute and its asserted purpose as an aid to enforcement of other campaign finance regulation.bayless addressed the constitutionality of an arizona statute that required political action committees pac s to give advance notice before engaging in certain types of political speech within ten days before an election.the court found the statute not narrowly tailored as a means of addressing arizona proffered concerns about informing its electorate and avoiding corruption or the appearance of corruption in the political process.see at.in its analysis,bayless aptly demonstrated why a statute such as nevada fails to satisfy the required fit between core political speech restriction and compelling state interests 
t he statute is because it is not limited to negative campaigning but rather reaches all of a pac independent expenditures that advocate for or against the election of any candidate.because the notice requirement applies even if the expenditure merely paid for vanilla advertisements advocating vote for smith,or freedom lovers for our senator,a burdens innocuous speech that does not even implicate the statute stated purpose.
id.at citing grossman city of portland,cir.similarly,the nevada statute does not comply with the narrow tailoring requirement,as it reaches a substantial quantity of speech not subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements it purportedly helps to enforce.
further contributing to the lack of narrow tailoring with regard to the asserted campaign finance regulation purpose is the nevada statute failure to limit its proscription on anonymous speech to a designated time period.in mcintyre,the court noted that ohio statute applies not only to leaflets distributed on the eve of an election,when the opportunity for reply is limited,but also to those distributed months in advance.at.see also id.at.commenting with disapproval on the temporal breadth of the ohio statute.a properly statute might cure some of the of the nevada statute as an aid to enforcement of other campaign finance regulations,by focusing on the speech as to which the public interest in obtaining complete and timely disclosure is greatest.in the absence of any temporal limitation,however,the nevada statute broad ban on anonymous speech is all the more,and does not meet the applicable exacting scrutiny required.
in sum,nevada presentation of as a salutary means of ensuring campaign financial disclosure is entirely unconvincing in light of the particulars of nevada overall scheme of campaign finance regulation.the statute plainly is not its principal weapon against campaign finance abuses,mcintyre,at,indeed,any effective weapon at is therefore not narrowly tailored to the state interest.
our conclusion that the nevada statute at issue here is not narrowly tailored to assist the state in enforcing other campaign finance laws should not in any way suggest that an identification requirement could never be narrowly tailored to achieve this goal.as we have developed,nevada statute is particularly for this purpose.an identification requirement carefully tailored to further a state campaign finance laws,or to prevent the corruption of public officials,could well pass constitutional muster.nevada statute,however,is simply not a viable example of such legislation.
the upshot is that none of nevada three proffered governmental interests suffices to outweigh the significant first amendment protection of anonymity accorded by mcintyre.
decisions since mcintyre 
none of the case law subsequent to mcintyre persuades us that we are wrong in our assessment that the nevada statute can not be sustained under that precedent.
two state supreme court decisions upheld anonymous campaign speech statutes after mcintyre.see seymour elections enforcement comm n,doe mortham,so d seymour,however,pertained only to elections and solicitations,not to referenda or other ballot measures.at.the nevada statute,like the statute in mcintyre,does apply to ballot questions,and thereby reaches a substantial quantity of speech as to which the corruption rationale for regulating campaign speech,stressed in buckley valeo and in mcconnell,has no application.additionally,the connecticut provision,unlike section,was limited to candidates and those associated with candidates,not persons unrelated to that candidacy.seymour,at.whether or not the statute challenged in seymour is constitutional,it precludes considerably less anonymous speech than the statute here at issue.
although the florida supreme court decision in doe is at odds with our holding,we do not find its reasoning convincing.doe depended on its understanding of mcintyre as limited to a solitary individual expression.see so d at.we reject this reading of mcintyre,for the reasons we have already explained.
in majors ii,the seventh circuit upheld the constitutionality of an indiana statute prohibiting anonymous campaign literature.the statute requires advertising that expressly advocat es the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate to include adequate notice of the identity of persons who paid for the communication.at quotation marks and citation omitted.elements of majors ii may be read to be inconsistent with our opinion.
in particular,the majors ii majority fails to accord sufficient significance,in our view,to the distinction we regard as determinative between a prohibition of the circulation of communication based on its content and a requirement that the financing of communications be separately reported.while majors ii noted the distinction the supreme court has drawn between disclosure reporting one identity to a public agency and disclaimer placing that identity in the ad itself,id.at,it did not discuss the conceptual distinction for first amendment purposes between a regulation that alters a communication and one that does not.nor did majors ii give any weight to the supreme court distinction,concluding,we there is no meaningful difference with regard to the protection of anonymous speech between a requirement that the identity of the publisher be revealed later and in less detail and a requirement that identifying information be included on the communication itself.see id.at like the indiana statute,the provision of the bipartisan campaign reform act that the mcconnell court upheld requires identifying any person who contributes to the making of the ad,even if the person is not a candidate or part of the candidate campaign staff.true,what is required is disclosure to an agency rather than disclosure in the political ad itself,but,as is apparent from the court reference to providing the electorate with information,the identity of the contributor is available to the public rather than secreted by the fec.citation omitted.but see id.at opinion of easterbrook,dubit
