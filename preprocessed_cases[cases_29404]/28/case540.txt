introduction 
in this case of first impression,we have before us the question of whether an official appointed to the upper san gabriel valley municipal water district district is required to stand for election to fill the unexpired portion of the term to which he was appointed.after the district,which is a defendant below and the petitioner and appellant herein,determined not to require the appointed official to stand for such election,real party in interest thelma jean robson filed a petition with the trial court to determine the question of whether that official should be required to stand for election in order to be able to serve the balance of the unexpired term the resolution of the novel issue presented by these consolidated proceedings requires us to determine the proper construction of government code section and particularly subdivision a thereof.
on august,the trial court entered an order granting robson petition and requiring the registrar to prepare for and conduct an election on november,to fill the vacancy on the district governing board.the district seeks to prevent that election and has asserted its objection through a petition for a writ of mandate no.as well as an appeal no.we have consolidated the pending appeal with the mandate petition and issued an order to show cause 
having considered the entire statutory scheme in context,construing section in a manner that harmonizes and gives effect to all parts and phrases of the statute,and giving due deference to the public right to vote for its representatives,we conclude that a person appointed to fill a vacancy created during the first half of the term of office on the governing board of the district may serve only until the person elected at the next general election takes office.in this case,the next general election is november,the in the term that commenced in january of.
we adopt what we believe is a logical and reasonable construction of the statutory scheme that will fully harmonize all of the provisions of section.the construction we adopt also is consonant with the preservation of the public right to vote for their representatives.
accordingly,the district petition for a writ of mandate will be denied and its appeal dismissed as moot.
factual and procedural background 
the district,which is located in los angeles county,is an incorporated water district,duly organized and existing under the laws of california.the district advises us that its purpose is to provide a reliable supply of imported water for groundwater storage and domestic consumption within its boundaries.
the governing board of the district is comprised of five directors,each holding office for a term.each member of the board takes office at noon on the first friday in december following the general district election at which such member was elected,et the terms are staggered so that every two years,at the general district election occurring in november,two or three of the seats will be subject to election.
an election for the district division office was held in for a term that,in the normal course of events,would not be on the ballot again until november.kenneth manning was elected a director of division at that election.he resigned his seat on the board less than four months after assuming office.
on march,the district governing board,apparently anticipating such resignation,voted to provide public notice of the vacancy on the board and to solicit potential appointees pursuant to section at the next board meeting,the potential appointees were informed that the appointment would be for an interim period.on april,the remaining directors appointed leon garcia to the vacancy that had resulted from manning resignation.
at the time garcia was appointed,the district noted on the record that the appointment was for an term.a press release was issued by the district announcing that garcia would serve as division director until the november election.at that time,he can choose to run for election to serve the unexpired portion of the term of office until december.
in june,the district notified the registrar of the resignation of an elected member of its governing board.among the registrar duties and responsibilities,as the district election official,was to call elections for members of the board in accordance with the requirements of law.
on june,approximately a year after notifying the registrar of the vacancy,the district voted not to place the division office on the ballot.instead,it passed resolution requesting the registrar to conduct an election only for divisions and,involving terms that were to expire in january 
robson,a resident of the district,and as a beneficially interested person,filed in the trial court a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief based on the premise that the district was required by section to schedule and conduct an election at the next general election to fill a vacancy on its governing board occurring in the first half of a term.
the district opposed the petition,arguing that garcia was entitled to hold the office,as the district appointee,until january when the term of the division office was due to expire.the registrar,without taking a position on the merits of the disputed issue,filed a response requesting an expedited trial court proceeding in order to resolve the question.
on july,robson applied for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause re preliminary injunction.the trial court set a hearing on the petition for writ of mandate.on august,as already noted,the trial court granted that petition and issued an order requiring the registrar to conduct an election 
the registrar began preparations for the november,election.the district notice of appeal on august,however,automatically stayed enforcement of the trial court august order.on august,robson applied for an ex parte order directing that the appeal not operate as a stay of the writ of mandate.the trial court granted that application based on a determination that the stay would cause irreparable damage to robson and others.thus,no stay was in effect when the instant petition for writ of mandate was filed in this court by the district.
based on our preliminary review of the petition,we determined that the district motion for a stay should not issue pending determination of the merits of the district petition.we issued an order to show cause and set the matter for argument on an expedited calendar.
contentions 
robson contends the statutory scheme permits an appointment to fill a vacancy on the district board only until the next general election,even if that election falls in the middle of an unexpired term.in that circumstance,the appointee would serve until the person elected at the midterm election qualifies for the office upon qualification,the person elected would fill the remainder of the term.
the issue,as set forth by the district,is did respondent court misinterpret section and overlook water code section to compel a midterm election for one of the district offices that had been vacated and duly filled by appointment,even though that office ordinarily would not have been on the ballot until the subsequent general election or,in the alternative,did respondent court err when it required an interim election for a seat to which district appointed a replacement to fill a vacancy in a public office carrying a term even though the term for that office had not expired 
we find ourselves in agreement with robson and answer in the negative both of the questions posed by the district.

legislative history 
section was first enacted in.at that time,the statute stated that a person appointed to fill a special district board vacancy would hold office only until the next general election.in lieu of calling a special election to fill the vacancy,the remaining board members could fill a vacancy by appointment until the next general district election.subdivision d of section emphasized the distinction between a person appointed to fill the position and a person elected to the position persons appointed to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next general district election,but persons elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the unexpired balance of the term of office.italics added.
since,section has been amended several times to clarify its intended effect.however,the substance of the statute,at all times,has remained the same a person appointed to fill a vacancy on a special district board would hold the office only until the next district election but a person elected to fill the vacancy would hold the office for the balance of the unexpired term.the only situation where an appointee was permitted to serve to the end of the unexpired term without standing for election was where the term was expiring and that office already was already scheduled for election at the next district election.
the most recent amendments to section occurred in.those changes were part of an omnibus bill making minor,technical,and changes to election procedures.election and reapportionment,on bill reg.sess.july.the purpose was to update and make more efficient the language in section in order to improve the administration of elections.ibid.this was accomplished by tying the election to fill the vacancy to the next general election,in place of the former language which,in effect,tied it to the next election to occur in the district.that was the focus of the amendment insofar as it affected district elections.see the report cited above on bill,the legislative vehicle through which the statute was amended.nothing in the legislative committee reports suggests that the amendments to section were intended to curtail the right of voters to elect a replacement for a director who had resigned.it would be extraordinary if the legislative purpose was to do so without reference or discussion of that effect.it would equally extraordinary for this court to seize on ambiguous language in this technical statute to conclude that a curtailment had been effected.we decline to construe the statute in that fashion.
interpretation of the current statutory scheme 
contrary to the district contention,water code section see fn,ante does not refer to the term of office of an appointee but merely authorizes a person appointed to office of director to assume the office,and to exercise the duties and responsibilities of the office subject to water code section,which specifies that a vacancy in the office of director shall be filled pursuant to section nothing in water code section contradicts the plain meaning of the words of section.the dispute in this action centers around the interpretation of that section as it may be pertinent to when an election must be held to fill a vacancy created on the district governing board.
there are three critical provisions set out in section,subdivision a,which we are required to construe and apply.they are 
a the fourth sentence the person appointed shall hold office until the next general district election after the date the district board is notified of the vacancy,and thereafter until the person elected at that election to fill the vacancy has been qualified.italics added.
b the fifth sentence the person elected to fill the vacancy shall fill the balance of the unexpired term.italics added.
c the sixth sentence if the term of office is due to expire following the next general district election and that election is scheduled or more days after the date the county elections official is notified of the vacancy,the person appointed to the vacancy shall fill the balance of the unexpired term of his or her predecessor.italics added.
another provision of section is also relevant.subdivision d provides persons appointed to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next general election and thereafter until the person elected at that election to fill the vacancy has been qualified,but persons elected at that election to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the unexpired balance of the term of office.italics added.
we have no trouble concluding that these sections,when read together,are ambiguous indeed,a reasonable argument can be made that they are,at least superficially,in apparent conflict.for example,the fourth and fifth sentences of subdivision a provide that an appointee can only serve until an elected person has qualified and then such elected person will serve the balance of the unexpired term.yet,the sixth sentence says that an appointed person shall fill the balance of an unexpired term if that term is due to expire after the next general district election.to say the least,this is confusing,and the confusion is compounded by the language of subdivision d which,it appears,has general application to each of the contingencies described in the three other subsections.it is our task to determine what the legislature intended and to read all of these sections,if we can,as a harmonized whole.
the district emphasizes that the fourth and fifth sentences of section,subdivision a apply when the term of office expires at the next general election and the sixth sentence permitting the appointee to serve the balance of an unexpired term deals with a term of office expiring after the next general election.it construes this language to mean that the sixth sentence should control if a vacancy occurs during the first half of a term and the fourth and fifth sentences would apply if a vacancy occurred in the second half of such term the district interpretation,however,would mean that an appointee would not have to run for election until expiration of the full term irrespective of how early in the term the vacancy occurs.in this case,that construction of the statute would allow garcia,who was appointed to the district governing board in april of,to serve in that position until january,a period of approximately three years and eight months,without ever having to stand for election.this would effectively preclude any participation by the voters in the selection of a director to fill this position until november.
the district position,in our view,conflicts with both the statutory language and the legislative intent and effectively disregards portions of the statutory text while treating other portions as mere surplusage.the district interpretation would create a conflict between the sixth sentence of section,subdivision a,on the one hand,and the fourth sentence of that subdivision and subdivision d,on the other.moreover,it would render meaningless the fifth sentence of subdivision a.
the district argues,in effect,that the phrase in the sixth sentence due to expire following the next general district election refers to an expiration date that would fall on,or be related to,the second election to be held after creation of the vacancy.but there is no reas
