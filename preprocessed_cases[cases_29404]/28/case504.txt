background 
in,the district and mphs each owned an acute care hospital serving residents of the district.seeking to improve both services and efficiencies,the district and mphs agreed to merge the operations of the two hospitals.as part of that agreement,the district leased its existing hospital facility to mphs in,with the lease to expire in january and full fee ownership and control of the existing hospital to revert to the district at that time.
during the term of the lease on the existing hospital,the state of california adopted strict seismic standards for acute care hospitals.implementation of the seismic standards meant that the existing hospital would require substantial modifications.based on engineering studies,the district and mphs concluded that compliance with the seismic standards would be better achieved by the construction of a new hospital facility rather than a retrofit of the existing facility.to this end,the parties entered a restructured relationship agreement agreement,under which mphs would develop,construct,and operate a new general,hospital on roughly acres of land leased from the district as owner of the property.
the agreement was incorporated in a series of interrelated written agreements,collectively termed the definitive agreements.the agreement itself governed the relationship between the district and mphs during the interim between the time the parties actually execute the definitive agreements and the closing date after voter approval.it covered such matters as the completion and execution of the definitive agreements,the parties obligations regarding the election and securing voter approval for the proposal,and the parties obligations regarding financing and the existing lease prior to the specified closing date.key here among the definitive agreements are the master agreement and the ground lease 
the master agreement contains the general terms that govern the relationship between the parties and coordinates all the other agreements where provisions overlap.the master agreement also sets forth the parties rights and obligations regarding the operations of the new hospital and provisions concerning the development and future uses of the new hospital.under the terms of the master agreement,mphs undertook to design,finance,and build the new hospital,demolish the existing hospital and return the site to the district,all at no cost to the district.it provides that mphs shall own and operate the hospital during the term of the ground lease.
the ground lease sets forth the contractual terms governing a lease of the district land to mphs for the purpose of building and operating the new hospital facility.the term of the lease commences when mphs begins to operate the new hospital start service date and may be extended for an additional year period upon mphs request and the district written consent.during the term of the ground lease,mphs will pay annual rent to the district in the amount of million,adjusted for inflation every three years.the ground lease further provides that mphs shall use the premises only for the purpose of maintaining and operating a general hospital and performing such other services in accordance with the master agreement.it also specifies that during the term of the lease and any extension thereto,mphs will hold ownership to the new hospital facility and associated improvements.also,the ground lease provides that upon expiration of the lease term the new hospital automatically becomes the property of the district and the district must compensate mphs at book value for certain assets as specified in the ground lease.
under the terms of the agreement,the district was obligated to hold an election on a ballot measure asking the voters to approve the district entry into the master agreement with mphs.the agreement stated both parties,at their own expense and within the limitations and parameters imposed by any law that governs the parties respective political activities,shall reasonably support the ballot measure and use reasonable efforts to obtain voter approval.
pursuant to the terms of the agreement,a special election was scheduled on a ballot measure measure v to allow voters the opportunity to accept or reject the district entry into the master agreement.the district devoted its summer newsletter to measure v.the newsletter states 
dear district resident,the district board is proud to announce that after many years of study and planning,we are ready to present our agreement to build a new community hospital to the district voters in a special ballot election this august.last fall,the district board unanimously approved an agreement with mphs,the current operator of peninsula medical center,to build a new million modern medical campus on district land with no new taxes.as part of this new lease,mphs will pay million a year to the district in rent for the use of that land for the term of the lease,after which time the hospital will be transferred back to the district.the district will reimburse mphs with the book value of the new hospital,a substantial discount,at the time of this transfer.because the current hospital does not meet the newly adopted,seismic safety requirements,which must be met by,the district board is eager to present this agreement to the district voters for approval in order to avoid further cost escalation and to keep construction on budget and on schedule.if the new seismic standards are not met by the deadline and a new medical facility is not built,the peninsula medical center would be forced to shut down,greatly limiting access to quality health care in our community.we would like to thank all of you who took the time to attend our special board meetings which were held throughout the district and to those of you who provided feedback on the draft agreement this past fall.the negotiations have been extensive and with your input and participation,we have negotiated the best possible agreement for the district.we will get a new hospital,and a framework for providing for the health care needs of the people of the district for generations to come.
the remainder of the summer newsletter devotes sections to various aspects of measure v,including the details of the master agreement the construction timeline and the hospital expected completion in early the reason the district needs a new hospital,the new seismic requirements for acute care medical facilities how the ballot works,including when voters should expect to receive their ballots and the new hospital for the next century,setting out the features and facilities included in the new hospital campus.
during the run up to the election,the district sent three additional mailers to voters concerning measure v.one is headed what is measure v it explains that the district and mphs have reached an agreement for the construction of a new hospital on district land,and that the current hospital will be forced to close down if it does not comply with new seismic standards.under the subheading,measure v will ensure the mailer lists four bullet points on the key terms of the agreement struck between the district and mphs.the four points listed are that mphs will build a new hospital meeting seismic standards with no new taxes the district will lease the site for the hospital to mphs at rent of million per year for the term the district will improve its oversight over hospital operations with its required approval of the removal of any core services and the district will have the option to acquire the hospital at the end of the lease at book value.
a second mailer is headed how the ballot works.it tells voters there will be no polling places and that once voters receive their ballots in the mail they should fill them in and return them by august,either by mail or to the outside the election office.it also restates the four bullet points listed in the first mailer.a third mailer is headed do forget to vote.it too reminds voters that ballots must be returned by august,and restates the four bullet points.on august,measure v was approved with of the votes cast in favor of the measure.
litigation phase 
discussion 
section.applicable standards 
the trial court sustained the district and mphs demurrers to plaintiff section claims without leave to amend.the appropriate standard of review of that ruling is as follows when reviewing a judgment dismissing a complaint after the granting of a demurrer without leave to amend,courts must assume the truth of the complaint properly pleaded or implied factual allegations.citation.courts must also consider judicially noticed matters.citation.in addition,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and read it in context.citation.if the trial court has sustained the demurer,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to state a cause of action.if the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,as here,we must decide whether there is a reasonable possibility the plaintiff could cure the defect with an amendment.citation.if we find that an amendment could cure the defect,we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion and we reverse if not,no abuse of discretion has occurred.citation.the plaintiff has the burden of proving that an amendment would cure the defect.citation.schifando city of los angeles cal th,d.
the relevant statutory language governing the issue of whether plaintiff complaint states facts sufficient to state a cause of action under section is as follows the board of directors may provide for the operation and maintenance through tenants of the whole or any part of any hospital acquired or constructed by it pursuant to this division,and for that purpose may enter into any lease agreement that it believes will best serve the interest of the district no lease for the operation of an entire hospital shall run for a term in excess of years.no lease for the operation of less than an entire hospital shall run for a term in excess of years.health,subd.a italics added.
based on competing interpretations of the statutory language,the parties dispute whether the district ground lease with mphs is subject to the statute lease restriction.accordingly,we first examine the statutory language to determine whether its meaning is plain or the statute is ambiguous.fitch select products cal th,d,stating that under principles of statutory construction,i f the plain,commonsense meaning of a statute words is unambiguous,the plain meaning controls.we will then address the parties competing interpretations to determine whether plaintiff can plead a meritorious claim consistent with our own interpretation of the statute.
section allows a board of directors to provide for the operation and maintenance through tenants of the whole or any part of any hospital acquired or constructed by it,subd.a.f or that purpose,the district may enter into any lease agreement that it believes will best serve the interest of the district.ibid.further,the length of any such lease agreement is determined by whether the board chooses to delegate the operation and maintenance of its hospital to a tenant in whole or in part if the entire operation and maintenance of its hospital is delegated to a tenant,then the maximum term of the lease the board may enter into is years,as reflected in the statutory language,no lease for the operation of an entire hospital shall run for a term in excess of years.
on their face,these provisions clearly and unambiguously authorize a district board to enter a specific type of that provides for the operation and maintenance through tenants of a hospital acquired or constructed by the district.the statute also places a clear and unambiguous restriction on the power of the board to enter such a lease no lease for the operation of an entire hospital shall run for a term in excess of years.the plain language of this lease restriction,however,must be construed in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part,giving significance to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose and construing words in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.santa clara valley transp.authority public utilities com.th,d brackets and citations omitted ailanto properties,city of half moon bay th,d we do not examine statutory language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.
applying these principles of statutory construction here,the legislature use of no lease in the lease restriction set forth in section,subdivision a obviously relates to the operation of an entire hospital because the complete wording of the lease restriction reads as follows no lease for the operation of an entire hospital shall run for a term in excess of years.when the entire lease limitation is itself considered in the context of the language of the subdivision as a whole,it is even clearer that the phrase for the operation of a hospital in the lease restriction relates back to earlier language that empowers a board to provide for the operation and maintenance through tenants of the whole or any part of any hospital acquired or constructed by it pursuant to this division,and for that purpose to enter into any lease agreement that it believes will best serve the interest of the district.health,subd.a italics added.in short,a contextual analysis of the language of the statute makes clear that the lease restriction only applies if the predicate requirements of the statute are board enters a lease for the operation and maintenance through tenants of a hospital acquired or constructed by the district.
in sum,when all the language of the statute is given full effect,construed as a whole and considered in context,it is clear that the legislature intended to restrict the power of a board to enter a lease in excess of years where two predicate requirements are met,when a board enters a lease providing for the entire operation and maintenance through tenants of a hospital acquired or constructed by the district.
plaintiff first contends that section lease restriction applies to any lease entered into by the district.such a crimped interpretation does not comport with the plain meaning of the no lease provision when that provision,as explained above,is considered in the context of the section as a whole.thus,we reject plaintiff attempt to manipulate the no lease language to extend the reach of the lease limitation in section to any lease executed by the board.
plaintiff contends that even if we conclude the statute mandates the existence of predicate requirements,the operative complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish such requirements and therefore the trial court erred by dismissing its claim under section.in support of its fact based argument,plaintiff asserts the definitive agreements as a whole establish that the ground lease involves a lease for the operation and maintenance of a hospital.additionally,plaintiff asserts the ground lease involves a
