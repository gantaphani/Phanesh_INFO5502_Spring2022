this appeal involves a claim that the city of martin,south dakota,and several of its officials violated section of the voting rights act of,b.the plaintiffs contend that the defendants adopted and maintained an ordinance that impaired the ability of native american indians to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice in city elections.sitting en banc,we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the action in its order of march,which was reversed by a panel of this court.we therefore vacate the court later judgment of february,and remand with directions to dismiss the action.
pearl cottier and rebecca three stars,members of the oglala sioux tribe and residents of martin,brought suit against the city,several members of the city council,and the city former finance director,alleging violations of the voting rights act and the constitution.the plaintiffs alleged that the city ordinance,which established boundaries for three voting wards within the city,diluted the votes of indians in each ward,and thereby violated section.they also alleged that the city enacted and maintained ordinance with a racially discriminatory purpose,in violation of section and the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.
after an bench trial,the district court rejected the plaintiffs claims and dismissed the action.cottier city of martin,slip op,hereafter march order.with respect to the section vote dilution claim,the court found that although the plaintiffs satisfied two of the three preconditions for liability that were established in thornburg gingles,they failed to show the third precondition,namely,that the white majority in the city voted sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the indian preferred candidate.id.at.the court also found no evidence of discriminatory intent in the passage of ordinance,and dismissed the plaintiffs alternative section claim and the constitutional claims on that basis.
on appeal,a divided panel of this court reversed on the vote dilution claim.cottier city of martin,cir cottier i.the court affirmed the district court findings regarding the first two gingles preconditions,but concluded that the district court clearly erred in finding that the third precondition was not satisfied.the court remanded to the district court with instructions to determine whether,in view of this court ruling that the plaintiffs had met all three gingles preconditions,the plaintiffs were entitled to relief under the totality of the circumstances.if so,the district court was directed to devise and implement an appropriate remedy.the city petition for rehearing en banc was denied,with five judges voting to grant it.
on remand,having been directed to accept that the plaintiffs established all three gingles preconditions for a section vote dilution claim,the district court found based on the totality of the circumstances that ordinance violated section.cottier.city of martin,d.the city declined to propose a remedy,asserting that there was no possible remedy for the violation found by the court.the district court considered three remedies proposed by the plaintiffs,and adopted the plaintiffs plan cottier city of martin,d.plan c did not divide the city into aldermanic wards,but rather adopted an voting scheme using cumulative voting.although the district court concluded in its march order that it lacked authority to order such a remedy,because it was not authorized by south dakota law,see march order at citing cane worcester county,wl cir unpublished,and cane worcester county,cir,the court on remand determined that plan c was permissible.the court ruled that it was bound to follow dicta from this court opinion in cottier i,at,which stated that i f,at the remedy stage,a redistricting of martin wards appears unworkable,it appears that plan c would be a viable option.see d at.
the city appealed both the finding of a section violation and the remedy,and a divided panel of this court affirmed.cottier.city of martin,cir cottier ii.the court then granted rehearing en banc and vacated the panel opinion in cottier ii.the en banc court notified the parties that the court may wish to consider issues decided in cottier i,as well as those briefed in cottier ii.
as the case is before the en banc court for the first time,we must first consider the scope of our review.the present appeal arises from the district court rulings on remand from cottier i,but this does not mean that we are constrained as a matter of law to accept the panel decision in cottier i.the en banc court does not lightly review a prior panel decision in the same case,but we have the power to do so.
when sitting en banc,the court has authority to overrule a prior panel opinion,whether in the same case or in a different case.the en banc court has not considered the questions decided in cottier i,and the law of the case does not preclude our consideration of those issues at this stage.the law of the case doctrine expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided,but it is not a limit to their power.messinger anderson,see christianson colt indus.operating.the doctrine,moreover,holds less sway with respect to an en banc court that is considering issues previously decided by a panel.that the court previously denied a petition for rehearing en banc is not controlling,because the decision to deny rehearing en banc is a pure exercise of discretion.it is not a ruling on the merits.
the parties have no justifiable expectation that a denial of rehearing en banc at an interlocutory stage resolves issues for all time.a remand order is not final until the supreme court denies certiorari at the end of the case.see christianson,at a petition for writ of certiorari can expose the entire case to review.hughes tool trans world airlines,holding that a prior dismissal of a writ of certiorari at an interlocutory stage did not establish law of the case or amount to res judicata on the points raised gressman et,supreme court practice ed.the court can reach back and correct errors in the interlocutory proceedings below,even though no attempt was made at the time to secure review of the interlocutory decree or even though such an attempt was made without success.the parties likewise must recognize that when the court of appeals declines in its discretion to rehear a case en banc after a panel orders a remand,the court retains authority to rehear the matter en banc at a subsequent stage of the proceedings.
to the extent that a footnote in robertson oil phillips petroleum,cir en banc,purports to restrict the authority of an en banc court to consider prior panel decisions,we overrule it.robertson cited law of the case principles that constrain a subsequent panel,see liberty mut.ins.elgin warehouse,cir order denying rehearing en banc,and seemed to apply them to an en banc court.we reject this view,and align ourselves instead with the uniform position of the circuits that an en banc court may overrule an erroneous panel opinion filed at an earlier stage of the same case.see irving united states,cir en banc watkins army,cir en banc shimman int l union of operating eng rs,local,cir en banc van gemert boeing co,cir en banc in re cent.r.of,cir en banc see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.
we conclude that it is appropriate in this case for the en banc court to consider the panel decision in cottier for the reasons set forth below,we hold that cottier i erred in reversing the district court dismissal of the action and remanding for further proceedings on liability and remedy.a federal court order directing a city to redraw its election ward boundaries,or to alter fundamentally its voting system,raises significant issues of federalism.see voinovich quilter.we think it exceptionally important for a federal court to ensure that there is a proven violation of section before ordering a city in south dakota to undertake significant changes in its electoral process.therefore,we will not overlook the error in cottier i and proceed to contemplate an order directing the city of martin to implement a remedy for a violation of the voting rights act 
in its march order,the district court considered the three preconditions for a section vote dilution claim,as described by the supreme court in gingles 
first,the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district second,the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive third,the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable the absence of special circumstances,such as the minority candidate running to defeat the minority preferred candidate.
gingles,at internal citation omitted.
on the first precondition,the district court found that two illustrative redistricting plans introduced by the plaintiffs showed that the native american group in the city was sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district.the court rejected the city contentions that the majority was not large enough and that it was too fragile.the court also held that the proposed plans were not so irregular on their face that they appear to be solely an effort to segregate races for the purposes of voting.rather,the court credited the testimony of the plaintiffs expert that he applied traditional districting principles to create these illustrative plans,and held that some consideration of race in fashioning the plans did not make them impermissible remedies for a section violation.
with respect to the second precondition,the court considered statistical analysis presented by experts for both parties concerning elections within the city and outside the city.the court found that three statistical methods employed by one or both experts were reliable,and that the analyses demonstrated political cohesiveness among indians in martin.considering the statistical evidence together with historical evidence and contemporary lay testimony,the court found that the plaintiffs satisfied the second gingles precondition.
considering the third precondition,however,the district court found that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to show that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable the absence of special circumstances,such as the minority candidate running to defeat the minority preferred candidate.gingles,at internal citation omitted.the court first evaluated an exit poll offered by the plaintiffs to show bloc voting in two city council races,but gave no weight to the poll due to shortcomings in its methodology.
the court then considered statistical analysis of election results from jurisdictions outside the city,which the court described as exogenous races.the court divided these exogenous races into several categories and made findings with respect to each.the court found that in countywide elections between candidates of different races,countywide elections between white candidates,and state and federal elections between white candidates,white voters did not vote sufficiently as a bloc usually to defeat the candidate.in one category,statewide elections between candidates of different races,the court found that white voters did vote sufficiently as a bloc usually to defeat the candidate.the court reasoned that interracial contests were entitled to more weight than contests among candidates of the same race,and that countywide elections should receive greater weight than state and federal elections.finding that only one category of exogenous elections showed bloc voting by a white majority to defeat candidates,the court concluded that the overall statistical evidence did not demonstrate the bloc voting required by gingles.
the court also evaluated the testimony of lay witnesses who said that they could identify candidates in city council elections,and that those candidates consistently lost.the plaintiffs urged that white bloc voting was the only possible explanation for the defeat of candidates,but the district court found that the lay testimony did not eliminate other reasons for candidate losses.the court ultimately found that i n light of the overwhelming statistical evidence,this lay testimony is not sufficient to meet plaintiffs burden of demonstrating the usual defeat of the candidate.
having determined that the plaintiffs failed to satisfy the third gingles precondition,the court entered judgment for the city on the plaintiffs claim of vote dilution in violation of section.the plaintiffs appealed,and this court filed its opinion in cottier i.we now consider the issues raised in that appeal.
vote dilution claims are peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case,requiring an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of the contested electoral mechanisms.gingles,at internal quotations omitted.to preserve the benefit of the trial court particular familiarity with the indigenous political reality,we apply a clear error standard of review both to the predicate factual determinations and to the ultimate finding regarding vote dilution.abrams johnson.it is the plaintiffs burden to demonstrate the existence of vote dilution.voinovich quilter.
we conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in finding that the plaintiffs failed to meet the third gingles precondition,that the white majority in martin voted sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate in city council elections.we therefore overrule the panel decision in cottier 
first,the district court did not clearly err in giving no weight to the exit poll offered by the plaintiffs to show bloc voting by a white majority in city council elections.the court gave specific and cogent reasons for declining to credit the results of this poll.after observing that exit polls generally are prone to high nonresponse rates which can seriously bias estimates and distort inferences,march order at,and that exit poll respondents may lie,the court found shortcomings in the specific exit poll conducted in martin.
the court explained that the plaintiffs own expert admitted that the exit poll sample,indians,and slightly females,so that it was not a representative sample of voters as a whole.id.the court found that the high nonresponse rates of seriously distorted inferences that could be drawn from the exit poll.id.at.the court also reasoned that a truly representative poll of the votes actually cast should logically demonstrate some consistency between the responses to the poll and the actual returns,id.at,but determined that the exit poll offered by the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate such consistency.id.at.although it was troubled by the fact that some of the poll takers were related to one of the plaintiffs,id.at,the court found it unnecessary to determine whether this fact alone was a sufficient basis to disregard the data.
it was not clear error for the court to view the poll as unreliable evidence of voting behavior by residents of martin.there were reasonable grounds for the district court to believe that the poll results understated the number of indians who favored the candidate,understated the number of white voters who favored the candidate,and failed to reflect truthful answers of those who responded.
second,the plaintiffs challenge to the district court statistical analysis does not demonstrate clear error.the cottier i panel concluded that the district court improperly relied on statewide and national election results in determining that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden,but we disagree.although the district court did use data from state and national elections,the district court did not rely on the state and national outcomes in tabulating the wins and losses of candidates.rather,the district court relied on the results for those elections,which were reported by the plaintiffs expert and cited by the plaintiffs as the election results for the city of martin.
the city election results derived from exogenous elections do not demonstrate that the district court overall finding as to the third gingles factor was clearly erroneous.the number of interracial elections presented to the district court was very small.there were only four interracial countywide races one race was,and the candidate won the other three in the city.appellants app.there were only three statewide interracial races,and the candidate won those in the city.appellants app.but there were state and federal races with candidates,and the candidate won fifteen of those contests in the city.appellants app.there were three countywide races one contest was,and the candidate was victorious in one of the other two in the city.appellants app.these results taken as a whole show almost equal numbers of victories for candidates and candidates.they do not compel a finding that a white majority in martin votes sufficiently as a bloc usually to defeat the candidate.johnson hamrick,cir although we have on various occasions held that district courts deciding minority vote dilution claims may give more weight to elections involving minority candidates than those involving all white contestants,there is no requirement that a district court must do so.citations omitted 
the district court did,for a subset of elections,rely on county election results,rather than city results,but this portion of the analysis does not establish clear error.the results in six of these contests,involving state and federal elections with multiple white candidates,actually favored the plaintiffs,because the candidates prevailed in only two of the six.appellants app.nine other contests in this subset were races in bennett county that involved both indian and candidates.the plaintiffs expert proffered these results as part of his analysis of the second gingles precondition,but concluded that it was not possible to include these elections in his statistical analysis of the third precondition.appellants app.the city expert replied that the plaintiffs expert was dead wrong that these elections could not be incorporated into the analysis of the third precondition,appellants app,but the plaintiffs still submitted no data concerning these elections.the district court evidently agreed with the city expert that the elections should be considered,and then evaluated the only data available in the record about those,results showing that the candidates won five of the nine contests.march order at appellants app.the court approach was more favorable to the plaintiffs than if the court had simply counted all nine elections against the plaintiffs based on a failure of proof 
overall,even if we accord little or no weight to the county results cited by the district court,the statistical evidence on the third gingles precondition is mixed the district court found insufficient proof,based on exogenous elections,that white voters typically vote as a bloc to defeat candidates in the city.the data in the record fall short of demonstrating that this conclusion is clearly erroneous.see gingles,at,concurring in judgment concluding that even where the district court clearly erred by aggregating certain data and relying on it to find racial bloc voting,the district court ultimate conclusion was not clearly erroneous in light of other evidence that the court also considered.
third,we disagree with the cottier i panel that the district court clearly erred when it declined to consider the results of aldermanic elections from as evidence of racial bloc voting.other than the exit poll that the district court permissibly found unreliable,there was no statistical evidence regarding these elections.the only other evidence about these contests was the testimony of lay witnesses who expressed an opinion about which candidates were preferred by indian voters,and whether those candidates won or lost.this testimony was disputed.some witnesses presented by the plaintiffs did not even live in martin.the defendants introduced testimony from indian voters who did reside in martin,and this evidence tended to show that indians,in fact,have varied opinions on issues of the day and on preferred candidates for elective office.the district court considered the lay testimony,but found that it did not show that candidates lost because of white bloc voting.the court concluded that in view of the statistical evidence,the testimony was insufficient to meet the plaintiffs burden to satisfy the third gingles precondition.this is a factual finding that addresses the relative persuasiveness of disputed lay testimony and statistical evidence unfavorable to the plaintiffs.there is no clear error in the district court weighing of the evidence.
the record evidence in support of the plaintiffs case on the third gingles precondition is not so strong as to generate a definite and firm conviction that the district court mistakenly dismissed the section vote dilution claim.see anderson bessemer city.for the reasons set forth by the district court,we also agree that the evidence is not sufficient to support a finding that ordinance was adopted and maintained for a discriminatory purpose.we therefore conclude that the district court judgment of march,should have been affirmed.because the section vote dilution claim was properly dismissed based on the third gingles precondition,we need not consider the city contentions regarding the other gingles preconditions,the district court analysis of the totality of the circumstances on remand,or the permissibility of any remedies proposed by the plaintiffs.the panel opinion in cottier i is set aside in its entirety,and it should not be treated as binding circuit precedent.
for the foregoing reasons,the district court judgment of february,is vacated,and the case is remanded with directions to dismiss.
i respectfully dissent because i conclude that this court should not,under the present circumstances,reconsider cottier i and we should grant the plaintiffs motion requesting that this court vacate the district court remedial order and remand to the district court for reconsideration of the appropriate remedy in light of the supreme court recent decision in bartlett strickland.
reconsideration of cottier i 
in robertson oil,this court,sitting en banc,concluded that the court should not accept a party motion for rehearing en banc of a decision after a second remand to open up the entire litigation.at emphasis added.specifically,the court observed that 
t he dissent willing acceptance of this opportunity reveals a different view of the principles of the law of the case which a majority of the judges of this court so firmly endorsed in our order denying rehearing en banc in liberty mutual insurance elgin warehouse and equipment,cir.indeed,the dissent would take this rehearing of robertson iii to vacate robertson i,in which we denied rehearing,and vacate robertson ii,in which we denied rehearing,and remand the case for a new trial.
the majority is correct that the view expressed in robertson oil is contrary to the prevailing view among our sister circuits that a ruling by a panel does not establish the law of the case if a later appeal is heard by the court en banc.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.the prevailing view maintains that 
a court en banc surely is free to limit the matters it considers en banc,and may exercise its discretion to refuse reconsideration of some issues resolved by a panel on an earlier appeal.there is no reason why en banc reconsideration of all issues must follow the determination that one or more issues in a case warrant the grudgingly rationed resource of en banc consideration.all ordinary concerns supplement this particular concern.nonetheless,the court en banc has a special authority that supports a special freedom to redetermine important issues without feeling bound in the same way as successive panels.
should successive appeals in the same case come to be heard by the court en banc,there is force in the view that ordinary principles should apply.the en banc court,however,has a special authority and responsibility for the law of the circuit,and may properly assert an extra measure of freedom to reconsider important issues.
id.emphasis added footnote omitted.
but even if this court,sitting en banc,possesses the power to overrule any panel decision that a majority of the active judges believes was wrongly decided,van gemert boeing.cir en banc,including in cases where prior en banc review of the panel decision was previously denied,the relevant question is under what circumstances the court should exercise this discretionary power.
i respectfully suggest that we should not exercise such power if a party would be seriously prejudiced as a result,or if reconsideration of a prior panel opinion would undermine stability in the sort of permanence and sureness in decision apart from the or composition of the particular tribunal so far as the person of the judges is concerned,lincoln life ins.roosth,cir.as the fifth circuit explained 
in more tranquil days and times,an appeal from a second trial would be heard by the same court as the first appeal.now,that is highly unlikely,and where it occurs,it least in this entirely to the laws of chance.that puts a premium on multiple appeals.that is so because,without implying any improper purpose to litigants or their counsel,or acknowledging anything more than,as human beings,judges will unavoidably have differences in emphasis,approach,or views on close questions in given areas,if the practice is followed for each succeeding panel to arrive at its own decisions,the losing party on the first appeal will naturally strive to bring it back a second,or a third,or a fourth time until all are exhausted.this possibility involves something other than simply more grist for our mill and as to which we should be indifferent.
we think that in a court it is most essential that it acquire an institutional stability by which the immediate litigants of any given case,and equally important,the bar who must advise clients or litigants in situations yet to come,will know that in the absence of most compelling circumstances,the decision on identical questions,once made,will not be and merely because of a change in the composition of the court or of the new panel hearing the case.
id.at emphasis added.
in the present case,i conclude that 
nothing about this case warrants our exercising the undoubted power to overrule the prior decision reached by the court on the first appeal.on the contrary,any effort to the merits and now declare a the same or a different of the former decision leads to consequences much more serious to the permanent,objective,administration of justice under law than any supposed individualized injustice to one or all of the litigants.
id.first,neither party asked this court to reconsider the prior panel decision in cottier i instead,the en banc court sua sponte raised the question.
second,no factual circumstances have changed since cottier i was decided to justify reconsideration of the panel opinion instead,a majority of the three years merely apply the law to the same facts differently.we should not encourage parties to bring multiple appeals in the same litigation in the hope that the en banc court will overrule prior panel opinions in that litigation.see lincoln,at.
lastly,reconsideration of cottier i unfairly prejudices plaintiffs.plaintiffs commenced the instant litigation on april.cottier,d at.the district court decision rejecting plaintiffs claims was entered on march.see march order.the appeal in cottier i was orally argued on january,and the panel filed its opinion,as corrected,on may.this court denied rehearing en banc on june.thus,at the time this case was orally argued to the en banc court on september,over three years elapsed since cottier i was first submitted to this court.during this period of time,plaintiffs have functioned with the belief that they established the city liability under the vra.no compelling circumstances,such as changed facts or law,justify reexamining and redeciding cottier indeed,applying rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure,this case,at its present posture,neither presents a necessity to secure or maintain uniformity of the court decisions nor involves a question of exceptional importance.
motion to remand 
even though i would decline to reexamine cottier i,i would not reach the merits of the city argument that the district court lacked the authority to impose remedial plan prior to oral argument,plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that this court vacate the district court remedial order and remand to the district court for reconsideration of the appropriate remedy in light of the supreme court recent decision in bartlett,in which the court declared that the rule relies on an objective,numerical test do minorities make up more than percent of the population in the relevant geographic area.at.
according to plaintiffs,the supreme court intervening decision in bartlett alters the law on which the district court remedial order was premised.they cite to the district court belief that a n effective majority,and thus an adequate remedy to a claim,requires approximately percent minority vap.cottier,d at citing jeffers clinton.because the district court imposed a requirement,plaintiffs contend that the district court erroneously rejected their proposed plan plan a provided for three districts,and its only district had an indian vap of percent.the district court concluded that plan a fail ed to provide an effective majority because it falls well short of the percent vap guideline.id.at.plaintiffs also argue that,for the same reason,the district court improperly rejected plan b,which proposed six districts,with ward contain ing percent indian vap and ward contain ing percent vap.id.at.
in response,martin maintains that bartlett only discusses the liability stage of a case it does not discuss an effective remedy or how a district court should determine remedies to a violation.according to martin,bartlett merely determined the minimum size minority group necessary to satisfy the first gingles precondition in the liability phase.in support of its argument,martin notes that even the dissenting justices in bartlett emphasized that the gingles preconditions do not state the ultimate standard under.the dissent stated that the threshold population sufficient to provide minority voters with an opportunity to elect their candidates of choice is elastic,and the proportions will likely shift in the future,as they have in the past,citing that some courts use a requisite percent population to constitute a safe district.bartlett.at souter,dissenting.
in this case,the district court applied a per se rule that a n effective majority,and thus an adequate remedy,requires approximately percent minority vap.cottier,d at.in light of bartlett,i will consider the evolution of this per se rule and its viability.
cases and origins of the rule 
in cases dealing with minority vote dilution,courts have confronted the question of what level of minority population is sufficient to provide the group with a realistic opportunity to elect officials of their choice kimball brace et,minority voting equality the percent rule in theory and practice,law pol y,quoting kirksey bd.of supervisors of hinds county.this percentage has been called the effective majority.id.
a rule of thumb has evolved that sets a percent minority population as the basis for an effective majority.id.the rule was allegedly supported by the justice department and given the imprimatur of the supreme court in united jewish organization of williamsburgh carey.id.but n either of these assertions is correct.id.
united jewish organization involved the attorney general preclearance review of a redistricting plan under of the vra.in that case,the supreme court stated that a t a minimum and by definition,a black majority district must be more than black.at.the court then determined that it was reasonable for the attorney general to conclude in this case that a substantial nonwhite population the vicinity of would be required to achieve a nonwhite majority of eligible voters.id.at.the court conclusion was based on its determination that the size of the minority population in the minority districts must reflect the need to take account of the substantial difference between the nonwhite percentage of the total population in a district and the nonwhite percentage of the population.id.at.thus,the court held that the justice department had the authority to deny preclearance to a plan with insufficient hispanic concentrations in certain districts in brooklyn on the grounds that the plan failed to provide hispanics an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.brace,supra,at.
notably,the court did not suggest that the percent rule is appropriate in all circumstances.indeed,there is no discussion in the case of the empirical basis for the choice of the percent figure.see also jack quinn et,congressional redistricting in the the impact of the amendments to the voting rights act,geo.mason civ.rts,the court in united jewish organization did not otherwise explain or justify its acceptance of the figure.scholars have researched the origins of the rule but have not found it in a holding of the supreme court 
in,the supreme court decided gingles,the seminal vra case.at.the court determined that,to establish a violation,a plaintiff must prove that a bloc voting majority must usually be able to defeat candidates supported by a politically cohesive,geographically insular minority group.id.at.this test requires plaintiffs to make three separate showings.first,the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district.id.at.second,the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive.if the minority group is not politically cohesive,it can not be said that the selection of a multimember electoral structure thwarts distinctive minority group interests.id.at.third,the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable the absence of special circumstances,such as the minority candidate running unopposed,to defeat the minority preferred candidate.id.
gingles did not explain what the court meant by the term majority.it is unclear both as to what percentage justice brennan was referring to as being sufficient to constitute a majority for purposes of this test,and who could be included in calculating this figure.rick strange,application of voting rights act to communities containing two or more minority is the whole greater than the sum of the parts.tech.gingles does not specify whether plaintiffs must show only a bare majority,whether they must show sufficient numbers so as to be able to effectively control a district,or who the court counts in calculating the majority.id.the court never discussed whether the plaintiffs are required to constitute a majority of the proposed district total population,total voting age population,or total registered voters.id.of course,the ordinary meaning of majority is fifty percent plus one.id.
district courts within this circuit expressly applied a or rule.see,smith clinton,a guideline of of total population is frequently used,and is derived by supplementing a simple majority with an additional to offset the fact that minority population tends to be younger than that of whites,for the pattern of low voter registration,and for low voter turnout among minorities.when population figures are used,a nonwhite majority is appropriate.jeffers.at it was just this reasoning that led this court,less than two years ago,to hold unanimously that something on the order of a bvap is required to remedy a violation of the voting rights act.and this court recognized that h istorically disadvantaged minorities require more than a simple majority in a voting district in order to have a practical opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.whitfield democratic party of,cir quoting smith.at.
nevertheless,by,the rule was considered exceptional.richard pildes,is law now at war with itself social science and voting rights in the.as one of the leading analyses concluded in the,districts with minority populations were generally sufficient to enable minority voters to defeat racial bloc voting,while districts less than minority almost never elected minority representatives.id.citing david lublin,the paradox of representation racial gerrymandering and minority interests in congress.and,the department of justice expressly disclaimed any reliance on a percent standard.quinn,supra,at.on november,the chief of the voting section of the civil rights division stated 
let me also take this opportunity to give you the department of justice position on the rule,whether a minority district must be at least in order to satisfy department of justice requirements.we attach no particular significance to a figure.the department has frequently concluded,based on the facts presented in a particular submission,that districts containing a minority population significantly less than and even of the total may be entitled to section preclearance.we have also rejected plans where the minority percentage in a district exceeded.each section submission must be evaluated in light of the particular factual on the basis of some preordained population percentage.
id.quoting remarks of gerald hebert,acting chief,voting section,civil rights division,department of justice at conference on fair redistricting in texas,emphasis added by quinn.
despite the trend away from the rule in the,in our most recent case regarding of the vra,we continued to apply percent as a guideline.bone shirt hazeltine,cir.in bone shirt,we upheld the remedial plan adopted by the district court,finding that the plan assures voters the opportunity to elect representatives of their choice and meaningful participation in the political process.id.we concluded that the remedial plan affords more than a percent majority in district and a percent majority in district.id.in support of this holding,we cited ketchum byrne,cir,as acknowledging the guideline and neal coleburn,for the following proposition t he general guideline for remedial districts is not a required minimum which the plaintiffs must meet before they can be awarded any relief under rather,the standard is a flexible and practical guideline to consider in fashioning relief for a violation.id.we also found that the district court correctly considered other factors,including turnout rate and incumbency in formulating the plan.id.holding that all that is required under is that the remedy afford a realistic opportunity to elect representatives of their choice.
bartlett strickland 
did the supreme court decision in bartlett modify what constitutes an effective majority for purposes of i conclude that it does.the case arose in a somewhat unusual posture in which the state of north carolina invoked as a defense to a new district that it created.bartlett.at.according to the state,required it to draw the district in question in a particular way,despite a provision of the north carolina constitution that prohibited the state legislature from dividing counties when drawing legislative districts for the state house and senate.id.the court granted certiorari to determine 
whether can be invoked to require state officials to draw lines to allow a racial minority to join with other voters to elect the minority candidate of choice,even where the racial minority is less than percent of the population in the district to be drawn.to use terminology in a district that is not a district,if a racial minority could elect its candidate of choice with support from crossover majority voters,can require the district to be drawn to accommodate this potential 
id.at.ultimately,the court held that such crossover districts do not satisfy the gingles requirement that the minority population be large enough and yet sufficiently geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district.id.at.
in reaching this holding,the court began its analysis by noting that the case turn ed on whether the first gingles requirement can be satisfied when the minority group makes up less than percent of the population in the potential election district.id.at.the dispositive question was w hat size minority group is sufficient to satisfy the first gingles requirement id.at.the court observed that 
a t the outset the answer might not appear difficult to reach,for the gingles court said the minority group must demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographical
