the united states brought suit against the state of missouri and the missouri secretary of state in her official capacity collectively,missouri,alleging missouri was in violation of its obligations under the national voter registration act of nvra.the district court found missouri met its nvra obligation to make a reasonable effort to conduct a general program of voter list maintenance.to the extent some nvra violations existed,the district court found those violations were the responsibility of individual local election agencies leas,and missouri was not directly responsible for enforcement of the nvra against the leas.the district court recognized missouri must do more than enact statutes to comply with the nvra,and must make a reasonable effort to coordinate state responsibilities.the district court therefore granted summary judgment in favor of missouri on any claim by the united states which seeks to hold missouri responsible for enforcement of the nvra against local election authorities,but allowed additional discovery for the united states to make its case that missouri compliance was unreasonable.
after discovery,the district court found missouri reasonably met its obligation to conduct a general program under the nvra,and granted summary judgment to missouri on all claims.in making this decision,the district court declined to admit,for the truth of the matters asserted therein,responses contained in surveys of the leas,finding the survey responses were hearsay.the district court allowed the survey statements only for the limited purpose of showing missouri knowledge of possible nvra violations by the leas.
on appeal,the united states argues the district court erred in its interpretation of the nvra.the united states also challenges the district court decision to exclude lea survey responses from evidence.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for reconsideration.
background 
underlying facts and the united states complaint 
the united states filed suit against missouri,alleging missouri was in noncompliance with its responsibilities under the nvra.of particular significance to this appeal,the united states alleged missouri failed to conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters by reason of death or change in residency,pursuant to a.
the district court examined missouri actions to comply with the nvra and missouri actions between to to attempt to remove ineligible voters from the voter rolls.in its findings of fact,the district court explained missouri had,among other things,enacted a law amending missouri statutory scheme regarding voter registration and list maintenance through state law,required that the systematic removal of ineligible voters from voter lists must be completed at least days before election s for federal office s provided for the removal of voters based on death,felony conviction,or mental incapacity required local election authorities to conduct a canvass of registered voters every two years provided for removal of voters who fail to respond to confirmation notices upon completion of the canvass,after the voter has failed to vote in two consecutive general elections after the date of notice developed a centralized voter registration database cvrd and numerous local voter registration systems lvrs provided for updated voter registration systems throughout the state,including provision of hardware and software,data conversion and training,and maintenance and support for these computer systems coordinated efforts to receive updated information in order to continually update and harmonize the cvrd and lvrs obtained information from the court systems and the registrars of vital statistics to determine the identity of voters who had been adjudged incapacitated or had been convicted of a felony and expended in excess of six million dollars to implement the cvrd.
the district court also delineated missouri actions from to the time of its decision.these steps included taking steps to eventually replace the cvrd with the missouri voter registration system mvrs,a single voter database to be directed by the secretary of state office by late,effectively having of local election authorities transfer their data to the mvrs,with all remaining counties scheduled to be completed by january,requiring the mvrs to be updated on a regular basis,and placing responsibility for mvrs maintenance on the secretary of state providing publications and also training to lea authorities at various seminars across missouri taking registration surveys from leas and submitting compilation reports to the united states election assistance commission as required by federal law and developing an action plan for encouraging lea compliance,which included preparation of a guideline manual and regular training for lea authorities,as well as tracking of registration inconsistencies,and with lea authorities where discrepancies are identified.
throughout the litigation,the registered voters in numerous missouri counties exceeded the number of eligible voters.the district court found it was unclear whether these discrepancies resulted,in part,from the nvra dual requirements that drivers license applicants must be given an opportunity to register to vote increasing the numbers of registered voters,and a to a voter canvass requir ing a two year delay before names can be removed from the voter registration lists thus delaying removal of those no longer eligible to vote.the district court also recognized the federal government had determined counties had low numbers of inactive registrants,indicating a possible lack of routine maintenance of voter lists.
in its complaint against missouri,the united states alleges several provisions of the nvra,contending missouri failed to conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters by reason of the registrant dying or moving implement a program that was uniform,nondiscriminatory,and in compliance with the voting rights act implement a program that prevented the removal of any person name from the official list of voters by reason of the person failure to vote and complete,at least days before the date of a primary or general election for federal office,a program to ensure that the names of ineligible voters have been removed from the official list.
b.the district court grant of summary judgment 
the district court stated 
the government complaint is not clear as to what conduct it alleges against missouri.in some respects,it appears the government alleges that missouri itself failed to comply with the nvra.in other respects,it appears the government is attempting to hold missouri liable for the conduct of local election authorities that does not comply with the nvra.the complaint does not separate its claims into separate counts nor does it explicitly state the alleged wrongful actors.
the district court further explained,it appears that the government is seeking,in large part,an order which will require missouri to enforce the nvra and the corresponding missouri statutes against local election authorities.the district court concluded,because neither missouri state law nor the nvra gives the secretary of state enforcement authority,summary judgment is granted in favor of missouri on those claims that seek to hold missouri responsible for the enforcement of the nvra against local election authorities.
in effect,the district court concluded missouri could only be held responsible for those duties directly assigned to the state,including the requirement it conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters by reason of death or change in residency,pursuant to a.however,the district court acknowledged,although missouri is not required to enforce the nvra against local election officials,it must itself comply with the terms of the nvra.the district court allowed additional time for discovery,and subsequently determined missouri efforts to conduct a general program to remove ineligible voters from the rolls was reasonable.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of missouri.

iii.discussion 
district court interpretation of the nvra 
the united states characterizes the main issue as,whether states can be held accountable for their local subdivisions violations of section of the nvra.this framing of the issue epitomizes the federal government construction of the nvra.a different framing of the issues would be for which violations of section of the nvra may states be held accountable when local subdivisions violate the nvra and in what manner may states be held accountable for the conduct of the leas 
in essence,the united states contends the nvra places obligations directly on the states highlighting in bold the term state in various passages from the nvra.under the federal government view,if a state delegates any obligation to an lea,the state remains ultimately responsible for the obligation.
missouri admits the nvra directly imposes certain requirements on the states.however,missouri is quick to note the nvra imposes different levels of obligations for various requirements.for instance,section the primary section at issue imposes certain duties on the states.see a in the administration of voter registration for elections for federal office,each state shall emphasis added.the statute then lists numerous provisions using different verbs to describe the states responsibilities.under section a,the state must ensure that any eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election.emphasis added.under section a,the state must require the appropriate state election official to send notice to each applicant of the disposition of the application.emphasis added.under section a,the state must provide that the name of a registrant may not be removed from the official list of eligible voters except under specified circumstances.emphasis added.under section a of most importance in this case,the state must conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters by reasons of death or change of residence.emphasis added.under a,the state must inform applicants of certain provisions.emphasis added.finally,under section a,the state must ensure that the identity of the voter registration agency through which any particular voter is registered is not disclosed to the public.emphasis added.
under the plain language of the statute,states must take specific actions.some of these provisions envision delegation,and do not require the states to do more than delegate.for example,congress expressly used the term ensure for the requirement that the identity of the voter registration agency through which any particular voter is registered is not disclosed to the public.see a.missouri is directly responsible for ensuring this identity remains undisclosed,and if missouri delegated this responsibility,it could not avoid liability for any failure to maintain such nondisclosure.the same would be true for the provision ensur ing that any eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election.see a.
the united states claims missouri has violated a.this provision requires that missouri conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters by reason of death or change in residency.by its plain language,this requirement envisions the states will actively oversee a general program wherein many of the duties not specifically assigned to the states may be delegated.unlike the term ensure which indicates a direct state responsibility,the term require may indicate a responsibility to do little more than pass a mandatory law.the phraseology conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort,a,represents some middle ground.nonetheless,this conduct terminology clearly envisions missouri will actively oversee the general program after all,the term conduct is an active verb,encompassing the concept of providing leadership.see webster third new intn l dictionary defining the term as meaning,inter alia,to bring by or as if by leading to lead as a commander to have the direction of to direct as leader the performance or execution of and to act as leader or director.under the nvra plain language,missouri may not delegate the responsibility to conduct a general program to a local official and thereby avoid responsibility if such a program is not reasonably conducted.
the district court correctly understood the key issue is whether or not missouri has met its express obligations under the nvra.however,the district court misunderstood the relevance of the leas actions or inactions regarding missouri compliance with the nvra.the district court found missouri could not be held responsible for enforcement of the nvra against local election authorities.this determination was technically correct.the plain language of the nvra provides a right of enforcement to only two categories of united states and a person who is aggrieved by a violation of the nvra.a and b.the state of missouri would not necessarily be a person aggrieved by a violation of the nvra.the statute envisions the federal government predominantly will enforce the nvra 
although missouri can not be required to enforce the nvra against the leas,any lack of lea compliance remains relevant to determining whether or not missouri is reasonably conduct ing a general program.other remedies besides ordering missouri to enforce the nvra against the leas may remain.for instance,if the district court determines a lack of lea compliance renders missouri efforts to conduct a general program unreasonable,it could order missouri either to develop different or improved methods for encouraging lea compliance,or assume direct responsibility for some or all of the activities needed to remove ineligible voters from the voter rolls,cease delegating nvra responsibilities to the leas.
we do not suggest what equitable relief,if any,may be appropriate,as the district court sits in a much better position to make this determination.we only provide the above options to clarify the possible realm of the actions.the courts,of course,should refrain from micromanaging the state and its agencies.see angela clinton,cir federal courts operate according to institutional rules and procedures that are poorly suited to the management of state agencies.a ppropriate consideration must be given to principles of federalism in determining the availability and scope of equitable relief.rizzo goode,d citation omitted.
the district court provided a lengthy analysis of missouri attempts to comply with the nvra,finding missouri met its obligation for a reasonable effort to conduct a general program on remand,the district court is not bound to reach a contrary conclusion.rather,our reversal requires only that the district court also consider any lack of lea compliance and determine whether any such noncompliance renders missouri effort to conduct a general program unreasonable in removing the names of ineligible voters.
