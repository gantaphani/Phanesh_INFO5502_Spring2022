the right to vote is protected in more than the initial allocation of the franchise.equal protection applies as well to the manner of its exercise.having once granted the right to vote on equal terms,the state may not,by later arbitrary and disparate treatment,value one person vote over that of another.bush gore,d citation omitted.
thirteen citizens of wake county,north carolina challenge a state law redrawing the wake county board of education electoral districts.plaintiffs contend that under the new redistricting plan,some citizen votes will get significantly more weight than other in violation of the fourteenth amendment guarantees of one person,one vote and the north carolina constitution promise of equal protection.for the reasons explained below,we conclude that plaintiffs have stated a claim upon which relief could be granted against the wake county board of elections and that the district court therefore erred in dismissing their suit.however,we affirm the denial of the motion to amend because the state officials plaintiffs proposed to add as named defendants are not amenable to suit.
accepting the facts in plaintiffs complaint as true,as we must on a motion to dismiss,plaintiffs allege that until,the wake county board of education board of education was composed of members elected from nine districts.the board of education functioning and selection was governed by north carolina general assembly session law,which required,among other things,that the board of education redistrict itself every ten years following the decennial census.
in,the census showed that wake county population had grown by over the preceding decade,with a maximum population deviation among the school board districts of the board of education thus redrew its districts in,resulting in geographically compact districts with a maximum population deviation of and no district deviating from the ideal district population by even.see appendix from plaintiffs complaint at.
the plan was put into place by a board of education that was majority republican.but under the new plan,the fall elections resulted in a board of education with a democratic majority.plaintiffs allege that because the new plan resulted in a democratic majority,the north carolina general assembly,in turn,over the objection of a majority of the wake county school board,passed a local bill making numerous changes in the method of selection.no democratic member of the legislature voted for it,and no african american member of the legislature voted for it.
the bill,session law session law,made numerous changes to the wake county board of education methods of election.central to plaintiffs complaint,the session law changed the board of education from nine districts to seven districts and set less geographically compact boundaries for this new set of districts.see appendix from plaintiffs complaint at.the maximum population deviation among the districts is.
further,the session law created two super districts.one super district forms a donut of outer,rural areas of the county,while the other forms a donut hole in the inner,urban area.see appendix from plaintiffs complaint at j.the maximum population deviation between the superdistricts is.
the session law also prohibits the board of education from making any further changes in its method of election until,something it previously could do.wake county is thus burdened with some substantially districts,where votes will be diluted other substantially districts.those districts are visually and mathematically less compact and split unique precincts in the county as opposed to the prior districts,which split only precincts.
plaintiffs sued the state of north carolina and the wake county board of elections board of elections,the entity charged with administering the board of education elections.plaintiffs complained that the session law overpopulates,without justification,certain districts,causing the vote of plaintiffs living in those overpopulated districts to be weighted less than votes of citizens in districts that are unjustifiably.plaintiffs thus claimed that the session law violates the united states constitution one person,one vote guarantees and the north carolina constitution equal protection clause.
defendants answered and moved to dismiss.plaintiffs,in turn,sought leave to amend their complaint,substituting governor patrick mccrory,senate president pro tem phillip berger,and general assembly speaker thom tillis individual state officials in their official capacities for the state of north carolina.
the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss and denied plaintiffs motion to amend as futile.specifically,the district court held that it had no jurisdiction over the state,that eleventh amendment immunity also insulated the individual state officials from suit,and that plaintiffs one person,one vote claims were really partisan gerrymandering claims,which it considered under both the united states and north carolina constitutions.plaintiffs timely appealed.
we first consider plaintiffs argument that the district court erred in ruling that proposed defendants tillis and berger proposed defendants were not proper parties to their suit and we do so de novo.franks ross,cir noting that the existence of sovereign immunity is a question of law that we review de novo and that we review de novo a legal determination of whether ex parte young relief is available quotation marks and citations omitted.
under the eleventh amendment,t he judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.the united states supreme court has read the eleventh amendment to render states immune from being hauled into federal court by private parties.fed.comm state ports,d.
while the eleventh amendment provides significant protections to states,the immunity it provides to state officials is less robust.specifically,a state official ceases to represent the state when it attempts to use state power in violation of the constitution.sch.bd.of city of charlottesville,allen,cir.see also ex parte young.such officials thus may be enjoined from such unconstitutional action sued and stopped,in other only if they have some connection with the enforcement of an unconstitutional act.id.at see also.dep t of state treasure salvors,d.
to be amenable to suit under the eleventh amendment,there must exist a special relation between the state official being sued and the challenged action.ex parte young,at.see also,waste mgmt.holdings,gilmore,cir ex parte young requires a special relation between the state officer sued and the challenged statute to avoid the eleventh amendment bar.this requires proximity to and responsibility for the challenged state action.wildlife fed limehouse,cir emphasis in original.by contrast,g eneral authority to enforce the laws of the state is an insufficient ground for abrogating eleventh amendment immunity.id.quotation marks omitted.
for example,in mcburney cuccinelli we held that virginia attorney general did not have a specific duty to enforce the state freedom of information act and thus was not subject to suit under ex parte young,cir.we noted that virginia had vested such authority in local prosecutors as opposed to the attorney general.further,we likened the attorney general duty to issue advisory opinions to the governor duty to uphold state sufficient to impose the required special relation to enforce the law so as to make him a proper defendant.id.at.
by contrast,in wildlife federation,we held that the sued state official there the director of south carolina department of transportation had a sufficiently close relationship with the challenged law or action to be amendable to suit.at.in that case,the plaintiffs alleged violations of the national environmental policy act arising from the proposed construction of a bridge in south carolina.we held that both state and federal law imposed specific duties upon the director that gave rise to the required special relation.id.at.
turning to the case at hand,we agree with the district court that neither proposed defendant had a special duty to enforce the challenged session law,and thus neither is amenable to suit.the north carolina constitution clearly assigns the enforcement of laws to the executive branch.const.art.iii.the general assembly retains no ability to enforce any of the laws it passes.id.and proposed defendants are merely members of north carolina general assembly.additionally,as is the case with all election plans in north carolina,the county board of elections,in cooperation with the state board of elections,has the specific duty to enforce the challenged redistricting plan.
plaintiffs counter that if the proposed defendants are not party to their suit,there will be no mechanism for forcing a constitutionally valid election,should they succeed in enjoining the session law this assertion is,however,incorrect.the district court could,for example,mandate that the board of elections conduct the next election according to the scheme in place prior to the session law enactment until a new and valid redistricting plan is implemented.state law also provides,for example,that the state board of elections can make reasonable interim rules with respect to pending elections.in the event any state election law is held unconstitutional or invalid by a state or federal court or is unenforceable,the state board of elections shall have authority to make reasonable interim rules and regulations with respect to the pending primary or election.without question,then,a valid election could take place if plaintiffs succeed on the merits and successfully enjoin the session law.
in sum,neither proposed defendant has any enforcement authority over election proceedings,and,accordingly,neither falls within the eleventh amendment exception to immunity established in ex parte young.we thus affirm the district court determination that adding speaker tillis and president pro tem berger as defendants would be futile.
with their main argument on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred when it dismissed their complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.we review the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint de novo,accept ing as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.du pont de nemours kolon,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.further,while the complaint must contain sufficient facts to state a claim that is plausible on its face,it nevertheless need only give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.id.quotation marks and citations omitted.
to the extent plaintiffs claims do not fall within the four corners of our prior case law,this does not justify dismissal under rule b.on the contrary,rule b dismissals are especially disfavored in cases where the complaint sets forth a novel legal theory that can best be assessed after factual development.mcgary city of portland,cir quoting baker cuomo,cir,vacated in part on other grounds,cir en banc.see also charles alan wright arthur miller et,federal practice procedure ed noting that courts should be especially reluctant to dismiss on the basis of the pleadings when the asserted theory of liability is novel and thus should be explored.indeed,as the law firm s up in unsettled areas,it may be more feasible to dismiss weaker cases on the pleadings otherwise,plaintiffs should be given an opportunity to develop evidence before the merits are resolved.metts murphy,cir.
finally,we bear in mind that a complaint is to be construed liberally so as to do substantial justice.pub.employees ret.ass of deloitte touche llp,cir quoting charles alan wright arthur miller et,federal practice and procedure ed.see also,anderson found.for advancement,educ.emp t of am.indians,cir noting that pleading standards require that the complaint be read liberally in favor of the plaintiff.
the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause guarantees not only the initial allocation of the franchise that is,the right to vote.bush,at.rather,equal protection applies as well to the manner of its exercise.having once granted the right to vote on equal terms,the state may not,by later arbitrary and disparate treatment,value one person vote over that of another.id.at.
inherent in the equal protection of voting is the requirement that all citizens votes be weighted equally,a principle that is commonly known as one person,one vote.reynolds sims,d.this principle ensures that every voter,no matter what district he or she lives in,will have an equal say in electing a representative.daly,at.a citizen,a qualified voter,is no more nor no less so because he lives in the city or on the farm.this is the clear and strong command of our constitution equal protection clause.reynolds,at.
the one person,one vote principle applies not just to the federal government but also to state and local government.avery midland,d.of particular note in this case,the supreme court has left no doubt that one person,one vote applies to school boards.id.if voters residing in oversize districts are denied their constitutional right to participate in the election of state legislators,precisely the same kind of deprivation occurs when the members of a city council,school board,or county governing board are elected from districts of substantially unequal population.emphasis added.
the courts have recognized that m athematical exactness or precision is hardly a workable constitutional requirement and do not hold state or local government districts to such a standard.daly,at quoting reynolds,at.nevertheless,governments must make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts as close to equal population as is practicable.daly,at quoting reynolds,at.
generally,therefore,a district apportionment plan with a maximum population deviation under will not,by itself,support an equal protection claim.daly,at.the threshold does not,however,insulate a state or local districting plan from attack.id.at.rather,it determines the allocat ion of the burden of proof,with a plaintiff in a case below the population disparity mark unable to rely on it alone to prove invidious discrimination or arbitrariness.to survive summary judgment,the plaintiff would have to produce further evidence to show that the apportionment process had a taint of arbitrariness or discrimination.id.quoting roman sincock,d 
here,plaintiffs allege such a taint of arbitrariness or discrimination.id.specifically,plaintiffs complain that the challenged districts discriminate between urban and rural voters,overpopulat ing,without justification,certain districts,causing the vote of plaintiffs living in those overpopulated districts to be weighted less than votes of citizens in districts that are unjustifiably.see reynolds,at stating that a qualified voter is no more nor no less so because he lives in the city or on the farm.the district court itself recognized that plaintiffs allege a favoritism of rural areas of the county over urban areas,and even defendants agree that plaintiffs do allege that the plan pits urban voters against rural voters.appellees br.at.it is hard to square all of this with the dissenting opinion assertion that plaintiffs do no such thing.post at.in any event,defendants concession highlights that plaintiffs here fulfilled rule core requirement they g a ve the defendant fair notice of their claims.erickson pardus,d quoting twombly,at.
further,plaintiffs complain that the districts,particularly when compared to the previous districts that had been drawn up just two years prior,were visually and mathematically less compact,confusing,and had significantly higher population deviations.j.plaintiffs also alleged that the challenged redistricting split unique precincts,whereas the prior plan divided only.plaintiffs point out that not only did the board of education itself oppose the redistricting,but that n o democratic member,and no african american member of north carolina general assembly supported the redistricting,suggesting,for rule b review,that it was neither racially nor otherwise neutral.
finally,plaintiffs contend that the challenged redistricting is intended to disfavor incumbents who are registered democrats and support progressive education policies.according to plaintiffs,the redistricting further s republican interests and advance s conservative agenda policies over the wishes of the wake county electorate which they contend is not a legitimate state interest that justifies the population deviations.id.again,even the district court recognized that plaintiffs allege the targeting of democratic incumbents and impermissible political bias.
when plaintiffs complaint is viewed through the forgiving lens mandated at the stage,it states a plausible claim for which relief can be granted.plaintiffs allege in detail a redistricting that resulted in a maximum population deviation of nearly.plaintiffs describe how and why that deviation was unjustified,discriminatory,and unconstitutional.they do not allege that the apportionment plan with a maximum population deviation just barely under by itself supports their equal protection claim,but rather they plead facts indicating that the apportionment had a taint of arbitrariness or discrimination.daly,at,quotation marks and citation omitted.
the dissenting opinion is quick to reject the complaint for its failure to engage in talismanic incantations of magic words like arbitrary.post at making much ado of the fact that the complaint does not even contain the words bad faith or arbitrariness.that plaintiffs chose to plead facts sounding in arbitrariness rather than simply invoking the word demonstrates to us only that plaintiffs have heeded the supreme court warning that formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.twombly,at.it is clear to us that plaintiffs pled arbitrariness when they alleged,for example,that the redistricting was done without justification,and that the deviations do not further any legitimate redistricting criteria.
similarly,the district court rejected plaintiffs allegations and dismissed their complaint.in doing so,it cited not a single case on all fours with this one nor any case mandating such an outcome.defendants similarly have identified no precedent that suggests that dismissing plaintiffs complaint at this stage is warranted,much less required.
to the contrary,a closer look at the precedent defendants and the district court cite underscores that plaintiffs claims should survive.for example,both defendants and the district court rely on daly,to justify dismissal here.tellingly,however,we held in daly that a plaintiff in a case falling below the population disparity mark may not rely on it alone to prove invidious discrimination or arbitrariness.to survive summary judgment,the plaintiff would have to produce further evidence to show that the apportionment process had a taint of arbitrariness or discrimination.id.at quoting roman,at emphasis added thus,in daly,rather than dismiss the plaintiffs claims,we remanded the matter,stating that w hether plaintiffs can produce any credible evidence to establish that the apportionment plan at issue here was the product of bad faith,arbitrariness,or invidious discrimination should be addressed on remand.id.at.
similarly,roman,d,on which we relied in daly,was decided after a trial.and gaffney cummings,on which the district court relied and in which the supreme court held that an otherwise acceptable reapportionment plan was not made constitutionally vulnerable by the fact that its purpose was to achieve political fairness between the major political parties,was decided after c onsiderable evidence was introduced,d 
by contrast,both defendants and the district court try to distinguish and dispense with cox larios,a case notably more similar to the one at hand and illustrative of the district court error in dismissing plaintiffs complaint.d three judge panel,summarily aff,d.in larios,a federal court struck down a statewide legislative redistricting plan in georgia.the plaintiffs there alleged that the plan disproportionately favored democrats in the state by districts in the urban atlanta region and the rural area both democratic strongholds while overpopulating districts with voters.the redistricting plan thereby created a maximum population deviation of.id.at.additionally,the new plan disproportionately protected democratic incumbents.id.at.the district court in larios found that the state purposefully drew districts in a way to exist within what they perceived to be a safe harbor and struck the plan as unconstitutional.id.at.the supreme court summarily affirmed the larios decision.
we recognize that the precedential effect of a summary affirmance can extend no further than the precise issues presented and necessarily decided by those actions.state bd.of elections socialist workers party,d quoting mandel bradley,d.such summary actions should not be understood as breaking new ground but as applying principles established by prior decisions to the particular facts involved.mandel,at.
while sensitive to its limitations,we can nevertheless glean several lessons from the larios summary affirmance.first,the supreme court has not created a maximum population deviation threshold,below which all redistricting decisions are inherently constitutional.this point was made clear by justice stevens opinion concurring in the affirmance and highlighting the court rejection of a safe harbor for districting plans that rest within the threshold 
a ppellant invites us to weaken the,standard by creating a safe harbor for population deviations of less than percent,within which districting decisions could be made for any reason whatsoever.the court properly rejects that invitation.after our recent decision in vieth jubelirer,d,the principle remains the only clear limitation on improper districting practices,and we must be careful not to dilute its strength.
at emphasis added.second,the supreme court necessarily believed to be correct the district court rejection of discriminatory treatment of incumbents from one party over those of another,the district court rejection of allowing citizens in certain areas to have disproportionate electoral influence,or both,since the lower court ruling relied on those bases in striking the redistricting as unconstitutional.larios,d at.
here,plaintiffs allege that,as in larios,a state legislature designed a redistricting plan with a maximum deviation in population of just under,designed to pit rural and urban voters against one another,and intended to favor incumbents of one political party over those of another.even if larios does not control this case though neither defendants nor the district court point to anything else squarely on point and controlling,either,we nevertheless find it persuasive.
the district court rejection of larios rested on an altogether arbitrary distinction.the district court declared that larios dealt with elections whereas this case deals only with wake county.the broad geographic differences found within a state are not found within one county.the lack of a factual basis for this statement aside,the district court failed to identify how such a difference in scale might justify rejecting plaintiffs claims as a matter of law.indeed,the supreme court recently reaffirmed that courts should analyze redistricting plans,reasoning that the nature of the harms is personal and directly threaten s a voter who lives in the district attacked but not a voter who lives elsewhere.alabama legislative black caucus alabama,d,see also dickson rucho,wl,at,vacating judgment and remanding north carolina legislative redistricting in light of alabama legislative black caucus alabama.we see no reason why such a analysis applies any differently at the county level,and defendants point to none.
similarly,the district court found it plainly apparent in larios that r epublican incumbents were being targeted,whereas here the targets are less clear.but certainty is not required to survive a motion to dismiss.notably,the district court did not find it implausible that such targeting occurred here.twombly,at.while the factual allegations in a complaint m
