this appeal asks us to interpret a term limit provision found in the city of stockton city charter.the voter adopted provision,section of article vi of the stockton city charter hereafter section,reads in relevant part no person elected as either mayor or councilmember shall be eligible to serve,or serve,as either mayor or councilmember for more than two terms 
plaintiff ralph lee white contends the measure imposes a limit on the cumulative number of terms a person may serve in elective office,no matter the combination of offices served.the city of stockton the city argues,and the trial court found,the measure does not impose a cumulative limit.we agree with the city and affirm the judgment.
background 
by petition for writ of mandate,white sought to remove real party in interest ann johnston as mayor of the city of stockton and to enjoin placing her name on the municipal election ballot of june for reelection as mayor.white contended johnston was ineligible to sit as mayor and to run for reelection under section.he argued section limited a person from serving in elected office,either as mayor or as a council member or in any combination of both,to no more than two cumulative terms.because johnston had served two terms as a council member prior to being elected mayor,white asserted she was ineligible to serve as mayor and to run for reelection.
the trial court denied white petition for an alternative writ.johnston name was placed on the june ballot,as was white,who also was running for mayor.johnston received the most votes in the election and qualified for a runoff election.white did not qualify.that november,johnston lost the general election.
following a hearing,the trial court on march,denied white petition for writ of mandate.a restriction on the constitutional right to hold public office must be expressed in unambiguous terms.the court found section was ambiguous because it did not clearly and plainly impose a cumulative term limit.it then found the city construction of section as not imposing a cumulative limit was reasonable and not clearly erroneous in light of the official ballot pamphlet used when the voters adopted section and the city consistent practice of not reading section as imposing a cumulative limit.
white appeals from the trial court judgment.
discussion 
we conclude section plain language indicates the measure applies to the offices of mayor and council member separately,not cumulatively.were we to determine the measure was ambiguous,we would reach the same conclusion.the materials before the voters when they adopted section,the city consistent interpretation and application of the measure,and other provisions of the city charter regarding elected officers,indicate the voters intended section to apply to the offices of mayor and council member separately,not cumulatively.

interpreting section on its face 
with these rules of construction in hand,we turn to section.written by the city council and approved by the electorate,it reads in pertinent part no person elected as either mayor or councilmember shall be eligible to serve,or serve,as either mayor or councilmember for more than two terms white contends section is not ambiguous,and on its face imposes a cumulative term limit on serving as an elected city official.he asserts the term either means one and the other of two or one or the other of two.he claims this definition makes it clear section prohibits candidates from serving in any combination of the two offices for more than two terms.
white also contends section second reference to mayor or council member is really a reference to an elected office on the city council,just as the measure first reference to person s elected as either mayor or councilmember can be seen as a reference to any elected member of the city council.
the measure language is clear,but it does not support white interpretation.section is addressed to certain persons.its subjects are the individuals elected as either mayor or council member,who collectively comprise the city council.however,the measure prohibits those persons from serving,or being eligible to serve,in either the office of mayor or the office of council member for more than two terms.the restriction imposes term limits based on the elected office,not on membership in the city council as a whole.
as a conjunction,the word either is used as a function word before two or more coordinate words,phrases,or clauses joined usually by or to indicate that what immediately follows is the first of two or more alternatives merriam webster collegiate dict.ed,original italics.section imposes limits on a person serving in the office of mayor,or,alternatively,the office of council member,but not on both cumulatively.
white contends that if the city council,which authored section,had intended the provision to apply to each elected office independent of the other,it could have included language expressly stating so.the lack of such language,white asserts,shows the city council intention that section apply cumulatively.to the contrary,in this instance,the lack of such language indicates the city council did not intend for section to apply cumulatively.
constitutional law requires any limitation on a citizen right to stand for election for a public office to be stated expressly and clearly.t he right to hold public office,either by election or appointment,is one of the valuable rights of citizenship the exercise of this right should not be declared prohibited or curtailed except by plain provisions of law.ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of eligibility to office.citation.carter commission on qualifications of judicial appointments cal d.the right to run for,and hold public office may be curtailed only if the law clearly so provides.woo superior court th.
