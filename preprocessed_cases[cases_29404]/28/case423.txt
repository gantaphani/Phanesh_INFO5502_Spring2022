plaintiffs rose johnson,et,a group of citizens of gainesville,georgia,appeal the district court judgment in favor of defendants robert hamrick,et,members of the gainesville city commission,on the plaintiffs civil rights challenge to gainesville method of electing city council members.see johnson hamrick,d.this appeal marks the third time that this case has come before us.see johnson hamrick,cir,unpublished opinion hamrick i johnson hamrick,cir hamrick ii.the central question since the beginning of the lawsuit has been whether the plaintiffs can show vote dilution in violation of section of the voting rights act,under the test established by the supreme court in thornburg gingles,d.
in its most recent order,on remand from hamrick ii,the district court employed the gingles test and specifically found that gainesville electoral system does not dilute minority votes.the district court also concluded that the plaintiffs could not show the discriminatory intent necessary to support their claim that gainesville system violates the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of the united states constitution.on appeal,the plaintiffs do not pursue their constitutional claim,but contend that the district court erred in finding no section violation under gingles.after thorough review,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding no vote dilution,and we therefore affirm.
the city of gainesville,georgia is governed by a city council comprised of five members.each member resides in one of the city five geographically designated wards,which serve as electoral districts.although an individual must reside in a ward in order to occupy that ward council seat,voting is conducted on an basis,meaning that all registered voters in the city can vote for every council seat.the office of the mayor rotates among the city council members and is not filled directly by popular election.administratively,the city is run by a manager who is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the city council.
figures from the census show that gainesville had a total population of,percent of which was and percent of which was white.other racial groups comprised percent of the population.of the city residents in,percent were and percent were white.by,gainesville population had grown to.according to the census,only percent of the city residents are,while percent are white and percent identify with another racial group.census results show that percent of gainesville residents are,while percent are white.currently,one of gainesville five city council members,myrtle figueras of ward,is.ward has been represented by an council member since.
this lawsuit began its long life in,when the plaintiffs filed a claim alleging that gainesville electoral system violates section and the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments by diluting minority voting power.since that time,the district court has issued three separate opinions and this court has considered two appeals.throughout the litigation,the plaintiffs have sought to show the four factors essential to proving a claim of vote dilution.as discussed in more detail infra,these factors are a sufficiently compact and numerous minority community,the existence of minority political cohesion or bloc voting,majority bloc voting,and that the totality of the circumstances indicates vote dilution.see gingles,at.at.
the district court issued its first decision in,when it held that the plaintiffs had not satisfied the third prong of gingles because they were unable to demonstrate that the white majority in gainesville voted as a bloc to defeat the minority preferred candidates.specifically,the district court found that candidates preferred by had achieved considerable success in the eight city council,or endogenous,elections reviewed,as well as in various exogenous elections,in which gainesville citizens voted for county,state,and national officials.the district court did not address the constitutional claims in its order.after the plaintiffs appealed,however,this court remanded the matter for consideration of the constitutional questions.see hamrick 
on remand,the district court reopened the case to receive evidence regarding elections that had taken place since the order.based on the new evidence,in the district court reversed its earlier determination and concluded that the plaintiffs had indeed proven a section violation under the gingles test.taking the recent elections into account,the court found that the white preferred candidate had prevailed over the candidate of choice in five of nine endogenous elections between and.the district court explained that white voters were able to elect the candidate of their choice in all eight of the elections in which they had expressed a preference,while voters were able to do so in only three campaigns.in addition to holding that the gingles test had been satisfied,the district court concluded that the totality of the circumstances weighed in favor of finding a section violation.finally,the district court rejected the defendants argument that section was unconstitutional.
in hamrick ii,this court vacated the district court order,concluding that the district court had made insufficient findings to allow proper review of the defendants arguments.stating that it lacked a sufficiently detailed explanation of the district court basis for weighing the elections under the third prong of gingles,id.at,the panel questioned the basis for the district court conclusion that the two races consistently preferred different candidates merely because they did so in five of nine endogenous elections.as a result,this court remanded the case to the district court for additional and more specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.id.at.
on remand,the district court reopened its evidentiary inquiry in order to comply with the gingles requirement that it examine the totality of the circumstances and conduct a searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality of the voting process.hamrick,d at quoting gingles,at.at.the new evidence presented to the district court in included data from the census as well as election statistics from special city council elections in march and november.the court also considered reports from election and demographic experts and gainesville city officials.
based on the evidence,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs could not prove a section violation because they failed to show consistent white bloc voting under the third prong of gingles.before reaching that issue,the district court analyzed the first two prongs of gingles in some detail,stating under the first prong that the compactness and numerosity of the community in gainesville presented a difficult question,and that,under the second prong,the community was politically cohesive internally even though there was insufficient evidence of cohesiveness between the and hispanic communities.ultimately,however,the district court did not base its decision on either of the first two prongs.instead,the court held that the plaintiffs could not prevail because the evidence did not show the existence of a white majority voting bloc.focusing entirely on endogenous elections for city council,the district court concluded that the evidence did not support a finding that the candidate preferred by the white majority usually defeats the candidate supported by.to the contrary,based on the extremely close percentage figures for white and preferences in various campaigns,the court suggested that the interests of the white and communities might in fact be merging in gainesville.because it held that the plaintiffs could not satisfy the third gingles prong,the district court did not address the totality of the circumstances argument in any detail,but noted a lack of evidence of racial appeals in gainesville elections and the fact that the city council is percent while the city itself is only percent.after rejecting the plaintiffs section argument,the district court held that the gainesville electoral system does not violate the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.
in appealing the district court order,the plaintiffs challenge only the determination that the gainesville electoral system does not violate section.this provision of the voting rights act states,in relevant part 
a no voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,practice,or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any state or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the united states to vote on account of race or color,or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section f of this title,as provided in subsection b of this section.
b a violation of subsection a of this section is established if,based on the totality of circumstances,it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection a of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.the extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the state or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered provided,that nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.
it has long been recognized that multimember districts and voting schemes may operate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial minorities in the voting population.gingles,at.at quoting burns richardson,d internal quotations omitted.this is because where minority and majority voters consistently prefer different candidates,the majority,by virtue of its numerical superiority,will regularly defeat the choices of minority voters.id.at.at.however,m ultimember districts and election schemes are not per se violative of minority voters rights.id.to the contrary,m inority voters who contend that the multimember form of districting violates must prove that the use of a multimember electoral structure operates to minimize or cancel out their ability to elect their preferred candidates.id.punctuation altered.
in gingles,the supreme court held that,in order to find the minimization or cancellation of minority power in an electoral system using multimember districts or voting,a court must determine that a bloc voting majority is usually able to defeat candidates supported by a politically cohesive,geographically insular minority group.id.at.at emphasis in original.plaintiffs seeking to make this showing must meet a test.first,the minority group must prove that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district.id.at.at.if the group can not make this showing,it is apparent that the multimember or nature of the electoral system is not responsible for the candidates lack of success.second,the minority group must be able to show that it is politically cohesive.id.at.at.third,the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable the absence of special circumstances,such as the minority candidate running to defeat the minority preferred candidate.at citation omitted.
the supreme court has explained that i n establishing this last circumstance,the minority group demonstrates that submergence in a white multimember district impedes its ability to elect its chosen representative.at.the three factors articulated in gingles have come to be known as compactness or numerosity,minority cohesion or bloc voting,and majority bloc voting.see,johnson de grandy,d.ultimately,proving all three gingles factors is not the end of the story.negron city of miami beach,cir.even if the plaintiffs prove that the three conditions are met,a court can not find a section violation unless it looks at the totality of the circumstances and determines that there has been impermissible vote dilution.see id 
significantly,a court can not find vote dilution unless the plaintiffs prove all of the necessary factors.if any one of the gingles prongs is not established,there is no vote dilution.see,gingles,at.at describing the three factors as necessary preconditions for finding vote dilution negron,at because we hold that the district court correctly determined that plaintiffs had failed to establish the first gingles precondition,it is unnecessary for us to review its other determinations.in this case,the district court based its decision that there was no vote dilution primarily on its finding that the plaintiffs could not show white bloc voting under the third gingles factor.see d at.because,as discussed below,the district court findings of fact and analysis of the third gingles prong were not erroneous,we affirm the district court judgment without addressing the first two prongs or the totality of the circumstances.our analysis focuses entirely on the third prong.
as we explained in hamrick ii,plaintiffs seeking to establish the third gingles factor must show not only that whites vote as a bloc,but also that white bloc voting regularly causes the candidate preferred by black voters to lose in addition,plaintiffs must show not only that blacks and whites sometimes prefer different candidates,but that blacks and whites consistently prefer different candidates.at emphases in original.because the section analysis is concerned with more than the results of any individual election,a pattern of racial bloc voting that extends over a period of time is more probative of a claim that a district experiences legally significant polarization than are the results of a single election.gingles,at.at emphasis added.similarly,the fact that racial polarization is not present in one or a small number of campaigns or the fact that a minority candidate achieves success in a given election does not necessarily negate the conclusion that the district experiences legally significant bloc voting.at.what matters under the third prong of gingles are larger trends,and it is important to bear in mind that such factors as incumbency,the absence of an opponent,or the use of bullet voting might explain divergences in individual elections.see id.
a district court determination regarding one of the gingles prongs is entitled to considerable deference.as the supreme court and this court have established,we review the district court findings on a section vote dilution claim for clear error.see hamrick ii,at citing.a gingles,at.at.under this standard,a finding of fact is clearly erroneous only if the record lacks substantial evidence to support it.lightning roadway express,cir quotations omitted.the supreme court has explained in the section context that rule a does not inhibit an appellate court power to correct errors of law,including those that may infect a mixed finding of law and fact,or a finding of fact that is predicated on a misunderstanding of the governing rule of law.gingles,at.at quoting bose consumers union of,d.
when we examine a district court findings in a section case,it is essential to remember that the clearly erroneous standard preserves the benefit of the trial court particular familiarity with the indigenous political reality of the state or local government under review.id.deference is afforded the district court findings due to its special vantage point and ability to conduct an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of a voting system.negron,at quotations omitted.unless we are compelled to conclude that the district court findings are not supported by substantial evidence,we must affirm.
in this case,the district court conclusions regarding the third gingles prong were not clearly erroneous.as part of the most recent proceedings,which were held on remand from hamrick ii,the district court considered extensive evidence concerning this prong,including information already in the record about elections between and,as well as information presented about two special city council elections that took place in.the district court also considered reports and testimony from the parties election experts,michael maggiotto for the defendants and richard engstrom for the plaintiffs.only maggiotto prepared estimates of racial voting in the two endogenous elections.the district court noted these results along with results from the nine other contested endogenous elections in the record from the previous proceedings in the case 
in his report and testimony,maggiotto explained that racial preferences could be determined in nine of these eleven elections.he could discern no preference in the ward election because he could find no precinct with a sufficiently large community and there was no preference in the ward election because no candidate received a majority of the vote.for the remaining nine elections,maggiotto explained that the candidate preferred by a majority of voters prevailed five times,or percent of the time ward,ward,ward,ward,ward.he also noted that in two of the remaining four elections ward runoff and ward,the winning candidate received only percent and percent of the white vote respectively,indicating that the white community may not have voted as a bloc.removing these two elections from the equation,maggiotto determined that the candidate favored by the community won in five of seven relevant elections,or percent of the time.
testifying for the plaintiffs,engstrom did not offer any alternative voting pattern statistics.instead,he argued that maggiotto had erred in his analysis of the two elections.first,engstrom claimed that the ward election,in which the candidate preferred by voters defeated the candidate preferred by a slim majority of white voters,should not be treated as a election one in which the majority of voters and the majority of white voters preferred different candidates.second,engstrom argued that maggiotto analysis of the ward election was flawed because the analysis should have been based on voter turnout rather than voter registration.finally,engstrom argued that the elections were not probative because they did not involve any candidates.
in its findings of fact,the district court generally accepted maggiotto analysis.the court explained that,excluding the ward election in which no preference could be discerned,candidates preferred by voters prevailed in five of eleven campaigns,or percent,and lost in another five,or percent.although the preferred candidate also received the majority of white votes in four of these five elections,the preferred candidate won without a majority of the white votes in the ward election.in two of the five elections in which the white preferred candidate prevailed over the candidate preferred by,the margin between the races was narrow.in the ward runoff,the winning candidate received percent of the white vote and percent of the vote.in the ward campaign,the winner earned percent of the white vote and percent of the vote.of the six elections in which the races expressed different preferences,three were clearly elections in which the white candidate won ward,ward,and ward,while three were closer,arguably elections.the white preferred candidate won two of the arguably elections ward runoff and ward,while the preferred candidate won one ward.the district court noted that the significance of the one election in which the preferred candidate won was diminished by the fact that the candidate was an incumbent.see d at.
the elections that raised the greatest concern for the district court were the ward campaigns in and,which were the only endogenous elections involving any candidates.although both candidates,incumbent john morrow and challenger rose johnson,were,the results show a clear white preference for morrow,the winning candidate,and a clear preference for johnson,who was defeated.despite recognizing that these elections present the most polarized voting data,d at,the district court concluded that they did not support a finding of white bloc voting.while it is possible that the results show white bloc voting to defeat an candidate preferred by voters,the district court suggested that the results could be explained equally by morrow long incumbency.the court also noted that,because the two campaigns involved the same two candidates,their results may be merely duplicative.id.at.because it found no evidence,testimonial or otherwise,supporting either the bloc voting explanation or the incumbency explanation,the court determined that these two elections ultimately are not more probative than the other endogenous elections.id.in addition,the district court observed that w hen viewed in conjunction with the most recent election evidence and the election evidence as a whole,these two instances of polarized voting appear isolated.there is nothing to indicate that these elections were part of or started a trend.id.
based on these findings of fact,the district court concluded that it does not appear that the white majority usually defeats the candidate preferred by black voters.indeed,the candidate preferred by black voters wins as often as he or she loses,of the time.id.emphasis in original.furthermore,the court held that the evidence indicated that the interests of the black and white communities may be merging,as evidenced by the fact that and white voters preferred the same candidates in four elections and that in another three elections white preference was just over percent while the preference was just under percent.in light of these findings,the district court determined that the plaintiffs could not show white bloc voting and could therefore not meet the third prong of gingles 
the plaintiffs argue that this determination was erroneous because the district court failed to give adequate weight to elections involving candidates,improperly evaluated elections,and placed too much emphasis on a simple mathematical approach.we are unpersuaded.
first,as a matter of fact,the district court did not clearly err in declining to afford special weight to the two endogenous elections involving candidates.although we have on various occasions held that district courts deciding vote dilution claims may give more weight to elections involving candidates than those involving all white contestants,see,davis chiles,cir southern christian leadership conference sessions,cir,there is no requirement that a district court must do so.in fact,the panel in hamrick ii expressly stated that w e do not mean to imply that district courts should give elections involving black candidates more weight rather,we merely note that in light of existing case law district courts may do so without committing clear error.at emphasis in original.
although a district court is free to accord extra weight to campaigns involving minority candidates,plainly it is not required to do so,especially when,as in this case,there are compelling reasons to question the probative value of such elections.while it is true that one could infer from the results of the and elections between morrow and johnson that white citizens voted as a bloc to defeat the candidate of choice of the community,there is an equally plausible explanation that white voters supported the incumbent morrow in and maintained their support for him in.as the district court found in its thorough analysis of these campaigns,nothing in the record compelled one conclusion over the other.
the plaintiffs argue,however,that the district court overemphasized morrow incumbency and thus violated our admonition that incumbency should not be viewed as a talisman by courts,sufficient in and of itself to deem an election involving an incumbent irrelevant to a plaintiff vote dilution claim.nipper smith,cir en banc.contrary to the plaintiffs characterizations,however,the district court did not improperly rely on morrow incumbency.rather than deeming the and ward elections irrelevant or discounting them on this basis,the court merely cited the incumbency as one part of its rationale for not affording extra weight to those campaigns.in so doing,the district court complied with the command of gingles,which cautions courts to take one candidate incumbency into account when deciding whether an election shows the existence of white bloc voting.see gingles,at.at see also abrams johnson,d stating that,under gingles,incumbency is a special circumstance to
