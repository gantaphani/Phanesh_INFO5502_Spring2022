the narrator states she questioned the constitutionality of laws prohibiting sex with children under fourteen.this statement is made while a graphic shows questioned laws protecting our children.
the narrator states and she called the electric chair silly.this statement is made while a graphic shows called electric chair silly.
on july,the jqc received three complaints about the television advertisement.after reviewing these complaints,the special committee concluded that the television advertisement violated its previous cease and desist request regarding the first brochure.on july,the special committee issued a public statement to the media,in accordance with rule b a,which stated that weaver had intentionally and blatantly violated the original cease and desist request and deliberately engaged in unethical,unfair,false and intentionally deceptive campaign practices.in the election held six days later,weaver was defeated by justice sears.on july,the jqc forwarded its materials on weaver to the general counsel for the state bar of georgia for possible disciplinary action under standard.
on july,one day after the special committee issued its public statement,weaver,joined by john traylor,a registered voter in georgia brought this law suit against the members of the special committee and the director of the jqc in both their individual and official capacities.they alleged that canons b d and b and rule unconstitutionally interfere with free speech on their face and as applied to them by the special committee,and requested injunctive relief,damages,and a special election.on august,the individual defendants moved the court to dismiss the complaint,contending among other things that,as sued in their official capacities,they were immune from suit under the eleventh amendment,and as sued in their individual capacities they were entitled to qualified immunity.
following some reciprocal discovery,the plaintiffs obtained leave of court to file a second amended complaint,which added the state bar of georgia as a party defendant at the same time,the court addressed the defendants claims of immunity from suit.on march,the court granted the individual defendants qualified immunity with respect to the plaintiffs claims for damages,rejected the defendants remaining grounds for dismissal,and denied the plaintiffs request for a special election.the court denied that request because plaintiffs had not shown extraordinary circumstances that would entitle them to a special election.specifically,they had not alleged,much less established,that georgia voters were deprived of an election,nor did they allege voter fraud,vote dilution,or any similar scheme that would require a special election.
after receiving for summary judgment,the district court,in an order entered on august,concluded that canon b d is facially unconstitutional because it chills core political speech and violates the overbreadth doctrine by prohibiting false statements of fact made without knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity the court was not persuaded,however,that canon b and rule violate the first amendment.in the court view,both are narrowly tailored to serve the compelling interest of preserving the integrity and independence of georgia judiciary finally,the court found that the process afforded a candidate standing in weaver shoes by rule is constitutionally adequate on august,the court entered final judgment,echoing these rulings.the plaintiffs now appeal the district court rejection of their challenges to canon b and rule,their request for a special election,and their claims for damages against the individual defendants in their capacities.the defendants the district court decision invalidating canon b d.
the first amendment provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech const.amend.i.this prohibition on laws abridging the freedom of speech has been incorporated into the fourteenth amendment so that it also applies to state governments.an overbreadth challenge is based on a statute possible direct and indirect burdens on speech.united states acheson,cir quoting am.booksellers webb,cir.the overbreadth doctrine permits the facial invalidation of laws that inhibit the exercise of first amendment rights if the impermissible applications of the law are substantial when judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.city of chicago morales,d quoting broadrick oklahoma,d.the doctrine is designed to protect the public from the chilling effect such a statute has on protected speech the court will strike down the statute even though the governmental entity enforced the statute against those engaged in unprotected activities.acheson,at quoting nationalist movement city of cumming,cir tjoflat,dissenting.
a candidate speech during an election campaign occupies the core of the protection afforded by the first amendment.mcintyre ohio elections comm n,d.the proper test to be applied to determine the constitutionality of restrictions on core political speech is strict scrutiny.id.under strict scrutiny analysis,the government has the burden of proving that the restriction is narrowly tailored,to serve a compelling state interest.republican party of minnesota white,d see also brown hartlage,d when a state seeks to restrict directly the offer of ideas by a candidate to the voters,the first amendment surely requires that the restriction be demonstrably supported by not only a legitimate state interest,but a compelling one,and that the restriction operate without unnecessarily circumscribing protected expression.
appellees contend that canon b d is narrowly tailored to serve georgia compelling interests of preserving the integrity,impartiality,and independence of the judiciary and ensuring the integrity of the electoral process and protecting voters from confusion and undue influence.appellees br.at.we disagree.
although georgia asserted interests may be compelling,canon b d is not narrowly tailored to serve those interests because,by prohibiting false statements negligently made and true statements that are misleading or deceptive,canon b d does not afford the requisite breathing space to protected speech.see brown,at.at.it is true that false statements are not entitled to the same level of first amendment protection as truthful statements.see id.at.at citing gertz robert welch,d.moreover,false statements made by candidates during political campaigns may have serious adverse consequences for the public at large.mcintyre,at.at.nevertheless,erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate,and it must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the breathing space that they need to survive.brown,at.at quoting times sullivan,d quoting naacp button,d.the chilling effect of absolute accountability for factual misstatements in the course of political debate is incompatible with the atmosphere of free discussion contemplated by the first amendment in the context of political campaigns.id.at.at.therefore,to be narrowly tailored,restrictions on candidate speech during political campaigns must be limited to false statements that are made with knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard as to whether the statement is,an actual malice standard.see id.restrictions on negligently made false statements are not narrowly tailored under this standard and consequently violate the first amendment.see id.at.at.
in brown,the supreme court held that it was unconstitutional for a kentucky appeals court to void a county commissioner election after the kentucky appeals court found that the winning candidate violated the kentucky corrupt practices act by stating during his campaign that he would work for a reduced salary unbeknownst to the candidate,this statement was false because the commissioner salary was fixed by law.id.at.at.the court held that,as applied,the kentucky corrupt practices act did not afford the requisite breathing space to core political speech because it prohibited and punished false factual statements that were made without knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard as to whether they were false.see id.at.at.the court noted that i n a political campaign,a candidate factual blunder is unlikely to escape the notice of,and correction by,the erring candidate political opponent.the preferred first amendment remedy of more speech,not enforced silence,whitney california.brandeis,concurring,thus has special force.id.
on its face,canon b d has the effect of chilling even more core political speech than the statute that was held unconstitutional in brown.canon b d not only prohibits false statements knowingly or recklessly made,it also prohibits false statements negligently made and true statements that are misleading or deceptive or contain a material misrepresentation or omit a material fact or create an unjustified expectation about results.see of judicial conduct canon b d.for fear of violating these broad prohibitions,candidates will too often remain silent even when they have a good faith belief that what they would otherwise say is truthful.this dramatic chilling effect can not be justified by georgia interest in maintaining judicial impartiality and electoral integrity.negligent misstatements must be protected in order to give protected speech the breathing space it requires.the ability of an opposing candidate to correct negligent misstatements with more speech more than offsets the danger of a misinformed electorate that might result from tolerating negligent misstatements.
moreover,we are not convinced that georgia interest in judicial impartiality is substantially advanced by canon b d because the risks georgia is concerned with are not limited to campaign practices by judicial candidates.it is the general practice of electing judges,not the specific practice of judicial campaigning,that gives rise to impartiality concerns because the practice of electing judges creates motivations for sitting judges and prospective judges in election years and years to say and do things that will enhance their chances of being elected.see white.at,concurring i am concerned that,even aside from what judicial candidates may say while campaigning,the very practice of electing judges undermines this interest in preserving judicial impartiality by choosing to popularly elect judges the state has voluntarily taken on the risks to judicial bias described above if the state has a problem with judicial impartiality,it is largely one the state brought upon itself by continuing the practice of popularly electing judges.
appellees argue that we should adopt a lower standard for judicial elections than for other types of elections because speech by judicial candidates is entitled to less protection than speech by legislative and executive candidates.we disagree.although there is some support for appellees position,see,buckley.judicial inquiry,cir judges remain different from legislators and executive officials,even when all are elected,in ways that bear on the strength in the state interest in restricting their freedom of speech,we believe that the supreme court decision in white suggests that the standard for judicial elections should be the same as the standard for legislative and executive elections.in white,the court struck down minnesota announce clause which prohibited a judicial candidate from announc ing his or her views on disputed legal or political issues.at quoting of judicial conduct canon a d i.in reaching its decision,the court was not required to decide whether the first amendment allows greater regulation of judicial election campaigns than legislative election campaigns because,even if this were true,the minnesota law still fa
