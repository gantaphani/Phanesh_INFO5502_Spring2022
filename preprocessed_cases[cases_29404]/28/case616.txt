this direct appeal involves the construction and constitutionality of section of the texas election code,which prohibits a person from appearing on the general election ballot as a candidate for a political party other than the party holding the primary in which the person voted or was a candidate.a.there are two issues in this appeal whether section can reasonably be construed to permit judge david hodges to appear as a democratic party candidate in the november election even though he voted in the republican party primary,and if not,whether the statute as applied to judge hodges violates either the texas or united states constitutions.the trial court rendered judgment that section is unconstitutional as applied to judge hodges under the specific and unique facts of this case.we conclude that section can not reasonably be construed to permit judge hodges to be a democratic party general election candidate when he voted in the republican party primary and that the statute is not unconstitutional as applied to him.accordingly,we reverse the trial court judgment and render judgment that judge hodges is ineligible for a place on the november general election ballot as a democratic party candidate.
background 
david hodges is the incumbent judge of mclennan county court at law.he has served in that capacity for about twenty years.in march,judge hodges again ran for his office in the democratic party primary.he was unopposed and,therefore,received the democratic party nomination for judge of mclennan county court at law.
however,rather than casting a vote in the march democratic party primary,judge hodges decided to vote for his friend,jim meyer,who was running in a contested race for district judge in the republican party primary.after discovering that judge hodges voted in the republican party primary,the mclennan county democratic party chair,john cullar,informed judge hodges that section left him no discretion but to remove judge hodges from the november general election ballot as the democratic party nominee.it is undisputed that judge hodges would be eligible to run as the democratic party candidate for county court at law judge in the general election but for section.it is also undisputed that absent section judge hodges would be guaranteed reelection because he has no opposition in the general election.
before cullar issued a declaration of ineligibility,judge hodges filed a declaratory judgment action,asking the trial court to declare that section does not render him ineligible to be a democratic party candidate and to enjoin cullar from declaring him ineligible.the trial court disagreed with judge hodges statutory construction argument and denied his request for a temporary injunction.
after the trial court ruling on judge hodges statutory construction argument,cullar issued a notice of administrative declaration of ineligibility,declaring judge hodges ineligible for a place on the general election ballot.thereafter,judge hodges amended his petition,claiming that section is unconstitutional as written and as applied to him.although judge hodges amended petition did not cite the provisions of the texas and united states constitutions that section allegedly violates,his trial court brief stated that the statute impermissibly burdens his right to vote and violates his substantive due process rights.the state of texas intervened,arguing for the statute constitutionality.
after a trial,the trial court held section unconstitutional as applied to judge hodges under the specific and unique facts of this case.the trial court rendered judgment,permanently enjoining the mclennan county democratic party from declaring judge hodges ineligible for a place on the november general election ballot as the democratic party candidate for judge of mclennan county court at law based on his participation in the republican party primary.the state of texas,cullar,and the mclennan county democratic party appellants filed direct appeals to this court.by,judge hodges reasserted his statutory construction argument as an alternative basis for upholding the trial court judgment,but he did not argue that section is facially unconstitutional.we noted probable jurisdiction and set the case for oral argument.

statutory construction 
section a provides 
restrictions on candidacy in general election by candidate or voter in primary 
a a person who voted at a primary election or who was a candidate for nomination in a primary is ineligible for a place on the ballot for the succeeding general election for state and county officers as the nominee of a political party other than the party holding the primary in which the person voted or was a candidate.
a.section a prohibits a primary candidate from later running for the same office as an independent,and section b prohibits a primary candidate from later running for the same office as a candidate.these sore loser provisions of section are not at issue in this case.
judge hodges argues that section a is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,including an interpretation that would render him eligible to participate in the november general election as a democratic party candidate.specifically,he contends that section a allows primary voters and primary candidates to be eligible as candidates in the general election for either the party holding the primary in which the individual voted or the party holding the primary in which the individual was a candidate.judge hodges argues that section a permits him to be a candidate for either the republican party because that is the party primary in which he voted or the democratic party because he was a candidate in its party primary,but prohibits him from acting as a candidate for any other party such as the libertarian party,the socialist party,or the green party.
appellants argue that section a is clearly an ineligibility statute rather than an eligibility statute,as judge hodges apparently construes it.according to appellants,the statute plain and unambiguous meaning is that an otherwise eligible candidate is ineligible if the candidate either votes in another political party primary or runs as a candidate in another political party primary.while judge hodges is not ineligible by virtue of the crossover candidacy element of section a,he is ineligible by virtue of the crossover voting element.appellants also point out that both the secretary of state and the attorney general have adopted this construction,see op.sec y state no.op.att y,and they urge us to defer to these prior administrative interpretations.
when we construe a statute,our primary goal is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature intent in enacting it.in re canales.we determine the legislature intent by examining the language used in the statute within the context of the entire statute.upjohn rylander.if a statute is clear and unambiguous,we need not resort to rules of construction or other aids to construe it.id.even then,however,we may consider,among other things,the statute objectives and the consequences of a particular construction.see.gov t code in re canales,at.in election cases,however,we are constrained in our interpretation by the principle that any statutory provision that restricts the right to hold office must be strictly construed against ineligibility.wentworth meyer.therefore,if section a is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we must apply the least exclusionary interpretation.
applying these principles,we agree with appellants that the statute precludes judge hodges from running as a democratic party nominee in the general election based on his participation in the republican party primary.although judge hodges proposed construction of the statute is a possible reading,it is not a reasonable one because it conflicts with the election code overall structure and the limiting language within the statute itself.
first,judge hodges construction of section would allow a prospective candidate to hedge his or her candidacy options for a particular office by voting in the primary of one political party and aligning as a primary candidate with another political party.if the prospective candidate lost a party nomination in the primary,judge hodges construction of section a would affirmatively authorize the prospective candidate to seek the same office as a candidate for another political party.that interpretation is antithetical to the statute most obvious and laudable purpose,which is to prevent candidates from having more than one bite at the apple in a single election year by precluding a primary candidate from running in the general election for the same office as an independent,a candidate,or a candidate for any other political party that nominates its candidates by primary election.see.a,b see also comm.of the taxpayers party garza,holding that the provisions of section are reasonable,nondiscriminatory,and constitutional.although the statute sore loser aspect is not implicated under the facts of this case,the possibility that such a situation could occur under judge hodges proposed construction of the statute precludes us from giving effect to that construction.
second,other election code provisions suggest that the code is structured to prevent the affiliation or alignment that judge hodges interpretation would allow.for example,the code provides that an individual can only affiliate with one political party per election cycle and precludes a person from voting in the primary of one political party and then voting in a primary for another political party.see.although the election code does not explicitly characterize party candidacy as affiliation with a political party,it is evident from the cited provisions that the code requires voters and candidates to align themselves with a single party for an entire election cycle for purposes of nominating candidates to run in the general election.
furthermore,judge hodges interpretation would permit a candidate who crossover votes to serve as a candidate for two different parties at the same time a result at odds with the election code party purity scheme.moreover,by voting in a political party primary,one becomes legally affiliated with that party.party affiliation potentially brings access to the integral workings of the party.see.a requiring party affiliation to serve as a delegate to or to participate in a party convention,to be a member on a state executive committee,or to be appointed to fill a vacancy on a county executive committee,b to be eligible to serve as a presidential elector for a political party,a person must be affiliated with the party.it is inconceivable that the legislature would affirmatively authorize a person to participate significantly in the affairs of one political party while running for office as another political party candidate.
finally,the language and title of section clearly demonstrate an intent to restrict prospective candidacies to a single party during an election cycle.the statute plainly states that a prospective candidate is eligible to be a candidate in the general election only for the party holding the primary in which the person voted or was a candidate,not a party or any party.
for these reasons,we can not accept judge hodges proposed construction of section.
constitutional challenge 
the parties agree that the proper test for determining the constitutionality of section a is the balancing test articulated in anderson celebrezze,d.the parties disagree,however,on how to apply that test in this case.
the united states supreme court has repeatedly stated that not every election regulation that impinges a fundamental right requires strict scrutiny and that there is no test for determining whether election regulations are constitutional.see,id.rather,a more flexible standard applies.the supreme court succinctly enunciated that standard as follows 
a s the full court agreed in anderson a court considering a challenge to a state election law must weigh the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate against the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,taking into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff rights.
burdick takushi,d citing anderson and holding hawaii ban on candidacies constitutional under the anderson balancing test.under the anderson balancing test,if a regulation severely restricts first and fourteenth amendment rights,the regulation must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.id.but when a state election law provision imposes only reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions upon the first and fourteenth amendment rights of voters,the state important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions.id.
in determining the relative importance of the interests the state advances,the state need not produce empirical evidence that the harm the statute is designed to avoid has actually occurred.munro socialist workers party,d.moreover,a statute does not fail merely because it is underinclusive and does not eliminate all types of conduct that could produce the same evil to which the statute is directed.clements fashing,d the state need not run the risk of losing an entire remedial scheme simply because it failed,through inadvertence or otherwise,to cover every evil that might conceivably have been attacked.the main issues here are whether the statute burdens a candidate right to vote or his right to be a candidate and how severe the burden is,whether the state interests are sufficiently important or compelling under the particular circumstances in this case,and whether section is reasonable and nondiscriminatory as applied to judge hodges.
does the statute burden a candidate right to vote if so,how severe is the burden 
judge hodges argues that section restricts the right of a person who seeks access to the general election ballot to vote because the statute restricts a candidate to voting only in the primary of the party in which he wishes to be a candidate in the general election.further,he argues that the section prohibits an independent candidate from voting in the primary of any party for any office.he also argues that the penalty imposed for violating this restriction is severe,namely,forfeiture of a nomination for public office.judge hodges asserts that the restriction is even more severe in his case because he is a incumbent who was guaranteed reelection but will now be defrocked of his position and livelihood because of section a.according to judge hodges,this severe restriction on the right to vote warrants strict scrutiny and can not survive unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.
appellants counter that judge hodges misidentif ies the injury when he claims that section a severely burdens his right to vote.instead,appellants argue,it is judge hodges candidacy that is burdened because of his crossover voting.because ca
