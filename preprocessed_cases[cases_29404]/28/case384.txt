background 
in october,the voters of albuquerque approved an amendment to the albuquerque city charter to require photo identification for voters in all municipal elections.see albuquerque,city charter,art.xiii,as amended.as stated in the city council bill submitting the amendment to the voters,the purpose of the amendment is to prevent voter fraud,specifically identity impersonation at polling locations.the amendment provides numerous examples of acceptable forms of photo identification any card issued by a government agency,driver license,student identification card,commercial transaction card such as a credit or debit card,insurance card,union card,a professional association card or the voter identification card issued by the city clerk.if a voter does not have an identification card,the amendment provides that a voter may cast a provisional ballot at the polling location after completing a affidavit as to identity,date of birth,and the last four digits of a social security number.the vote will then be counted once the individual presents photo identification to the city clerk within ten days of the election date.additionally,the city clerk provides free photo identification cards at any time,including on the day of an election and during the period following an election.aplt.br.at.the law,however,does not cover absentee voters because it is intended specifically to address the fraud and impersonation that may result from voting.
in a complaint,plaintiffs contended that the amendment violated the first and fourteenth amendments,the civil rights act of,and the voting rights act of.by stipulation of the parties,the district court dismissed all but the equal protection and first amendment claims contained in counts i and vi.following discovery,both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.on february,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the equal protection claim and in favor of defendants on the first amendment claim.santillanes,d at.this appeal followed.
after the district court opinion,but prior to oral argument in this case,the supreme court decided crawford.the court upheld an indiana photo identification requirement,similar to albuquerque,against a facial equal protection challenge.crawford.at.the indiana law required all voters to present a photo identification.in the lead opinion,joined by chief justice roberts and justice kennedy,justice stevens rejected the facial challenge to the law.justice stevens reaffirmed the court earlier decisions,including burdick takushi,d,which held that the appropriate standard for evaluating constitutional challenges to a regulation affecting the right to vote is to balance the restrictions imposed by the regulation against its justifications.crawford.at.in a concurring opinion joined by justice thomas and justice alito,justice scalia held that any burden imposed by the photo identification law was minimal and justified without regard to any individual effects of the provision on certain voters.id.at.according to justice scalia,the law is a generally applicable,nondiscriminatory voting regulation,and t he burden of acquiring,possessing,and showing a free photo identification is simply not severe in comparison to the usual burdens associated with voting.id.at.nevertheless,under justice stevens opinion,the court balanced the asserted injury to the right to vote against the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.after a detailed weighing of the burdens imposed by the law,the justifications for the law,and the accommodations made for particularly situated voters,justice stevens held that the burden of presenting photo identification at a polling place imposes only a limited burden on voters rights,id.at quoting burdick,at,and that the justifications for indiana law were both neutral and sufficiently strong to uphold the law.id.at.

we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.timmerman bank,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.scott harris,d.
on appeal,the city argues that the district court erred in holding that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge the voter identification law,and that the law violates equal protection.concerning the second argument,the city argues that a the law properly distinguishes between and absentee voters,b the district court erred in applying a heightened standard of review,c the current valid photo identification requirement is not unconstitutionally vague,d the help america vote act hava and the amendments to new mexico election code concerning voter identification do not conflict with the law,e the city was not required to show that the state failed to comply with hava prior to imposing the law,and f the district court other justifications should be rejected.

three individuals and three organizations are plaintiffs.the individual plaintiffs,ann kass,alexandra kazaras,and barbara grothus,live in albuquerque and intend to vote in future municipal elections.the organizational plaintiffs include the league of women voters of county,sage council,and the new mexico coalition to end homelessness the league of women voters is a organization that engages in various voter education programs and consists of individuals who are registered to vote and do vote in local elections,see also santillanes,d at.sage council is an organization dedicated to protecting the voting rights of native americans and conducts activities to educate and increase participation among native american voters,see also santillanes,d at.finally,the new mexico coalition to end homelessness is a organization dedicated to serving,representing,and advocating for the homeless,see also santillanes,d at.some of the coalition members focus on registering homeless individuals to vote,see also santillanes d at.
plaintiffs have presented evidence that they and their members intend to vote in future elections.see.they contend that the individual plaintiffs possess photo identifications that may or may not be deemed current or valid by an albuquerque election official.for example,some of the plaintiffs do not have photo identifications that match their current physical appearance,and another plaintiff has an driver license.see,grothus aff,kazaras aff.additionally,the new mexico coalition to end homelessness maintains that homeless populations have a particularly difficult time obtaining and keeping photo identification.hughes dep.
as in many cases challenging aspects of voting,plaintiffs can not identify a single individual who would not vote,let alone not vote because of the measure.see,crawford marion county election,cir,aff,d stewart blackwell,cir,vacated as moot,cir sandusky county democratic party blackwell,cir per curiam.we agree with the city that the fact that plaintiffs might be personally offended by the requirement of showing photo identification or philosophically opposed to it is insufficient to confer standing.aplt.br.at.as far as we can tell,no individual lacks photo identification,although the individual plaintiffs suggest that the photo identification that they do have will confound election judges,potentially result in arbitrary enforcement of the requirement,and result in unequal treatment as compared to those who vote absentee where there is no such requirement.
standing is not a proxy for ruling on the merits and is determined at the outset of the lawsuit.see whitmore arkansas,d our threshold inquiry into standing in no way depends on the merits of the petitioner contention that particular conduct is illegal,quoting warth seldin,d alteration in original matheson,d s tanding is a jurisdictional issue,separate and distinct from the merits.though many of the burdens identified by the plaintiffs now have a different legal significance given the supreme court decision in crawford,we are satisfied that,at the outset of this litigation,the evidence supporting the plaintiffs claim of unequal treatment of voters absentee voters is sufficient injury to confer standing,and the relief requested would solve the perceived problem.the injury in fact is the denial of equal treatment.ne.chapter of associated contractors of am.jacksonville,d.although the city argues that the bases identified by the district court to show injury are speculative or,aplt.br.at,the fact remains that the individual plaintiffs will still be required to present photo identification that must be accepted if they vote whereas those voting absentee will not.because standing exists at least for purposes of the individual plaintiffs and the equal protection claim,we now turn to the merits.see crawford,at where only injunctive relief sought,only one plaintiff must demonstrate standing.
ii.equal protection 
the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment states that n o state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend.xiv.
unless a statute being challenged on equal protection grounds jeopardizes exercise of a fundamental right or categorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic,it will be presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
coal.for equal rights,ritter,cir quoting nordlinger hahn,d,and city of cleburne cleburne living,d internal citations omitted.as the supreme court recently confirmed in crawford,the appropriate test when addressing an equal protection challenge to a law affecting a person right to vote is to weigh the asserted injury to the right to vote against the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.crawford.at internal quotation marks omitted.the city raises several arguments for why the district court erred in holding that the law violates equal protection.we address each argument in turn.
a.the law properly distinguishes between and absentee voters 
the city first argues that the law properly distinguishes between and absentee voters.although the district court ostensibly restricted its equal protection analysis to the treatment among voters,d at,it also found that the risk of impersonation was far greater with absentee voting procedures and that tended to undermine the city rationale for the measure,id.at.plaintiffs contend on appeal that the albuquerque law creates an arbitrary distinction between and absentee voters by only requiring voters to present photo identification.they argue that because any registered voter in albuquerque may choose to vote absentee,stat.a,unlike indiana where only certain classes of individuals are eligible to vote absentee,there is greater opportunity for mischief creating a greater need to treat all voters alike.aplee.supp.br.at.further,plaintiffs argue that absentee voters who ultimately present their ballots will not be subject to the photo identification requirement.aplee.supp.br.at.plaintiffs claim that such different treatment of absentee persons who vote from voters is without justification.we must disagree.
absentee voting is a fundamentally different process from voting,and is governed by procedures entirely distinct from voting procedures.see.democratic party rokita,d,absentee voting is an inherently different procedure from voting,aff sub nom.crawford marion county election,cir,aff,d.although the district court distinguished rokita on the basis that indiana law was more restrictive on who was eligible to vote absentee,the fact remains that nothing suggests that absentee ballot fraud would be limited by a requirement that applied to absentee voting.see crawford,at.as the city argues,w hile requiring absentee voters to enclose a copy of photo identification with their ballots would provide election officials with a trustworthy source to establish a link with the name of the registered voter,the absence of a person standing before election officials precludes linking the enclosed identification with the person actually casting the ballot.aplt.br.at.furthermore,the unique procedures for absentee voting allow for a separate process confirming the identification of a voter.see,stat.requiring an absentee voter to fill out an application with personal identification information.because all registered voters in albuquerque have the option of voting or by absentee ballot,voters may choose which set of procedures to follow.
thus we are unpersuaded by plaintiffs argument that the law treats absentee voters who ultimately cast their ballot differently than voters.aplee.supp.br.at.the law clearly applies to all voters at polling locations,and therefore we read the law to require any person,including a voter who applied for an absentee ballot but later votes due to not receiving an absentee ballot,to present photo identification.further,individuals who obtained an absentee ballot and merely arrive to drop off the ballot at the city clerk office have already subjected themselves to the separate absentee voter procedures necessary to confirm the voter identification.
additionally,we recognize that states have wide latitude in determining how to manage election procedures.see buckley am.constitutional law,d states have considerable leeway to protect the integrity and reliability of election processes generally.states may also take reform one step at a time,and need not cover every evil that might conceivably be attacked.mcdonald chicago bd.of election comm rs,d internal quotation marks omitted.the albuquerque law is intended to target voters and not all voters,and because there are clear differences between the two types of voting procedures,the law distinction is proper.
