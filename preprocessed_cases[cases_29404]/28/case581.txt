elections code section,subdivision b requires that a ll petition sections shall be printed in uniform size and darkness with uniform spacing.we hold that this statute requires the use of a uniform typeface in the statement of reasons for the recall and the answer of the recall target.the petitions submitted to the south gate elections official to recall raul moriel,xochilt ruvalcaba,maria benavides,and albert robles,petitions do not actually comply with section,subdivision b.the statement of reasons for the recall and the answers of the recall targets were not printed in uniform typefaces.however,even though the petitions do not actually comply with section,subdivision b,they are valid under the doctrine of substantial compliance.the purpose of section,subdivision b to ensure equal emphasis of the statement of reasons and the satisfied because neither the statement nor the answers were unduly emphasized.
the trial court also concluded that the petitions were valid.we affirm the trial court grant of a petition for writ of mandate sought by proponents of the recall of robles,benavides,ruvalcaba,and moriel propenents.we also affirm the trial court denial of robles,benavides,ruvalcaba,and moriel petition for writ of mandate.
factual background 
joseph ruiz and other south gate residents initiated the process to recall moriel,ruvalcaba,benavides and robles target officials.the process requires,inter alia,submitting two blank copies of the petition for recall with the elections official,subd.a.the petition must include a notice of intention,which includes a statement of the reasons for the proposed recall,subd.b sometimes referred to as the statement.if the target of the recall files an answer to the statement of the proponents,the answer must be included in the petition,subd.a,subd.a.
after receiving the two blank copies,the elections official has ten days to notify the proponents,in writing,whether the form and wording of the petition conforms to the elections code,subds.a b.once the elections official approves the form and wording of the petition,the recall proponents may circulate the petition for signature,subd.d.
on october,the proponents filed separate petitions to recall moriel,ruvalcaba and benavides.on october,carmen avalos,the south gate elections official,wrote ruiz,informing him the petitions did not comply with the elections code and were null and void.avalos enumerated the defects i n the city of south gate the number of valid signatures to satisfy elections code section needs to be twenty three listed proponents addresses did not match with what the records of the registrar recorder had on file and it was difficult to verify three of the proponents on the form due to illegible signatures that were difficult to confirm.
the proponents revised the three petitions and drafted a fourth for the recall of robles.they filed the petitions on november.each notice of intention included the name and title of the officer sought to be recalled and a statement of the reasons for the proposed recall.each petition also contained a proof of service demonstrating that each recall target was personally served with a copy of the notice of intention relating to that target.
on november,moriel and benavides filed an answer and the next day,ruvalcaba and robles filed an answer.benavides answer,which is similar to the other three answers,provides in english and spanish as follows 
do not sign this legal document without consulting with your attorney.the law requires the person who gives you this form to be a united states citizen and registered voter in the city of south gate.ask for california driver license,if this person refuses to identify themselves or you know that they are circulating this petition illegally,call the city attorney or the reward hot line.a reward is available for information leading to conviction of persons circulating this petition who are not united states citizens and registered voters of south gate.you may remain anonymous.
including both the english and spanish versions,a total of eight words were underlined and ten were printed in bold type.the remainder of the answer was printed in plain type.moriel answer differed from benavides answer in that the phrase ask for california driver license was underlined 
on november,avalos wrote araceli dominiguez,another south gate resident and recall proponent,in connection with the recall effort.the letter,in pertinent part,stated as follows pursuant to elections code,the proof of publication of notice of intention to recall has been met.however in order to proceed with the recall process of the above mentioned officers ruvalcaba,moriel,benavides,and robles you must also comply with elections code as to the form of recall petition and elections code filing copies of proposed petition.
on november,avalos wrote ruiz three separate letters approving the petitions for recall of moriel,benavides,and robles.each letter provided as follows we find the proposed form to be in compliance with all of the pertinent requirements of the elections code and hereby find that the petition may be circulated and signatures gathered from the registered voters in the city of south gate.
avalos,however,rejected the petition to recall ruvalcaba,stating i must reject your petition due to the missing words in your submitted petition.it is not uniform with what was indicated in the filed notice of intention or the proof of publication submitted to our office.the proponents then submitted a revised petition to recall ruvalcaba.the revised petition was rejected because t here are smudges of ink on one of the petitions.on november,in a letter to antonio mendez,a resident of south gate,avalos approved a petition to recall ruvalcaba,indicating the petition was in compliance with the elections code requirements.
on december,avalos wrote ruiz that the petitions were flawed.according to avalos letter,t he error consists of a failure to comply with california elections code section a,which requires that the petition may consist of any number of separate sections,which shall be duplicates except as to signatures and matters required to be affixed by signers and circulators.this means that all pages that require the signatures of the voters shall be duplicates.avalos further informed ruiz that the recall effort must be started anew.the proponents of the recall continued to gather signatures despite avalos letter withdrawing approval.
procedural background 
on january,the proponents filed a verified petition for writ of mandate requesting that the trial court declare avalos december,letter invalid and requiring the south gate city clerk to accept the petitions if filed by the statutory deadline.avalos,julia sylva,the elections official who replaced avalos,and salvador alva,the south gate city attorney,were named as respondents,and the target officials were named as the real parties in interest.the target officials filed a separate petition for writ of mandate.
during a hearing on both ruiz and the target officials petitions for writ of mandate,the trial court indicated that the use of bold and underlining in the target officials answers balances out the use of bold in the proponents statements.the trial court further found that t he answer has underlining and bold print just like the statement does.in fact,the bold print and the underlining is really more striking when it in specific words and specific thoughts or ideas or terms than when it is in the whole section i do think the size of the letters is really different.
the trial court also concluded that avalos december,letter rescinding the approval by the city clerk for noncompliance with was void,and there is no evidence that the petitions did not comply with that section,that,therefore there was nothing at that point improper about the proponents continuing to collect signatures 
on march,the trial court granted ruiz petition for writ of mandate and directed respondent julia sylva to vacate the december,rescission of respondent carmen avalos approval of the petitions to recall city of south gate mayor raul moriel,vice mayor xochilt ruvalcaba,council member maria benavides,and city treasurer albert robles,and to notify petitioner,in writing,that the december,letter was of no force and effect 
the trial court also ordered that julia sylva,elections official for the city of south gate,shall receive for filing at the los angeles county registrar recorder office all petitions to recall real parties in interest submitted by petitioner and the recall proponents by the statutory deadlines.said petitions shall remain in the custody of the los angeles county registrar recorder office while they are being processed by respondent sylva or her designee in accordance with applicable elections code provisions.sylva appealed the same day from the grant of ruiz petition for mandate and the proceedings were automatically stayed code civ.proc.
the petition for writ of mandate filed by the target officials was denied.
on march,the trial court ordered the los angeles county registrar recorder to receive the petitions for filing.the court ordered,in the alternative,the submission of the petitions to sylva if sylva is present at the office of the registrar recorder.if sylva is not present at the registrar recorder office,the petitions should be maintained in a secure location.the trial court also ordered that the petitions are to be deemed to be timely filed if this court affirms the judgment.
on april,robles,moriel,ruvalcaba and benavides appealed from the denial of their petition for writ of mandate and joined in most of sylva brief.
we denied ruiz request to lift the automatic stay and consolidated the appeals from the grant of ruiz petition for writ of mandate and from the denial of the target officials petition for writ of mandate.we also granted the secretary of state,the official responsible for the administration of the provisions of the elections code,permission to file amicus curiae briefs in both cases.
discussion 
in part i,we begin with the principal section,subdivision b requires that the statement and answer contain a uniform typeface,a circumstance indisputably absent from this case.we answer that question affirmatively.therefore,in part ii,we focus on the issue of substantial compliance.finally,we discuss sylva contention that the signatures collected after avalos purported rescission letter are invalid.to resolve this appeal we need not and do not consider the parties remaining contentions 
i.the petitions do not actually comply with section,subdivision b 
the principal issue in these appeals involves the statutory construction of section,subdivision b.the statute provides all petition sections shall be printed in uniform size and darkness with uniform spacing.we must determine what the legislature intended when it enacted the law.
the parties and amicus provide three different interpretations of the legislative intent.ruiz argues the statute requires that a copy of the petition signed by one voter must look the same as another copy signed by another ensuring that all voters are presented with the same information,in the same form.this argument,which the trial court adopted,is rooted in the plain language of the statute.section means copy of the petition.hebard bybee th,d defining section as copy myers patterson d.using the term section to mean copy.thus,according to the plain language of the statute,all copies must have uniform size and darkness.
while the strength of ruiz interpretation is that it defines section as the term is commonly used in the elections code,the weakness is that the statutory language,as he interprets it,is duplicative.section,subdivision a states that t he petition may consist of any number of separate sections,which shall be duplicates except as to signatures and matters required to be affixed by signers and circulators.thus,under section,subdivision a each copy of the petition must be a duplicate of all other copies.a duplicate is exactly the same as one or more others of its kind and would,therefore necessarily have identical size,darkness,and spacing.websters new unabridged internat.dict.defining duplicate as consisting of or existing in two corresponding or identical parts or examples being exactly the same as one or more others of its kind.the meaning ruiz ascribes to section,subdivision b is no different from the meaning of section,subdivision a.
in contrast to ruiz,sylva argues that the typeface on any and every section of the petition that is circulated for signatures must be uniform in size,darkness,and spacing.she further contends that the plain meaning of section,subdivision b,is that,on a recall petition,the recall proponents statement of reasons for recall and the target official answer must be printed in the same typeface.although sylva expressly states that a section,as used in the statute,is a copy of the petition,her interpretation requires defining section as paragraph.if the term section means paragraph,then all petition paragraphs shall be printed in uniform size and darkness.but,if the term section means copy,as sylva claims,only the copies must be uniform,not each paragraph of the petition.
the target officials concur in sylva interpretation of the statute,stating the recall proponent statement of reasons for recall and the target official answer must be printed in the same typeface.like sylva,the target officials explicitly define section as copy,but implicitly reject a literal construction of the statute because they eschew the claim that only copies of the petitions must be uniform.
the secretary of state rejects both parties interpretations and argues that the notice of intention and the answer must be printed in the same type size.however,this does not preclude the parties from utilizing bolding,underlining,italics or different fonts,even though these variations can result in distinctly different measurements.the secretary of state interprets section,subdivision b to mean that the elections official must reject a petition prepared by the proponents of a recall election that differs in any way from the original notice of intention including the statement or the answer.emphasis in original,footnote omitted.the secretary of state carves out a limited exception.in a rare circumstance,he has advised that the recall election proponents may print the answer in a manner that differs from the way it was prepared occasionally an elections official will be presented with an answer that has been prepared in a bizarre shape,a christmas tree or paragraph construction 
the secretary of state analysis is not based on the statutory language and even conflicts with the language of the statute.whereas the statute requires uniform size,darkness,and spacing,the secretary permits variations that can result in distinctly different measurements.the secretary describes his approach as one providing a consistent and workable interpretation of the law relating to recall elections.the legislative history,however,reveals a conflict between his interpretation and that of march fong eu,the secretary of state at the time the legislation was enacted 
the legislative analysis completed when section,subdivision b was being considered provided current law does not prohibit proponents from printing the notice of intention in a larger and bolder type than that used for the officer answer.requiring all petition sections to be printed in a uniform size and darkness would ensure that both the notice of intention which includes the recall statement and the official answer are given equal emphasis on the petition.while the current secretary of state argues his interpretation is entitled to great weight because he is responsible for enforcing the legislation,the authority he cites stands for the proposition that a contemporaneous administrative construction of the statute by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement and interpretation is entitled to great weight.wilkinson workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,andal miller th,fn,d.thus,under wilkinson and andal,the prior interpretation of secretary eu is the one entitled to great weight because she interpreted the statute at the time the statute legislation was under consideration 
in construing section,subdivision b,we must ascertain the legislature intent to effectuate the legislative purpose,fair employment housing com.cal d.the statute plain meaning controls the court interpretation unless its words are ambiguous.if the plain language of a statute is unambiguous,no court need,or should,go beyond that pure expression of legislative intent.kobzoff los angeles county medical center cal th,d.in contrast,where the statutory language is ambiguous other indicia of legislative intent must be considered.hoechst celanese franchise tax bd.cal th,d,when a statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,then we look to extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.a statute should not be construed in a manner that renders it superfluous.dix superior court cal d,young gannon th,d.literal construction of statutory language will not prevail if contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statutory scheme.gomes county of mendocino th,d.
the construction proposed by the proponents,a literal construction,renders section,subdivision b superfluous.because statutes should not be construed in a manner that renders them meaningless dix superior court,supra,cal d at,we look beyond the plain language to ascertain the legislative intent.accordingly,we review the legislative history of section,subdivision b.the statute was proposed at the request of the los angeles county registrar recorder and introduced by assemblymember david elder in.according to a memorandum of support from the office of secretary eu,the new legislation was necessary because there is no provision that prohibits proponents from printing a recall petition in different type sizes.for example,the notice of intention including grounds for recall in type size and the officer answer in a small type size.the same memorandum explained that the bill would impose a requirement for uniformity throughout the petition.significantly,assemblymember elder analysis,contained in a letter to the governor requesting his approval of the bill,also indicated that the amendment would require recall petitions to be printed in uniform type and size.see people pena th,d considering letter from author to governor urging passage of legislation when ascertaining legislative intent.
based on the legislative history stressing the need for equal emphasis,we conclude that section,subdivision b requires that the statement and answer be printed in uniform size and darkness.this interpretation,advanced by sylva and the target officials,is most consistent with the legislative intent.people thomas cal th,d,the fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.
while one canon of statutory construction calls for liberal construction of recall statutes in favor of the right to recall elected officials gage jordan cal d,a court can not enlarge the scope of a procedural statute where the statutory provisions are clear.wilcox enstad d.the legislative intent,as reflected in the legislative history indicates that section,subdivision b requires that the statement and answer be printed in uniform size and darkness with uniform spacing.this construction is the only one confirmed by the legislative purpose.
the practical consequence of this holding is that the recall election proponents,who control the recall process,will select the typeface for both the statement and the answer.the proponents,however,will not derive any special benefit from their ability to select the typeface precisely because of the uniformity requirement.if granting the recall proponents an opportunity to select the typeface is deemed to be undesirable,the legislature may amend the statute to specify a particular typeface as it has done in other situations.see.
ruiz and the secretary of state surmise that other deleterious consequences will flow from this holding.the secretary of state argues the target officials could,in every instance,thwart the entire recall process simply by choosing a type size and darkness different from that selected by the proponents.if the target officials choose a typeface different from that employed by the proponents,the proponents,in order to actually comply with section,subdivision b,must print the answer in the same typeface as the statement even if that requires alteration of the typeface used in the original answer.
ruiz claims that construing section,subdivision b to require a uniform typeface in the statement and answer would enable the recall election proponents to edit the answer.the term edit connotes an alteration of the content of the answer.however,permission to alter the typeface used in the answer,where it is inconsistent with the typeface used in the statement,is not tantamount to sanctioning the alteration of the content of the answer,which is neither required nor permitted under section,subdivision b.
there is no dispute that the petitions do not actually comply with section,subdivision b,as we have construed it.the statements and answers were printed in disparate typefaces,which lack the uniformity required by the statute.
ii.the petitions substantially comply with purpose of section,subdivision b 
the next issue is whether,under the doctrine of substantial compliance,the petitions are valid despite the fact the entire statement was printed in bold type and the answer was printed in a combination of typefaces,including plain type,bold type,and underlined type.
s ubstantial compliance means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute.assembly deukmejian cal d,quoting stasher cal d.the doctrine of substantial compliance,however,can not save a petition that misinforms the voters or fails to inform the voters of information necessary to exercise intelligently their rights creighton reviczky d.nor may it be relied upon to save carelessly or negligently prepared petitions.california teachers collins cal d.s tatutes passed for the purpose of protecting electors from confusing or misleading situations should be enforced.clark jordan cal d.
even though the doctrine of substantial compliance is narrowly applied in the election context,our supreme court has stressed that technical deficiencies in referendum and initiative petitions will not invalidate the petitions if they are in substantial compliance with statutory and constitutional requirements.assembly deukmejian,supra,cal d.the same rules have been applied to recall petitions.see othmer city council of long beach cal,tilden blood d.
we conclude the petitions substantially complied with the purpose of section,subdivision b.although the petitions do not actually comply with the literal language of section,subdivision b,they comply with the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute.
a.the purpose of section,subdivision b is to assure equal emphasis of the notice of intention and the answer 
the purpose of section,subdivision b,as indicated in the legislative history,is to ensure equal emphasis of the statement and the answer.the legislative history reflects the understanding that r equiring all petition sections to be printed in uniform size and darkness would ensure that both the notice of intention which includes the recall statement and the officer answer are given equal emphasis on the petition.office of sec.of state,analysis ab reg.sess.june,emphasis added.the author of the legislation described the changes as technical and procedural and numerous other analyses similarly reflect that the legislation was technical and procedural.see,com.elections reapportionment analysis assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,bill provides for technical,clarifying,and procedural changes assem.bill,reading june,reg.sess.as amended may,same.
because the legislative purpose to ensure equal emphasis of the statement and answer,the premise of sylva argument that t he lack of actual compliance with the statute in this case defeats the statute essential provide fair and balance
