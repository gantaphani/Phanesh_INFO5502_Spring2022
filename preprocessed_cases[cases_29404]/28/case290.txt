this is a consolidated appeal in which michael chamness,daniel frederick,and rich wilson challenge the constitutionality of certain sections of california senate bill sb,legislation which,implementing california proposition,fundamentally changes the california election system by eliminating party primaries and general elections with candidates,and substituting a nonpartisan primary and a runoff.appellant julius galacki moved to intervene in the lawsuit,but the trial court denied his motion.
factual background 
before california voters approved and the california legislature enacted sb,california operated under a partisan primary election system.under that system,each qualified party held a primary election in june,and the winner became the party nominee in the november general election.independent candidates did not participate in the primary elections but were nominated to the general election ballot by voter petition.
amended the california constitution to establish a open primary election system under which voters directly nominate two candidates.the top two candidates become the general election candidates regardless of political party affiliation or lack thereof.to implement,the california legislature enacted sb.together,and sb drastically changed elections in california.
under the version of sb in place at the time relevant to this case,in the primary election candidates on the primary ballot indicated either their political party preference,as disclosed on the candidate most recent statement of registration,or that they had no party preference,or designated that preference spot on the ballot be left blank.cal.a.
as secretary of state,defendant debra bowen interpreted the term political party in this section to mean only a qualified party under cal.that section imposes certain requirements before a group may become a qualified party.thus,a candidate may only list his party preference on the primary ballot if that party has taken the statutory steps to become a qualified party.at the time of the disputed election,there were six qualified parties in california american independent,democratic,green,libertarian,peace and freedom,and republican.bowen concluded that a candidate who prefers a party could not state the term independent on the ballot.rather,the candidate had to either state he has no party preference,or leave the space blank.
sb also prohibits voters from casting votes in the general election.however,voters may cast votes in the primary election.cal.further states 
no person whose name has been written in upon a ballot for an office at the direct primary may have his or her name placed on the ballot as a candidate for that office for the ensuing general election unless one of the following is applicable 
c at that direct primary he or she received the highest number of votes cast for that office or the second highest number of votes cast for that office 
because only the two candidates with the highest number of votes in the primary election advance to the general election,a person whose name has been written on the ballot as a candidate at the general election for a office shall not be counted.cal.bowen interpreted this statute to prohibit all candidates from running in the general election.
chamness sought to run for office in the primary election and wished to have the ballot state,in the party preference space,independent.instead,he appeared on the ballot as

frederick sought to run as a candidate in the general election for assembly district,but under sb could not do so.wilson,who is registered to vote in assembly district,cast a vote for frederick in the election.election officials did not count wilson vote for frederick.
galacki attempted to run as a candidate in the july,general election for congressional district.he was not permitted to do so.when galacki sought registration papers,los angeles county registrar dean logan explained to galacki that sb bans candidacies in the general election.galacki thereafter attempted to cast a vote for himself in the general election by mailing his ballot to logan office.logan did not count the vote.
chamness filed suit on february,seeking a preliminary injunction to enjoin the implementation of sb in the special congressional election in which he wished to participate.
on march,abel maldonado,california independent voter project civp,and californians to defend the open primary cdop,filed a motion to intervene.the trial court granted the motion.
on march,the trial court denied chamness motion for a preliminary injunction.chamness filed a motion for an expedited appeal,which this court denied.chamness thereafter voluntarily dismissed that appeal.
on may,plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment.on july,the general election occurred.frederick was not on the ballot,and wilson vote for frederick was not counted.galacki did not appear on the ballot,and his vote for himself was not counted.
on july,the trial court denied chamness motion for summary judgment,and sua sponte tentatively granted defendants summary judgment.also on july,galacki filed a motion to intervene.in his motion,he alleged sb violated his first and fourteenth amendment rights by barring him from running as a candidate.he also stated it violated his rights under the elections clause by prohibiting logan from counting galacki vote for himself.finally,he alleged sb impermissibly forced him to state that he has no party preference,when,in fact,he wished to run as a tea party candidate.
galacki also stated he would assert two unique elections clause claims first,his right to run for federal office as a candidate second,his right to cast a ballot as a candidate and have it counted.galacki stated that b ecause he is entitled to intervene,the court may incorporate by reference his constitutional claims stemming from the july,general election into plaintiffs pending motion for summary judgment.
the trial court denied galacki motion to intervene for two reasons.first,it stated galacki failed timely to file the motion and second,it stated that plaintiffs would adequately represent galacki rights.
on august,the trial court formally granted defendants summary judgment.chamness,frederick,and wilson appeal the trial court order granting defendants summary judgment case.galacki appeals the trial court order denying his motion to intervene case.
ii.jurisdiction and mootness 
this court has jurisdiction over this appeal as it arises from the trial court final orders granting summary judgment to defendants and denying galacki motion to intervene.citizens for balanced use montana wilderness ass n,cir this court has jurisdiction over the denial of a motion to intervene as of right as a final appealable order rubin city of santa monica,cir.
chamness case is not moot because his claims are capable of repetition,yet evading review.rubin,quoting shaefer townsend,cir.chamness claim is capable of repetition because future election administrators would deny him the ability to use the designation independent on the primary ballot.see id.as this court has previously noted,i f election law cases were rendered moot by the occurrence of an election,many constitutionally suspect laws could never reach appellate review.id.internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.we therefore exercise jurisdiction over this appeal.see id.
frederick and wilson appeal is,however,moot.they base their appeal on the proposition that california law impermissibly allows voters to cast votes in general elections,but then prohibits those ballots from being counted.whether or not that was so at the time the district court decided the case,see field bowen,it is not so now.
california elections code has been amended to clarify that voters are not permitted to cast ballots in general elections.see cal.notwithstanding any other provision of law,a person may not be a candidate at the general election for a office id.except for a office at a general election,each voter is entitled to write on the ballot the name of any candidate for any public office,including that of president and vice president of the united states.emphasis added.plaintiffs concede that the state may prohibit votes from being cast in a general election.see burdick takushi.
because frederick and wilson seek only declaratory relief affecting future elections,their appeal is moot see renee duncan,cir.for the same reason,galacki claims regarding his candidacy and the vote he cast for himself in the general election are moot.
iii.discussion of the issues 
chamness argues the state violated his first amendment rights by prohibiting him from using the ballot label independent and forcing him to choose between a preferred party designation,no party preference,or a blank space on that part of the ballot we hold that chamness has failed to establish that sb severely burdened his rights,and uphold the constitutionality of the statute as reasonably related to furthering the state important interest in efficiently regulating elections.
this court reviews the constitutionality of a statute de novo.rubin,at.
common sense,as well as constitutional law,compels the conclusion that government must play an active role in structuring elections.dudum arntz,cir quoting burdick,at.any election system,whether it governs the registration and qualifications of voters,the selection and eligibility of candidates,or the voting process itself,inevitably affects at least to some degree the individual right to vote.id.at quoting burdick,at.therefore,the supreme court developed a balancing test to resolve the tension between a candidate first amendment rights and the state interest in preserving the fairness and integrity of the voting process.rubin,at.this court reiterated the appropriate test 
when deciding whether a state election law violates first and fourteenth amendment speech rights,courts are to weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the state rule imposes on those rights against the interests the state contends justify that burden,and consider the extent to which the state concerns make the burden necessary.
id.quoting timmons twin cities area new party.
when an election regulation imposes a severe burden on first amendment rights,the state must show the law is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest strict scrutiny review.id.quoting burdick,at.nondiscriminatory restrictions that impose a lesser burden on speech rights need only be reasonably related to achieving the state important regulatory interests.id.quoting burdick,at.this court has noted that voting regulations are rarely subject to strict scrutiny.dudum,at citing lemons bradbury,cir.
a regulation imposes a severe speech restriction if it significantly impair s access to the ballot,stifle s core political speech,or dictate s electoral outcomes.rubin,at.a regulation imposes a permissible restriction on speech when it is generally applicable,evenhanded,and politically neutral,or if it protects the reliability and integrity of the election process.id.at citing hussey city of portland,cir.this is true even when the regulations have the effect of channeling expressive activities at the polls.id.quoting timmons,at.
in timmons,the supreme court upheld a law banning a candidate from appearing on the ballot with more than one political party designation.at.the court held the burden imposed was a minor one,id.at,and therefore rejected the political party contention that it has a right to use the ballot itself to send a particularized message to the voters about the nature of its support for the candidate.ballots serve primarily to elect candidates,not as forums for political expression.id.at.
the court held the state had a strong interest in the stability of its political system.id.at.although such an interest does not allow the state to insulate political parties from minor parties or independent competition,the interest permits them to enact reasonable election regulations that may,in practice,favor the traditional system.id.at.the court thus concluded that the burdens the law impose d on the party associational rights are justified by correspondingly weighty valid state interests in ballot integrity and political stability.id.at.
in rubin,applying the timmons analysis,this court held that a city could preclude a candidate from designating on the ballot,as his occupation,that he was a peace activist.at.the law prohibited any candidate from naming a status as his occupation.id.this court held that the city prohibition of status designations such as activist does not severely burden a candidate first amendment rights.id.the court noted the regulation is viewpoint neutral it bans any type of status regardless of the message it seeks to convey.id.additionally,it did not hinder core political speech by preventing the candidate from supporting or discussing peace activism during his candidacy it merely placed a limit on how his occupation would appear on the ballot.id.finally,the city provided him an alternative way to express his views through a candidate statement distributed prior to the election.id.at.under all of the circumstances,the law did not severely burden the candidate speech rights.id.
chamness has likewise failed to show that the statute challenged in this case severely burdened his first amendment rights.chamness seeks to use the ballot to promote his political message.however,unlike the candidate in timmons,chamness can not identify the specific message he wishes to convey or explain how that message is hindered.the law prohibits chamness from designating himself as independent,and requires him to state he has no party preference.yet,chamness has failed to demonstrate any real difference between the two locutions.
the only possible difference between the two phrases that has been suggested is that independent may evoke a positive view that the candidate affirmatively rejects the politics of the other parties.no party preference might,on the other hand,evoke a neutral or even negative view that the candidate is apathetic to the views of the other parties,while he does not identify with them,he does not reject them.chamness,however,failed to provide any evidence that the two phrases are actually likely to be understood by voters to convey these different meanings,and,if they do,that the distinction would tend to affect the way voters cast their votes.considered in context,we can not assume these facts in the absence of evidence.to the contrary,we assume the ballot was presented to a electorate,familiar with the qualified political parties it has seen on past ballots.see.state grange.state republican party.moreover,had chamness believed that no party preference had negative connotations even to voters,he could have requested that his name appear next to a blank space,which was permitted under the version of sb in effect during chamness candidacy.
the fact that the regulation in this case is viewpoint neutral as to the required term no party preference supports the conclusion that it imposes only a slight burden on speech.see rubin,at.the restriction does not allow any candidates to term themselves independents and does allow all candidates to put themselves forward on the primary ballot and gather votes.that candidates not identified on the ballot as preferring a particular party must use the term no party preference or leave the space blank rather than designating themselves as an independent has no viewpoint implications,and so,for that reason as well,imposes a l esser burden on speech.
such slight speech burdens may be justified by the state important regulatory interests,timmons,at quoting burdick,at,including prevent ing misrepresentation and electoral confusion,norman reed.here,there is such an interest in preventing confusion.the term independent,if listed next to a candidate name on a ballot,might be confused with the name of a political party,such as the american independent party one of california qualified political parties 
the state also has an important interest in managing its ballots.timmons,at.if the state were to allow chamness to use the term independent,various candidates could then seek to place other designations on the ballot in lieu of a party preference.those mig
