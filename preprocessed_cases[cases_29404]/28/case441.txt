believing himself the victim of a concerted effort to thwart his presidential bid,ralph nader sued an array of influential democrats in late for malicious prosecution and abuse of process.his complaint alleges a civil conspiracy whose object was to deplete his resources by forcing him to defend meritless ballot eligibility challenges in nearly twenty states.the district court dismissed the complaint,concluding that nader suit,if successful,would punish the democrats for activity protected by the first amendment.nader appeals,arguing that the district court misapplied the applicable first amendment test.because the district court approach and the merits of nader claims present state law issues of first impression,we think it best to resolve this case on simpler and more certain grounds.both here and in the district court the parties fully briefed the question whether nader suit exceeded the applicable statute of limitations.agreeing with defendants that the complaint itself demonstrates its untimeliness,we affirm on this ground alone.
because the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss,nader allegations must be taken as true.chalabi hashemite kingdom of jordan.so citing various newspaper articles to bolster its complaint relates the following events.

moreover,nader alleges,the democrats own words demonstrate that they brought these challenges without regard for their merit and with the ulterior purpose of bleeding his campaign dry.nader quotes moffett telling the washington post that w e wanted to neutralize his campaign by forcing him to spend money and resources defending these things,but much to our astonishment,we actually been more successful than we thought we be in stopping him from getting on at all.id.quoting jonathan finer brian faler,nader unsure of ballot spot in many states.post,at.acknowledging the same purpose to the new york times,moffett said that they had sued nader in swing states and safe states alike to drain him of resources and force him to spend his time and money.id.quoting seelye,convictions intact,nader soldiers on,supra,at.nader alleges that dnc chairman terry mcauliffe promised to support him in some states if he would voluntarily avoid the battlegrounds,and that the democrats first legal complaint came on the very day nader rejected this offer.id.thus,nader claims,the democrats admitted purpose for bringing these lawsuits was not to vindicate valid legal claims,but rather to bankrupt campaign by forcing the candidates to spend their limited resources of time,talent and money on the defense of unfounded lawsuits.id.he believes that the democrats record bears him out although winning a handful of their challenges,they eventually lost the vast majority of lawsuits they filed.id.
president bush reelection quieted the conflict.all state ballot challenges had been resolved in the weeks prior to the election,and though the democrats still had a handful of fec complaints pending,each was dismissed in due course without further proceedings.in early,however,the law firm that prosecuted the successful ballot access challenge in pennsylvania,reed smith llp,won an award of costs that it eventually pursued by writ of attachment in the superior court of the district of columbia in the summer of.id.nader opposed the attachment,claiming to have recently discovered a fraud in the underlying suit in the form of undisclosed ties between reed smith and justices of the pennsylvania supreme court.see id.that dispute remains pending in superior court,see id,though the commonwealth court of pennsylvania has already refused to reopen its award of costs,see in re nomination paper of ralph nader,slip op.at.
this brings us to the case before us,which followed closely on the heels of the reed smith attachment.nader first filed his complaint in superior court on october,naming as defendants the democratic national committee,the ballot project,america coming together,the service employees international union,john kerry,jack corrigan,toby moffett,elizabeth holtzman,robert brandon,mark brewer,and reed smith llp.he alleged malicious prosecution,abuse of process,civil conspiracy,and federal civil rights violations.defendants removed the case to federal court where,for procedural reasons having nothing to do with the issues before us,nader then dropped his federal claims.this left only the state law claims,which defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.among other things,the democrats argued that nader complaint was barred by the statute of limitations,insufficient to state a claim,and precluded by the first amendment.
accepting defendants first amendment theory that the complaint was barred by the doctrine,the district court granted the motion to dismiss.see generally eastern presidents conference noerr motor freight,d united mine workers pennington,d.noerr and pennington are antitrust cases,but they stand for the proposition that when a person petitions the government for redress,the first amendment prohibits any sanction on that instance,a sherman act penalty for anticompetitive long as the petition was in good faith.see,covad commc ns bell atl.for this purpose,the supreme court has treated lawsuits as petitions,see,bill johnson restaurants,nlrb,d citing cal.motor transp.trucking unlimited,d.and discussing,we have said that it is hard to see any reason why,as an abstract matter,the common law torts of malicious prosecution and abuse of process might not in some of their applications be found to violate the first amendment,whelan abell.the district court thus thought that before nader could bring such claims,he had to show that the democrats ballot challenges fell within the bar sham exception,that their lawsuits were objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits and brought with the specific intent to further wrongful conduct through the use of governmental opposed to the outcome of that process.nader democratic,d,citing prof l real estate investors,columbia pictures,d internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.assuming for the sake of argument that the democrats lawsuits were in fact objectively baseless,the district court found that nader had at least failed to allege facts sufficient to satisfy the sham test second is,inappropriate subjective intent.nader,d at.it thus dismissed the complaint under without reaching the democrats statute of limitations defense.id.at.
nader appeals,arguing that even if applies,his credited as they must be on a motion to satisfy the sham test.on the merits,the democrats defend the district court decision and then argue that,even if nader can overcome,he failed to state claims for abuse of process and malicious prosecution.they also renew their claim that nader complaint came too late.because the district court decided these issues on a motion to dismiss,our review is de novo.see chalabi,at reviewing timeliness de novo kaemmerling lappin,reviewing decision on motion to dismiss de novo.
we begin by briefly addressing the elements of the torts at issue.under district of columbia law,c ivil conspiracy is not an independent tort but only a means for establishing vicarious liability for an underlying tort.hill medlantic health care group,internal quotation marks omitted.a claim for civil conspiracy thus fails unless the elements of the underlying tort are satisfied.see executive sandwich shoppe,carr realty,c ivil conspiracy depends on performance of some underlying tortious act.internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,because its only purpose is to spread liability for a successful tort claim to all agreeing parties regardless of whether they actually committed the tortious act,a civil conspiracy claim incorporates not only every substantive element of the underlying tort,but also its statute of limitations.see,diamond davis,citing with approval thomas news world commc ns.
of the substantive torts nader alleges,malicious prosecution is the more straightforward.in the district of columbia,malicious prosecution requires that the underlying suit terminated in plaintiff favor malice on the part of the defendant lack of probable cause for the underlying suit and special injury occasioned by the plaintiff as the result of the original action.morowitz marvel.in other words,the victor may sue the vanquished for a baseless suit if it was brought with malicious disregard for its validity and caused injury over and above the ordinary costs of litigation.and although injuries to reputation,emotional distress,loss of income,and substantial expense in defending have all been held to fall outside the scope of the definition of special injury,joeckel disabled am.veterans,internal quotation marks omitted,we long ago held that,as a matter of district of columbia law,repetitious malicious actions may satisfy this element,see soffos eaton,o ne who twice sues another maliciously and without probable cause is responsible to him in damages.
abuse of process presents more complicated issues.although we observed in whelan that,under its most expansive interpretation,this tort could be used even against someone who sues successfully while harboring an improper motive,see at,the district of columbia court of appeals has given the tort a narrower construction while leaving its exact elements far from clear.see,morowitz,at holding that while ulterior motive is insufficient,the critical concern is whether process was used to accomplish an end unintended by law,and whether the suit was instituted to achieve a result not regularly or legally obtainable.according to the district of columbia court of appeals,abuse of process lies where the legal system has been used to accomplish some end which is without the regular purview of the process,or which compels the party against whom it is used to do some collateral thing which he could not legally and regularly be required to do.bown hamilton,internal quotation marks omitted.we know at least that suits intended primarily to achieve their lawful purpose need not be brought with a pure heart.see,scott district of columbia,holding that attempt to secure conviction was not abuse of process even where defendant alleged police officers had ulterior aim of covering up their use of excessive force.still,the district of columbia court of appeals has yet to provide precise guidance on the question of how collateral the thing that could not legally and regularly be required,bown,at,must be to support an abuse of process claim,which represents the essential question in determining the boundary between everyday litigation and tortious abuse of court procedures.
nader theory simplifies the issue,however.because the democrats were,after all,bringing ballot challenges to achieve their goal of keeping nader off the perfectly natural means to what is a perfectly lawful end in and of only way they could even theoretically have abused the legal process was by filing such claims knowing that they were false.nader theory of either tort thus requires him to prove a pattern of filings that were objectively baseless and intentionally so.
this discussion should make clear that nader civil conspiracy theory,which aggregates the democrats many challenges into a single pattern of baseless litigation,is essential to the validity of his claims.nader theory of special injury for malicious prosecution,as well as his theory of the collateral end for abuse of process,both turn on his ability to demonstrate that the democrats employed a pattern of baseless litigation to deprive him so dramatically of resources as to leave him unable to meaningfully campaign for the presidency.reviewing the allegations of a broad democratic strategy recited in the complaint,see,am.compl,and even in the headers of his briefs to this court,see,appellants opening br.conspirators filed complaints in an effort to use a pattern of baseless and repetitive claims as a means to bar the candidates from running for public office during the general election,we think it plain that it is this aggregated,conspiratorial theory of misuse of the judicial process that nader has actually brought.indeed,although the complaint recites some facts from each individual forum where nader access was challenged,see am.compl,it contains no facts tending to show that any individual claim was objectively baseless other than its relation to the scheme and the large number of failed claims overall.
on the merits,this aggregated theory presents interesting legal issues of first impression.first is the applicability of.if nader in fact concedes that his theory requires him to prove a pattern of deliberately false filings,no problem could arise because h owever broad the first amendment right to petition may be,it can not be stretched to cover petitions based on known falsehoods.whelan,at.but if nader argues that he can prevail on abuse of process without such proof,see oral arg.tr,we would then have to perhaps certify to the district of columbia court of question of the exact scope of abuse of process in relation to the
