plaintiffs,joseph and marilyn campbell,brought this action pursuant to in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama against defendant rainbow city hereinafter defendant or the city,its mayor and its board of adjustment,seeking damages allegedly resulting from the city council and planning commission denial of tentative approval for plaintiffs proposed building project plaintiffs contend that the city violated their rights under the first amendment and the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause when it denied them such tentative approval.plaintiffs claim that all other developers that came before the planning commission had received approval and aver that plaintiffs were treated differently by the city because of campbell candidacy in a prior mayoral election,in which he ran against the incumbent mayor,a member of the planning commission that refused to give tentative approval.the case went to trial,and the jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs.
defendant rainbow city has appealed,asserting as error the district court denial of defendant rule motion for judgment as a matter of law we agree for two reasons.plaintiffs failed as a matter of law to show that the city final policymaker acted with an unconstitutional motive,and thus no reasonable jury could find that the city violated the plaintiffs first amendment rights.moreover,plaintiffs have not offered any evidence to support an equal protection claim of individuals who were treated differently.thus,the district court should have granted the city rule motion.for these reasons,the order of the district court is reversed,and it is directed to enter judgment for defendant.
background 
in,campbell ran for the office of mayor of rainbow city and was defeated by the incumbent,mayor sue glidewell.during his bid for office,campbell was critical of glidewell and her policies.
all building projects in rainbow city must gain approval of the city council and the planning commission.as part of her office,mayor glidewell is a voting member of both the city council and the planning commission and appoints six of the other nine members to the planning commission.prior to final approval of a project,the planning commission can grant tentative approval if the applicant meets certain requirements.tentative approval permits the developer to start preparing the site for construction by allowing cleaning and clearing of the land and some minor grading 
the rainbow city zoning ordinance has a set of specific regulations governing developments within rainbow city.one such regulation affecting multifamily housing developments relates to density.prior to,the ordinance allowed a density of ten units per acre.the ordinance was amended in to allow a density of sixteen units per acre.
on may,the campbells bought approximately ten acres of land within rainbow city the property was zoned for multifamily housing.plaintiffs wanted to build a large apartment complex on the tract of land.originally,the campbells intended to build units on the property.in order to develop the property in this manner,plaintiffs would need to obtain a variance because the ordinance would permit only units on a tract of land.in january,campbell met with mayor glidewell to discuss the construction of an apartment complex on the property.later,on february,when campbell came before the city planning commission,he sought to develop apartments on the land.he brought a vicinity map,which highlighted the property,to the meeting.the planning commission decided to table the matter for discussion.
on march and,campbell attended a city council meeting and a planning commission meeting to determine if he would be permitted to build apartments on the land.both the council and the planning commission tabled the matter for further discussion.
on april,campbell again went before the planning commission.this time he stated that he was seeking to build one building with units on part of the property.campbell believed that if he impressed the planning commission with this development,it would allow him to build the other apartments.the planning commission,wary of campbell request,tabled any action until it could consult with the city attorney.
in may,campbell hired an attorney to help him with his requests.on may,campbell attended a city council meeting and left paperwork with the council.in a letter addressed to the mayor on the same date,plaintiffs stated their reasons for seeking a variance from the limitation of ten units per acre.
on june,the campbells sent another letter to the mayor and the city council.the campbells indicated in the letter that the city lawyer had informed them that they had not complied with the requirements of tentative approval and the letter was an attempt to demonstrate compliance the campbells stated that they were seeking tentative approval for apartments per acre on their tract.attached to the letter was a sketch drawn in pencil showing the locations of the proposed buildings.
the next correspondence between the parties appears to have taken place more than one year later.after an inquiry from the campbells attorney,on october,the city attorney stated that the campbells had never satisfied the fifth requirement for tentative approval.
under the structure set up by the city,parties dissatisfied with the planning commission response may appeal to the board of adjustment.on november,the campbells filed an application with the board of adjustment in which they sought a number of variances.plaintiffs sought a variance with regard to apartment density,so as to allow them to build units per acre as opposed to sixteen,the maximum that the ordinance would have allowed at that time.they also sought a variance from the setback requirement for buildings,which required a setback of fifteen feet from parking areas.they sought a variance from the requirement for the mandatory spacing between buildings.finally,plaintiffs asked for a variance from the mandatory front and back yard space requirements.the board of adjustment,which met in may,turned down all of plaintiffs requests for variances.eventually,plaintiffs sold half of the property.another party developed that portion of the property under the name meadow oaks.
plaintiffs offer the following developments as comparators the etowah steelworkers credit union,the wallace medical center,regency point,christopher apartments,the hidden creek apartments,meadow oaks,terry echols apartments on brown avenue,and terry echols apartments on sixth street.
the etowah steelworkers credit union and the wallace medical center are commercial developments.regency point was built in as a planned unit development for a retirement community.there is no evidence in the record to show that regency point sought or obtained tentative approval from the planning commission to develop the property.the area was rezoned without the developer furnishing the city with a zoning request or a concept plan.according to plaintiffs expert,stinson,regency point does not have the mix of commercial and residential housing required by the ordinances relating to a planned unit development.
the christopher apartment complex was built partially on land zoned for property,a designation which does not allow the building of apartments.stinson could find no record of plans having been submitted to the city building department.
the hidden creek apartment complex is a small,development situated on a near plaintiffs tract of land.there is no evidence in the record to show that the developers of the hidden creek apartments sought or received tentative approval for the development prior to receiving final approval.according to stinson,the hidden creek apartments do not comply with the city ordinances governing density,parking,and recreational areas.
the meadow oaks development,a multifamily apartment complex,built on land originally owned by plaintiffs,was granted tentative approval by the planning commission after its developers submitted a site plan.the development as built does not have the proper buffer zone between the development and an adjacent single family residence.
finally,plaintiffs claim their project to be similarly situated to the two sets of apartments built by terry echols an complex on brown avenue and a complex on sixth street,both of which do not comport with the city ordinance in numerous ways.both echols developments sought and received tentative approval from the planning commission.each time echols came before the commission,he brought site plans outlining the proposed locations of the buildings.on a few occasions he was accompanied by both his architect and his engineer who would answer questions posed by the planning commission relating to the proposed development.
echols appeared before that planning commission six or seven times prior to receiving tentative approval for his development on sixth street.for his brown street development,echols attended at least two meetings prior to getting tentative approval.each time that he was not granted tentative approval,the planning commission would table the matter for further discussion,and he was expected to return to seek approval at the next meeting.
at trial,plaintiffs supported their argument that they were treated differently and retaliated against by the city with the testimony of the city former building inspector,jack bowlings.although bowlings was not present at trial because he was deceased,he had given sworn testimony at three pretrial depositions.moreover,prior to the third deposition,he had submitted a sworn affidavit to the parties.plaintiffs contend that the statements in the depositions and the affidavit prove that they were treated unjustly by the city.defendant argues that the testimony of bowlings is inadmissable,a position with which we find some sympathy.however,because we decide the case on other grounds,we need not further address bowlings testimony.similarly,we do not address defendant appealing argument that the expert testimony relied on to support the award of damages is inadmissible.
ii.discussion 
after the conclusion of plaintiffs case and at the end of trial,the city made rule motions for judgment as a matter of law.the trial court denied these motions.defendant appeals this denial.
we review a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same standards used by the district court.abel dubberly,cir per curiam.we consider whether sufficient conflict exists in the evidence to necessitate submitting the matter to the jury or whether the evidence is so weighted in favor of one side that that party is entitled to succeed in his or her own position as a matter of law.id.although we look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,the must put forth more than a mere scintilla of evidence suggesting that reasonable minds could reach differing verdicts.id.because the jury found for plaintiffs on both the first amendment claim and the equal protection claim,defendant must show that the trial court erred in sending both claims to the jury.
section claims 
a local government may only be held liable under section if action pursuant to official policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort.matthews columbia county,cir per curiam quoting church city of huntsville,cir.further,only municipal officers or groups who have final policymaking authority may subject the municipality to liability.id.
first amendment 
we assume,for the purposes of appeal,that plaintiffs speech is protected by the first amendment.we also assume that plaintiffs produced evidence from which a reasonable jury could have found that mayor glidewell sought to punish plaintiffs in retaliation for their protected speech.in order to find that the city is liable for such an alleged tort,however,we must find that the planning commission,the final policy maker,acted with the improper motive.matthews,at.an improper motive of one of the members of a planning commission is not imputed to the rest of the commission.id.unconstitutional motive of one member of a majority is insufficient to impute an unconstitutional motive to a commission mason village of el portal,cir summary judgment for municipality appropriate where plaintiff showed evidence of discriminatory motive held by one member of a majority.
in matthews,the plaintiff alleged that her job as the county director of administrative services was eliminated in retaliation for her statements concerning a company with which the county was attempting to contract.three of five county commissioners voted to eliminate the position.in a special verdict,a jury determined that one of the commissioners was motivated to eliminate the position by the plaintiff protected speech and that the two other commissioners were influenced by that commissioner.we held,however,that the plaintiff evidence did not support a finding of unconstitutional motive on behalf of the county commission on the basis either of a theory of delegation or ratification.matthews,at.we found that a delegation theory applies only where a group with final policymaking authority delegates its authority to another person or entity,and that person or entity is not subject to any review by the original policymaker.id.citing scala city of winter park,cir.we also found that in order for a municipality to be liable under a ratification theory,the final policymaker must ratify not only the decision of its member with an unconstitutional motive,but also the unconstitutional basis itself.id.citing gattis brice,cir.
here,as in matthews,the evidence fails to show that the planning commission,the policymaker for the city,acted with an unconstitutional motive in denying plaintiffs tentative approval for their building project.the only evidence that plaintiffs offered into evidence were the opinions of bowlings that mayor glidewell influenced and controlled the planning commission there is not a scintilla of evidence that the commission knew of and ratified an unconstitutional motive in its decision to repeatedly table plaintiffs request for tentative approval of their project.without any evidence showing that a majority of the members of the final policymaker,the planning commission,acted with an unconstitutional motive,the trial judge erred in denying defendant rule motion with respect to the plaintiffs first amendment claim.
equal protection 
as a preliminary consideration,federal courts should be disinclined to sit as a zoning board of review,and as a general rule,zoning decisions will not usually be found by a federal court to implicate constitutional guarantees.greenbriar village,mountain brook,city,cir per curiam.nevertheless,the equal protection clause requires government entities to treat similarly situated people alike.equal protection claims are not limited to individuals discriminated against based on their membership in a vulnerable class.rather,we have recognized any individual right to be free from intentional discrimination at the hands of government officials.see,realty strickland,cir.to prevail on this traditional type of equal protection claim,basically a selective enforcement claim,that the city ordinance was applied to them,and not other developments,plaintiffs must show that they were treated differently from other similarly situated individuals,and that defendant unequally applied a facially neutral ordinance for the purpose of discriminating against plaintiffs.see strickland alderman,cir.
plaintiffs equal protection claim and the court jury instruction thereon seem to mirror a newer trend in equal protection law,a class of one claim without a necessary showing of ill will or discriminatory purpose.the supreme court has recognized the equal protection clause is implicated in class of one claims where the plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.village of willowbrook olech,d per curiam 
the analysis of plaintiffs equal protection claim requires a finding that there were developments which were similarly situated to the campbells proposed development,because d ifferent treatment of dissimilarly situated persons does not violate the equal protection clause.realty,at.a showing that two projects were similarly situated requires
