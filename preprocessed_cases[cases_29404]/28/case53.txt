in this action for declaratory and injunctive relief,four registered voters residing in north smithfield,rhode island the town seek to compel the holding of an election in november of.the plaintiffs claim that the town charter requires such an election and that the refusal of the town and various town comply with the charter abridges the plaintiffs first amendment rights to vote and to associate in an effort to parry this thrust,the defendants make four main arguments.first,they question the justification for federal court intervention.second,they point to a referendum,approved by the voters of north smithfield,which switched municipal elections to years starting in the year,and assert that this vote erases any need for an election in.third,the defendants claim that the voters ratified the plan to forgo the election during the election in which the ballot mentioned lengthened terms for certain elected officials.finally,the defendants interpose a series of equitable,estoppel,and the like.
the district court found no merit in the defendants contentions,see bonas town of north smithfield,slip op.at,and ordered the town to hold a regular election for town council and school committee in.on this expedited appeal,the defendants renew the same arguments that the district court rejected.we heard oral argument on september,and ruled ore tenus that the town must hold the election in question.this opinion explains the basis for our ruling.all applicable time periods,the time for filing petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc shall run from the date of this opinion rather than from the date of our oral advisory.
background 
in,the voters of north smithfield affirmatively answered four related referendum questions designed to transition the town from an election cycle to an cycle.the text of these referendum questions three of which refer to the amendment of specified sections of the town charter follows 
article ii,section the regular town election be held the first tuesday after the first monday in november in even numbered years beginning in the year 
article v,section the term of the town administrator begin on the first day of december next following election and extend to november of the year and every two years thereafter 
article xiv,section school committee members be elected at large at the regular biennial elections in even numbered years,keeping their staggered terms beginning in the year and serve for a term of four years and until successor is elected and qualified 
shall all other provisions of the charter relating to the election,such as declarations,endorsements,nomination papers and primary date,be amended to be consistent with the state election calendar 
at the time of the referendum,article ii,section,of the town charter stated that a regular town election shall be held on the first tuesday after the first monday in november in years.the charter further provided that town council members would be chosen at these regular town election s,and article iv,section,mandated that town councillors,once elected,would serve for a term of two years,such term to begin on the first day of december next following their election,or until their successors are elected and qualified.article xiv,section,decreed that each school committee member shall be elected at large at the regular biennial elections in years to serve for a term of four years and until his successor is elected and qualified,and staggered the terms so that three of the five school committee slots were filled in one regular biennial election and the remaining two were filled in the next.
the charter amendments resulting from the referendum make clear that the first town election is to take place in.those amendments do not explicitly mention any changes in the election schedule leading up to that year,other than a lengthening of the town administrator term which would run from to.had the amendments contained similar language with respect to the town council and school committee terms,this case would not have seen the light of day.
three school committee members had been elected in,each to serve a term in accordance with the charter provisions in effect at that time.two school committee seats,and all the town council seats,were up for election in.despite the absence of any explicit voter mandate approving lengthened terms for town council and school committee members,the official ballot for the municipal election listed the terms for these offices as three and five years,respectively these inscriptions appeared out of thin air neither the town council nor the board of canvassers had taken any official action aimed at lengthening the terms for these offices,and the meeting minutes for the relevant periods do not reflect that the matter was even considered.notwithstanding this lack of documentation,however,the defendants what it may be this extension was openly discussed in various official venues both before and after the referendum that one candidate for office in the november election distributed a flyer stating that t he next election will be held in november and that much of the electorate plainly understood that the extension was part of the transition package.
relying on this understanding and on the language that appeared on the ballot,the defendants decided not to hold a municipal election in.the registered voters in the town of north smithfield who desire to exercise their right to vote for town council and school committee in the that they learned of the town intention to forgo the election in february of,at which point they unsuccessfully petitioned the town council and board of canvassers for redress 
invoking,the plaintiffs then filed suit in the federal district court,claiming a denial of their right to vote and their right to political association under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.the district court heard the matter on for summary judgment,filed after the parties had stipulated to the pertinent facts.ruling from the bench on august,the district court granted the plaintiffs motion,denied the,and ordered the defendants to hold a regular town election in the year for town council and three school committee seats.the court further explained its rationale in a written decision issued two weeks later.this appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction 
the most in the plaintiffs path is the question of federal jurisdiction federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,and therefore must be certain that they have explicit authority to decide a case.see irving united states,cir en banc.thus,we subject the plaintiffs choice of a federal forum to careful scrutiny.
an earlier election case,griffin burns,cir,sets forth the analytic framework.first,because the jurisdictional statute,parrots the text of,federal jurisdiction hinges upon the existence vel non of a substantial claim under section.griffin,at.in other words,federal courts have jurisdiction over claims arising out of a state or local electoral dispute if,and to the extent that,the complaint limns a set of facts that bespeaks the violation of a constitutionally guaranteed right.
it is certain that the right to wellspring of all rights in a constitutionally protected.the supreme court long ago described that right as a fundamental political right.yick wo hopkins.thus,the constitution protects the right of all qualified citizens to vote,in state as well as in federal elections.reynolds sims,d.since municipalities are political subdivisions of state government,this means that the right to vote in local elections including referenda elections is constitutionally protected.see griffin,at.
despite this bedrock federal interest,a federal court may not inject itself into the midst of every local electoral dispute.election law,as it pertains to state and local elections,is for the most part a preserve that lies within the exclusive competence of the state courts.powell power,cir.thus,with only a few narrow and exceptions,federal courts are not authorized to meddle in local elections.consequently,they normally may not superintend the conduct of local electoral contests or undertake the resolution of garden variety election irregularities.griffin,at.
it is our task,then,to separate wheat from chaff,and to determine whether this case fits into one of the isthmian exceptions to this general rule of.the first,and most developed,justification for federal court intervention exists when a discrete group of voters suffers a denial of equal protection.see,reynolds,at.because there is no evidence that a particular category of north smithfield voters will suffer disproportionately from the defendants decision to forgo the election,this case does not fit that mold.
federal court involvement also may be proper when a denial of substantive due process occurs,that is,i f the election process itself reaches the point of patent and fundamental unfairness.griffin,at.we found such a parlous state of affairs in griffin,when rhode island election officials,relying on a ruling of the state supreme court,made an decision not to count absentee and ballots that had been cast in a primary election.because that decision changed the rules at the end of the game,resulting in the annulment of an entire class of ballots that likely would have been,we upheld the district court order for a new election in the affected ward.id.at.
although some subsequent cases have distinguished griffin,see,henry connolly,cir distinguishing griffin in respect to the scuttling of a ballot initiative for failure to comply with signature prerequisites partido nuevo progresista perez,cir distinguishing griffin,in a ballot mismarking case,on the ground that the claimed injury was indirect vote dilution as opposed to direct disenfranchisement,none have weakened its core holding that,in those few cases in which organic failures in a state or local election process threaten to work patent and fundamental unfairness,a colorable claim lies for a violation of substantive due process and,hence,federal jurisdiction attaches.other courts also have struggled with plotting the boundaries of federal jurisdiction in this area,but,in the main,have adhered at least approximately to griffin core holding.see,marks stinson,cir citing griffin and decertifying the winner of a local election in the face of massive absentee ballot fraud see also hennings grafton,cir suggesting that wilful conduct which undermines the organic processes by which candidates are elected may violate the constitutional right to vote.
we do not pretend that it is a simple matter to segregate electoral disputes from those that appropriately can be characterized as harbingers of patent and fundamental unfairness.see navedo acevedo,cir declining to find that asserted election irregularities reached the level of federal constitutional violations,but noting that it is not always easy to draw the line reflected in the differing outcomes of the decided cases.like beauty,fundamental fairness frequently lies in the eye of the beholder.but the constitution does not ensure a rule for every situation.in respect to federal jurisdiction over claims arising out of a state or local election dispute,each case must be evaluated on its own facts.
in this chiaroscuro corner of the law,one thing is clear total and complete disenfranchisement of the electorate as a whole is patently and fundamentally unfair and,hence,amenable to rectification in a federal court.here,our evaluation of whether such widespread disenfranchisement has occurred a question of state law do state and local rules mandate an election in north smithfield for the offices of town council and school committee in the fall of assuming that such an election is topic to which we shortly shall town refusal to hold it would work a total and complete disenfranchisement of the electorate,and therefore would constitute a violation of due process in addition to being a violation of state law.
in deciding that cases of total and complete disenfranchisement of the electorate as a whole are federally justiciable,we find duncan poythress,cir.unit b,particularly helpful.in that case,the court held that the refusal of georgia state officials to call a special election to fill a position on the georgia supreme court violated the electors constitutional right to vote.id.at.the court reasoned that,since georgia law required a special election following the resignation of any elected official,the governor appointment of a successor to a retiring justice constituted a violation of substantive due process.id.at citing griffin,at.
along with the duncan court,we can imagine no claim more deserving of constitutional protection than the allegation that officials have purposely abrogated the right to vote id.at.here,as in duncan,the decision to dispense with an election was deliberate.if the decision is allowed to stand,every resident of north smithfield will be deprived of his or her right to vote for the affected offices.in our judgment,such disenfranchisement betokens an utter breakdown of the electoral process.that extraordinary circumstance is far removed from the garden variety election irregularities that courts have held insufficient to support federal intervention.griffin,at.
in concluding that we have jurisdiction to hear and determine this case,we do not open the door to routine federal intervention in state and local elections.this case is the exception to the general rule of.we emphasize that deciding it does not embroil the federal courts in the detailed administration of a local election.the case does not involve tinkering with the state election machinery,reviewing petitions,registration cards,vote tallies,and certificates of election for all manner of error and insufficiency.id.at citing powell,at.the violation is,as we have said,to disenfranchisement of the electorate as a the district court has prudently selected a remedy that allows the electoral machinery to move forward without continuing federal involvement.that remedy simply orders the town to hold an election in.it is essentially the same as the remedy approved in griffin,duncan,and marks.
to say more on this point would be supererogatory.based on the foregoing,we hold that the district court appropriately exercised jurisdiction over the plaintiffs complaint 
iii.the merits 
it remains for us to examine the provisions of the north smithfield town charter to determine whether,in fact,they require an election in.the defendants advance two related theories in support of their putative authority to extend the terms of town council and school committee members.first,they suggest that the referendum,taken together with existing charter provisions,should be construed to dispense with the election.second,they suggest that the electorate ratified the extension of terms when votes were cast in the election using an official ballot which indicated that town council and school committee members would serve three and terms,respectively.see supra note.both theories fail.
by its unvarnished terms,the referendum mandated that the first election take place in,but,except with respect to the office of town office that the plaintiffs concede should not be up for election in not provide for any changes in the election calendar or terms of office prior to that date.sailing headlong into the teeth of this plain language which is given more bite by the utter absence of any record of official approval of a term defendants maintain that the intended consequence,all along,was to postpone the election until.to buttress this claim,they submit various affidavits to show that this consequence was mentioned both at town council meetings and at an informational meeting,open to the public,held prior to the vote on the referendum.
the interpretation urged by the defendants has a certain superficial appeal.to transition from an to an election cycle there must,by necessity,exist at least one irregular term.theoretically,either lengthening or shortening the wonted terms of elected officials could serve this purpose.this does not mean,however,that municipal officials are free to choose the alternative they prefer,which,unsurprisingly,happens to be the alternative that perpetuates them in office.because charter amendments must be sanctioned by the voters,const.art.xiii,w
