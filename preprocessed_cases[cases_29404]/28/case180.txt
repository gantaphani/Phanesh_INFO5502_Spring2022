plaintiffs,carrie harkless,tameca mardis,and the association of community organizations for reform now acorn collectively,plaintiffs,appeal the dismissal of their suit brought pursuant to the national voter registration act of nvra.the suit alleges that the defendants,jennifer brunner,secretary of state for the state of ohio the secretary,and helen,director of the department of job and family services djfs for the state of ohio the director,failed to comply with section of the nvra.because the complaint states a cause of action against the secretary and the director,we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
because this is an appeal from the grant of a rule b motion to dismiss,the following account accepts as true the facts alleged in the complaint.jones city of cincinnati,cir.harkless is an ohio citizen living in lorain.she receives food stamps,medicaid assistance,and cash assistance through ohio works first.these benefits are administered by the djfs for the state of ohio.harkless is eligible to vote in ohio,and she was previously registered to vote.however,she has moved since registering to vote and has not changed her voter registration address,and she has not been offered the opportunity to register to vote or change her voter registration address on any of her visits to the djfs,as required by section of the nvra.
mardis is an ohio citizen living in cleveland.she receives food stamps and medicaid assistance through the djfs.she is eligible to vote in ohio,but she is not registered to vote and has not been offered the opportunity to register to vote on any of her visits to the djfs,as required by section of the nvra.
acorn is a organization incorporated in louisiana with several offices in ohio.its main ohio office is in cleveland,and it has more than members in its six ohio chapters.it spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year on voter registration activities in the state of ohio.acorn regularly conducts voter registration drives to collect voter registration applications from people outside of djfs offices who were not offered the opportunity to register to vote during visits to djfs offices,as required by section of the nvra.
there is widespread noncompliance with the nvra requirements.the secretary has limited her activities to the maintenance of a telephone number that county djfs offices may call to receive more voter registration application forms.the djfs denied legal responsibility for ensuring that voter registration services are available at public assistance agencies.the defendants have failed to monitor nvra compliance by djfs offices or enforce the mandates of section of the nvra in such offices.spot checks performed during october and november of at djfs offices in lorain,franklin,delaware,lake,mahoning,and cuyahoga counties revealed that there were no voter registration forms at any offices except in mahoning county.a survey conducted by acorn revealed that only out of people exiting a djfs office were offered a form asking whether they wanted to register to vote.between and,djfs offices for rural counties with relatively small populations registered far more voters than urban counties with larger populations and more people living at or below the poverty line.in the same time period,djfs offices in counties failed to register a single voter,djfs offices in counties registered fewer than voters,and djfs offices in counties registered fewer than voters.during and,djfs offices statewide processed about million applications for food stamps and processed less than of that number of voter registration application forms.
on february,the greater cleveland voter coalition sent a letter to the secretary outlining ohio failure to comply with the nvra and requesting that steps be taken to bring the state into compliance.on may,acorn sent a letter to the secretary to provide written notice of the violations as required by the nvra.the letter stated that acorn would bring suit unless ohio devised a plan to implement the nvra.the director was sent a copy of the letter.on may,the secretary office responded to the greater cleveland voter coalition letter,asserting that nvra compliance was not the secretary responsibility.acorn received a copy of the letter.acorn again wrote the secretary in july,offering to meet and address steps ohio could take to ensure nvra compliance.the secretary did not respond,and in september the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the northern district of ohio alleging that the secretary and the director failed to fulfill their obligations under section of the nvra.
b.the district court opinions 
the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss.harkless blackwell d.first,the court concluded that acorn lacked standing to bring suit.id.at.it ruled acorn lacked standing to sue on its own behalf because the complaint failed to allege that acorn ability to further its goals had been perceptively impaired so as to constitute far more than simply a setback to the organization abstract social interests.id.the court ruled that acorn lacked associational standing because acorn failed to allege anything except a setback to its abstract social interests,and acorn failed to allege facts demonstrating that any of acorn members have suffered,or will suffer,a concrete,actual injury traceable to defendants alleged violations of the nvra.id.at.
second,the court ruled that the complaint should not be dismissed on grounds that harkless and mardis failed to comply with the nvra notice requirements.id.at.citing acorn miller,cir,it held that the sixth circuit has determined that notice sent by acorn of the same nvra violation alleged by the individual plaintiffs satisfies the notice requirement.harkless,d at.
third,the court concluded that the secretary was not a proper party to the suit because the fact that plaintiffs allege that counties are not complying with their duties under the law is insufficient to state a claim against the secretary.id.at.the court ruled that under the ohio revised code and the ohio administrative code the county djfs offices bore the burden of providing voter registration forms,and the county djfs offices have a duty to implement procedures designed to comply with the nvra.id.at.the court found support for this conclusion in united states missouri,wl.may.in missouri,t he court held that despite the fact that,pursuant to the nvra,missouri has designated the secretary of state as the chief election official to coordinate nvra responsibilities for missouri,the secretary of state was not responsible for the enforcement of the nvra against local election authorities.harkless,d at.the court distinguished this case from united states new york,d,which held that two state public assistance agencies,which delegated their nvra responsibilities to local agencies,were responsible for ensuring that their district offices complied with the nvra.harkless,d at.the court found that new york is distinguishable because that case made clear that new york law granted the state control over the local offices.id.
finally,the court concluded that the director was not a proper party to the suit because no nvra section requires the director of a state public assistance agency to ensure compliance by county departments,and the ohio statutes do not require the ohio djfs to ensure that the county departments comply with the nvra.id.at.
the court denied the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration,but it did not address their request to file an amended complaint,apparently finding it moot in light of its decision that the defendants were not proper parties.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a cause of action.league of united latin am.citizens bredesen,cir citing kottmyer maas,cir.the court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,accept all factual allegations as true and determine whether plaintiffs undoubtedly can prove no set of facts consistent with their allegations that would entitle them to relief.id.citing kottmyer,at.
iii.analysis 
the overarching question in this case is whether states should be held responsible for implementing the requirements of section of the nvra.the two related secondary questions are whether ohio secretary of state,designated by ohio implementing legislation as the chief election official,has a role in ensuring ohio compliance with the nvra,and whether the director of the djfs has a role in ensuring ohio compliance with the nvra.we first address the statutory framework and then address each defendant in turn.
a.the nvra and ohio implementing legislation 
congress enacted the nvra,stat,et,to increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for federal office,to protect the integrity of the electoral process,and to ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.id.b see also acorn miller,cir holding that congress passed the nvra i n an attempt to reinforce the right of qualified citizens to vote by reducing the restrictive nature of voter registration requirements.this case involves section of the nvra,designed specifically to increase the registration of the poor and persons with disabilities who do not have driver licenses and will not come into contact with the other principal place to register under this act motor vehicle agencies,at,as reprinted in.
the nvra requires that notwithstanding any other federal or state law,each state shall establish procedures to register to vote in elections for federal office by application in person at a federal,state,or nongovernmental office designated under section.a b.section requires that states designate as voter registration agencies vras all offices in the state that provide public assistance and all offices in the state that provide programs primarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.id.a a b.in ohio,the djfs and all of its local offices have been designated as vras.see ohio ann.x.vras are required to distribute voter registration applications,assist applicants in completing applications,and accept completed applications.a a i iii.thus,in accordance with the nvra,any time a person enters a djfs office to receive food stamps,medicaid assistance,welfare,or disability benefits assistance,that person should receive a voter registration form for federal elections and assistance in filling out the form.
the nvra also mandates that e ach state shall designate a state officer or employee as the chief state election official to be responsible for coordination of state responsibilities under the nvra.id.as noted in the legislative history,this official is responsible for implementing the state functions under the bill,at.in ohio,that official is the secretary.
the nvra authorizes judicial intervention if a state fails to comply with its terms.miller,at citing.the attorney general may bring a civil action in an appropriate district court for such declaratory or injunctive relief as is necessary to carry out the nvra.a.also,a person who is aggrieved by a violation of the nvra may bring a civil action in an appropriate district court for declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the violation.id.b.
ohio implementing legislation 
to implement the nvra,the ohio general assembly passed amended substitute senate bill,which incorporated the nvra mandates into chapter of the ohio revised code.ohio law requires each djfs office to designate one person within that agency to serve as coordinator for the voter registration program within the agency and its departments,divisions,and programs.the designated person shall be responsible for administering all aspects of the voter registration program for that agency as prescribed by the secretary of state.ohio ann.a.the djfs offices are required to provide voter registration applications and assistance in the registration of persons qualified to register to vote,id.b,distribute a form in conjunction with the voter registration application that states,inter alia,that registering to vote or declining to register will not affect the amount of assistance provided,id.c,distribute a voter registration form to each applicant with each application for service or assistance,id.d,and train employees to administer the voter registration program and accept completed voter registration applications,id.e.the djfs county department s shall make voter registration applications as prescribed by the secretary of state under ohio ann.available to persons who are applying for or receiving public assistance.id.
ohio has designated the secretary as its chief election officer.id.the secretary must p rescribe a general program for registering voters or updating voter registration information,such as name and residence changes,by designated agencies,id.r,p rescribe a program of distribution of voter registration forms through designated agencies,id.s,and a dopt rules for the purpose of implementing the program for registering voters through designated agencies,id.u.the secretary must also transmit written instructions on the implementation of the voter registration program within each designated agency,id.f,and prepare and cause to be displayed in a prominent location in each designated agency a notice that identifies the person designated to assist with voter registration,the nature of that person duties,and where and when that person is available for assisting in the registration of voters,id.i.significantly,ohio law empowers the secretary to c ompel the observance by election officers in the several counties of the requirements of the election laws,id.m,and to investigate the administration of election laws,frauds,and irregularities in elections in any county,and report violations of election laws to the attorney general or prosecuting attorney,or both,for prosecution,id.at n.
are the defendants proper parties 
the secretary 
to determine whether the secretary may be held responsible for ohio nvra violations,we need not look further than the text of the statute.the nvra requires that each state designate a state officer or employee as the chief state election official to be responsible for coordination of state responsibilities under the nvra.as noted in the legislative history,this designated official is responsible for implementing the state function under the bill,at.see also coal.for students with disabilities educ.legal defense fund taft,no,wl,at,ohio secretary of state and not its governor has the duty and authority to implement and enforce the provisions of the nvra.voluntary guidance on implementation of statewide voter registration lists,election assistance comm n,at ii g,the chief state election official is the highest ranking state official who has,as a primary duty,the responsibility to ensure the lawful administration of voter registration in federal elections.
despite this clear language,the that the only task that congress imposed upon her is the coordination of state responsibilities under th e act.according to her,beyond this duty to coordinate,congress assigned no specific tasks to the secretary,instead choosing to allow states to determine how to allocate responsibility for the nvra mandates.and,because ohio chose to implement its requirements through the county departments and to make local officials responsible,those local officials,not the secretary,are the proper parties to this lawsuit.
under the plain language of the statute,the designated officer,here the secretary,must coordinate state responsibilities.coordination,according to the oxford english dictionary,is t he action of the condition or state of being or.oxford english dictionary ed.it is also defined as the h armonious combination of agents or functions towards the production of a result.id.the secretary focus on the word coordination in isolation ignores the phrase it modifies,which is state responsibilities namely,that e ach state shall designate a state officer or employee who is to be responsible for coordination of state responsibilities.those responsibilities include the requirement that each state designate as voter registration agencies all offices in the state that provide public assistance.id.a a.the act goes on to state,in no uncertain terms,that each vra shall distribute voter registration forms,assist applicants in completing voter registration forms,and accept completed forms.id.a a.
the secretary argues that once the state designates an office as a vra,her responsibility ends,and it is up to the designated office to carry out the remaining tasks.according to this view,if every state passed legislation delegating nvra responsibilities to local authorities,the fifty states would be completely insulated from any enforcement burdens,even if nvra violations occurred throughout the state 
however,the entire act,including other subsections,speaks in terms of state responsibilities what is noticeably missing is any mention of county,municipal,or other local authorities.indeed,congress grafted the nvra onto the existing public assistance structure,under which the fifty states,not their political subdivisions,have the ultimate accountability.accordingly,the better interpretation of the statute reads these two provisions each state shall designate voter registration agencies,and that each state shall ensure that the agencies complete the required tasks.and the secretary,as ohio chief election officer,is responsible for harmonious combination or implementation and that program on behalf of ohio 
two other provisions of the nvra confirm this reading of the statute.first,private citizens aggrieved by a violation of the nvra may bring a lawsuit for declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the violation.id.b.but before doing so,that person must provide written notice of the violation to the chief election official of the state involved.id.only i f the violation is not corrected within days after receipt of a notice,is a private citizen then authorized to bring suit.id.second,section also provides that a ll departments,agencies,and other entities of the executive branch of the federal government shall,to the greatest extent practicable,cooperate with the states in carrying out the act.id.b.these provisions would be pointless if states could abdicate their responsibilities by delegating them to local officials.requiring plaintiffs to send notice to their chief election official about ongoing nvra violations would hardly make sense if that official did not have the authority to remedy nvra violations.similarly,federal cooperation with state authorities would be meaningless if states had no role in the implementation or enforcement of nvra requirements.
furthermore,the courts that have been faced with similar issues support this reading of the nvra.in united states new york,d,the district court considered whether two state agencies were required to ensure nvra compliance by district offices run by local governments.the court concluded that i t would be plainly unreasonable to permit a mandatorily designated state agency to shed its nvra responsibilities because it has chosen to delegate the rendering of its services to local municipal agencies.id.at.similarly,the fourth circuit in robertson jackson,cir,discussed,in the context of the food stamp act,whether state agencies may avoid their federal responsibilities through delegation.the court concluded that a state that chooses to operate its program through local agencies can not thereby diminish the obligation to which the state,as a state,has committed itself,namely,compliance with federal requirements.id.at see also woods united states,cir while the state may choose to delegate some administrative responsibilities,the ultimate responsibility for operation of the food stamp program remain s with the state.
the only case to the contrary,united states missouri,wl.may,was reversed in united states missouri,cir.the district court held that the missouri secretary of state was not a proper defendant in an action under section of the nvra concerning maintenance of voter registration lists,because state law vested authority for voter registration lists in the state local election officials.missouri,wl,at.
in missouri,the district court explicitly relied on the fact that missouri law did not give the secretary of state enforcement authority.id.at.on appeal,the eighth circuit found that u nder the nvra plain language,missouri may not delegate its responsibility to a local official and thereby avoid responsibility.missouri,at.ohio statutes implementing the nvra,in contrast,bestow upon the secretary an obligation to enforce statewide compliance with the nvra.under ohio ann.n,the secretary of state shall investigate the administration of election laws,frauds,and irregularities in elections in any county,and report violations of election laws to the attorney general or prosecuting attorney,or both,for prosecution.in performing these duties,the secretary may administer oaths,issue subpoenas,summon witnesses,compel the production of books,papers,records,and other evidence,and fix the time and place for hearing any matters relating to the administration and enforcement of the election laws.id.cc.accordingly,even if the word coordination in the nvra is truly vague,ohio law makes it abundantly clear that the secretary is responsible for the implementation and enforcement of section.ohio law also makes clear that she has the authority to do so.
the rule upon which the secretary so heavily relies,does not help her.first,as we have explained,the nvra and ohio implementing statute are clear the secretary is responsible for managing the multiple state responsibilities under the nvra.second,the rule does not apply to the nvra.the secretary is correct that when congress attempts to abrogate a state sovereign immunity under section of the fourteenth amendment,it must make its intent to do so clear and unequivocal.see,gregory ashcroft,d will.dep t of state police,d pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.congress enacted the nvra,however,under article i,section of the constitution,more commonly known as the elections clause acorn miller,cir.
in miller,we explained that the elections clause explicitly grants congress the authority either to make laws regarding federal elections,or to alter the laws initially promulgated by the states.thus,unlike the commerce clause,article i section specifically grants congress the authority to force states to alter their regulations regarding federal elections.id.indeed,as the text of the constitution makes clear,the clause expressly presses states into the service of the federal government by specifying that state legislatures shall prescribe the details necessary to hold congressional elections.this stands in stark contrast to virtually all other provisions of the constitution,which merely tell the states not what they must do but what they can or can not do.acorn edgar,cir.when it comes to time,place,and manner regulations for federal elections,the constitution primarily treats states as election administrators rather than sovereign entities.see id.at i n this case illinois advances the notion that to make a state administer federal elections fatally compromises state sovereignty.that particular fatal compromise,however,is built into the constitution,precisely in article i section,the first sentence of which places the burden of administering federal elections on the states.
the elections clause also gives a broad grant of power to congress,allowing it to define the boundaries of state transgressions and to remedy any wrongdoing.the commerce clause read in conjunction with the necessary and proper clause,for example,only permits congress to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to regulate commerce among the several states by contrast,the elections clause allows congress to make or alter laws affecting the states.see miller,at edgar,at.in ratifying article i,section,the states not only gave congress plenary authority over federal elections but also explicitly ensured that all conflicts with similar state laws would be resolved wholly in favor of the national government accordingly,the logic behind the congress must be explicit when it encroaches in areas traditionally within a state core governmental not apply when congress acts under the elections clause,as it did in enacting the nvra.see miller,at rejecting michigan argument that the nvra is u
