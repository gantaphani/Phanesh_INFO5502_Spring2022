imagine if a state imposed these restrictions on candidates for election to the legislature they shall not identify themselves as a member of a political party in any form of advertising or when speaking to a gathering they shall not solicit campaign funds and they shall not make a statement that a reasonable person would perceive as committing the candidate to vote a certain way on a n issue likely to come before the legislature.a court faced with a first and fourteenth amendment challenge to the law would make short work of it.legislative candidates have a first amendment right to associate publicly with a political party,see tashjian republican party of,to solicit campaign funds,see riley fed.of the blind of,and to communicate to their constituents how they will vote on the issues of the day,see brown hartlage.it is doubtful that a single federal or state court judge in the country would see it differently.
yet what happens if the same restrictions apply to judicial elections,not legislative elections some say the answer is the same.elections are elections,and the same first amendment applies to all of them.when the government suppresses election speech based on its candidates from mentioning a political party with whom they affiliate,barring them from putting their name on a letter or telling them what they can and can not say about their judicial most rigorous form of constitutional applies,and no categorical exemption from the first amendment spares the government from this burden.in modern america,judicial elections are no less relevant to the public policy concerns of the citizenry than legislative elections,and the first amendment protects electioneering speech in the one context as vigorously as it does in the other.concerns about impartiality and that might result from unfettered judicial campaigning can be handled after the elections,not before,through the application of judicial recusal rules that all states require their judges to follow before they agree to hear a case.any remaining concerns flow not from the absence of speech restrictions on judicial candidates but from the state insistence on holding elections for judicial office in the first place.a state can not simultaneously insist that judges be held accountable to the electorate at regular intervals but deny to sitting judges and candidates alike the communicative tools for explaining how they will be held to account.
others say it is not that easy.judges do not represent constituents.they apply the law to the facts one case at a time,and,if they represent anyone or anything,it is the rule of law,which is why they sometimes must rule against the policy preferences of a majority of the voters.the judicial process works only when it is done in a disinterested manner,which is inconsistent with campaigns in which judges commit to rule,or appear to commit to rule,in a certain way in certain cases.it is one thing when a legislator solicits money during a campaign it is quite another when a judicial candidate,a sitting judge above all,does the same.with a few modest exceptions,see,caperton massey coal.court rule,rules are and therefore may not provide adequate safeguards against the risks that flow from treating judicial elections like legislative ones.unlike the other branches of government,the authority of the judiciary turns almost exclusively on its credibility and the respect warranted by its rulings,both of which are likely to be diminished by electoral speech that permits the malignant inference that there is such a thing as judges and judges.in some settings,there can be too much of a good thing,and unfettered free speech in judicial elections is one of them.
this is a complicated debate,and today case requires us to take a side on some of these issues.most recently in,the kentucky supreme court promulgated a judicial canon along the lines of the hypothetical legislative campaign rules mentioned above.as sitting judges ourselves,we have considerable sympathy for the concerns that prompted the canon,so much so that we embrace a central premise of it judicial elections differ from legislative elections,and the kentucky supreme court has a compelling interest in regulating judicial campaign speech to ensure the reality and appearance of an impartial judiciary.yet because two clauses of the canon overlooked narrower ways of advancing this interest and because,as written,they remain incompatible with the united states supreme court decision in republican party of minnesota white,we must invalidate them.the third clause is constitutional in the main but contains a material ambiguity,which requires further consideration by the district court.the district court decision is affirmed in part and vacated in part.
in,kentucky became the fifteenth state and the fourth commonwealth.the original kentucky constitution permitted the governor to appoint judges,see.const,but the commonwealth,in the aftermath of the age of jackson,amended its constitution in to require its judges to stand for popular election to terms.see.const.const.since,judicial elections in kentucky have been nonpartisan,compare.const.with.const,meaning that political parties have no formal role in any stage of the judicial selection process.prospective candidates submit petitions for nomination to the secretary of state.ann.the commonwealth holds a single primary election for each judicial seat with no party identifiers and random ballot positioning.id.the top two in the primary election receive a spot on the general election ballot,which also is held without any party identifier.id.
in competing for judicial seats,all candidates must abide by the kentucky code of judicial conduct.promulgated by the kentucky supreme court,it generally prohibits a judge or judicial candidate from inappropriate political activity.rules of supreme court of kentucky,canon.sitting judges or judicial candidates violate this admonition,the code says,if they fail to follow these clauses of canon,among others 
the party affiliation clause.a judge or candidate shall not identify himself or herself as a member of a political party in any form of advertising,or when speaking to a gathering.if not initiated by the judge or candidate for such office,and only in answer to a direct question,the judge or candidate may identify himself or herself as a member of a particular political party.canon.

in june,marcus carey,then a candidate for a seat on the kentucky supreme court,filed a complaint in federal district court claiming that the party affiliation,solicitation and commits clauses violated his speech and associational rights under the first and fourteenth amendments of the constitution.the named defendants sit on the kentucky judicial conduct commission,sit on the kentucky inquiry commission or serve as bar counsel.
carey complained that he wanted to disclose his party status,yet he feared the party affiliation clause barred him from doing so.he wanted to ask for campaign contributions by signing letters,yet he feared the solicitation clause barred him from doing so.and he wished to respond to a judicial questionnaire distributed by kentucky right to life,raising questions for the candidates about their judicial philosophy and about their positions on specific issues,yet he feared the commits clause barred him from doing so.he asked the court to declare the clauses unconstitutional on their face and to enjoin their enforcement.
in october,roughly one month before the election,the district court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the party affiliation and the solicitation clauses but dismissed carey challenge to the commits clause on ripeness and standing grounds.on november,carey moved to amend his complaint,the commits clause,this time detailing the statements he proposed to make in possible violation of the clause.about a week later,carey lost the election.
in september,the court ruled that carey amended challenge to the commits clause was ripe for review and allowed it to proceed along with carey challenges to the party affiliation and solicitation clauses.the parties all moved for summary judgment.in ruling on the motions,the district court determined that strict scrutiny applied to all of the challenges.it then invalidated the party affiliation and solicitation clauses on their face but rejected carey facial challenge to the commits clause.the state defendants appeal the court ruling on the party affiliation and solicitation clauses,and carey appeals the court ruling on the commits clause.
before turning to the merits,we must consider two jurisdictional questions implicated by these challenges did carey file his claims too early,making them unripe for judicial review,or too late,making them moot see warshak united states,cir en banc.
ripeness.designed to ensure that the federal courts resolve existing,substantial controversies,norton ashcroft,cir,not disputes anchored in future events that may not occur as anticipated or may not occur at all,rifle ass of am.magaw,cir,the ripeness doctrine ensures that a dispute is concrete and real before the judicial branch resolves it.three considerations inform the doctrine is the alleged injury likely to occur is the factual record sufficiently developed to resolve the question and what kinds of hardships,if any,will the parties face if the court delays resolution of the question warshak,at.in the context of a overbreadth challenge like this one,a relaxed ripeness standard applies to steer clear of the risk that the law may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.broadrick oklahoma.
carey meets these requirements.in future judicial elections,as in prior ones,he claims an interest in engaging in protected speech that implicates,if not violates,each clause.he wants to let voters know his party affiliation.he wants to solicit campaign funds directly,as opposed to indirectly via an election committee.and he wants to answer judicial questionnaires propounded by a local organization.these aspects of the canon at least chill,and in some instances prohibit,these forms of communication,and in the course of the november election,at least until the entry of the october injunction,carey censored himself on each topic.all of this establishes a credible fear of enforcement,norton,at,sufficient to overcome any ripeness concerns.
the kentucky judicial conduct commission persists that the kentucky supreme court and its ethics branch,the kentucky judicial ethics committee,have yet to apply these clauses to carey,noting that an authoritative construction of the canons may significantly alter the constitutional questions.commission opening br.at.that is all true,but it is a peculiar ground for staying our hand now with respect to all of these challenges,some of which involve clauses with little ambiguity.see city of lakewood plain dealer pub.this challenge dates from july,and a related challenge,supported by the same counsel,dates from september,see family trust found.of,wolnitzek,d.the commission has had ample time to request interpretations or modifications of canon by the committee or the court,yet apparently has not done so.nor has the commission,or anyone else in this case,asked the federal courts to certify any questions to the kentucky supreme court.these claims are ripe for review.
mootness.in one sense,carey original challenge seems moot because the november election has come and gone.carey filed his original complaint months ahead of the election,and moved to amend it a week before the election,yet here we are more than three years after the election,still considering his claims.carey,however,retains the right to run for judicial office again,and all candidates for judicial office in kentucky,whether sitting judges or not,are subject to canon.under these circumstances,the claims may proceed the alleged wrongs are capable of repetition,yet evading review,saving them from mootness,as the district court correctly held and as the parties do not dispute.see fed.election comm.right to life,briggs ohio elections comm n,cir.
two recent decisions of the supreme and the stage for resolving the merits of this dispute.at issue in white was a judicial canon,first promulgated by minnesota in,providing that a candidate for a judicial office,including an incumbent judge,shall not announce his or her views on disputed legal or political issues.of judicial conduct,canon a d i white,at.applying strict scrutiny,the court rejected minnesota contention that the canon preserved judicial impartiality in a permissible way.
to the extent the minnesota announce clause sought to preserve judicial impartiality in one lack of bias for or against either party to the proceeding,id.at court accepted the state interest as a compelling one.id.at.but the clause suffered from a problem because it did not restrict speech for or against particular parties,but rather speech for or against particular issues.id.at.it may be,the court acknowledged,that,when a case arises that turns on a legal issue on which the judge as a candidate had taken a particular stand,the party taking the opposite stand is likely to lose,but that is not due to any bias against that party for a ny party taking that position is just as likely to lose.id.at.
to the extent the state meant to advance impartiality in another absence of judicial preconception in favor of or against a particular legal view that was not a compelling interest.id.at.s ince avoiding judicial preconceptions on legal issues is neither possible nor desirable,pretending otherwise by attempting to preserve the appearance of that type of impartiality can hardly be a compelling state interest either.id.at.
and to the extent the state meant to promote impartiality in the sense of judicial the willing ness to consider views that oppose one preconceptions the court found it unnecessary to decide whether this desirable quality amounted to a compelling interest.id.at.it held that the clause was so poorly tailored to any interest in that the minnesota supreme court could not have adopted the announce clause for that purpose.id.judges,both incumbent and prospective,it reasoned,retained so many ways to communicate their views on legal issues other than through election statements that the clause gratuitously limited speech while leav ing appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited.id.at.
caperton dealt with a sitting state supreme court justice whose top campaign donor in the previous election,the head of a mining company,had spent million on his than all of his other supporters combined.see caperton.at.when a dispute involving the mining company came before the court,the justice refused to recuse himself from hearing it and ultimately joined the majority in ruling for the company.see id.at.the losing party claimed that the justice participation in the case violated its due process rights.the supreme court agreed,holding that,by refusing to disqualify himself,the justice had unconstitutionally deprived the parties of a fair hearing.see id.at.when there is a serious risk of actual bias,the court reasoned,the constitution requires judges to disqualify themselves,though the court cautioned that this was an extraordinary situation,emphasizing the size of the mining company support relative to other donors support,the apparently decisive effect of this support on the justice election and the close temporal connection between the justice election and the company case.id.at.
strict scrutiny applies to all three aspects of this first amendment challenge.white,for one,suggests as much,even if the decision does not compel that conclusion.in striking down minnesota announce clause,the court said the following about the standard of review 
as the court of appeals recognized,the announce clause both prohibits speech on the basis of its content and burdens a category of speech that is at the core of our first amendment freedoms speech about the qualifications of candidates for public office.at.the court of appeals concluded that the proper test to be applied to determine the constitutionality of such a restriction is what our cases have called strict scrutiny,at the parties do not dispute that this is correct.
the state defendants seize on the modest length of the court analysis and minnesota concession,arguing that we need not apply strict scrutiny here.but white brevity on this score and minnesota concession may suggest something else that the has little to support it.the amicus brief filed in support of minnesota did not question the applicability of strict scrutiny in white.see brief amicus curiae of california,et in support of respondents,republican party of kelly.not one of the justices,not even one of the four dissenters,objected to the application of strict scrutiny.and if strict scrutiny does not apply to judicial canons like this one and the one at issue in white,it is difficult to understand why the court exercised its discretion in reviewing white,given that virtually the entire analysis is premised on the applicability of strict scrutiny and given that the outcome of the case under a lower level of scrutiny is far from clear.
first principles also suggest that strict scrutiny should apply.the three canons censor speech based on its content in the most basic of ways they prevent candidates from speaking about some subjects judicial philosophy,the legal issues of the day,party affiliation but not others experience and they prevent candidates from asking for support in some ways campaign funds but not others a vote,yard signs.the canons refer directly to,and are justified with reference to,the content of candidates speech,meaning they are not eligible for the relaxed review that restrictions receive.ward rock against racism.
restrictions on speech generally face strict scrutiny,see united states playboy entm t group,u,and thus are presumptively invalid unless the restriction discriminates on the basis of categorically proscribable speech,see city of paul.see also united states stevens,slip.op.at april.none of the categorical apply.the canons do not address fighting words or incitement,see chaplinsky new hampshire,defamation,see beauharnais illinois,obscenity,see roth united states,or child pornography,see new york ferber.far from implicating these exceptions,today regulations implicate a core area of protection elections.see brown,at see also stevens,slip op.at declining to declare depictions of animal cruelty as a new categor y of speech outside the scope of the first amendment.
nor does the nature of the restrictions implicate any of the other areas or types of,place and manner restrictions,commercial speech,expressive which the court has applied review.the canons instead are of a piece with the kinds of speech candidates what they can and can not say before an the courts have scrutinized most rigorously.see,brown,at see also erwin chemerinsky,restrictions on the speech of judicial candidates are unconstitutional,explaining that strict scrutiny should apply to first amendment challenges to judicial canons like these mark spottswood,comment,free speech and due process problems in the regulation and financing of judicial election campaigns,nw,same.
the commission does not cite a single case,and we have not found one on our own,applying anything less than strict scrutiny to comparable challenges to judicial election canons.after white,the eighth circuit applied strict scrutiny to minnesota party affiliation and solicitation clauses.see republican party of white,cir en banc white ii.after white,the eleventh circuit did the same in invalidating georgia rules prohibiting judicial candidates from soliciting campaign funds.see weaver bonner,cir.after white,the seventh circuit applied strict scrutiny to wisconsin party affiliation clause and held that wisconsin solicitation clause survived both intermediate and strict scrutiny.see siefert alexander,slip op.at,cir.june.and,before white,the third circuit applied strict scrutiny in upholding some judicial speech restrictions.see stretton disciplinary bd.of supreme court of,cir.
the commission urges us to apply a form of intermediate scrutiny,which balances the competing fundamental rights of some judicial candidates who have a right to engage in campaign speech and some litigants who have a right to an impartial judiciary.commission opening br.at.but the reality that judicial impartiality is a vital state interest,protected by the due process clause,caperton.at,does not require us to dilute the first amendment.it establishes instead that kentucky has a compelling interest in preserving the canon,proving that the state can satisfy the first requirement of strict scrutiny,not that,having satisfied this requirement,it may water down the remaining requirements.
the commission analogy to gentile state bar of nevada,does not hold up.gentile balance d litigants fair trial rights with attorneys free speech rights in upholding a rule prohibiting attorneys involved in a pending trial from making statements likely to prejudice the proceedings.id.at.as these features of the decision suggest,gentile applies only to speech restrictions imposed on attorneys during a pending case,see id.at,which is one are a comparable law restricting judges from telling the press about the outcome of a pending case would not be an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech.today,however,we have a speech restriction aimed not at judges performing court functions but at judges and judicial candidates making campaign statements or solicitations outside of court and outside of the process of deciding cases in their official for the purpose of communicating information to voters about whom they should elect.that gentile upholds a law restricting a lawyer speech during a trial does not mean that it allows restrictions on lawyers in all settings.otherwise,a lawyer running to be the attorney general or governor of a state could be censored simply because she is an officer of the court.that is not the case.
the commission insists that the solicitation clause is an especially poor candidate for strict scrutiny review,because the supreme court applies a lesser standard of review to restrictions on political donations.see mcconnell fed.election comm n.but this argument gives analogy a bad name.the solicitation clause does not set a contribution limit,as in mcconnell and similar cases.see,e,fed.election comm right to work.it flatly prohibits speech,not donations,based on the topic solicitation of a contribution and speaker a judge or judicial candidate precisely the kind of regulations that traditionally warrant strict scrutiny.
because strict scrutiny applies,the commission faces a daunting gauntlet,as it is the rare law that survives this kind of review.burson freeman.to survive,the three canons must be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest.eu san francisco county democratic cent.
at the same time,carey seeks to invalidate these clauses not just as applied to him but in all of their applications,which is to say on their face.in most constitutional cases,that exceptional remedy requires the claimant to show one of two things that there truly are no or at least few circumstances in which the act would be valid,united states salerno,see also.state grange.state republican party,or that a court can not sever the unconstitutional textual provisions of the law or enjoin its unconstitutional applications.connection distrib.holder,cir en banc.the courts,however,rightly lighten this load in the context of challenges to the facial validity of a law.id.in view of the risk that enforcement of an overbroad law may deter people from engaging in constitutionally protected speech and may inhibit the free exchange of ideas,the overbreadth doctrine permits courts to invalidate a law on its face if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.stevens,slip op.at quoting.state grange,at.
party affiliation clause.this clause prohibits judges and candidates from disclosing their party affiliation in any form of advertising,or when speaking to a gathering,save in answer to a question by a voter in or very small private informal settings.rules of supreme court of kentucky,canon a kentucky judicial ethics opinion.the clause advances at least two interests,both sufficiently compelling to satisfy the first amendment.it furthers the commonwealth goal of having a judiciary that is neither biased in fact nor in appearance.see white,at.and it furthers the commonwealth interest in diminishing reliance on political parties in judicial selection,a policy grounded in the kentucky constitution requirement that judicial elections be nonpartisan in nature.
the problem,however,is not the commonwealth laudable interests in promulgating this canon it is the commonwealth methods in furthering them.the court frequently says that censoring speech must be a government measure of in advancing its policy interests,thompson states med,and the requirement is proof that the court means it.if a law does too much,or does too little,to advance the government objectives,it will fail.see eu,at.this canon does both.
the canon first problem is a white it suppresses too much speech to advance the government interest.in invalidating minnesota announce clause,white established that a state may not prohibit a judicial candidate from disclosing,say,that i am for limited government,i support a woman right to choose,i prefer laws,or,to use an example from white,i think it is constitutional for the legislature to prohibit marriage.at.the party affiliation clause prohibits all of this,only more so.it prohibits candidates from announcing their position on one issue of potential importance to voters the party they support.and it prohibits them from announcing their position on many issues of potential importance to voters the party platform with which they affiliate.a party platform after all is nothing more than an aggregation of political and legal positions,a shorthand way of announcing one views on many topics of the day.if the announce canon at play in white prevented candidates from communicating relevant information to voters on matters of current public importance,and did not narrowly advance the state interest in a judiciary,id.at,the same is true of kentucky canon,which potentially prevents candidates from announcing their views on many issues at once.see id.at we have never allowed the government to prohibit candidates from communicating relevant information to voters during an election.
at the same time,the canon does too little to advance the state interest in impartiality and the avoidance of partisan influence.party affiliation,as it turns out,is not a forbidden topic.it is forbidden only when the candidate raises the point.if,by contrast,a voter asks the question in a setting or in a small gathering,the candidate is free to say what she wants.that reality undermines the suggestion that a candidate deals a fatal blow to judicial impartiality by revealing her party affiliations.and of course,once that information is disclosed,whether in answer to a question or based on prior publicly known affiliations including holding other elected offices,nothing in the canon prohibits others,whether newspapers or political parties or interest groups,from disclosing to the world the candidate party affiliation.a law can not be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest order,and thus as justifying a restriction upon truthful speech,when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited.id.at.
the clause undershoots its target in another respect.although candidates may not reveal their party affiliation,they may discuss their membership in,affiliation with or support of any other type of organization,including organizations that take positions on judges and judicial philosophy.although the two major political parties take positions on a wide array of issues,many interest groups advance a narrower set of positions and often do so more vocally,particularly with respect to judges.by identifying themselves with such groups,candidates can communicate more about their political and judicial convictions than they ever could by carrying a party membership,in the process,may do as much to call judicial into question as any party affiliation ever would.
the canon also prohibits only disclosure of a candidate party membership,not party membership itself.yet the appearance of judicial is part and parcel of its reality,not a device designed to disguise reality.if concern over judicial partisanship and the influence of political parties on judging truly underlies the clause,the authorization to belong secretly to a political party amounts to a gaping omission.a party undisclosed potential influence on candidates is far worse than its disclosed influence,as the one allows a full airing of the issue before the voters while the other helps to shield it from public view.
kentucky responds that the restriction supports the kentucky constitution requirement that judicial elections be they operate with no partisan primaries and with no partisan identifiers at the ballot booth.see.const.the point,however,cuts both ways.in one sense,it establishes the bona fides of the commonwealth policy.but in another sense,it undermines the commonwealth professed need to suppress speech in the process.carey does not challenge the validity of prohibiting party identifiers on the ballot or the validity of holding primaries.he just wishes to communicate about a matter of potential interest to the voters and one that is often already a point of public his own terms.
most states have not made the choice kentucky did.fifteen states choose their supreme court justices in contested,nonpartisan elections,and only five,including kentucky,prohibit candidates in those elections from revealing their partisan affiliations.see app x three more prohibit candidates from claiming to be a candidate of a political organization but do not prohibit revealing membership or affiliation.id.and two of these five one and wisconsin have been invalidated.see siefert,slip op.at.that a majority of the states with nonpartisan supreme court elections have opted not to censor their candidates in this way of course does not establish the invalidity of the clause,but it does call into question the necessity of implementing kentucky nonpartisan judicial election system in this way and whether it amounts to the least restrictive means of protecting the commonwealth interests.playboy entm t group,at.
the commission says that the clause restricts as little speech as possible while preventing kentucky elections from turning into affairs.it allows judges,the commission adds,to join political parties,to participate in them and to disclose party affiliation if asked in the proper voters who care about a candidate partisan affiliation to discover it while preventing widespread advertisement of a candidate party membership and preventing judicial races from turning into partisan political campaigns.commission opening br.at.yet this argument looks at the problem through the wrong end of the telescope it merely demonstrates that the clause does not restrict as much speech as it might,not that the clause restricts no more speech than is necessary.
we do not doubt one of the premises of the party affiliation may not be a reliable indicator of the qualities that make a good judge.yet i t is simply not the function of government to select which issues are worth discussing or debating in the course of a political campaign,white,at quotation omitted,and it is difficult to see how kentucky speech restriction does not do just that.informational bans premised on the fear that voters can not handle the disclosure have a long history of being legislatively tried and judicially struck,whether in the election setting or elsewhere.see,brown,at the state fear that voters might make an choice does not provide the state with a compelling justification for limiting speech.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council.voters often resort to a variety of proxies in selecting judges and other office holders,some good,some bad.and while political identification may be an unhelpful way to pick judges,it assuredly beats other grounds,such as the formula of running candidates with familiar or popular last names.in that respect,this informational ban increases the likelihood that one of the least relevant grounds for judicial fortuity of one all that the voters will have to go on.as the district court correctly concluded,this clause violates the first amendment on its face.
solicitation clause.kentucky prohibits judicial candidates from solicit ing campaign funds,a restriction that extends to all fundraising by the candidate,including solicitations,group solicitations,telephone calls and letters.rules of supreme court of kentucky,canon b.the clause permits the candidate to establish a committee that may solicit campaign donations,and it permits the committee to disclose to the candidate the names of people who donated to the campaign and those who declined.see id.kentucky says that the clause satisfies the first amendment,but we,like the district court,conclude that it does not.
as with the party affiliation clause,we do not doubt the bona fides of the solicitation clause that it serves kentucky compelling interest in an impartial judiciary.the same goes for its interest in preserving the appearance and reality of a judiciary,an objective often served by fundraising limitations.see fed.election comm conservative political action.litigants have a due process right to a trial before a judge with no direct,personal,substantial pecuniary interest in the outcome,tumey.ohio,and the legitimacy of the judiciary rests on delivering on that promise and in furthering the public trust in the integrity of its judges,see mistretta united states.see generally caperton.
preserving these interests,we also acknowledge,grows more complicated when a state exercises its sovereign right to select judges through popular elections.judicial elections,like most elections,require a lot of it.kentucky supreme court election,which featured four contested races and one uncontested race,saw ten candidates raise a total of,of which the candidates spent on television commercials.brennan center for justice at nyu school of law,the new politics of judicial elections at.unless the pool of judicial candidates is limited to those wealthy enough to independently fund their campaigns,a limitation unrelated to judicial skill,the cost of campaigning requires judicial candidates to engage in fundraising.white,at,concurring.complicating matters further,the general public often,though not invariably,pays less attention to judicial elections than other elections,forcing judicial candidates to focus their fundraising efforts on the segment of the population most likely to have an interest in judicial races the bar.this leads to the unseemly situation in which judges preside over cases in which the parties are represented by counsel who have contributed in varying amounts to the judicial campaigns.stretton,at.
that the clause advances important government interests,however,does not establish that it does so narrowly.prohibiting candidates from asking for money suppresses speech in the most conspicuous of ways and,in the process,favors some candidates over judges who benefit from their current status over candidates,the who may not need to raise any money at all over candidates,and the who have an army of potential fundraisers over outsiders.for these reasons,it is tempting to say that any limitation on a candidate right to ask for a campaign contribution is one limitation too many.but there are at least two areas covered by the clause that test such an solicitations,particularly by sitting judges,and solicitations of individuals with cases pending in front of the court.yet we need not decide the validity of such restrictions today because kentucky goes well beyond them.
besides covering solicitations and those directed at individuals with pending cases,the canon prohibits a range of other solicitations,including speeches to large groups and signed mass mailings.such indirect methods of solicitation present little or no risk of undue pressure or the appearance of a quid pro quo.no one could reasonably believe that a failure to respond to a signed mass mailing asking for donations would result in unfair treatment in future dealings with the judge.nor would a speech requesting donations from a large gathering have a coercive effect on reasonable attendees.commission opening br.at compare ohralik ohio state bar ass n,state may regulate lawyers solicitation of clients because of intrusive ness of persuasion under circumstances conducive to uninformed acquiescence with in re primus,regulation of lawyer written,solicitation merited heightened scrutiny because it did not afford any significant opportunity for overreaching or coercion and shapero.bar ass n,targeted,solicitation is distinguishable from the solicitation because there is no badgering advocate breathing down a potential client neck,asking for an immediate answer.
at the same time,the clause does too little to protect the commonwealth interests.although the candidate himself may not solicit donations,his campaign committee may.and nothing prevents a committee member from soliciting donations in person.that leaves a rule preventing a candidate from sending a signed mass mailing to every voter in the district but permitting the candidate best friend to ask for a donation directly from an attorney who frequently practices before the court.are not the risks of coercion and undue appearance far less with the first prohibited solicitation than the second permitted one 
although the clause prevents judicial candidates from saying please,give me a donation,it does not prevent them from saying thank you for a donation given.the clause bars any solicitation,whether in a large group or small one,whether by letter or one on one,but it does not bar the candidate from learning how individuals responded to the committee solicitations.that omission suggests that the only interest at play is the impolitic interpersonal dynamics of a candidate request for money,not the more corrosive reality of who gives and how much.if the purported risk addressed by the clause is that the judge or candidate will treat donors and differently,it is knowing who contributed and who balked that makes the difference,not who asked for the contribution.if kentucky fears that judges will allow campaign donations to affect their rulings,it must believe that s uccessful candidates will feel beholden to the people who helped them get elected regardless of who did the soliciting of support.weaver,at.
two other circuits have considered the validity of similar canons and have come to similar conclusions.in weaver,the eleventh circuit considered a georgia rule providing that judicial candidates shall not themselves solicit campaign funds.at.relying on many of the same problems identified here,the court concluded that the canon was not narrowly tailored to serve georgia compelling interest in judicial impartiality.id.at.in white ii,on remand after the supreme court invalidated minnesota announce clause,the eighth circuit invalidated a canon that
