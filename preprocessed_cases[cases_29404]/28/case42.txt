richard mcclure filed suit against the secretary of the commonwealth of massachusetts and others,alleging an interference with both his right to vote and his right to run for political office under the first and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.he sought injunctive and declaratory relief,requiring that he be placed on the ballot as an independent candidate in the race for a state senate seat 
in march of,mcclure had sought certification from a town clerk to be placed on the ballot as an unenrolled candidate for state senate in massachusetts.unenrolled means not affiliated with any political party.the town clerk refused to issue the certification because mcclure had voted in the democratic party presidential primary on march.pursuant to a state statute.laws ch,such voting automatically enrolled mcclure as a democrat.pursuant to another state statute,ch,one running for an office as an independent must not be enrolled in a political party for the ninety days preceding the filing deadline for primaries for candidates running for state senate.as a result,mcclure temporary enrollment automatically disqualified him from running for the state senate as an independent because the deadline for filing an intent to run for that office was less than ninety days after the date of the democratic primary in which he voted.
the district court,after an expedited hearing,denied mcclure motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed his claim on may.mcclure galvin,no,wl,at.may.we now affirm this judgment.
the statutory scheme at issue here requires some elaboration.
massachusetts general laws chapter,section provides that an unenrolled candidate for elected office will not have her name printed on the ballot unless a certificate confirming this unenrolled status is obtained from the registrar of voters of the town where the candidate is a registered voter.such a certification will not be granted to any such candidate who shall have been an enrolled member of any political party during the time prior to the last day for filing nomination papers as provided in section ten,and on or after the day by which a primary candidate is required by section to establish enrollment in a political party.laws ch.in turn,chapter,section states that an enrolled candidate seeking to enter a party primary must have been a member of that party for the ninety days before the filing deadline for that primary,which is the last tuesday in may for candidates for state senate.the beginning date of the nonenrollment period for independent candidates is thus ninety days prior to the last tuesday in may.next,chapter,section establishes the last tuesday in may as the deadline for filing candidacies for offices for the general elections,and the last tuesday in may thus acts as the ending date for the nonenrollment period.the effect of chapter,section in was to require unenrolled candidates seeking a place on the ballot for state senate not to have been enrolled as a member of any political party between february,and may.this year,the state presidential primary was held within the period.
the nonenrollment period for independent candidates for,governor and federal,united states senator offices begins one week later,ninety days prior to the first tuesday in june.laws ch.the period thus did not include the presidential primaries for individuals running for these offices.
a similar scheme is in place for enrolled candidates.see.laws ch,individual seeking ballot placement for elected office as a member of any party,and who thus seeks to run in a party primary,needs a certificate certifying that he has been enrolled as a member of the political party whose nomination he seeks throughout the ninety days prior to the last day herein provided for filing nomination papers for the primary with the state secretary.in fact,since section incorporates section by reference,the beginning date of the period within which candidates running for a given office under a party banner must have been a member of that party is the exact same date as the beginning date of the period within which unenrolled candidates must not have been enrolled as a member of any party.for state senate candidates,this key date is ninety days prior to the last tuesday in may.see.laws ch.
massachusetts general laws chapter,section as currently in effect states that voters who are unenrolled at the time of appearing to vote in a primary may generally vote in any party primary.upon appearing to vote in a primary,a ballot clerk asks unenrolled voters in which primary they desire to vote they may then vote in that primary.laws ch.generally,an unenrolled voter can vote in party primaries without losing her unenrolled status.
there is an exception,however,for presidential primaries in a presidential primary,upon voting,the voter shall become enrolled in and shall remain a member of the political party whose ballot he received until he files a certificate,signed under the pains and penalties of perjury,with the board of registrars of voters,requesting to have his enrollment changed to another party or political designation or cancelled.laws ch.the change of status back to unenrolled is effective once the board receives the certificate.see.laws ch.there is no set amount of time that one must remain a member of the party in whose primary one has just voted unenrollment can take place immediately.
before a amendment to chapter,section,all primary voting by unenrolled voters not simply such voting in presidential primaries automatically enrolled previously unenrolled voters in that party.see.laws ann.ch,historical and statutory notes.since the amendment,however,only the presidential primaries have had that effect an unenrolled voter may vote in all other primaries without losing her unenrolled status 
voters currently enrolled in one party in massachusetts may not generally vote in any other party primary,and they may not switch their enrollment to another party within twenty days of a primary.laws ch.one effect of these laws is that no voter in massachusetts,enrolled or unenrolled,may vote in more than one party primary on a given primary day.see.laws ch.
mcclure is a registered voter in chelmsford,massachusetts,and was a registered republican until february,on that date he disenrolled and changed his status to unenrolled.on march,mcclure went to the polls to vote in the democratic party presidential primary in massachusetts.in his affidavit,he states that on that date,the ballot clerk asked him in which party presidential primary he would like to vote and when he asked for a democratic party ballot,the clerk put a large d next to his name.mcclure then told the ballot clerk that he did not want to enroll in the democratic party the clerk told him that he would not be enrolled in the democratic party and handed him a certificate indicating that he was establishing his voter status as unenrolled.after voting,a different clerk an exit clerk took this certificate from mcclure.elizabeth delaney,the town clerk of the town of chelmsford,stated,in her affidavit,that the effect of this certificate was merely to immediately change mcclure enrollment status back to unenrolled.however,he was briefly enrolled as a democrat.
on march,mcclure,having satisfied the other requirements to be an unenrolled candidate for state senate whose name appears on the ballot,applied to the chelmsford town clerk for a voter registration certificate.the town clerk had called him the previous day march and told him over the phone that she would not be able to grant such a certificate because mcclure voted in the democratic presidential primary on march,which enrolled him as a democrat within ninety days of the may deadline for filing.in this conversation,mcclure informed her of the misinformation he received from the ballot clerk.the town clerk responded that the election laws are very complex,one can not expect a checker at the polls to understand all of their details,and mcclure should have called her as chief election official if he had any questions or doubts.on march,the town clerk formally and in writing denied mcclure certificate.
mcclure filed suit in federal district court in massachusetts on april,alleging that the enrollment restriction effectuated by massachusetts general laws chapter,sections and violated his first amendment speech and association rights as a voter and as a candidate for public office.he also asserted that it violated his equal protection clause rights because it constituted invidious discrimination against unenrolled voters.he finally alleged both that the statutory scheme itself gave unconstitutionally inadequate notice to mcclure and that the negligence of various town and state officials led to a similar lack of notice.mcclure sought declaratory relief,injunctive relief,and attorney fees.
given the time constraints involved,the district court granted mcclure motion for an expedited hearing on his motion for a preliminary injunction,and then denied the preliminary injunction and dismissed the claim under.b.mcclure,wl,at.the district court,relying on the supreme court decision in storer brown,d,held that mcclure could not state a claim on the merits.mcclure,wl,at.storer upheld a california law preventing candidates from having their names placed on the ballot in a general election as independents if they had registered with a political party at any time within one year prior to the date of the primary election that preceded that general election.storer,at.the district court held that the scheme at issue in storer was identical in its relevant respects to the one at issue here,thus foreclosing the bulk of mcclure claim.mcclure,wl,at.
the district court also held that mcclure attempt to distinguish storer failed the fact that the scheme at issue here only applied to presidential primaries and not to all primaries is a distinction without a meaningful difference because i t is impossible to see how a statute that places an even lesser burden on an independent voter who desires to seek public office could be more violative of a voter rights.id.at.as for the rest of mcclure claims arguing lack of fair notice,the court cited the principle that citizens are presumed to know the law and added that the ballot clerk negligence provided no basis for a viable estoppel claim.id.
mcclure appealed the denial of the preliminary injunction and the dismissal of the claim to this court.mcclure has not,however,raised on appeal his claims of lack of fair notice or misrepresentation by the ballot clerk those claims are waived.the only claim before this court is that the statutory scheme unduly burdens mcclure rights to vote and to run for office.
appellate review of a trial court denial of a preliminary injunction is deferential we will reverse such a denial only if the district court mistook the law,clearly erred in its factual assessments,or otherwise abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.mcguire reilly,cir.of course,a material error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion.review of the dismissal of a claim under rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is de novo.martin applied cellular,cir.in the end,both the dismissal of the claim and the denial of the preliminary injunction turn on pure issues of law.
the standard of review for a law that burdens ballot access and voting rights is not static rather,the supreme court has suggested something of a sliding scale approach and has noted that there is no bright line to separate unconstitutional state election laws from constitutional ones.timmons twin cities area new party,d.we must weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the s tate rule imposes on rights to vote and run for office against the interests the state contends justifies that burden,and consider the extent to which the s tate concerns make the burden necessary regulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs rights must be narrowly tailored and advance a compelling state interest.lesser burdens,however,trigger less exacting review,and a s tate important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions.id.at.quoting burdick takushi,d citations omitted.
mcclure is correct that the state interests here are weaker than the interests stated in storer.the burden imposed on mcclure rights here is also not severe.in the end,the state important regulatory interests,while more fragmented than those in storer,are sufficient to justify that burden.
mcclure argues that the scheme forces him to make a difficult choice between two crucial rights,voting and running for office,because the scheme does not allow him,within a period,both to run for state senate as an independent and to vote in a party presidential primary.but voting in a presidential primary has never been treated in the same way as voting in a general election,and indeed,voting in the primary of a party to which one does not belong is not a constitutional right.see cal.democratic party jones,d as for the associational interest in selecting the candidate of a group to which one does not belong,that falls far short of a constitutional right,if indeed it can even fairly be characterized as an interest.it has been described in our cases as a desire.it is instead an associational right of a political party to decide whether it wants to include nonmembers in its own primaries this is a decision that the state generally must respect in its regulation of primaries.see id.at.tashjian republican party of,d cool moose party rhode island,cir.
the massachusetts scheme,of course,does not operate to exclude existing democrats from voting in the presidential primary and then running for office as democrats it only prevents those who are unenrolled or enrolled in a different party from both voting in the democratic presidential primary and then running for office under their old party designation.the choice that mcclure points to is only a choice between running for political office which is surely an important political right and voting in another organization primary which is not a constitutional right at all.the state places no great burden on mcclure when it asks him to refrain from the latter in order to participate in the former.
the remaining burden imposed on mcclure by this statute is that it forces him to think ninety days ahead before the filing deadline if he plans on becoming an unenrolled candidate,because he needs to be careful that he does not vote in a disqualifying primary within this time period.but storer held that a potential candidate was not significantly burdened by a statute that forced him to think ahead one full year before becoming an independent candidate.at.
the significance of the burden on mcclure is further reduced by the fact that it falls evenly on all political groups.the supreme court has said that review of election regulations will be far sharper if there is discrimination against certain distinct political groups.see,anderson celebrezze,d.mcclure argues that the massachusetts scheme discriminates against unenrolled voters,but this is not so.the scheme applies evenhandedly to enrolled individuals of all parties as well as to unenrolled individuals.all candidates are banned from running for office using one enrollment status if they have held some other enrollment status for the ninety days before the primary filing deadlines.the rule thus equally burdens republicans,democrats,and independents.if anything,the laws give unenrolled voters more rights than other voters by permitting them to vote in any party primary at least if they are willing to change designations individuals enrolled in a party can not vote in a different party primary unless they changed their enrollment more than twenty days before the primary.laws ch.
mcclure also argues that the election laws discriminate against individuals running for as opposed to and federal offices,because the filing deadline for offices is one week earlier than the filing deadlines for other offices.thus the presidential primaries occurred within the period for offices but not for or federal offices.it is not rational to infer from this fact an intent on the part of a state to discriminate against potential officials as a group while favorin
