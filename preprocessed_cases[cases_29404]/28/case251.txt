i.the missouri laws at issue 
article viii,of the missouri constitution,as amended in,broadly grants the right to vote to a ll citizens of the united states over the age of eighteen who are residents of this state but then provides that no person who has a guardian by reason of mental incapacity,appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be entitled to vote.this prohibition has a long history the missouri constitution of barred from voting persons kept at poorhouses and other asylums at public expense.the constitution of provided that no idiot,no insane person and no person while kept in any poorhouse at public expense shall be entitled to vote.art.viii.the amendment tying the prohibition to guardianship was intended to give polling officials something tangible on which to decide whether a person was disqualified by reason of his mental condition.new corrough.
the missouri election laws implement article viii,by providing,no person who is adjudged incapacitated shall be entitled to register or vote.the parties in this case do not argue that disqualifies more adults from voting than the prohibition set forth in article viii.such a contention would conflict with missouri election laws must be liberally construed in aid of the right of suffrage,nance kearbey,that the right of citizens who possess the enumerated constitutional qualifications to vote may be regulated by statute although not lightly denied or abrogated,state ex rel.mcclellan kirkpatrick,and that voting rights are an area where our state constitution provides greater protection than its federal counterpart,weinschenk state of missouri,banc.thus,while no missouri appellate court has addressed the question,we are confident that the supreme court of missouri would construe the term adjudged incapacitated in as having the same meaning as the term has a guardian appointed by reason of mental incapacity in article viii.
the missouri probate code authorizes the appropriate probate court to appoint a qualified guardian for an adult if a hearing has established by clear and convincing evidence that the person for whom a guardian is sought is incapacitated as defined in this law.stat.an incapacitated person is defined as 
one who is unable by reason of any physical or mental condition to receive and evaluate information or to communicate decisions to such an extent that he lacks capacity to meet essential requirements for food,clothing,shelter,safety or other care such that serious physical injury,illness,or disease is likely to occur.
the probate code defines a partially incapacitated person as one who lacks capacity to meet,in part,these essential requirements.emphasis added.the distinction is significant.an adjudication of partial incapacity imposes only those legal disabilities specified in the order of adjudication,whereas an adjudication of full incapacity imposes all legal disabilities provided by law,except to the extent specified in the order of adjudication,in either case,the probate court must apply a least restrictive environment principle,imposing only such restraint as is necessary to prevent the ward from injuring himself and others and to provide him with such care,habilitation and treatment as are appropriate for him considering his physical and mental condition and financial means.see.if the court finds the person partially incapacitated,it shall appoint a limited guardian and shall impose only such legal disabilities and restraints on personal liberty as are necessary to promote and protect the of the individual.
ii.an eleventh amendment issue 
at the outset,defendants argue that the missouri secretary of state and attorney general have no real connection with the enforcement of missouri laws regarding the loss of voting rights by persons under guardianship and therefore this suit is barred by the eleventh amendment.like the district court,we disagree.
a state eleventh amendment immunity does not bar a suit against a state official to enjoin enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional statute,provided that such officer has some connection with the enforcement of the act.reprod.health servs.of planned parenthood of the louis region,nixon,cir quotation omitted.though broad authority to register voters and to administer voting and elections is delegated to local election authorities the county clerk or the local board of election secretary of state is the chief state election official responsible for overseeing of the voter registration process.see.moreover,obligates the secretary of state to send local election authorities the names of persons who are adjudged incapacitated.as we will explain,bob scaletty was prevented from voting in the election by an error that may well have stemmed from his inclusion on a list of persons under guardianship that did not note the preservation of his right to vote.finally,missouri statutes appoint the secretary of state as the chief state election official to administer the federal help america vote act of and the national voter registration act of.see.
the attorney general has statutory authority to represent the state in both criminal and civil cases.see.persons who knowingly attempt to vote when they are presumably would include persons under guardianship due to mental be prosecuted for committing a class one election offense.see.
the summary judgment record reflects considerable uncertainty,inconsistency,and apparent confusion among local guardians and election officials concerning the proper interpretation of the missouri laws at issue.in these circumstances,we conclude that the secretary of state and the attorney general were potentially proper parties defendant for the injunctive relief sought had plaintiffs prevailed on the merits.
accordingly,the ex parte young exception to eleventh amendment immunity applies.see reprod.health,at.
iii.equal protection claims 
in the last fifty years,the supreme court has considered many cases involving various aspects of the right to vote.s ince the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights,any alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.kramer union free school dist,d.the court concern with these difficult issues is understandable,though the resulting array of opinions deciding disparate voting issues can be difficult to apply in a new context.
this case concerns a state eligibility requirement for voting.historically,deciding who is qualified to vote has been a relatively unfettered prerogative of the sovereign states.see rodriguez popular democratic party,d the right to vote,per se,is not a constitutionally protected right.the states have long been held to have broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised absent of course the discrimination which the constitution condemns.lassiter northampton county bd.of elections,d upholding a literacy test because literacy has some relation to standards designed to promote intelligent use of the ballot.
