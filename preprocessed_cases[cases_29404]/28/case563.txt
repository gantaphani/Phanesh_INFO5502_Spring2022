the hotly contested compton municipal election resulted in two election contests challenging the results of the runoff election in the mayoral and city council races.the trial court granted both election contests,removing the winners from office and replacing them with their opponents.finding the runoff ballot had listed the candidates names in both races in the wrong alphabetical order,the trial court concluded that switching the would have changed the outcome of both races due to the advantage the placement affords over placements.the trial court also granted the contest against the city council winner on the ground that she had committed offenses against the electorate.
with regard to the mayoral election,we reverse the judgment and reinstate the winning candidate as mayor.in the city council race,we affirm the portion of the judgment annulling the winning candidate election for having committed offenses against the elective franchise.we reverse the portion of the judgment for the challenger based on error.
background 
the court held a consolidated trial of election contests brought by respondent omar bradley against appellant eric perrodin for the compton mayor office and by respondent melanie andrews against appellant leslie irving for a compton city council position.for the sake of convenience,we will discuss the contests separately although they involved overlapping issues and evidence.
a.the compton mayoral election perrodin appeal 
nine candidates,including perrodin and bradley,vied for mayor in compton primary election of april.compton city clerk charles davis,the local elections official,listed the nine mayoral candidates on the primary ballot according to a randomized alphabet obtained from the secretary of state.see.pursuant to that randomized alphabet,perrodin name was listed above bradley on the primary ballot.there is no allegation that davis erred in preparing the primary ballot.
the primary election failed to yield a majority of votes for any single candidate.bradley,the incumbent mayor,finished first with votes perrodin,a deputy district attorney and former police officer,came in second with votes.
davis prepared a ballot for the june,runoff election between bradley and perrodin,using the same randomized alphabet as in the primary election.accordingly,the runoff ballot listed perrodin name above bradley.
on june,perrodin won the mayoral runoff election with votes to bradley votes.
after the june runoff election,bradley filed an election contest against perrodin,with the following allegations perrodin and others prepared fraudulent or counterfeit ballots for the runoff election davis erred in failing to use the appropriate randomized alphabet for the june election that would have placed bradley name before perrodin on the runoff ballot perrodin committed offenses against the elective franchise,subd.c,et precinct board members committed malconduct,subd.a and illegal votes were cast,subd.d.
a lengthy court trial was held with witnesses testifying over the course of several months.of bradley numerous allegations,the trial court upheld only one,finding that davis failure to place bradley name above perrodin on the runoff ballot constituted grounds to void perrodin election and declare bradley the new mayor.the trial court reasoned as follows the elections code required davis to request a new randomized alphabet from the secretary of state for the june runoff election had davis made such a request,the secretary of state would have provided the same randomized alphabet that had been drawn on march,for the kern county special election the randomized draw for the kern county election would have required davis to place bradley name above perrodin on the runoff ballot and due to the advantage that a top ballot position affords a candidate over candidates the primacy effect,perrodin received at least votes that would have gone to bradley had bradley name been listed first based on the primacy effect theory,the trial court shifted votes from perrodin to bradley and declared bradley the victor.the court rejected perrodin contention that bradley sole remedy to correct any error on the ballot was to file a writ petition.
the trial court rejected bradley remaining grounds for contesting the election.the court found no evidence of counterfeit or fraudulent ballots insufficient evidence that perrodin committed offenses against the franchise the precinct board did not commit malconduct and any procedural errors and irregularities were not the board fault and did not affect the outcome of the election illegal votes were cast,but it was impossible to determine except for nine illegal votes that had been cast for the perrodin slate for whom the illegal votes were cast and while davis was careless in failing to follow proper election procedures,he did not willfully neglect or refuse to perform his duties.
based solely on the primacy effect resulting from the order in which the two candidates names were placed on the ballot,the trial court annulled perrodin certificate of election and ordered that a new certificate of election be issued to bradley.the court entered judgment against perrodin and declared bradley to be mayor.
bradley was sworn in as mayor on february.thereafter,perrodin appealed from the judgment and petitioned for a writ of supersedeas and immediate stay.we issued the writ and stay after requesting opposition and hearing oral argument.bradley perrodin.on february,the california supreme court denied bradley application for stay and petition for review.bradley perrodin.the judgment in favor of bradley having been stayed pending resolution of perrodin appeal,perrodin has been serving as mayor while this appeal was pending.
b.the compton city council election irving appeal 
appellant irving and respondent andrews were the top candidates in one of two city council races in the april primary election.the other council race,won by yvonne arceneaux in a runoff election against frank wheaton,is not at issue in this appeal.in the june,runoff election,irving defeated andrews by a vote of to.
andrews then filed the present election contest against irving,contending that davis had erred by placing irving name above andrews on the runoff ballot.andrews position differed from bradley on this point in one significant respect.unlike bradley,andrews contended that under either randomized alphabet at issue in this one drawn for the primary election or the one drawn for the kern county name should have been first on the runoff ballot.in other words,under both randomized draws,a was to come before i,so andrews should have been listed before irving no matter which draw was to be used.
davis conceded below that andrews name should have been listed first under either of the two randomized alphabets at issue in this case.davis stated,and the trial court agreed,that irving name was mistakenly placed before andrews due to davis unintentional error.the finding that davis error was unintentional is not disputed in this appeal.
andrews also contended below that irving had committed offenses against the elective franchise by soliciting either personally or through her agents nine to register to vote,and by illegally influencing or instructing the nine to vote for irving.
the trial court,after rejecting irving argument that the ballot error should have been addressed in a writ proceeding,found the error sufficient to overturn irving election.the court shifted votes from irving to andrews based,as in the mayoral election contest,on the primacy effect theory and declared andrews the winner.
in addition,the trial court found irving had committed offenses against the elective franchise,either personally or through her agents,by knowingly soliciting nine to register for absentee ballots in violation of section,subdivision a being present in the nine absentee voters homes while they were voting and telling them how to vote,in violation of section,subdivision a fraudulently registering the nine and assisting them to vote or completing their absentee ballots for them,in violation of section and soliciting illegal votes from the nine nonqualified voters,in violation of section.the trial court also declared irving,having committed offenses against the electorate while holding public office,was barred under the disqualification provisions of section,from ever holding office in california 
irving appealed from the adverse judgment and petitioned for a writ of supersedeas.we denied the petition on march.wheaton et arceneaux et.accordingly,andrews has been serving on the city council while this appeal was pending.
discussion 
ithe election 
section requires the secretary of state to conduct randomized alphabet draws for five major election dates,including the first tuesday after the first monday in june of years,subd.b d.bradley contends that because the compton june,election fell on the first tuesday after the first monday in june of an year,davis erred in failing to request the randomized alphabet drawn for that date by the secretary of state under section,subdivision b d 
perrodin contends a runoff election in a charter city like compton is not a separate election for which a new randomized alphabet is required under the elections code.under sections,subdivision b and,a charter city may request a new randomized alphabet when the last possible day to file nomination papers for the local election would occur after the date of the drawing for one of the five major election dates,subd.b.perrodin claims that because the june election was a runoff election,for which there was no last possible date for filing,subd.a,the same randomized alphabet was properly used in both primary and runoff elections.perrodin further relies upon a letter,in which the secretary of state informed the city of compton that the same randomized alphabet was to be used for its primary and general elections see andal miller th,fn,d the contemporaneous construction of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement is entitled to great weight.
perrodin also notes that like compton,the cities of los angeles,long beach,burbank,inglewood,redondo beach,and pasadena all use the same randomized alphabet in both primary and general elections.in addition,perrodin points out that section,subdivision d requires use of the same randomized alphabet in both primary and special elections for state assembly,state senate,and congressional representative.
we granted perrodin request to take judicial notice of a march,letter from the secretary of state elections counsel stephen trout,advising the city of long beach to use the same randomized alphabet for both the long beach april primary election and the long beach june general election.trout letter explained that the same draw could be used on both ballots because no candidates other than those qualified to appear on the ballot in the primary nominating election will be qualified for the general municipal election.
a runoff election,as perrodin correctly points out,is merely the second round of voting in a single election.edelstein city and county of san francisco cal th,d.if one of the candidates receives a majority of the votes cast in the primary election,there is no need for a runoff election.where no majority is achieved in the primary election,only those candidates who qualify in the primary election may participate in the runoff election.there is no new filing period for a runoff election.
we agree with perrodin that nothing in sections and required the compton clerk to request a new randomized alphabet for the june runoff election,which was simply a continuation of the april primary election.under section,subdivision b d,a random drawing for a june election must be conducted days earlier,on march.on this record,however,it was uncertain on march whether a june runoff election would even be necessary and,if so,between which candidates.we see nothing in section or that would require the clerk to ask the secretary of state to conduct a march drawing for a june runoff election that may or may not occur depending on the outcome of an april primary election.
as we understand the statutory scheme,a new randomized alphabet is not required for a runoff election with no new filing period or new candidates.as there was no new filing period for compton june runoff election,and only the top two contestants in the primary election were eligible to participate in the mayoral runoff election,we find the clerk had no statutory obligation to request a new randomized alphabet for the june election.the statutory requirements for requesting randomized alphabets simply do not fit the circumstances of this case.section,subdivision b states that when a charter city schedules an election on one of the five major election dates,and the last possible day to file nomination papers for the local election would occur after the date of the drawing for the major election date,the procedure set forth in section shall apply.under section,the charter city must notify the secretary of state of the local election date and the last possible date to file for that election.section requires the secretary of state to then conduct a randomized drawing on the first weekday following the last possible date of filing.as it was impossible to file nomination papers for the compton june runoff election,we find the procedures of sections and inapplicable to the june runoff election.
given our determination that the statutory scheme does not prohibit use of the same randomized alphabet for both the primary and runoff rounds of voting in a single election,we conclude perrodin name was properly listed before bradley on the runoff ballot.as no factual basis error exists to support bradley equal protection violation claim or the trial court shifting of votes from perrodin to bradley under the primacy effect theory,those issues need not be addressed in relation to bradley appeal.we note,however,that as discussed below in part iii regarding the judgment for andrews,even if bradley and perrodin names were erroneously reversed on the runoff ballot,the primacy effect theory would not justify shifting votes from perrodin to bradley.
we conclude the trial court erred in entering judgment against perrodin and for bradley,and reverse that portion of the judgment.
perrodin has requested costs and attorney fees on appeal.although perrodin is entitled to costs,we deny his request for private attorney general fees on appeal.code civ.perrodin contends his successful appeal has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest and has conferred a significant benefit on the public,namely the fundamental right of for the citizens of compton.that same fundamental right,however,exists in each and every election contest.to recover private attorney general fees,t he claimant objective in the litigation must go beyond transcend those things that concretely,specifically and significantly affect the litigant,to affect the broader world or general public as the statute puts it.hammond agran th,d.attorney fees connected to a candidate quest for elective office,on the other hand,do not transcend the candidate palpable personal stake in the election.id.at,d.accordingly,we deny perrodin request for attorney fees.
the election 
section,subdivision c provides that an election contest may be brought on the ground t hat the defendant has committed any other offense against the elective franchise defined in division commencing with section.in this case,the trial court found that irving had committed offenses against the elective franchise in violation of four sections in division by knowingly soliciting nine to register to vote by absentee ballot in violation of section,subdivision a being present in the nine absentee voters homes while they were voting and telling them how to vote in violation of section,subdivision a fraudulently registering the nine and assisting them to vote or voting for them in violation of section and soliciting illegal votes from the nine nonqualified voters in violation of section.
irving contends on appeal that there is no consistent evidence that irving participated personally in any of the alleged fraudulent acts.some caps.omitted.irving claims that at most,there were nine witnesses who could connect irving to a handful of the acts the trial court considered fraudulent.irving points out that the nine witnesses were spanish speaking and their alleged conversations with her took place through an interpreter irving sister.irving maintains there is no evidence that irving speaks or understands spanish,or knew the witnesses were not citizens.irving also points to the relatively weak eyewitness identification of irving by some of the nine witnesses.according to irving,a review of the nine witnesses testimony reveals that only five could make any identification of irving,and this only relating to the initial visit seeking registration.and even among those five,the identifications differ in more than minor detail.
the trial court weighed all of the evidence,however,and concluded,based upon substantial and credible testimony,that irving had committed offenses against the elective franchise.except where additional evidence is required by statute,the direct evidence of one witness who is entitled to full credit is sufficient for proof of any fact,see witkin,cal.evidence ed.presentation at trial.although an appellate court will not uphold a judgment or verdict based upon evidence inherently improbable,testimony which merely discloses unusual circumstances does not come within that category.citation.to warrant the rejection of the statements given by a witness who has been believed by a trial court,there must exist either a physical impossibility that they are true,or their falsity must be apparent without resorting to inferences or deductions.citations.conflicts and even testimony which is subject to justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment,for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends.citation.citations.people thornton cal d,disapproved on other grounds in people flannel cal d,fn,people martinez cal th,d.
in this case,the testimony of elvita andrade,which was similar in many respects to that of the other eight witnesses,is sufficient to uphold the trial court finding that irving had committed offenses against the franchise.andrade testified that although she had spoken with irving through a translator,she had also spoken directly with irving in english.andrade stated she had told irving,in english,that she is not a united states citizen.andrade explained that irving response was that citizenship had nothing to do with it.that it had nothing to do with the government,so that it would not a ffect my citizenship.that it was just for the school.because this was to help the kids.andrade said she had been told to sign an absentee ballot application,which she did,and that either irving or the translator would pick up the absentee ballot from her when it arrived.andrade stated that when the translator came to pick up andrade absentee ballot,she andrade had signed the ballot and given it to the translator without marking or punching it.someone other than andrade,presumably someone connected with irving campaign,marked and submitted andrade absentee ballot,which was counted in the election.
when an otherwise successful candidate such as irving is subsequently found to have committed an offense or offenses against the elective franchise,her election may be annulled even if the number of unqualified voters she fraudulently registered or the number of votes she unlawfully solicited were too few to have changed the outcome of the election.as the california supreme court explained each offense against the elective franchise defined in division now of the elections code can furnish independent statutory grounds for contesting and annulling the election,separate and apart from the effects of any illegal votes actually counted.former,subd.c,now,subd.c see stebbins white d.gooch hendrix cal th,fn,d.
irving contends her election may only be annulled under section,subdivision c for having committed offenses against the electorate if she was found to have committed bribery for the purpose of winning the election,there is substantial evidence her unlawful conduct changed the results of the election,or there is substantial evidence that fraud permeated the election.we find no merit in any of these contentions.
regarding her claim that bribery is a prerequisite for annulling her election,irving cites salazar city of montebello d.salazar,which predates gooch hendrix,supra,cal th,d,held that a specific finding of bribery is required to annul the election of a candidate whose offenses against the electorate did not change the election result.salazar city of montebello,supra,d at.
salazar relied upon canales city of alviso cal d,a ballot measure election contest in which the measure proponents had committed offenses against the electorate.canales held that the result of a ballot measure election should not be annulled for the misdeeds of the measure proponents,unless the misdeeds affected the outcome.in a footnote,the court in canales left undecided whether a showing that a candidate is responsible for the misdeeds is sufficient to disqualify him absent a showing that the result was affected.perhaps the absence of a statutory requirement of a showing that bribery affected the result is explained by the fact that a candidate who is convicted of bribery is thereby rendered ineligible for office.cal,art.xx.we need not now decide whether a showing by a preponderance of evidence that a candidate is responsible for misdeeds specified in section now section,subdivision c,is sufficient to invalidate an election absent both a conviction and a demonstration that the misdeeds determined the result of the election.citation.canales city of alviso,supra,cal d at,fn,italics in original.stebbins white,supra,d,fn.omitted.
nothing in canales,which dealt with a ballot measure,required salazar to hold that a candidate offense which failed to change the election result will result in annulment only if the offense was bribery.the most that can be said about canales on this point is that the supreme court did not decide whether a candidate election may be annulled for an offense that failed to change the election result.that question was again mentioned by the supreme court in gooch hendrix,supra,cal th at page,footnote,d,when it cited stebbins white,supra,d at pages,with approval.
stebbins found it permissible under section,subdivision c to annul the election of a candidate whose offenses against the electorate did not change the election result.stebbins white,supra,d at.stebbins explained the grounds for contesting an election are set out in elections code section now section and the court is explicitly authorized to pronounce judgment in a contested election proceeding either confirming or annulling and setting aside the election,now.thus the question is not whether the court is authorized to annul an election on one of the statutory grounds of contest but is rather whether there is some other statutory restriction decreeing that an election can not be annulled unless the criminally obtained votes would change the election result.since there is no such statutory restriction,we conclude that a violation of elections code section,subdivision c now section by the person whose election is contested constitutes grounds for annulling his election.ibid.
in gooch hendrix,supra,cal th at page,footnote,d,the supreme court implicitly disagreed with salazar bribery requirement language by citing stebbins with approval and stating each constitutes an offense against the elective franchise defined in division of the elections code,violations of which themselves can furnish independent statutory grounds for contesting and annulling the election,separate and apart from the effects of any illegal votes actually counted,subd.c see stebbins white d.
notwithstanding the language from gooch,irving argues that gooch requires a finding that fraud permeated the election before her election may be annulled.gooch,however,involved an election contest primarily brought against school board candidates under former section now section,on the basis of illegal votes.gooch,supra,cal th at,fn,d.the illegal votes in gooch were cast by absentee voters whose ballot applications had been solicited by members of a voter education project called the black american political association of california bapac.when the absentee ballots arrived,the voters were encouraged to vote in the presence of the bapac solicitor,who would offer advice on the candidates or issues.although it was impossible to determine for which candidates the illegal votes were cast,the supreme court found sufficient uncontroverted circumstantial evidence that the illegal votes had affected the outcome of the election to justify annulling all of the election results.id.at,d.the supreme court explained we do not believe the legislature intended that under circumstances such as these,where clear and convincing evidence established pervasive illegalities that permeated the election process,and where,although it can not be determined on a basis for whom the illegal votes were cast,it nonetheless appears the illegal votes affected the outcome of the election,a trial court is without authority to annul and set aside the election results within its discretion under section now section.id.at,d.
gooch,contrary to irving position,did not hold that a candidate offenses against the electorate will result in annulment only if the offenses changed the outcome or fraud so permeated the election process that it appears the illegal votes affected the outcome of the election.although there was evidence in gooch that some of the candidates had committed offenses against the electorate two school board candidates were among the bapac solicitors who engaged in the unlawful solicitation of votes gooch,supra,cal th at,d,at least of the were members of bapac of the had been given bapac absentee ballots for delivery to the voters id.at,d,the supreme court declined to review the finding that some candidates offenses against the elective franchise furnished a separate and independent basis for annulling the election results.see ante,at,and fn,d.id.at,fn,d.instead,the supreme court annulled the entire election as to all candidates,including those who were innocent of having committed misdeeds,based on circumstantial evidence that the illegal votes had changed the election results.in short,gooch is not inconsistent with our determination that irving misdeeds,even though they did not change the election results,properly resulted in the annulment of her election.
we conclude,under subdivision c of section,irving election was properly annulled based on the finding,which was supported by substantial evidence,that she had committed offenses against the franchise.the trial court properly annulled irving election under section,subdivision c despite the lack of evidence that irving offenses changed the outcome of the election.gooch hendrix,supra,cal th at,fn,d,stebbins white,supra,d at.we affirm the portion of the judgment annulling irving election under section,subdivision c.
the judgment for andrews 
although we agree irving election was properly annulled,we disagree that judgment was properly entered for andrews,who was judicially declared elected despite her failure to win the highest number of legal votes in the june runoff election.under section,having found irving,the winning candidate,disqualified for having committed misdeeds that failed to change the result of the election,the trial court should have entered judgment annulling and setting aside the election,italics added.the elections code does not permit the trial court to annul the election of the winning candidate,based on offenses that did not change the result of the election,and then declare another candidate elected by shifting legal votes between the two candidates under the primacy effect theory.having annulled the winning candidate election for misdeeds that did not change the election results,the court should have annulled and set aside the runoff election under section.
andrews contends the judgment declaring her elected may not be reviewed on irving appeal because irving,whose election was properly annulled by the trial court,has no justiciable interest as a candidate to protect as a basis for challenging the remainder of the court order relating to the seat for which she ran.emphasis omitted.citing pierce harrold d.andrews contends that once irving election was annulled,irving lost standing to challenge the portion of the judgment awarding the seat to andrews,contrary to the election results,under the primacy effect theory.
the question of who,if anyone,was duly elected to the city council seat in the runoff election is central to andrews election contest against irving.as the candidate with the highest number of legal votes in the runoff election,irving interest was injured by the shifting of legal votes from irving to andrews.in that regard,irving is an aggrieved party entitled to be heard on appeal on the primacy effect issue.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.in another regard,however,irving personal interest in the primacy effect issue was mooted by her disqualification from office under section,subdivision c.
given that this election contest involves questions broader than irving personal interest as a candidate for the contested office,we conclude the electorate interest in this important legal issue requires that the primacy effect issue be addressed election contests are not typical adversary proceedings between individuals asserting personal rights or interests,but involve the right of the people to have the fact as to who has been duly elected by them judicially determined.an election contest involves a question of broader import than the mere individual claim of a person to enjoy the honors and emoluments of a particular office brought directly into contest.the inquiry must be as to whether in a given instance the popular will has been,or is about to be,thwarted by mistake or fraud.the public interest imperatively requires that the ultimate determination of the contest shall reach the right result.cal.jur d elections,fns.omitted.
turning to the merits of irving contentions,we find that by shifting votes from irving to andrews based solely on the primacy effect theory,the trial court exceeded its authority.under sections,and,only illegal votes may be discarded in an election contest if the court finds,after discarding the illegal votes given for the winning candidate,that another candidate has the highest number of legal votes,the court shall declare that person elected.otherwise,if discarding the illegal votes given for the winning candidate would not change the result of the election,and the winning candidate is disqualified from taking office due to having committed offenses against the elective franchise,the court shall enter judgment annulling and setting aside the election.
in this case,the trial court found a total of illegal votes had been cast in the runoff election,but found it impossible to determine in whose favor other than the nine illegal votes for irving the illegal votes had been cast.even if we were to assume that all illegal votes had been cast for irving,subtracting illegal votes from irving total would still have left her the victor with legal votes to andrews legal votes.therefore,the illegal votes cast for irving did not change the result of the election,and there was no other candidate with more legal votes than irving.given irving disqualification from taking office due to her offenses against the elective franchise,the trial court should have entered a judgment annulling and setting aside the election,italics added.
instead,in a ruling unprecedented,to our knowledge,in this country,the trial court shifted legal votes from irving to andrews based solely on the primacy effect assumed to be enjoyed,on average,by those listed first on the ballot.while many courts and legislatures have recognized the advantage afforded to candidates whose names are listed first on the ballot,no judicial or statutory authority exists to reverse the results of an election where,due to unintentional clerical error,the ballot listed the candidates in the wrong alphabetical order.
election results may only be challenged on one of the grounds specified in section.friends of sierra madre city of sierra madre cal th,d.error occurring in the absence of fraud and resulting purely from unintentional clerical error,as in this case,is not a valid ground for an election contest under section.the fact that legal votes may have been cast for irving solely because her name was erroneously listed first on the ballot does not,in itself,impeach the integrity of those votes.legal votes randomly cast by the least informed or least interested voters are entitled to the same weight as legal votes cast by the most highly educated and informed voters in our society.the legality or illegality of a vote cast by a qualified voter in a lawful manner does not depend upon the voter motive or purpose in voting a certain way.see bush head cal.to shift legal votes to correct the votes randomly cast for irving solely as a result of her erroneous advantageous ballot position and to award those same random votes to andrews based solely on the primacy effect theory would be,without any lawful justification,to disenfranchise those voters.see shinn heusner d,to invalidate lawfully cast absentee votes would be,without warrant,to disfranchise these voters.dennen jastro,clerk inadvertent error in listing the same candidate twice,as the nominee of two different political parties,should not disenfranchise the entire vote of the district and vitiate the election,unless it be made to appear that by reason of the irregularity the result was different from what it would otherwise have been,or that it prevented the voter from freely,fairly,and honestly expressing his choice of the candidate for the office.nelson robinson so d a candidate unfavorable ballot position which allowed voters to exercise free choice after a reasonable study of the ballot,does not constitute a violation of equal protection.roberts byrd,clerk failure to rotate names every ballots did not void the election.bees gilronan ohio in the absence of fraud,election officials failure to properly rotate candidates names on the voting machine ballots did not invalidate the election.
we conclude the trial court erred in entering judgment for andrews and declaring her elected when she had failed to win the highest number of legal votes in the june,election.accordingly,we reverse the judgment in favor of andrews.
the vacant council seat 
under government code section,an office becomes vacant when,among other circumstances,the officer is removed from office,subd.d,or a court declares the officer election or appointment to be void id.at subd.j.in this case,andrews has been serving as city council member based on the trial court erroneous judgment declaring her elected under the primacy effect theory.but having failed to win the highest number of legal votes,andrews should not have been declared elected under section.see d,supra,at,the decision of a competent tribunal declaring an election void results in the office becoming vacant.thus,where the court annuls the defendant election because he or she committed an offense against the elective franchise,or because he or she is ineligible,it is not authorized to declare anyone else elected.the defendant disqualification does not render the votes for the defendant illegal and require that his or her votes be disregarded and that the election be given to the candidate with the next highest number of votes.in such a case the office is vacant and must be filled in the manner provided by law.
accordingly,once this court opinion reversing the judgment for andrews becomes final,andrews election will be annulled and her seat will be vacant.
irving lifetime disqualification 
section states that a ny public official who knowingly violates any of the provisions of this chapter,and thereby aids in any way the illegal casting or attempting to cast a vote,or who connives to nullify any of the provisions of this chapter in order that fraud may be perpetrated,shall forever be disqualified from holding office in this state and upon conviction shall be sentenced to a state prison for months or two or three years.in this case,the record contains no evidence that irving was convicted under section or any other provision of chapter corruption of the voting process of division penal provisions of the elections code.irving contends that in the absence of a criminal conviction under chapter of division of the elections code,the trial court erred in declaring her to be forever disqualified under section from holding public office.
having determined in part ii of this opinion that irving city council election was properly annulled under section,subdivision c due to her commission of offenses against the elective franchise,we conclude irving is disqualified from seeking or filling the council seat she had sought in the election,for the remainder of that term.in other words,irving is ineligible to fill andrews vacant city council position.pierce harrold,supra,d at.
irving right to run for other terms of public office in future elections,however,is a separate issue.irving contends the lifetime ban of section does not apply in the absence of a criminal conviction of a chapter offense.andrews,on the other hand,points out that section on its face fails to link imposition of the lifetime ban with a conviction under chapter,whereas it specifically links imposition of a state prison sentence with such a conviction.andrews argues that because disqualification from public office is a civil,not criminal,penalty,section imposes both civil and criminal penalties.under the civil aspect of the statute,according to andrews,the trial court properly imposed a lifetime ban against irving upon finding,in the civil context of the elections contest,that she was a public official who had committed offenses against the franchise and,thus,had violated section.
while disqualification from public office is a civil disability lubin wilson d,it is also true that disqualification is a civil penalty or consequence which flows from the judgment of a felony conviction.citation.ibid.violation of section is a felony punishable by a state prison term of months or two or three years.see,subd.a crimes punishable by death or imprisonment in state prison are felonies.section is found in chapter,entitled corruption of the voting process,of division,entitled penal provisions,along with other criminal statutes.section is not located in division,entitled elections contests,where section is found.proving that a candidate election should be annulled in a civil action due to her commission of an offense against the elective franchise,subd.c is not the same as proving the candidate is a public official who has committed a felony under section.
we reject andrews invitation to parse the language of section in a manner that wholly ignores the section placement with penal,not civil,statutes in division of the elections code.we conclude the only reasonable and practical construction of section is to determine its lifetime disqualification penalty flows solely from a felony conviction under that statute.
pierce harrold,supra,d.supports our view.harrold contended on appeal that her election could only be annulled under former section presently section,subdivision c,following a criminal conviction of an offense against the electorate.the appellate court rejected this contention,reasoning in part that because election contests must be filed within a relatively short time period,to make conviction of an offense a condition precedent even to initiating an election contest would represent an absurd contradiction in legislative policy.as contestants observe,it does not require extended discussion of the realities relating to the time needed to prosecute even the least complex criminal case to compel the conclusion that the conviction requirement would render contests under section c virtually impossible to accomplish within the applicable statute of limitations.pierce harrold,supra,d at.
the pierce court held that although harrold disqualification might not extend to the next election in,it extended to the upcoming november general election,which was a continuati
