on january,president clinton appointed appellee victoria wilson to the united states commission on civil rights under a commission expressly stating that the appointment was for the remainder of the term expiring november,left vacant by the death in office of a prior member.after november,president bush,treating wilson commission as having expired on that date,appointed appellant peter kirsanow to succeed her.at the next meeting of the commission,that body recognized wilson as a continuing member on her assertion that she was entitled to a full term on the commission running from january,to january.the united states and kirsanow filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment that wilson term had expired and that kirsanow is now a member of the commission.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of wilson.the united states and kirsanow appealed.because we agree with appellants that wilson term had expired,we reverse the district court and remand with instructions for it to enter summary judgment for the appellants.
background 
the united states commission on civil rights the commission is charged with investigating allegations of deprivation of voting rights on the basis of color,race,religion,sex,age,disability,or national origin.a.in addition the commission is empowered to conduct studies and disseminate information relating to discrimination.id.a.the commission functions are purely investigatory and has neither the power to enforce federal law,nor to promulgate any rules with the force of law.see hannah larche,d united states mead,d.
the commission was first created in,and as originally established was composed of six members serving terms at the pleasure of the president.see.b,stat.congress reauthorized and reorganized the commission in by expanding it from six to eight members,providing that not more than four of the members could at any one time be from the same party,dividing the appointment power between the president and congress,establishing that the president could only remove members for neglect of duty or malfeasance,and staggering the terms of the commissioners.specifically,the act stated that the term of office of each member of the commission shall be six years except that a members first taking office shall serve as designated by the president,subject to provisions staggering the initial appointments,and b any member appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the term for which his predecessor was appointed.b,stat.the act.the staggering provisions created two groups of four commissioners each.the first group would serve for three years,at which point their successors would be appointed to terms.the second group would serve for six years from the outset.see id.b.under this structure,the terms of office would be regularly staggered with half of them expiring every three years.the act provided for the commission to expire in.nonetheless the commission continued to operate via the process of annual appropriations until reauthorized.in the commission was formally reauthorized,stat.the act.this act has been dubbed an effort to more concisely rewrite the act,at,reprinted in.like the act,the act provides that t he term of office of each member of the commission shall be years.c.however,instead of the initial staggering provisions that followed in the act,the act merely provided the term of each member of the commission in the initial membership of the commission shall expire on the date such term would have expired as of september.c.the act did not contain any language referring to filling vacancies.the act did preserve the division of appointment power between the president and congress,as well as the requirements for partisan balance,and the limitations on presidential removal of members.see b,e.the act provided for the commission to terminate on september,however,it has again continued to operate pursuant to annual appropriations.
on november,clinton appointed retired judge leon higginbotham to a term as a member of the commission.his commission stated that his appointment was for a term expiring november.he replaced arthur fletcher,whose term expired on november.on december,judge higginbotham died in office.to fill this vacancy,president clinton appointed appellee,victoria wilson,to the commission on january.her commission expressly states that her appointment was for the remainder of the term expiring november.treating wilson term as having expired on november,president bush appointed appellant peter kirsanow on december,to succeed wilson on the commission.kirsanow was administered the oath of office by superior court judge maurice ross however,the chair of the commission,mary frances berry,refused to recognize him or allow him to participate in commission activities.the chair instead continued to recognize wilson as a member of the commission and allowed her to participate as such.
the united states and kirsanow collectively appellants filed this action in the united states district court for the district of columbia seeking declaratory relief against wilson.the commission,mary frances berry chair,and cruz reynoso,moved to intervene.the united states objected that neither the commission nor its officers in their official capacity have the right to appear in litigation without the permission of the attorney general,which they had not obtained.see except as otherwise authorized by law,the conduct of litigation in which the united states,an agency,or officer thereof is a party is reserved to officers of the department of justice,under the direction of the attorney general.the district court summarily permitted the intervention.as the united states has not raised this issue on appeal,claiming it has no practical effect upon the issues presented,since wilson herself is entitled to defend against the government complaint,we do not decide whether this intervention was permissible.the parties filed dispositive motions and on february,the district court issued an oral ruling granting wilson motion for summary judgment.
the district court concluded that the amendments act does not mandate regularly staggered terms.rather,its plain language clearly requires that all commissioners serve terms,regardless of whether,as in this case,their predecessors completed their terms.thus,under the district court reading of the statute,wilson would be entitled to serve a full six years,until january.the district court first found that the language of c is perfectly clear.it contains no exceptions,qualifications,not for delayed appointments and not for appointments to fill unexpired terms.second,the court noted that a staggering provision had been proposed,but not adopted by congress in the act.third,the district court relied on the removal of the staggering and vacancy provisions from the act,holding that when congress affirmatively deletes language which had been included in legislation,then congress means what it said.
finally,the court rejected appellants argument that failure to maintain staggering would undermine the bipartisan nature of the commission as well as its integrity and credibility.the court found nothing to suggest that the absence of such a requirement would frustrate congress purpose.although acknowledging that its ruling would eliminate uniformly staggered terms,the court opined that its decision would not result in the complete elimination of all staggering.even so,the court reasoned that the staggered term requirement was only one amongst a large constellation of protections that were introduced by the act and a ll of these protections,except staggered terms,remain expressly included in the act.the district court concluded that i f congress believes that the regularly staggered terms should be among these protections,then,of course,it is free to make its intention explicit by including express language in the statute.
the united states and kirsanow filed this appeal.
ii.analysis 
this case involves a pure legal question of statutory interpretation.our review of statutory interpretation by a district court is de novo.see,butler west.
we begin our analysis with the language of the statute.see,barnhart sigmon coal,d.our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.robinson shell oil,d quoting united states ron pair enterprises,d.in determining the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language we refer to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.id.at.at citing estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d mccarthy bronson,d.
the disputed provision,c provides the term of office of each member of the commission shall be years.the term of each member of the commission in the initial membership of the commission shall expire on the date such term would have expired as of september.appellants contend,contrary to the district court holding,that the language of the first sentence of c is ambiguous,as the expression term of office is subject to at least two plausible interpretations.appellants concede that one very plausible interpretation of c is that advocated by wilson and adopted by the district court each individual member of the commission,however appointed,whenever appointed,is entitled to serve a period of,the term runs with the person.under this interpretation,each member of the commission would receive a term running from the date of her appointment.however,appellants argue that another plausible reading of c is that the first sentence establishes terms of office,beginning and ending on fixed dates,irrespective of whether and when individuals are appointed to fill them.under this reading,each member of the commission must be assigned to a fixed,slot of,the term runs with the calendar.we agree with appellants that the ambiguity in the first sentence of c permits either of the readings suggested.
as attorney general brewster explained more than a century ago,t here are two kinds of official terms.commissioners of the district of columbia,op.att y.one kind of term refers to a period of personal service.in that case,the term is appurtenant to the person.id.another kind of term refers to a fixed slot of time to which individual appointees are assigned.there,the person is appurtenant to the term.id.at.in other words,a term of office can either run with the person or with the calendar.as an example of the latter,article ii of the constitution provides that the president shall hold office during a term of four years.const.art.ii,cl.even before enactment of the twentieth amendment,which established specific dates for the end of the president term,it was understood that presidential terms ran four years with the calendar,not four years with the person,regardless of whether an individual assumed office after his predecessor failed to serve out a full term.thus,contrary to appellees position,it is not clear that the expression term of office shall be years found in c is unambiguous.indeed,far from it.the very appointment of wilson by president clinton to serve only the remainder of judge higginbotham term demonstrates the ambiguity in the statutory provision calling for term s of office.the district court erred in holding that c unambiguously requires that all commissioners be appointed for six years,regardless of whether their predecessors completed their terms.this error undermines the district court judgment,because the remainder of its analysis rests on that erroneous premise as its point of departure.
finding that the expression term of office in c is ambiguous,we are left to resolve that ambiguity.in resolving the ambiguity,we consider the broader context of c and the structure of the act as a whole,as well as the contextual background against which congress was legislating,including relevant practices of the executive branch which presumably informed congress decision,prior legislative acts,and historical events.finally,we explore the policy ramifications of the suggested interpretations of c.each of these considerations leads us to the conclusion that,in enacting the act,congress did not disrupt the staggering of terms of commission members created in the act.therefore we hold that wilson was appointed by president clinton only to fill the unexpired term of judge higginbotham,as her commission indicates,and her service as a commissioner terminated on november.as a result,kirsanow,having been validly appointed to a vacant seat on the commission on december,for a term expiring november,and having taken the oath of office,is a member of the united states commission on civil rights.
appellants argue that in order to properly interpret c we must construe both of its two sentences together,rather than as separate and unrelated.taken together,appellants contend that it is evident that the act retained fixed slots of time to which individual members of the commission are appurtenant.the second sentence of c provides that the term of each member of the commission in the initial membership of the commission shall expire on the date such term would have expired as of september,under the act.the initial membership of the commission is defined as the members of the united states commission on civil rights on september,in other words,the members then serving on the commission pursuant to the act.b.appellants argue that in maintaining the staggering of initial terms of the commission,as inherently provided for by the second sentence of c,the act perpetuated a system of staggered terms.new terms begin based on when the old,staggered terms end.thus the structure created by congress in and preserved in would automatically endure.
appellees would have us read the two sentences of c as unrelated.according to appellees,the first sentence alone sets the term of office for six years,and the second sentence simply addresses the transitional issue of the terms of the initial membership of the commission,allowing the existing members of the commission to finish the terms to which they had been appointed.however,as discussed in part,supra,read alone,the first sentence of c is ambiguous.it is susceptible to an interpretation that each member appointed to the commission receives six years from her date of appointment,regardless of whether her predecessor left office early,and regardless of whether there was a delay in her appointment.this is the interpretation urged by the intervenors.this interpretation would not only grant wilson a full term,it would effectively extend the terms of others on the commission.yet,an equally plausible interpretation is that terms of the commissioners run for six years with the calendar.rather than counting from the date of appointment,the six years of members term are counted from the expiration of their predecessors term.this is the common practice of the executive branch in making appointments to staggered boards and commissions.see,office of legal counsel,department of justice,memorandum for the executive clerk,term of a member of the mississippi river commission,at may,observing that to preserve the staggering required by statute,each member may serve only until the passage of the specified number of years calculated from the expiration of his predecessor term,even if the member confirmation and appointment take place after that prior term has expired.thus,despite any delay in appointment,a commissioner term would expire six years from the day her predecessor expired.both are six year question is which congress intended here.
reading the first sentence of c together with the second sentence,the latter provides an anchor fixed times for terms of commissioners to expire,based on the term s of each member of the commission in the initial membership of the commission.it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.fda brown williamson tobacco,d quoting davis michigan dep t of treasury,d.thus,it is a more faithful construction of c to read it as a whole,rather than as containing two unrelated parts.it is the classic judicial task of construing related statutory provisions to make sense in combination.united states fausto,d.the second sentence does indeed address the transitional issue of the terms of the initial membership,but in doing so,it also creates a pattern of staggered appointments.staggered terms must run with the calendar,rather than with the person,to preserve staggering.thus,taken with the history and background against which congress was legislating,discussed infra,it simply makes more sense to read c as creating terms of office running with the calendar from the date of expiration of a predecessor term.that being the case,any appointment to fill a vacancy for an unexpired term,such as wilson appointment,must only be for the duration of that unexpired term.for it to be otherwise would disrupt the fixed and staggered terms that run with the calendar.
at oral argument,we raised with counsel for appellees the question of the effect of their proffered interpretation,as adopted by the district court,on the terms of those members who,like berry and reynoso,were appointed to succeed commissioners who had served their full terms,when the successor did not take office until the lapse of some period of time after the termination of the prior commissioner service.counsel argued for a application of the statute,contending that when an appointee predecessor had served out her full term,but there was a delay in the nomination of the new appointee,that new appointee could permissibly serve less than a full six years,because such a discrepancy was only minor.however,when the appointee is replacing a predecessor who had failed to serve out a full term,such as here,the new appointee should serve a new,full six years from the date of her appointment.this anomalous result further undermines appellee interpretation of the statute.we have difficulty believing that congress sub silentio created two different tracks with full terms for those commissioners who succeeded appointees who by reason of death or resignation did not serve out their full terms,but truncated terms for those who succeeded members who served for six years but whose vacancy was not immediately filled by presidential appointment.nothing in section c gives any indication that the phrase the term of office of each member of the commission has two different meanings for two distinct classes of commissioner not otherwise recognized in the statute.the lack of such differentiation and appellee concession that delayed appointees serve terms shortened by the interval between the expiration of their predecessors term and the date of their appointment further supports our interpretation that,read together,the two sentences of c create fixed terms that run with the calendar.
our interpretation is consistent with widely held traditional understandings of statutes defining terms of office.the second edition of american jurisprudence notes that w here both the duration of the term of an office and the time of its commencement or termination are fixed by a constitution or statute,a person elected or appointed to fill a vacancy in such office holds for the unexpired portion of the term d public officers and employees.
the controversy before us involves just such a term of office.the first sentence of c fixes the duration of the term six years.the second sentence of c fixes the time of termination the terms of the initial members expire at dates determinable from preexisting law.it is thus unsurprising that president clinton issued a commission appointing appellee wilson for the remainder of the term expiring november.reading c as a whole,we conclude that it creates fixed terms of office that run with the calendar,rather than with the person.thus,having been appointed to fulfill the remainder of judge higginbotham term,expiring november,wilson time on the commission is up.
our interpretation of c is further confirmed by background considerations such as relevant practices of the executive branch.congress is presumed to preserve,not abrogate,the background understandings against which it legislates.see,bennett spear,d norfolk redev.hous.auth.chesapeake potomac,d.l ongstanding practices of the executive branch can place a gloss on congress action in enacting a particular provision.ass of civilian technicians flra.here the consistent treatment of appointments by the executive branch provides such a gloss.
neither the act nor the act explicitly addressed delays in appointments of members after a predecessor term had expired.yet,it appears that every presidential appointee to the commission since has been appointed to a term of office expiring six years from the date her predecessor term expired.even after the passage of the act,with the changes appellees claim it made to the terms of office,president clinton appointed no less than four members to the commission for terms of less than six years.three of these were delayed appointments,and the fourth is victoria wilson.congress has reappropriated funds for the commission,effectively reauthorizing it,each year since it was supposed to terminate in,and yet it has not once suggested that the executive branch implementation of the law was incorrect.it is not that the president interpretation of c is due deference,as suggested by appellants,but rather that the executive branch interpretation of the law through its implementation colors the background against which congress was legislating.congress is presumed to be aware of established practices and authoritative interpretations of the coordinate branches.national lead united states.congress is presumed to have legislated with knowledge of such an established usage of an executive department of the government.lorillard pons,d in re north,special division.here the executive branch consistent practice provides a presumptive default.
similarly,the practice of appointing members to the commission on civil rights is but an example of what has been the unbroken position of the attorney general and the justice department on executive appointments.as noted in an opinion issued by the office of legal counsel on may,term of a member of the mississippi river commission 
ordinarily,when a statute provides for an appointee to serve a term of years,the specified time of service begins with the appointment.case of chief constructor easby,op.att y.a different rule generally applies to commissions whose members have staggered terms.there,to preserve the staggering required by statute,each member may serve only until the passage of the specified number of years calculated from the expiration of his predecessor term,even if the member confirmation and appointment take place after that prior term has expired.
emphasis added.this latter rule has been consistently applied to executive appointments to the commission on civil rights both in its previous incarnation under the act and as constituted under the act.appointments have run six years from the date of the expiration of a predecessor from the date of appointment it is of course possible that the consistent practice of presidents clinton and bush in appointing members of the commission has been consistently wrong.however,we do not agree with appellee interpretation compelling that conclusion.rather,we hold that presidents clinton and bush have it right.that is,the act clearly intended to create staggering.the act preserved this structure by providing for terms with the terms of the initial commissioners expiring according to their commissions under the act.
furthermore,the consistent practice of the executive branch with respect to the filling of midterm vacancies on other bodies with staggered term members has been to fill those vacancies for the duration of the unexpired term,preserving the staggering of terms.that this practice has been longstanding is illustrated by a dispute in the century remarkably similar to the case at bar.in,the attorney general was asked by the president for his opinion of the term of office of a commissioner of the district of columbia who had been appointed after his predecessor failed to serve out a full term.see commissioners of the distri
