at issue in this lawsuit under section of the voting rights act of,stat.codified as amended at,is whether minority plaintiffs,who are not sufficiently numerous to form a voting majority in any district in the commonwealth of virginia,may nevertheless claim that a legislative redistricting plan denies minority voters an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.the district court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiffs could not satisfy the requirement established in thornburg gingles that a minority group seeking relief under section demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district,d.because we agree that gingles establishes a numerical majority requirement for all section claims,we affirm the order of the district court dismissing the complaint with prejudice.
on june,the commonwealth held a special election for the united states house of representatives seat in the fourth congressional district.the seat had become vacant on account of the death of longtime democratic representative norman sisisky on march.in the special election,republican randy forbes defeated democrat louise lucas to capture the fourth district seat by a to percent margin.
shortly thereafter,on july,the virginia general assembly enacted the existing congressional district plan the redistricting plan based on the results of the census relevant to this appeal,the redistricting plan redrew the boundaries of the fourth district,shifting a number of citizens out of the fourth district and into the third and fifth congressional districts.before the enactment of the redistricting plan,blacks formed percent of the total population and percent of the population in the fourth district in the reconfigured fourth district,blacks constitute percent of the total population and percent of its population.
the redistricting plan left the total population and population figures for blacks in the third district virtually unchanged.the third district previously had a total black population of percent and a black population of percent.under the new plan,blacks in the third district comprise percent of the total population and percent of the population.similarly,the total population and population statistics for blacks in the fifth district were largely unaffected by the redistricting plan.blacks constituted percent of the total population in the fifth district both before and after the enactment of the plan.black population,however,saw a slight increase from percent in the former fifth district,to percent in the redrawn fifth district 
the plaintiffs are nine registered voters who either currently reside in the fourth district or were shifted out of the fourth district as a result of the redistricting plan.on february,the plaintiffs filed a federal complaint in the eastern district of virginia alleging that the reconfiguration of the fourth district dilutes minority voting strength in violation of section of the voting rights act more precisely,the complaint alleges that,in the former fourth district,blacks were sufficiently numerous to combine with white voters and thereby elect their preferred candidates to public office.the plaintiffs contend that,in the fourth district,blacks are too small in number to form the same winning coalition with crossover white voters that existed before the enactment of the redistricting plan.the complaint further alleges that the new plan dilutes minority voting strength in the fourth district by shifting black voters out of the fourth and into the third district.according to the plaintiffs,the reassignment of black voters to this already safe amounts to an unnecessary waste of black votes.as affirmative relief,the plaintiffs requested an order declaring that the redistricting plan dilutes minority voting strength in violation of section enjoining the defendants from conducting any elections in the fourth district under the redistricting plan and restoring the fourth district to approximately percent in total black population.
relying on the supreme court decision in united states hays,d,the district court dismissed for lack of standing the seven plaintiffs who no longer reside in the fourth district as a result of the redistricting plan.the hays court held that plaintiffs who do not live in a challenged district lack standing to claim that the district has been racially gerrymandered in violation of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.where a plaintiff resides in a racially gerrymandered district the plaintiff has been denied equal treatment and therefore has standing to challenge the legislature action.although hays concerned a racial gerrymandering claim under the equal protection clause,rather than a vote dilution claim under section of the voting rights act,the district court was persuaded that the principles of standing discussed in hays apply equally to the seven plaintiffs in this case who do not live in the challenged district,and thus can claim no more than a generalized grievance against governmental conduct of which they do not approve.hall commonwealth of,d,quoting hays,at.accordingly,the district court held that only plaintiffs joan hall and leslie speight have standing to challenge the fourth district by virtue of their residency within the fourth district.id.at.
the district court ultimately dismissed the vote dilution claims of hall and speight on the grounds that they failed to satisfy all of the necessary preconditions for a section claim established by the supreme court in thornburg gingles,d.the gingles court construed section in the context of a lawsuit claiming that the election of candidates from a multimember diluted minority voting strength by submerging a cohesive racial minority group within a white majority.the court held that plaintiffs challenging the use of multimember districts under section must first establish three threshold conditions.the minority group must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently large and compact to constitute a majority in a single member district,show that it is politically cohesive,and demonstrate that the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority preferred candidate.id.at.
proof of the gingles preconditions is not alone sufficient to establish a claim of vote dilution under section.the ultimate determination of vote dilution under the voting rights act still must be made on the basis of the totality of the circumstances.lewis alamance county,cir internal quotations omitted.on the other hand,the failure of a minority group to satisfy all of the gingles preconditions means that it can not sustain a claim under section that the challenged electoral practice impede s the ability of minority voters to elect representatives of their choice.gingles,at.after analyzing the vote dilution allegations in the complaint,the district court held that hall and speight failed to state a claim cognizable under section,since blacks would not form a population or majority in the fourth district even if they prevailed and the fourth district was restored to approximately percent in total black population.the district court therefore dismissed the complaint with prejudice pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
on appeal,the plaintiffs claim that the district court erred in treating the first gingles precondition as a numerical requiring black voters to be a numerical majority in a district.appellants br.at.although gingles states very clearly that section plaintiffs must demonstrate that a minority group is large enough to form a majority in a district,gingles,at,the plaintiffs argue that nothing in the language of section or gingles requires that a minority group constitute a numerical majority in a district in order to state a vote dilution claim.instead,the plaintiffs contend that the first gingles precondition is satisfied not only when a minority group constitutes a numerical majority in a district,but also when minorities are sufficiently numerous to form an effective or functional majority in a district by combining with voters from other racial or ethnic groups.appellants br.at.according to the plaintiffs,the purpose of section is to remove obstacles that impair the ability of minorities to elect their preferred candidates.thus,they argue that if minorities can elect a candidate by forming a majority in a district in combination with voters from another racial group,then they have demonstrated that a structure which prevents them from doing so is dilutive.id.at.fundamentally,the plaintiffs contend that section authorizes a claim that an election law or practice dilutes the voting strength of a multiracial coalition.
we review de novo the dismissal of a complaint under rule b,franks ross,cir,which authorizes the dismissal of a complaint that fail s to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.b.because the purpose of rule b is to test the legal sufficiency of a complaint,rather than the facts alleged in support of it,we must accept as true all allegations and must construe the factual allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.randall united states,cir.ultimately,a complaint should not be dismissed under rule b unless it appears certain that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would support its claim and would entitle it to relief.mylan,matkari,cir.with these principles in mind,we consider whether the complaint states a valid claim under section however,before turning to the merits of the plaintiffs appeal,we set forth below the concepts that give meaning to a vote dilution claim,as well as the standards that keep it within principled legal bounds.mcghee granville county,cir.
a vote dilution claim alleges that a particular practice operates to cancel out or minimize the voting strength of a minority group.white regester,d.in turn,a minority group voting strength is measured in terms of its ability to elect candidates to public office.gingles,at,concurring observing that minority voting strength is to be assessed solely in terms of the minority group ability to elect candidates it prefers emphasis omitted.in choosing the ability to elect its preferred candidates as the measure of a minority group voting strength,the court declined to address whether section permits claims,brought by a minority group too small to form a majority in a district,that a practice impairs its ability to influence rather than to win elections.id.at.thus,under existing supreme court authority,a vote dilution claim under section must be cast solely in terms of an allegation that a particular practice impede s the ability of minority voters to elect representatives of their choice.id.at.
any claim that the voting strength of a minority group has been diluted must be measured against some reasonable benchmark of undiluted minority voting strength.as justice frankfurter once observed,t alk of debasement or dilution is circular talk.one can not speak of debasement or dilution of the value of a vote until there is first defined a standard of reference as to what a vote should be worth.baker carr,d frankfurter,dissenting see also gingles,at,concurring noting that to evaluate a vote dilution claim,it is necessary to construct a measure of undiluted minority voting strength.
the size,compactness,and cohesiveness requirements of the gingles preconditions are at the heart of the measure of undiluted voting strength that the supreme court has adopted for vote dilution claims.in gingles,justice observed that the first and second preconditions establish a standard of undiluted minority voting strength in terms of the voting power a minority group could wield if its members were all concentrated within one,hypothetical district.
the court definition of the elements of a vote dilution claim is simple and invariable a court should calculate minority voting strength by assuming that the minority group is concentrated in a district in which it constitutes a voting majority.where the minority group is not large enough,geographically concentrated enough,or politically cohesive enough for this to be possible,the minority group claim fails.where the minority group meets these requirements,the representatives that it could elect in the hypothetical district or districts in which it constitutes a majority will serve as the measure of its undiluted voting strength.whatever plan the state actually adopts must be assessed in terms of the effect it has on this undiluted voting strength.
gingles,at,concurring emphasis added.the electoral ability of a group concentrated within a hypothetical district makes sense as the measure of undiluted minority voting strength,because voting strength is measured in terms of a group ability to elect candidates and a minority group that could constitute a majority in a district ordinarily has the potential ability to elect representatives without white support,while a minority that could not constitute such a majority does not.id.at.emphasis added.
stated differently,minority voters have the potential to elect a candidate on the strength of their own ballots when they can form a majority of the voters in some district.when the voting potential of a minority group that is large enough to form a majority in a district has been thwarted by the manipulation of district lines minorities may justly claim that their ability to elect candidates has been diluted in violation of section.on the other hand,when minority voters,as a group,are too small or loosely distributed to form a majority in a district,they have no ability to elect candidates of their own choice,but must instead rely on the support of other groups to elect candidates.under these circumstances,minorities can not claim that their voting is,the potential to independently decide the outcome of an been diluted in violation of section.as the supreme court observed in growe,a minority group claiming vote dilution must establish that it has the potential to elect a representative of its own choice in some district.growe,at.emphasis added.and u nless minority voters possess the potential to elect representatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practice,they can not claim to have been injured by that structure or practice.gingles,at.
ultimately,the right to undiluted voting strength in section is a guarantee of equal opportunity in voting,ensuring that a minority group is not denied,on account of race,color,or language minority status,the opportunity to exercise an electoral power that is commensurate with its population in the relevant jurisdiction.see smith brunswick county,cir explaining that the analysis of a vote dilution claim must consider whether the protected voting group has a voting opportunity that relates favorably to the group population in the jurisdiction for which the election is being held.this guarantee of equal opportunity in voting is evident in the plain language of section,which is violated whenever an election law or practice leaves minorities with less opportunity than other members of the electorate to elect representatives of their choice.b see also voinovich,at.only if the apportionment scheme has the effect of denying a protected class the equal opportunity to elect its candidate of choice does it violate where such an effect has not been demonstrated,simply does not speak to the matter.as a result,to establish a vote dilution claim under section,minorities must prove that they have been unlawfully denied the political opportunity they would have enjoyed as a majority in a district namely,the opportunity to dictate electoral outcomes independently of other voters in the jurisdiction.voinovich,at.
in light of these principles informing a vote dilution claim under section,we must conclude that the complaint in this case fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the plaintiffs can not establish that black voters have been denied an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.the redistricting plan reduces the population of blacks in the fourth district from to percent.it does not follow,however,that the new plan dilutes minority voting strength under section.section and gingles instruct that a plan may not create a barrier to the ability of minorities to elect their p
