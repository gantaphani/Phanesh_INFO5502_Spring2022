two organizations and an unsuccessful candidate for state senate challenge the constitutionality of several minnesota campaign finance laws.as relevant here,minnesota requires registration with the campaign finance and disclosure board by all organizations that accept or spend money to influence,or whose major purpose is to influence,the nomination or election of a specific candidate,subds.and defining political committee and political fund.it also requires lobbyists to disclose the source of funds spent on lobbying,and restricts religious,charitable,and educational organizations from requesting money from candidates,subd.d.further,minnesota prohibits candidates from accepting money from another candidate campaign committee,and caps contributions from political committees,political funds,lobbyists,and large contributors at percent of the candidate expenditure limit,subd.on summary judgment,the district court found these statutes constitutional.minnesota citizens concerned for life,kelley,d.the challengers appeal.
jurisdiction being proper under,this court affirms in part,reverses in part,and remands.
minnesota citizens concerned for life,is a corporation whose purposes include informing the public on abortion and related topics.before each election,mccl publishes the results of a questionnaire identifying a candidate position on such issues.mccl does not expressly advocate the election or defeat of specific candidates.
the committee for state candidates is a registered political committee affiliated with mccl,devoted to electing or defeating candidates based on issues.unlike mccl,cspc publishes and distributes materials expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates.cspc also contributes directly to campaign committees of favored candidates.
plaintiff david racer ran unsuccessfully for state senate in november.he plans to run again for office in minnesota.
just before the november election,mccl,cspc and racer sought to enjoin enforcement of various campaign finance statutes,alleging violations of the first amendment.citing a failure to comply with the short and plain requirement of federal rule of civil procedure a,the district court withheld ruling on the complaint before the november election.after the election,the court permitted the challengers to file an amended complaint.cross motions for summary judgment followed.
ruling on the motions,the district court found the definition of campaign material in,subd,unconstitutionally vague,and the disclaimer requirement of.a as violating the right to speak anonymously.these rulings are not contested.
mccl,cspc and racer appeal the district court rulings on the following six provisions a the definitions of political committee and political fund,subds.and b the lobbying allocation interpretation of,subd.d c the ban on transfers between candidates political committees,subd.d the contribution limits,subd.e the aggregate limit on contributions from political committees,political funds,lobbyists,and large contributors,subd.and,f the restriction on solicitations by religious,charitable,and educational organizations.
this court reviews de novo a grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard used by the district court.see essco geometric harvard,cir.this court affirms where there are no genuine issues of material fact,and judgment is appropriate as a matter of law.see,citing.c.
definitions of political committee and political fund 
mccl challenges the definitions of political committee and political fund,which read 
political committee means an association whose major purpose is to influence the nomination or election of a candidate or to promote or defeat a ballot question,other than a principal campaign committee or a political party unit.
political fund means an accumulation of dues or voluntary contributions by an association other than a political committee,principal campaign committee,or party unit,if the accumulation is collected or expended to influence the nomination or election of a candidate or to promote or defeat a ballot question.
subd.mccl claims that the phrase to influence in both definitions is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad,violating the first amendment.
the parties argued their case before this court on october.then,no minnesota court had construed these subdivisions.without controlling state precedent,this court would have to speculate or conjecture.see kaiser mem l blood ctr.of minneapolis,cir.see also virginia soc y for human life,caldwell,cir certifying question to virginia supreme court as to whether state campaign finance statute should be narrowly construed under buckley valeo,d virginia soc y for human life,caldwell,narrowly construing the statute.
on december,this court certified a question to the minnesota supreme court as to the construction of subdivisions and.that court,after briefing and argument,ruled on june.by this court order,the case is resubmitted for decision.
the minnesota supreme court held 
t o clarify the conformity of our statute with buckley,we choose to reformulate the eighth circuit question as follows 
whether the use of the phrase to influence the nomination or election of a candidate or to promote or defeat a ballot question and related phrases in,subds.and may be narrowly construed to limit the application of those statutes to groups that expressly advocate the nomination or election of a particular candidate or the promotion or defeat of a ballot question.
we answer the certified question,as reformulated,in the affirmative.
minnesota citizens concerned for life,kelley.
in its opinion,the minnesota supreme court holds that the challenged definitions do not apply to groups that engage only in pure issue advocacy.id.at.mccl claims to engage only in pure issue advocacy.the district court,therefore,correctly found that mccl lacks standing to challenge the definitions of political committee and political fund.
lobbying allocation formula 
subdivision d,requires mccl lobbyists to report each source of over per year that mccl used for lobbying,including the source name,address,and employer.mccl contends this requirement violates the first amendment by compelling disclosure of personal information about contributors who give generally to mccl.the district court held that the state interest in regulating lobbying outweighs mccl first amendment interests.mccl,d at,quoting buckley,at.compelled disclosure may be upheld where government interests are sufficiently important to outweigh the possibility of infringement.
in an advisory opinion,the board has interpreted subdivision d to require that a lobbyist principal,such as mccl,provide its lobbyists the names of persons meeting either of two thresholds those who earmarked donations over to mccl for has never happened and thus mccl does not attack this reporting those whose aggregate contributions multiplied by the percentage of the budget the lobbyist principal used for lobbying is greater than.campaign fin.and pub.disclosure bd,issue.mccl claims the statute as applied is vague and overbroad because the formula requires disclosure of contributors whose funds may not be used for lobbying 
both the supreme court and this court have upheld statutes based on the government compelling interest in requiring lobbyists to register and report their activities,and avoiding even the appearance of corruption.see buckley,at.minnesota state ethical pract.bd.rifle ass n,cir upholding the predecessor statute to section,cert.denied,d.applying buckley,this court in nra examined the record to determine whether any contributors had experienced threats of physical or economic harm as a result of the disclosure requirement.nra,at,applying buckley,at.in this case,mccl provides no evidence of such extreme hardship.
mccl contends that the main problem with subdivision d is that minnesota requires the disclosure of contributors for pure issue advocacy.mccl invokes its contributors rights to free speech and association with an advocacy organization as established since naacp alabama,d.mccl also notes it faces a misdemeanor charge if it fails to report the required personal information.
subdivision d states simply that a lobbyist must report each original source of money in excess of in any year used for the purpose of lobbying true,the statute itself does not have a specific formula to determine the threshold.the issue becomes whether the board formula is precise enough.mccl cites cases applying buckley to invalidate regulation of speech that is pure issue advocacy.see vermont right to life,sorrell,cir iowa right to life,williams,cir.virginia soc y for human life,at.essentially,mccl asserts that buckley express advocacy limitation must be read into the statute,preempting the board formula.see buckley,at.
this court must follow the latest pronouncement of the supreme court buckley and mcfl were specific to the statutory language before us they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating speech.mcconnell fed.election comm n,d.mcconnell explains that the express advocacy distinction only resulted from narrowly construing an overbroad,vague statute.id.if the statute is easily understood and objectively determinable,the vagueness objection that persuaded the buckley court to limit feca reach to express advocacy is inapposite.id.at,citing grayned city of rockford,d.
the lobbying allocation formula is not unconstitutionally vague if it is easily understood and objectively determinable.mccl contends that it can not know at any specific time the percent of its budget spent on lobbying,and therefore its contributors can not know whether their personal information will be disclosed.mccl concludes that the lobbying allocation formula thus does not give fair warning of what is required or prohibited,citing thorburn austin,cir,and grayned,at.
the board counters that mccl,and its contributors,need only consult public records in order to calculate the lobbying allocation formula.mccl makes comprehensive disclosure of its total finances for the preceding calendar year.see.charitable organization act.mccl also discloses as a principal the amount it spends on lobbying,again for the preceding calendar year.see,subd.the board concludes that a person of common intelligence can compare the two publically available numbers and determine the lobbying allocation formula.
the board does not claim in either its brief,or its advisory opinion,to require a percentage allocation.as interpreted by the board,the lobbying allocation formula is not unconstitutionally vague,and does not infringe upon contributors rights to free speech and association with an advocacy organization.
mccl finally claims that the formula is arbitrary,as the amount spent on lobbying may vary from year to year.mccl offered no proof of this assertion in the district court and the comprehensive annual amounts in the are roughly comparable from year to it.on this record,the lobbying allocation formula is not arbitrary.
mccl fails to prove that the lobbying allocation formula causes extreme hardship,or improperly regulates issue advocacy.further,as interpreted by the board,the formula is not vague.accordingly,the district court properly held that as applied,subdivision d is constitutional.
ban on transfers between candidates political committees 
section,subdivision,prohibits the transfer of funds between candidates political committees,except when the contributing candidate committee is dissolving.racer,as a future candidate,claims this ban infringes his first amendment right of association,to receive money from candidates.specifically,he claims the ban is not closely drawn to match a sufficiently important state interest.see federal election comm beaumont,d stating the scrutiny for a ban on campaign contributions.see also nixon shrink missouri gov t pac,d.
the district court found that minnesota bans transfers between to prevent circumventing the limits,to avoid the appearance of corruption,and to restrict those in power from funneling money to those seeking power.avoiding the appearance or perception of corruption is a significant state interest in the evaluation of campaign finance laws.see mcconnell,at,cal.daily op.serv.racer argues that the potential for corruption from transfers is minimal because candidates will transfer money only to other candidates contribution limits already exist minnesota has a general statute in section and,earmarking could be required by the original contributor.the supreme court has flatly rejected such logic 
and because the first amendment does not require congress to ignore the fact that candidates,donors,and parties test the limits of the current law,federal election comm colorado republican federal campaign,d,these interests have been sufficient to justify not only contribution limits themselves,but laws preventing the circumvention of such limits,at.a ll members of the court agree that circumvention is a valid theory of corruption.
mcconnell,at.
subdivision is closely drawn to match the interests identified.see beaumont,at.subdivision limits contributions from campaign committees,not from candidates personally.see,subd.limiting contributions from another candidate principal campaign committee,a committee with the other candidate name or title,or a committee otherwise authorized by the contributing candidate.a candidate may personally contribute to another campaign,endorse another candidate,encourage contributors to another candidate,and support another candidate in many legal ways.
because subdivision serves the significant interest of avoiding corrupt elections by banning transfers,and is closely drawn,the district court correctly found it constitutional.
contribution limits 
racer also challenges,subdivision,setting different contribution limits for election and years.he claims it gives incumbents an unfair advantage in violation of the first amendment.the district court found no basis for racer contention that the limit discriminates against challengers as a class.mccl,d at.this court agrees.
subdivision provides 
a candidate for state senate must not permit the candidate principal campaign committee to accept aggregate contributions made or delivered by any individual,political committee,or political fund in excess of in an election year for the office sought and in other years.
absent record evidence of invidious discrimination against challengers as a class,a court should generally be hesitant to invalidate legislation which on its face imposes evenhanded restrictions.buckley,at.racer notes that in,the ninth circuit held an annual contribution limit violated the first amendment,due to disparities in fundraising between incumbents and challengers.see service employees int l union fair political practices comm n,cir,cert.denied,d.however,the ninth circuit has since recognized that this holding is superceded by beaumont and shrink pac.montana right to life ass eddleman,cir,cert,d,quoting beaumont,at,and shrink pac,at.
regulations on contributions are merely marginal speech restrictions subject to relatively complaisant review under the first amendment,because contributions lie closer to the edges than to the core of political expression.beaumont,at.in,the ninth circuit upheld montana contribution doubled if the candidate had a contested the record showed no support for the proposition that an incumbent advantages are leveraged into something significantly more powerful by contribution limitations applicable to all candidates,whether veterans or upstarts.eddleman,at,quoting shrink pac,at.
as in eddleman,racer presents no evidence that the statute here causes any disadvantage to challengers.challengers may accept contributions throughout a election cycle.a candidate often a campaign committee before filing for office.see,subd.defining candidate,as an individual who has received contributions or made expenditures in excess of.once deemed a candidate,a principal campaign committee must be formed,which can remain in existence for years.see,subds.thus,challengers may form campaign committees and raise money years in advance of an election.
that a challenger may decide to run late in the election main not attributable to subdivision.because racer fails to present evidence of invidious discrimination against c
