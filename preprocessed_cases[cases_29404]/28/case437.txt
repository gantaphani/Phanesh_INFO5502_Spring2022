this appeal presents the following issues whether the procedures by which the georgia general assembly considers local legislation violate the principle of one person,one vote,and whether the changes in internal rules and procedures by which the general assembly enacts local legislation are subject to the preclearance requirement of the voting rights act of,et,as amended.as to the first issue,the district court determined that,although the members of the georgia general assembly local delegations were popularly elected,they did not engage in governmental functions,and,therefore,the one person,one vote requirement does not apply.under the circumstances of this case,the district court should have invoked abstention concerning this issue.regarding the second issue,we affirm the court determination that the preclearance requirements of the voting rights act did not apply to the changes in the general assembly.accordingly,we reverse in part and affirm in part.
background 
the legislative power of the state is vested in the general assembly,which consists of a house of representatives and a senate,art.iii.both the house and senate have adopted their own rules to govern organization and basic rules of operation local legislation,which is legislation that applies to a specific city,county,or special district,comprises a large part of the bills introduced and enacted by the general assembly each year because of this volume,the house and the senate have adopted local delegations for the consideration of local legislation.each county,municipality,or other jurisdiction has a local delegation and any legislator whose district encompasses territory within a specific city or county is a member of the local delegation for that entity.
the local delegations make recommendations to the house and senate standing committees,which then recommend local legislation to the entire.a local bill must receive the requisite majority from the local delegation to be reported favorably out of the standing committees with a do pass recommendation.absent local delegation rules filed in the house standing committee,unanimous support from the local delegation is required for the committee to report the legislation favorably to the full house with a do pass recommendation similarly,senate rule u provides that local legislation must be approved by a majority of the senators who represent the locality in question.if the local delegation is equally divided on the proposed legislation,however,the committee then considers the legislation on its own merits and can report it with either a do pass or do not pass recommendation.
if local legislation has received the requisite number of signatures of representatives and senators whose districts lie partially or wholly within the locality which the legislation affects,it is ordinarily passed on an uncontested basis as a matter of local courtesy the underlying assumption of local courtesy is that the bill affects only a certain city or county,and,therefore,representatives and senators of other districts should defer to that local delegation judgment.local courtesy is a custom,however,and is not provided for in either the house or senate rules.should a member of the house or senate choose to challenge local legislation on the floor,local courtesy is not enforced 
it is undisputed that these challenges seldom happen.the district court noted that in practice,the local delegations propose all local legislation and this legislation typically,but not always,is by the full general assembly without further discussion or debate.dejulio,d at.for local legislation to become law,however,the governor must sign it within forty days from the end of the legislative session.id.
tiberio dejulio and eva galambos hereinafter voters,filed a voting rights action pursuant to,the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution,and an action to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment and the voting rights act of,et,as amended.voters alleged that the current procedures for enactment of local legislation of the general assembly constituted a violation of the one person,one vote standard additionally,voters argued that the changes in the general assembly internal rules are subject to the preclearance requirement of section of the voting rights act.dejulio,d at.the district court granted summary judgment to the appellees and determined that the one person,one vote requirement did not apply to the general assembly local legislative delegations,and the changes in internal rules and procedures by which the general assembly enacted local legislation were not subject to the voting rights act preclearance requirements.id.at.voters appeal this judgment on both issues.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,apply the same standard as the district court,and review all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.allison mcghan med,cir.summary judgement is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions and answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d quoting.c.
one person,one vote 
because this issue is better determined by the state,the district court should have invoked pullman abstention under pullman abstention,a federal court will defer to state court resolution of underlying issues of state law.harman forssenius,d.by abstaining in such cases,federal courts avoid unnecessary friction in relations,interference with important state functions,tentative decisions on questions of state law,and premature constitutional adjudication.id.at.at.
two criteria have been established for application of the pullman doctrine the case must present an unsettled question of state law,and the question of state law must be dispositive of the case or would materially alter the constitutional question presented.duke james,cir.a question of state law is unsettled if it is fairly subject to an avoiding construction,which means that the state court can render a fair interpretation of state law that comports with the constitution.id.at.
in considering abstention,we must take into account the nature of the controversy and the importance of the right allegedly impaired.siegel lepore,cir en banc per curiam.voters in this case allege that the current procedures for enacting local legislation violate the one person,one vote requirement of the fourteenth amendment.specifically,voters contend that their vote is diluted compared to other fulton county voters whose representatives and senators represent only a portion of fulton county,but who have an equal vote in fulton county local delegations.
an alleged denial of voting rights does not automatically trigger federal involvement.duncan poythress,cir.unit b the abstention doctrines are not considered rules of law.rather,they are applied with the exercise of sound discretion based of the facts of each case.hill city of el paso,texas,cir.
in this case,we risk interference with valid state procedures and unnecessary federal constitutional adjudication.how power shall be distributed by a state among its governmental organs is commonly,if not always,a question for the state itself.highland farms dairy agnew.the georgia constitution authorizes the general assembly to create its own rules of procedure.both the house and senate have adopted internal procedures for the consideration of local legislation to assist the general assembly in handling vast quantities of legislation.whether the local delegations perform governmental functions,which subjects them to the one person,one vote requirement,is a fundamental matter of state law that is most appropriate for state court determination.because the relief sought by voters regarding the validity of the house and senate rules may be available under georgia law,we conclude that the district court should not have decided the merits of the federal constitutional claims presented in this complaint.
the dissent states that no unsettled state law questions are p
