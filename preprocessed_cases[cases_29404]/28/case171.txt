this case arises out of bexar county redistricting of its justice of the peace and constable precincts following the national census.the plaintiffs contended that the redistricting plan impermissibly dilutes the votes of hispanics in violation of section of the voting rights act and that it violates article v,section of the texas constitution.the district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on their federal law claim and denied relief on the state constitutional claim.after carefully reviewing the evidence adduced at trial,we hold that there is no legal or factual basis for the court finding of vote dilution and that the plaintiffs are entitled to no relief under federal law.we reverse in part,affirm in part and vacate the district court injunctive relief.
background 
in august,bexar county commissioners court adopted,pursuant to the texas constitution,a redistricting plan for its justice of the peace and constable precincts justice precincts.see.const.art.v.the major changes effected by the redistricting plan were the reduction of the number of precincts from five to four,and the elimination of one constable position.the plan eliminated precinct five,which elected one justice of the peace and one constable,but it added one new justice of the peace position to precinct one,thereby leaving the total number of justice of the peace positions unchanged.constable tejeda precinct five position was eliminated.under both the current and former redistricting plans,there are one and two districts.the population of precinct five was transferred into revised precincts one and two.the redistricting plan was by the department of justice civil rights division.
just after elections had been held under the new plan,the plaintiffs filed suit against bexar county alleging that the plan violated sections and of the voting rights act and article v,section of the texas constitution the district court conducted a bench trial and ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on their section vote dilution claim.as a remedy,the court ordered the results of the elections set aside and the judge reinstated the original plan,and,inter alia,ordered bexar county to constable tejeda post.this court stayed the court remedy pending bexar county appeal.
ii.discussion 
voting rights act claim 
what the plaintiffs precisely assert is that the elimination of precinct five and its consolidation in the other redrawn districts has diluted the influence of hispanic votes in precinct two.it is surely no accident,however,that former constable tejeda,whose position was eliminated in the redistricting,is the lead plaintiff.
section of the voting rights act proscribes vote dilution whereby a class of citizens has less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.this court applies a framework in analyzing section claims.naacp fordice,cir.first,plaintiffs challenging a redistricting plan must satisfy the preconditions for a section claim set forth by the supreme court in thornburg gingles,d id.second,the plaintiffs must prove that based on the totality of the circumstances,the challenged plan results in the denial of the right to vote based on color or race in violation of section.fordice,at.to meet the threshold gingles test,the plaintiffs bear the burden to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the affected minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a voting age majority in a district the minority group is politically cohesive and the majority votes sufficiently as a bloc that it is the absence of special to defeat the minority group preferred candidate.id.citing gingles,at.at.
in reviewing a district court decision regarding an alleged violation of section of the voting rights act,this court analyzes the legal standards applied by a district court de novo,id.at,and the factual findings for clear error.gingles emphasized that the proper assessment of vote dilution claims is peculiarly dependent upon the facts of each case and requires an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of the contested electoral mechanisms.at.at.the clear error standard precludes reversal of a district court findings unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson city of bessemer,d.we may not reverse for clear error so long as the district court findings are based on a plausible account of the evidence considered against the entirety of the record.fordice,at.
the parties do not dispute that the plaintiffs satisfy the first two prongs of the gingles threshold inquiry hispanics are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to constitute a voting age majority in justice precinct two,and they are politically cohesive.the evidence adduced before the district court focused on gingles third inquiry,the ability of hispanics to elect their preferred candidate under the plan in reapportioned justice precinct two the plaintiffs argument is that although precinct two retains a majority of hispanic residents,the majority is narrower than that in former precinct five and,having been diluted,is barely sufficient to ensure hispanic electoral success.since neither party presented significant evidence regarding the other redistricted precincts,our analysis is confined to justice precinct two.
the critical question before the district court,and now on appeal,is whether the plaintiffs met their burden of proof on the third gingles factor.lacking such proof,the plaintiffs can not succeed.see,magnolia bar ass n,lee,cir.
after carefully reviewing the record,and being cognizant of the deference owed to the district court,we have concluded that the district court made substantial legal and factual errors in evaluating the plaintiffs evidence.principally,but not solely,the court erred in ignoring the defendants reconstituted election analysis,and it erred in applying the special circumstances test to ignore the consistent electoral victories of hispanic candidates in precinct two.as a result,the district court clearly erred in ultimately concluding that the redistricting plan impermissibly diluted the hispanic vote in bexar county.
reconstituted election analysis 
because,at the time of trial,only one election had been held within the new precinct boundaries created by the election for bexar county constable in justice precinct for both sides agreed that it was appropriate to look to exogenous races to determine whether racial bloc voting took place in the revised justice precinct two in doing so,the experts employed reconstituted election analysis to evaluate the results of exogenous races for other elected posts that took place in both experts agreed that these races were the most relevant to determining whether anglos voted as a bloc usually to defeat the hispanic candidate of choice in precinct two in addition,the plaintiffs expert responded to the defendant expert analysis of other prior election cycles and agreed that the results from the elections also had substantial probative value.not surprisingly,the expert opinions conflicted on the critical point.compare ex.with exs.the district court,noting these contrary conclusions,determined that the reconstituted election analyses presented by both sides were insufficient and unpersuasive,and opted to consider other evidence to make its determination as to the third gingles factor.
the district court discarded the reconstituted election evidence offered by both parties for two reasons.first,the court found the reconstituted election methodology to be inherently unreliable because including or excluding what the district court believed were a handful of over and under ballots could lead to substantially different conclusions on the ultimate question of racial bloc voting.in addition,the court found that special circumstances in both the and election cycles made these elections unreliable for the purpose of evaluating the validity of the redistricting plan.unfortunately,the district court clearly erred in both determinations.
reconstituted election analysis is a relatively simple method that extracts actual election results from a variety of statewide and local races that subsume the area being analyzed and determines,within the new district,the racial composition of the vote and the winner within the new district.this method of aggregation allows a researcher to determine how an individual candidate performed within the boundaries of the target district even though the actual election covered a different geographical area.
the defendant expert,john alford,employed this standard method in examining races from the general election.the plaintiffs expert,henry flores,also employed a similar one crucial difference in calculating the percentage of the vote received by each candidate,flores used the correct total votes cast for each candidate within the boundaries of justice precinct two.however,in calculating the appropriate denominator,flores did not use the total votes cast in each race within precinct two,but rather used the total ballots cast in precinct two in the overall election.this approach systematically misrepresents the percentage of the vote obtained by each candidate.it does so by improperly including and in the denominator of the equation.are ballots where a voter casts more than one vote for an office and thus invalidates his vote for that office.are those ballots where a voter does not mark any candidate for a given office.neither nor count toward determining victory in a race because they represent,respectively,either a spoiled ballot or an uncast ballot for that particular race.the ballot remains valid,of course,for those races and only those races in which it was properly marked.but to use such ballots in the denominator for calculating the percentage of the vote received in a given race,when the votes from those ballots would not have affected the race,is simply incorrect and results in skewed and inaccurate vote percentages.flores report erred in this manner.based on the inaccurate percentages he calculated,flores concluded that only eight of the hispanic candidates of choice won their races within the boundaries of justice precinct two 
at trial,bexar county counsel carefully dissected this error,leading flores to admit,contrary to his written report,that the proper calculation would have shown that out of hispanic candidates of choice actually won the exogenous elections within the confines of justice precinct two roa vol.at.
to its credit,the district court recognized this fatal flaw in flores methodology.however,instead of simply discarding flores flawed findings and relying on the proper calculations made by the defendant expert,the district court held that flores errors demonstrated how easily reconstituted election analysis can be abused under the best of circumstances.as a result,the district court found the evidence generated from these reconstituted election analyses to be largely unpersuasive.the district court then inexplicably threw out the defendant expert evidence based on the flawed methodology employed by the plaintiffs expert.
the district court first erred in suggesting that the difference between the two expert analyses arose from the inclusion of a handful of ballots.to take just one example,in the race for justice precinct two constable,flores used the total ballots cast in the as the denominator in his equation to determine that garza received percent of the vote.see roa vol.at however,flores methodology improperly included and from that election.id.these votes,taken together,constitute percent of the ballots used in the denominator of flores equation.omitting these uncounted ballots from the calculation,as should have been done,reveals that garza actually obtained percent of the vote.see ex.thus,we disagree that the mistakenly included ballots were a mere handful.on the contrary,flores calculation errors were significant and systematic,and produced a substantially flawed analysis.these erroneous results do not cast doubt on the methodology of reconstituted election analysis,but on the quality of the particular calculations 
the district court,though appropriately disturbed at the serious errors made by the plaintiffs,chose to toss out all of the reconstituted election evidence put forward by both sides.but as the defendant brief points out,such an approach is similar to determining that mathematics is a flawed science simply because one expert testifies that two plus two is four and another expert testifies that two plus two is five.the court should have considered flores errors as undermining the weight of his testimony,not that of the defendant expert.see rollins fort bend indep.sch,cir holding that numerous errors by an expert witness can make all of that expert findings and theories unreliable.an independent assessment of the validity of the defendant expert testimony would then have shown that analysis completely uncontradicted in its findings that the hispanic candidate of choice obtained more votes within new justice precinct two in out of the races identified by both experts as central to the court gingles analysis.moreover,when the general election is included in this analysis,the defendant uncontradicted expert testimony indicates that the hispanic candidate of choice would have won of the most recent races within justice precinct two.
these results contradict the district court determination that the anglo bloc voting serves usually to defeat the hispanic candidate of choice in justice precinct two.the district court decision to disregard these results constitutes clear error.this error prevented the district court from considering the data that both sides agreed were the most probative on the third gingles factor,and thus,strikes at the core of the district court ultimate conclusions.
evaluating special circumstances 
in its initial opinion,the district court acknowledged that both sides focused on expert testimony regarding the and elections and concurred on the importance of these elections in proving the legality of the redistricting plan.nevertheless,the court held that these elections exhibited special circumstances that made an accurate extrapolation of the redistricting plan effect impossible.the district court identified as the relevant special circumstances the presence of a hispanic candidate,tony sanchez,a democrat running for governor in,and the presence of george bush,at the time the republican governor of texas,as a candidate for president in.
the supreme court has cautioned that special circumstances may explain minority electoral success in an otherwise polarized contest,and that such aberrational victories do not necessarily disprove racial vote dilution.gingles,at.at.the district court,however,misapplied the special circumstances analysis in a manner contrary to that contemplated by the supreme court and this circuit precedents.
as explained in gingles,the special circumstances analysis was designed to prevent defendant jurisdictions from arguing that a minority candidate occasional victory in an otherwise racially polarized electorate defeats a vote dilution claim.id.to this end,the court listed several factors that might contribute to the unusual success of an individual minority absence of an opponent,incumbency,or utilization of bullet voting procedures.id.while not exhaustive,this list comprises circumstances that might explain a victory for a minority candidate in a polarized district.this circuit accordingly holds that while special circumstances may be used to explain a single minority candidate victory,the supreme court comment regarding such circumstances can not be transformed into a legal standard which requires the court to force each and every victory of several minority candidates to fit within a prescribed special circumstance.rollins,at emphases added.the rollins court went on to note that e very victory of a minority candidate can not be explained away as a fortuitous event.id.
in the present case,the district court employed the gingles special circumstances analysis not to explain the victory of an individual minority candidate,but rather to explain away the consistent success of hispanic candidates in a number of races over two general election cycles.this was clear error.as noted above,reconstituted election with the proper that the hispanic candidate of choice won of contests during the and general elections within justice precinct two.
moreover,even if special circumstances could be used to explain away all of the minority candidate victories,the evidence fails to provide any basis for such a finding in this case.the district court reasoned that in the elections,george bush candidacy for president likely affected both hispanic and overall voter turnout,but the court failed to explain what the special circumstances of bush candidacy might have been.without evidence,it is impossible to tell whether bush candidacy helped or harmed candidates in.we do not doubt that bush candidacy had some effect on turnout within texas.the plaintiffs expert believed that hispanic election success was more difficult in.however,because no other evidence described the magnitude or nature of this effect,the court clearly erred in speculating how bush candidacy explained the overwhelming success of candidates 
similarly,the district court clearly erred in determining that the presence of tony sanchez at the top of the ticket in was a special circumstance that explained the success of hispanic candidates in that election cycle.no evidence presented at trial tended to indicate that hispanic candidates were more likely to succeed as a result of sanchez candidacy.instead,the plaintiffs expert testified that he had not conducted a study regarding the effect of sanchez candidacy,or what he termed racist ads,on hispanic turnout,and he opined that there was no way of telling the effects of how those ads played out.roa vol.at.indeed,the plaintiffs expert went on to testify specifically that sanchez candidacy and the related ads could have increased turnout on both sides.id.at.
the lack of supporting evidence wholly undermines the district court finding that these elections were not sufficiently reliable to provide any insight into the polarized voting inquiry.the district court finding in this regard is clearly erroneous.
because they are not vulnerable to a special circumstances attack and were not otherwise disputed,the and election results,as properly reconstituted,have substantial probative value on the question whether the plaintiffs met the third gingles precondition.the evidence of overwhelming electoral success for candidates over a wide range of offices and in two separate general election cycles,in both a presidential and a election year,leads to the firm and definite conclusion that the district court clearly erred in finding that anglos vote as a bloc usually to defeat the hispanic candidate of choice within new justice precinct two.recent voting patterns and trends suggest that hispanics will continue to enjoy substantial success in electing the candidates they support in justice precinct two 
other statistical evidence 
after erroneously discarding the probative reconstituted election analyses,the district court purported to rely on the homogenous precinct analysis conducted by the plaintiffs expert.at trial,the plaintiffs submitted expert reports and testimony developed using both regression and homogenous precinct analysis.see,roa vol.at.the homogenous precinct analysis conducted by the plaintiffs expert selected predominantly hispanic and anglo from within justice precinct two and examined the performance of the candidates who ran in the elections.id.we need not consider this homogeneous precinct analysis further,however,because,despite its statements to the contrary,the district court did not actually rely on this analysis 
the court opinion makes clear that it confused the plaintiffs homogenous precinct analysis with the separate analysis conducted by the plaintiffs expert of some that had been redistricted on a single member concept and which contained varying percentages of hispanic voters these election jurisdictions consisted of san antonio city council districts,state house and senate districts,state board of education districts,and congressional districts.in each of these election jurisdictions,the plaintiffs expert examined the overall population and voting age population by racial group,as well as the voter registration.see roa vol.at pls.ex.in addition,the plaintiffs expert focused on the success rates of hispanic candidates who ran for election in these districts.see roa vol.at.the expert analysis of single member districts is completely separate and distinct from the homogenous precinct analysis.
based on his examination of the success rates of hispanic candidates in bexar county,the plaintiffs expert confirmed,at least in his mind,the conclusion he had reached based on his earlier homogenous precinct analysis that examined the results of the reconstituted elections from the general election.flores concluded that,for a hispanic candidate to succeed in bexar county,the registered voter population must exceed percent in a given election jurisdiction.accepting this conclusion,the court held that because 
new justice precinct two does not contain a percentage of registered voters in excess of percent the court is in agreement with flores that anglo voters,in the absence of special circumstances,can and will vote as a bloc in new precinct two usually to defeat the candidate chosen by hispanics and therefore the third prong of gingles is satisfied.
the district court determination in this regard is clearly erroneous for two reasons.first,we know of no caselaw that simply correlates minority candidate success rates,absent any additional statistical analysis,with a minimum threshold of minority voter registration that automatically satisfies gingles third prong.indeed,in our view,such an approach cuts at the heart of gingles and its progeny,which prohibit courts from presuming racial bloc voting and require the plaintiffs to prove that anglos actually vote as a bloc usually to defeat the minority candidate of choice.see growe emison,d a court may not presume bloc voting even within a single minority group citing gingles,at.at.because the district court discounted the reconstituted election evidence submitted by both parties it had no information that would have shed any light on whether anglo voters in these areas actually vote as a bloc usually to defeat the hispanic candidate of choice.rather,in relying only upon the remaining data submitted by the plaintiffs in support of their expert conclusion,the district court impermissibly presumed anglo bloc voting against hispanic candidates in any and all districts where hispanic voter registration is below percent.
moreover,even if this method of analysis were appropriate,the data relied upon by the district court are ambiguous at best on the question whether percent is the minimum threshold for hispanic voter registration in order to assess section compliance.the data shed little,if any,light on the real question in this case,whether the to of hispanic voters in justice precinct two is sufficient that they have an opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice.as bexar county points out,of the districts examined by flores,have over percent hispanic registered voters.see exs.it is undisputed that when the percentage of hispanic registered voters exceeds percent,hispanics have a clear opportunity to elect their candidates of choice in those districts.but,the question before the district court was whether a lower percentage of registered voters was sufficient to afford such an opportunity.of the remaining districts,had less than percent hispanic registration and of these had less than percent hispanic registration.id.evidence regarding such heavily districts does not carry the plaintiffs burden as to precinct two.in fact,in the only relevant set of three districts where hispanic voter registration lay between and percent,a hispanic candidate was actually elected while the experts disagreed as to the reasons for the success of the hispanic candidate in this percent district,the results undermine flores finding that percent hispanic voter registration is a magical number below which the third gingles factor may be presumed to be satisfied 
for the foregoing reasons,the only supporting evidence referenced by the district court on the third gingles prong was actually,and the court finding was therefore clearly erroneous 
plaintiffs burden of proof 
a final observation is in order concerning plaintiffs burden of proof of the third gingles factor.elections for the three offices in justice precinct constable and two justices of the held in november of years,with two positions on the ballot in presidential election years and one position on the ballot in election years.on,flores admitted that he agreed with the defense expert,alford,that in presidential election years,anglos do not vote as a bloc usually to defeat the hispanic candidate of choice in justice precinct two.see roa vol.at.in addition,flores admitted that it was unclear and uncertain whether anglos vote as a bloc,in election years,usually to defeat the hispanic candidate of choice within the challenged area.id.at given that the plaintiffs own expert witness at trial admitted that for two out of the three relevant election scenarios the third gingles factor could not be met,and that in the remaining election scenario,it is unclear and uncertain whether this factor could be met,the district court finding that the plaintiffs had satisfied their burden of proof on this factor is all the more perplexing.
totality of the circumstances inquiry 
because the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof on one of the three essential gingles preconditions for a section vote dilution claim,we need not reach the county claim that the district court clearly erred in its analysis of the totality of the circumstances.magnolia bar,at.nonetheless,where plaintiffs are able to satisfy the gingles threshold inquiry and a district court properly turns to the requisite totality of the circumstances analysis,district courts must thoughtfully consider the factors enumerated in zimmer mckeithen,cir,and the senate judiciary committee report on the amendments to the voting rights act,sess,reprinted in.the district court relatively cursory analysis of the factors was insufficient in this case.in particular,the court ignored that five of the officials elected from the county justice precincts are hispanic and that as the election cycle progresses in the new precinct two,more hispanics will likely be elected this powerful evidence of nearly proportional representation ought to have been considered by the court.
relief ordered by the district court 
from the preceding discussion,it is clear that the district court award of injunctive relief must be vacated.
we pause briefly,however,to note that district courts should use a great deal of caution in invalidating the results of a duly held election and ordering the implementation of its own alternative districting plan.the primary responsibility for correcting voting rights act deficiencies rests with the relevant legislative body.jones lubbock,cir,reh g denied,citing chapman meier,d.both the supreme court and this court have admonished district courts to afford local governments a reasonable opportunity to propose a constitutionally permissible plan and not haphazardly to order injunctive relief id.citing wise lipscomb,d.the extraordinary relief granted in this case,in which the district court not only ordered the election results overturned,but required the county to recreate and refund the eliminated constable office,is reserved only for the most extreme cases.see,cook luckett,cir.this case was in no way extreme.the court order was an abuse of discretion.
plaintiffs constitutional claim 
while the district court analysis of the plaintiffs section voting rights act claim was wanting in many respects,we note,however,that the district court engaged in a careful analysis of the plaintiffs claim under the texas constitution.our review of the briefs and record indicates that the district court properly resolved this claim on the merits.we affirm this portion of the judgment.
iii.conclusion 
this is the rare case in which the district court erroneously refused to consider probative evidence and just as erroneously relied on evidence to support its vote dilution finding.to uphold a finding of vote dilution without any supporting evidence,and with much evidence that indicates a sustained hispanic electoral success in precinct two b significant anglo crossover voting for hispanic candidates and c nearly proportional hispanic representation in the justice precinct posts,ignores reality.the court finding and resulting judgment can not stand.
for the reasons discussed above,the judgment of the district court is reversed in part and affirmed in part.in light of our conclusions,we render judgment in favor of bexar county and vacate the district court injunctive order.
the section claim was rejected by a panel in april and is no longer at issue.
setting aside an election is a drastic remedy.see bell southwell,cir and cook luckett,cir.such a remedy should only be imposed where timely relief is either denied or precluded.see toney white,cir en banc and saxon fielding,cir.
as the district court recognized,the,requirement of baker carr,d,does not apply to judicial districts like justice precincts.wells edwards,aff,d.however,the district court,at various points in its opinion,expressed concern regarding the application of the gingles threshold test to districts that are not required to comply with the,requirement.since section includes judicial selections,chisom roemer,d,we are at a loss as to what other standard than gingles might apply.
all references in this opinion to justice precinct two,unless otherwise noted,refer to the newly redistricted justice precinct two.
this court has repeatedly endorsed the analysis of exogenous elections in section vote dilution cases.see rangel morales,cir naacp fordice,cir.
see johnson miller,per curiam statistically speaking,reconstituted election results from precincts within a certain district,actual prior election results from a certain district,and frequency distributions are the primary methods used to estimate the percentages needed to give minority voters an equal opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice.aff miller johnson,d.
the defendant expert,john alford,also examined reconstituted election results from nine races from the general election and eight races from the general election,as well as two races from the democratic primary election and seven races from the democratic primary election.see ex.
in using the term won,flores apparently means that the candidate obtained more than percent of the votes cast based on his flawed calculation methods.beyond the simple arithmetic error made by flores,the use of a percent threshold may,in some cases,misrepresent the actual percentage necessary to win because it fails to account for the potential presence of a third candidate.as a result,even if flores had employed the proper denominator,his approach would not accurately indicate which candidate actually won,because while flores is correct that a candidate wins if he obtain more than percent of the vote in a,race,a candidate may win a race with as little as percent of the vote assuming the other two candidates split the vote evenly.for example,in two of the races analyzed by both experts in the governor race and the race for court of criminal appeals,place winning candidate within new justice precinct two,the candidate who got the most votes within the target area,nonetheless garnered less than percent of the total votes cast in that race within the target area.see ex.in this sense,flores report not only improperly derives the candidates vote percentages,but also misrepresents the threshold portion of the vote necessary to win in a given race.
indeed,even the one loss was extremely close,with a difference of only votes out of a total of votes cast in that race.see ex,table.
the exact numbers contained in defense exhibit vary slightly from the numbers in the trial transcript apparently because of the way that state law requires early votes from small precincts to be reported.these differences were discussed at trial and do not make a significant difference in t
