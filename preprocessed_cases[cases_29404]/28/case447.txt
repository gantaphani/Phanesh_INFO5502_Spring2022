a group known as emily list promotes abortion rights and supports democratic women candidates.it challenges several new federal election commission regulations that restrict how may spend and raise money to advance their preferred policy positions and candidates.emily list argues that the regulations violate the first amendment.
the first amendment,as interpreted by the supreme court,protects the right of individual citizens to spend unlimited amounts to express their views about policy issues and candidates for public office.similarly,the first amendment,as the court has construed it,safeguards the right of citizens to band together and pool their resources as an unincorporated group or organization in order to express their views about policy issues and candidates for public office.we agree with emily list that the new fec regulations contravene those principles and violate the first amendment.we reverse the judgment of the district court and direct it to enter judgment for emily list and to vacate the challenged regulations.
in the wake of the bipartisan campaign reform act and the supreme court decision in mcconnell fec,the election season of erupted with bitter accusations about the activities of certain entities.the controversy was popularly known by a single term that refers to the section of the tax code applicable to nonprofits engaged in political activities.the debate arose after wealthy individuals contributed huge sums of money to nonprofits ranging from america coming together to to swift boat veterans for truth in order to support advertisements,efforts,and voter registration drives.in total during the campaign,these groups reportedly spent several hundred million dollars.
as the campaign unfolded,many in both major president bush and senator the activities of certain.some encouraged the fec to ban large donations to entities in the same way that congress in bcra had banned large contributions to political parties.proponents of additional regulation reasoned that had replaced political parties as the loophole in the campaign finance system.see edward foley donald tobin,the new loophole,political committees,and,bna money pol.
in response,the fec did not ban from receiving and spending large donations,as some had urged.but the fec did limit how much such as emily list could raise and spend.the fec achieved this objective by dictating that covered pay for a large percentage of activities out of their accounts.see c,f because donations to those accounts are capped at annually for individual contributors,the fec allocation regulations substantially restrict the ability of to spend money for activities such as advertisements,efforts,and voter registration drives.the regulations separately require that donations to be considered hard money subject to the cap if the corresponding solicitation indicated that donations would be used to support the election or defeat of a federal candidate.see id.
in early,emily list filed suit,arguing that the new regulations violated the first amendment and the federal election campaign act.in,the district court upheld the regulations in their entirety.
to assess the constitutionality of the new fec regulations,we initially must address at some length the relevant first amendment principles set forth by the supreme court.
ratified in,the first amendment provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.const.amend.i.this guarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office.buckley valeo,d internal quotation marks omitted.the amendment protects political association as well as political expression.see also naacp alabama ex rel.patterson,d.
in analyzing the interaction of the first amendment and campaign finance laws,the court has articulated several overarching principles of relevance here.
first,the court has held that campaign contributions and expenditures constitute speech within the protection of the first amendment.in buckley,the foundational case,the court definitively ruled that contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an area of the most fundamental first amendment activities.at.the court has never strayed from that cardinal tenet,notwithstanding some passionate objections.see,nixon shrink.gov t pac,d stevens,concurring money is property it is not speech.skelly wright,politics and the constitution is money speech,yale.
second,the court has ruled that the government can not limit campaign contributions and expenditures to achieve equalization that is,it can not restrict the speech of some so that others might have equal voice or influence in the electoral process.in perhaps the most important sentence in the court entire campaign finance jurisprudence,buckley stated t he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment.at.the court added that the government interest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections does not justify regulation.id.at.
in davis fec,the court strongly reiterated that equalization is not a legitimate government objective,d.the davis court approvingly quoted justice kennedy observation in austin michigan chamber of commerce that the notion that the government has a legitimate interest in restricting the quantity of speech to equalize the relative influence of speakers on elections is antithetical to the first amendment.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also austin.chamber of commerce,d scalia,dissenting this illiberal principle of one man,one minute was proposed and soundly rejected in buckley 
third,the court has recognized a strong governmental interest in combating corruption and the appearance thereof.see buckley,at.see also mcconnell fec,d.this,indeed,is the only interest the court thus far has recognized as justifying campaign finance regulation.davis.at preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption are the only legitimate and compelling government interests thus far identified for restricting campaign finances.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.importantly,the court has emphasized that the rationale is not boundless.the core corruption that government may permissibly target with campaign finance regulation is the financial quid pro quo dollars for political favors.fec conservative pac ncpac,d.this anticorruption interest is implicated by contributions to candidates to the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political quid pro quo from current and potential office holders,the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.buckley,at.see also citizens against rent control city of berkeley,d buckley identified a single narrow exception to the rule that limits on political activity were contrary to the first amendment the exception relates to the perception of undue influence of large contributors to a candidate.based on the close relationship between candidates and parties and record evidence demonstrating that political parties sold access to candidates in exchange for contributions,the court has held that the interest also justifies limits on contributions to parties.see mcconnell,at.see also buckley,at.
fourth,in applying the rationale,the court has afforded stronger protection to expenditures by citizens and groups for example,for advertisements,efforts,and voter registration activities than it has provided to their contributions to candidates or parties.the court has explained that contributions to a candidate or party pose a greater risk of quid pro quo corruption than do expenditures.see buckley,at.at the same time,the court has stated that limits on contributions to candidates or parties pose only a marginal restriction upon the contributor ability to engage in free communication.id.at.by contrast,expenditure restrictions limit political expression at the core of our electoral process and of the first amendment freedoms.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.a restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed,the depth of their exploration,and the size of the audience reached.id.at.the court jurisprudence,in short,reflects a fundamental constitutional difference between money spent to advertise one views independently of the candidate campaign and money contributed to the candidate to be spent on his campaign.ncpac,at.emphases added see also randall sorrell,d 
in maintaining this line between i contributions to candidates or parties and ii expenditures,the court has acknowledged that a citizen or group large example,in financing advertisements or confer some benefit on a candidate and thereby give influence to the spender.but the court nonetheless has consistently dismissed the notion that expenditures implicate the interest.see buckley,at.expenditures not a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate see also mcconnell,at.mere political favoritism or opportunity for influence alone is insufficient to justify regulation id.at.congress could not regulate talk show hosts or newspaper editors on the sole basis that their activities conferred a benefit on the candidate ncpac,at.exchange of political favors for uncoordinated expenditures remains a hypothetical possibility and nothing more.
fifth,the court has been somewhat more tolerant of regulation of corporations and labor unions.the court has permitted statutory limits on contributions that corporations and unions make from their general treasuries to candidates and parties more controversially,the court has carved out a significant exception to buckley holding on expenditures the court has upheld laws that prohibit corporations and unions from making expenditures for activities expressly advocating the election or defeat of a federal candidate.the court has permitted those expenditure limits on the ground that they restrain the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public support for the corporation political ideas.austin,at.see also mcconnell,at.but see first bank of boston bellotti,d buckley,at.
to sum up so far in reconciling the competing interests,the supreme court has generally approved statutory limits on contributions to candidates and political parties as consistent with the first amendment.the court has rejected expenditure limits on individuals,groups,candidates,and parties,even though expenditures may confer benefits on candidates.and the court has upheld limits on corporations and unions use of their general treasury funds to make campaign contributions to candidates or political parties or to make expenditures for activities expressly advocating the election or defeat of federal candidates.
this case does not involve regulation of candidates,parties,or corporations.rather,this case concerns the fec regulation of entities that are not connected to a candidate,party,or corporation.we thus must consider how the constitutional principles outlined above apply to in particular to three different kinds of i those that only make expenditures ii those that only make contributions to candidates or parties and iii those that do both.for purposes of the first amendment analysis,the central issue turns out to be whether independent are treated like individual citizens who under buckley have the right to spend unlimited money to support their preferred candidates or like political parties which under mcconnell do not have the right to raise and spend unlimited soft money 
the first relevant category of entities consists of those that only make expenditures for political activities such as advertisements,efforts,and voter registration drives.in this category make no contributions to federal candidates or parties.
the supreme court case law establishes that those nonprofit entities,like individual citizens,are constitutionally entitled to raise and spend unlimited money in support of candidates for elected the narrow exception that,under austin,the government may restrict to some degree how spend donations received from the general treasuries of corporations or unions.see cal.med.ass fec,d opinion of blackmun,see also fec.citizens for life,mcfl,d ncpac,at.citizens against rent control,at.buckley,at.right to life,leake,cir.
those principles were initially articulated in.there,justice blackmun determined that contributions to political committees can be limited only if those contributions implicate the governmental interest in preventing actual or potential corruption,and if the limitation is no broader than necessary to achieve that interest,at.opinion of blackmun.applying that standard,he found that contributions to a committee that makes only independent expenditures pose no such threat of actual or potential corruption.id.by pooling their resources,adherents of an association amplify their own voices the association is but the medium through which its individual members seek to make more effective the expression of their own views.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.justice blackmun thus concluded that government may not limit contributions to a that only makes expenditures 
the court reinforced those principles a year later in citizens against rent control.there,the court struck down limits on donations to a committee seeking to defeat a ballot measure.see citizens against rent control,at.building on the established right of individuals to make unlimited expenditures,the court stated that there are of course,some activities,legal if engaged in by one,yet illegal if performed in concert with others,but political expression is not one of them.id.at.the court further reasoned placing limits on contributions which in turn limit expenditures plainly impairs freedom of expression.id.at.in the court words,to place a spartan indeed any individuals wishing to band together to advance their views on a ballot measure,while placing none on individuals acting alone,is clearly a restraint on the right of association.id.at.
in ncpac,the court reiterated that the government may not limit the spending of.the court invalidated a law that restricted a group expenditures in support of a candidate who had accepted public financing.see ncpac,at.the court stated that citizens collective action in pooling their resources to amplify their voices is entitled to full first amendment protection id.at.
in mcfl,the court again underscored that advocacy groups are generally entitled to raise and spend unlimited money on elections.the court invalidated an expenditure limit imposed on a corporation that had distributed a newsletter promoting candidates.the court noted that individuals contribute to a political organization in part because they regard such a contribution as a more effective means of advocacy than spending the money under their own personal direction.mcfl,at.the court added that v oluntary political associations do not suddenly present the specter of corruption merely by assuming the corporate form.id.at.see also austin,at.kennedy,dissenting mcfl held that a nonprofit corporation engaged in political discussion of candidates and elections has the full protection of the first amendment.adhering to mcfl,the mcconnell court ruled that bcra ban on certain electioneering communications could not validly be applied to corporations.see mcconnell,at.
the principles set forth in,citizens against rent control,ncpac,and mcfl are rooted in the court consistent holdings beginning with buckley that individual citizens may spend money without limit apart from the limit on their own contributions to candidates or parties in support of the election of particular candidates.after all,if one person is constitutionally entitled to spend million to run advertisements supporting a candidate as buckley held,it logically follows that people are constitutionally entitled to donate each to a group that will run advertisements supporting a candidate put another way if the first amendment prohibits any limitation on how much money an independent political committee can spend on an campaign,how can it permit limits on donations to committees that make only independent expenditures richard briffault,the problem and the buckley problem,geo,see also edward foley,the major purpose test distinguishing between and groups,stating baseline proposition that it would be unconstitutional to limit the contributions that individuals may give to ideological groups to be used for electoral purposes note,the unconstitutionality of limitations on contributions to political committees in the federal election campaign act amendments,yale.
these supreme court decisions reflect,moreover,the commonsense proposition that regulation of does not fit within the rationale,which constitutes the sole basis for regulating campaign contributions and expenditures.see davis.at.as the court has explained the principle,mere donations to groups can not corrupt candidates and officeholders.in the words of the fourth circuit,it is implausible that contributions to independent expenditure political committees are corrupting.right to life,at internal quotation marks omitted.and to the extent a then spends its donations on activities such as advertisements,efforts,and voter registration drives,those expenditures are not considered corrupting,even though they may generate gratitude from and influence with officeholders and candidates.rather,under buckley,those expenditures are constitutionally protected.therefore,limiting donations to and spending by in order to prevent corruption of candidates and officeholders represents a kind of regulation to which the supreme court has emphatically stated,enough is enough.fec.right to life,wrtl,d controlling opinion of roberts.
writing for the fourth circuit,judge wilkinson recently summarized the relevant supreme court precedents,concluding that the court has never held that it is constitutional to apply contribution limits to political committees that make solely independent expenditures.right to life,at.those groups receive full first amendment protection and are entitled to receive donations and make expenditures because they offer an opportunity for ordinary citizens to band together to speak on the issue or issues most important to them.id.at.we agree with judge wilkinson assessment of the state of the law.
the second relevant category of consists of those that only make contributions to federal candidates or political parties and make no expenditures.given the constitutionally permissible caps on an individual donor contributions to candidates or parties,the supreme court has acknowledged the risk that individuals might use to evade those limits.in order to prevent circumvention of limits on an individual donor contributions to candidates and parties,the court has held that entities can be required to make their own contributions to candidates and parties,as well as pay associated administrative expenses,out of a account that is subject to source and amount restrictions.see,at.opinion of marshall,id.at.opinion of blackmun.as a majority of the court pointed out in,doing so prevents from being used as conduits for illegal contributions to parties and candidates and thus prevents evasion of the limitations on contributions to a candidate.id.at.opinion of blackmun,see also id.at.opinion of marshall,limit on donations to prevents evasion of limit on contributions to candidates by channeling funds through the cal.med.ass fec,cir kennedy,committee is natural conduit for candidate contributions and the essential purpose of the provision here in question is to limit those contributions,not to limit expenditures for any other type of political advocacy emphasis added 
consistent with ruling,feca limits contributors to donating a maximum of per year to a account.a in turn may contribute to a candidate or party only from that account.see a c.and an individual contribution to a account may count against the individual aggregate annual contribution limits.see a.
what about a entity that falls into both other words,a that makes expenditures and makes contributions to candidates or parties emily list is a good example of such a hybrid it makes expenditures for advertisements,efforts,and voter registration drives it also makes direct contributions to candidates and parties.in all of its activities,its mission is to promote and safeguard abortion rights and to support the election of democratic women to federal,state,and local offices nationwide.
the constitutional principles that govern such a hybrid entity follow ineluctably from the principles governing the other two categories of.to prevent circumvention of contribution limits by individual donors,entities may be required to make their own contributions to federal candidates and parties out of a is,an account subject to source and amount limitations annually per contributor.similarly,also may be compelled to use their accounts to pay an appropriately tailored share of administrative expenses associated with their contributions.see,at.opinion of marshall.but entities are entitled to make their as advertisements,efforts,and voter registration of a or general treasury account that is not subject to source and amount limits.stated another way a that makes expenditures to support federal candidates does not suddenly forfeit its first amendment rights when it decides also to make direct contributions to parties or candidates.rather,it simply must ensure,to avoid circumvention of individual contribution limits by its donors,that its contributions to parties or candidates come from a account 
how does mcconnell affect the above principles governing mcconnell upheld congressionally imposed limits on political parties receiving or spending soft money.some have argued that the government can similarly restrict contributions to and spending by nonprofits.in this case,the district court accepted that reasoning in ruling for the fec it found similarly situated to political parties for purposes of the first amendment analysis.
in our judgment,however,mcconnell does not support such regulation of.mcconnell affirmed bcra limits on contributions to political parties because of the close ties between candidates and parties and the extensive record evidence of what it deemed a threat of actual or apparent,the access to federal officials and candidates that large contributors to political parties received in exchange for their contributions.the court said that it was not unwarranted for congress to conclude that the selling of access gives rise to the appearance of corruption.mcconnell,at.the court expressly based its conclusion on the close relationship between federal officeholders and the national parties,as well as the means by which parties have traded on that relationship id 
unlike the political parties examined in mcconnell,there is no record evidence that entities have sold access to federal candidates and officeholders in exchange for large contributions.see also craig holman,the bipartisan campaign reform act limits and opportunities for groups in federal elections,today electioneering groups can make no such promises of access in exchange for a soft money contribution.
more fundamentally,groups do not have the same inherent relationship with federal candidates and officeholders that political parties do.the mcconnell court identified numerous differences between political parties and interest groups.at.interest groups do not select slates of candidates for elections.interest groups do not determine who will serve on legislative committees,elect congressional leadership,or organize legislative caucuses.political parties have influence and power in the legislature that vastly exceeds that of any interest group.as a result,it is hardly surprising that party affiliation is the primary way by which voters identify candidates,or that parties in turn have special access to and relationships with federal officeholders.id.as noted in mcconnell,congress recognized these differences and enacted a statutory scheme under which i nterest groups remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration,gotv activities,mailings,and advertising.id.at.
in sum,it will not work to simply transport mcconnell holding from the political party context to the setting.on this question as well,we agree with judge wilkinson it is not an exaggeration to say that mcconnell views political parties as different in kind than independent expenditure committees.right to life,at.
for entities,the most pertinent supreme court precedents remain buckley,citizens against rent control,ncpac,and mcfl.as discussed above,those cases ultimately stand for the proposition that groups may accept unlimited donations to their accounts.and subject to the one exception,individual spend unlimited amounts out of their accounts for activities such as advertisements,efforts,and voter registration drives 
we now consider whether the fec regulations at issue in this case comport with the relevant constitutional principles.they do not.
the fundamental flaw,as counsel for emily list succinctly stated at oral argument,is that the commission improperly brought to bear what was essentially a political party analysis to a,independent committee which is not under the control of,or associated with candidates in the fashion of a political party.tr.of oral arg.at.
the rules set forth in c,f,and contain five relevant provisions.in our judgment,the provisions are not closely drawn to meet an important governmental interest 
under the supreme court precedents,entities may be required to use their accounts for their own contributions to candidates and parties and for an appropriately tailored share of administrative expenses associated with such contributions.but as explained above,may not be forced to use their accounts for expenditures such as advertisements,efforts,and voter registration drives.individual entitled to spend and raise unlimited money for those activities.the fec five new regulatory provisions flout those principles.
first,the regulations require entities to use their accounts to pay at least of the costs of their generic efforts and voter registration activities.c.by generic,the regulations mean those activities that refer to a party but do not promote or oppose a particular candidate.see id.this provision violates the first amendment because are constitutionally entitled to pay of the costs of such voter drive activities out of their accounts.see cal.med.ass fec,d opinion of blackmun,see also fec.citizens for life,mcfl,d fec conservative pac ncpac,d citizens against rent control city of berkeley,d buckley valeo,d.
second,the regulations mandate that covered use their accounts for of any generic communications that refer to a party without referring to a candidate,for example,support the democratic party.c.this provision likewise violates the first amendment because are constitutionally entitled to pay of the costs of such communications out of their accounts.see,at.opinion of blackmun,see also mcfl,at.ncpac,at.citizens against rent control,at.buckley,at.
third,the regulations direct covered entities to use their accounts to pay at least of all administrative expenses.c.those administrative expenses include rent,utilities,office supplies,and salaries,among other costs.but a may be forced to use hard money for,at most,a percentage of administrative expenses that closely corresponds to the percentage of activities relating to its contributions as compared to its advertisements,efforts,and voter registration activities.see davis fec,d campaign finance regulations must at least be closely drawn to further an important governmental interest,at.opinion of marshall,rejecting argument that was entitled to pay its entire administrative expenses with unlimited donations or account emphasis added.the tailoring must ensure that a hybrid is not unduly advantaged as compared to a that makes only contributions and thus must fund certain administrative expenses with hard money and is not unduly disadvantaged as compared to a that makes only expenditures and thus may fund its administrative expenses with soft money.section c does not attempt or purport to allocate administrative expenses in that way.and the desire for a rule hardly constitutes the compelling state interest necessary to justify any infringement on first amendment freedom.fec.right to life,wrtl,d internal quotation marks omitted controlling opinion of roberts.
fourth,the regulations compel covered entities to use their accounts to pay of the costs of advertisements or other communications that refer to a federal candidate.f.if an advertisement or communication refers to a state candidate as well as a federal candidate,the must pay for it with a percentage of its account as determined by time and space allocation.see id.f.here again,the problem is that are constitutionally entitled to pay of the costs of their advertisements and other communications out of a account.see mcfl,at.ncpac,at.citizens against rent control,at,at.opinion of blackmun,buckley,at.
fifth,the regulations create a new regime for solicitations indicating that donated funds will be used to support or oppose the election of a clearly identified federal candidate.the regulations require that donations in response to such solicitations be treated as hard money.id.a b.this means that donations in response to such solicitations are subject to a cap.if a solicitation also refers to a state or local candidate,at least of the responsive donations must go to the account.id.b.this provision is badly flawed.are entitled to raise money for their accounts to help support their preferred candidates,yet this regulation prohibits from saying as much in their solicitations.such notions run afoul of the fundamental rule of protection under the first amendment,that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.wrtl,at.internal quotation marks omitted davis.at provision that requires choice between unfettered political speech and discriminatory fundraising limitations violates first amendment.
in short,the new fec regulations do not pass muster under the supreme court first amendment precedents.the regulations are not closely drawn to serve a cognizable anticorruption interest.see davis.at wrtl,at.ncpac,at.citizens against rent control,at.buckley,at.donations to and spending by a can not corrupt a candidate or officeholder,at least in the absence of some evidence establishing such corruption or the appearance thereof.see right to life,leake,cir see also richard briffault,the problem and the buckley problem,geo,the do not fit easily within buckley anticorruption paradigm,at least as the supreme court has defined corruption until now.gregg polsky charles,regulating section organizations,geo.
of course,the fact that the regulations do not serve a cognizable interest is not surprising because the decision to more tightly regulate entities like emily list arose out of an entirely different concern the influence of that raise and spend large amounts of money and thereby affect federal elections.see,comments of democracy,campaign legal center center for responsive politics in response to notice of proposed rulemaking,at,criticizing the spending of tens of millions of dollars of soft money explicitly for the purpose of influencing the presidential election by section groups.responding to such complaints,the fec adopted these new regulations to tamp down spending by and thereby better equalize the voices of citizens and groups who participate in the political process.large donations to and spending by prompted these regulations,and limiting expenditures is their intended and predictable effect.
but the supreme court first amendment cases have repeatedly repudiated this equalization rationale as a basis for regulating contributions or expenditures.see davis.at buckley,at.under current law,therefore,these regulations are unsupportable.the concern with large individual donations to the is that they permit a tiny group of wealthiest to play an enormous role in the electoral process buckley,however,rejected the protection of political equality as a basis for limiting the role of money in election campaigns.briffault,geo.at internal quotation marks omitted.
as a lower court,we must strictly adhere to the supreme court precedents.the regulations contravene the first amendment as it has been interpreted thus far by the supreme court 
as some commentators point out,it might seem incongruous to permit to receive and spend large donations when political parties and candidates can not.see samuel issacharoff pamela karlan,the hydraulics of campaign finance reform.but this perceived anomaly has existed to some extent since buckley,which recognized that contribution limitations alone would not reduce the greater potential voice of affluent persons and groups,who would remain free to spend unlimited sums directly to promote candidates and policies they favor in an effort to persuade voters.buckley,at.and mcconnell similarly took note of the fact that,even after that decision upholding regulations on contributions to parties,i nterest groups remain free to raise soft money to fund voter registration,gotv activities,mailings,and advertisements.mcconnell fec,d.
if eliminating this perceived asymmetry is deemed necessary,the constitutionally permitted legislative solution,as the court stated in an analogous situation in davis,is to raise or eliminate limits on contributions to parties or candidates.at.but it is not permissible,at least under current supreme court precedents,to remove the incongruity by placing these limits on spending by or donations to.
in addition to its first amendment challenge to the five regulatory provisions,emily list alternatively contends that three of the five provisions exceed the fec statutory authority.see c agency may not act in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or short of statutory right.we agree.
when enacting bcra in,congress did not authorize the fec to restrict donations to or spending by though congress was aware that bcra restrictions on political parties meant that independent groups would become more influential in the electoral process.indeed,senator lieberman,speaking in the senate at the time,anticipated that at least some of the soft money donors who will no longer be able to give to political parties will be looking for other ways to influence our elections.donations to groups will probably top many of their lists.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of lieberman.he was right.yet in the seven years since bcra was enacted,congress still has not imposed limits on,apparently because of continuing constitutional and policy concerns about regulating them in such a manner.
the statutory question,therefore,is whether the fec authority under the federal election campaign act justifies the challenged regulations.
under feca,the fec authority extends only to regulating donations and expenditures made for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office.a i.as the supreme court has explained,d onations made solely for the purpose of influencing state or local elections are therefore unaffected by feca requirements and prohibitions.mcconnell fec,d.
under feca,in other words,the fec possesses statutory authority to require a to use its account to pay for federal activities,generic activities,and mixed activities.see id.at.but the fec exceeds its statutory authority when it requires to use hard money for exclusively state and local election activities.see id.at.chevron usa,natural res.def.council,d step one.
the three regulatory provisions that emily list challenges under feca cross the statute boundaries.
emily list targets one of the provisions in c as exceeding the fec statutory,the part requiring covered to use their accounts to pay for of their administrative expenses.this requirement applies even if more than of a nonprofit administrative expenses are exclusively associated with state and local elections.that poses a problem because the fec possesses no authority under feca to require nonprofits to use their accounts for their exclusively state and local election activities.we thus concur with emily list that this provision is overbroad and federalizes the funding and reporting of a large portion of such a committee nonfederal receipts and disbursements,which are not made for the purpose of influencing federal elections.emily list br.at 
next,emily list argues that f exceeds the fec statutory authority.recall that this provision requires covered to use hard money for all or part of their public communications that merely refer to federal candidates.see f.the fec runs roughshod over the limits on its statutory authority when it presumes that any public communications that merely refer to a federal candidate necessarily seek to influence a federal election 
for example,f would compel a covered nonprofit to use some hard money to pay for an advertisement running only in california in which senator jones from maine endorses candidate smith for governor of california.the sole purpose of such an advertisement is to influence the state election in matter entirely outside the fec statutory authority.
an incident illustrating f statutory flaws occurred in.emily list sought to run advertisements featuring senator stabenow in order to support democratic women candidates for state legislative offices.at the time,senator stabenow was a candidate for reelection to the senate in michigan.emily list represented that the communication would not be distributed in michigan,would not reference senator stabenow federal candidacy,would not solicit funds for her federal candidacy,and would not refer to any clearly identified candidate.rather,it would support democratic women candidates as a class.nonetheless,the fec determined that the mere reference to senator stabenow meant that emily list had to pay for the communications with hard money.see fec,at.
finally,emily list argues that the solicitation rule set forth in also exceeds the fec statutory power.we agree.to reiterate,requires covered to treat as contributions all funds given in response to solicitations indicating that any portion of the funds received will be used to support or oppose the election of a federal candidate.a b emphasis added.if the communication indicates that the funds will support or oppose both a federal and candidate,then at least of those funds must be treated as hard money.see id.b.the statutory defect in the rule is that,depending on the particular solicitation at issue,it requires covered to treat as hard money certain donations that are not actually made for the purpose of influencing federal elections.
consider a fundraising pitch in which a such as emily list tells donors that only of their gift will be used to support identified federal candidates,with the rest to exclusively support state and local candidates.each donor fully and correctly understands that only a small portion of his or her gift will be used for the purpose of influencing federal elections.and yet,requires that at least of donations in response to such a solicitation be classified as a donation subject to the simultaneously creating a separate cap on donations given in response to such a solicitation.this may require a to decline or return funds it receives for purely state and local elections.that is not permissible under feca.
in short,there is a significant mismatch between these challenged provisions and the fec authority under feca.therefore,we conclude that f and,as well as the provision in c that applies to administrative expenses,exceed the fec statutory authority 
before concluding,we add a few words regarding the concurring opinion.
to begin,it is important to emphasize the area of agreement between the opinion of the court and the concurrence.all three judges on the panel have determined that c,f,and are unlawful and must be vacated.
the concurrence advances two main points i that under mcconnell,the federal government constitutionally may regulate like political parties and ii that we should not address the first amendment issue in this case.neither argument is convincing.
first,the concurrence contends that regulation of political parties is not mcconnell theme,and it reads mcconnell to support regulation not only of political parties but also of independent groups.concurring op.at.as we have explained at length above,we do not find that a persuasive interpretation of mcconnell.in upholding title i of bcra,the mcconnell court relied heavily on the unity of interest,close relationship,and close ties among candidates,officeholders,and political parties.the concurrence identifies no similar unity of interest between,on the one hand,and candidates,officeholders,or parties on the other.the mcconnell court also based its decision on the substantial record evidence of parties selling access in exchange for contributions.the court repeatedly emphasized that congress must show concrete evidence that a particular type of financial transaction is corrupting or gives rise to the appearance of corruption it has done so here.mcconnell,at.the concurrence cites no similar record evidence showing that sell access to officeholders and candidates in exchange for large contributions.
in our judgment,mcconnell views political parties as different in kind than independent expenditure committees.right to life leake,cir.we therefore disagree with the concurrence attempt to stretch mcconnell reasoning from political parties to nonprofits 
relatedly,the concurrence disputes our reading of.see concurring op.at.but our analysis of that case,including our reliance on justice blackmun opinion,tracks the persuasive reasoning of the fourth circuit in north carolina right to life,of several other courts,and of numerous commentators.see,right to life,at see also,comm.on jobs candidate advocacy fund herrera,no.c,wl.state republican party.state pub.disclosure comm n,richard briffault,the problem and the buckley problem,geo,john eastman,strictly scrutinizing campaign finance restrictions and the courts that judge them,cath.re,gregg polsky charles,regulating section organizations,geo.moreover,the concurrence does not substantively address the several cases that similarly recognize the right of to raise and spend money to support their agendas and preferred candidates.see,fec.citizens for life,mcfl,d fec conservative pac ncpac,d citizens against rent control city of berkeley,d.
the concurrence further contends that we have not received briefing on the constitutional issue.we again respectfully disagree.the briefs and oral argument focused first and most extensively on the first amendment and debated the key question in this case for first amendment purposes,are more like individual citizens who under buckley have the right to spend unlimited money to support their preferred candidates or more like political parties which under mcconnell do not see buckley valeo,d see also mcconnell,at.moreover,was cited and discussed often in the briefs and at oral argument.see tr.of oral arg,fec br.at,amicus br.at,emily list reply br.at.indeed,the fec brief noted that was a case chiefly relied upon.fec br.at iv.in short,the briefs and oral argument focused on and grappled with the critical issues posed by the first amendment challenge.
the concurrence suggests,however,that our holding goes further than the submission of emily list.but emily list forcefully argued that these regulations violate the first amendment of the united states constitution,contended that mcconnell and do not support the fec approach,and asked the court to vacate the new regulations in their entirety.emily list br.at.in deciding this case,we have set forth the relevant constitutional principles as we discern them,and we then have applied those principles to the challenged regulations.in so doing,we have concluded that the regulations violate the first amendment we therefore have vacated the regulations,which is precisely the relief emily list sought in advancing its first amendment claims.
second,apart from its substantive disagreement with our first amendment analysis,the concurrence states that we should resolve this case on statutory grounds alone,and claims that it is gratuitous for us to address the first amendment.we respectfully but firmly disagree.
the threshold problem with the concurrence preferred approach is that emily list raises a statutory challenge to only three of the five provisions at issue here.emily list does not advance a statutory challenge to the provision in c requiring that covered use their federal or accounts to pay for at least of their generic and voter registration activities.nor does emily list raise a statutory challenge to the provision in c requiring that covered nonprofits use hard money to pay for at least of their generic communications.compare emily list br.at discussing only administrative expenses provision of c in statutory section of brief with emily list br.at raising constitutional challenges to all provisions of c.indeed,footnote of emily list brief all but concedes that,under the statute,the fec may require use of hard money for these generic activities.
emily list decision not to target these two provisions of c on statutory grounds appears wise.such an argument would be very difficult to square with mcconnell several pointed statements that feca permits the fec to treat generic activities as entirely federal for purposes of contribution and expenditure limits.in fact,mcconnell harshly criticized the fec for not having previously treated political parties generic activities as entirely federal activities subject to feca limits.see mcconnell,at.by allowing generic activities to be funded largely with soft money,fec allocation regime subverted original feca scheme id.at.feca scheme eroded by fec allocation regime see also id.at.
under the circumstances,we have no choice but to address emily list first amendment argument.the concurrence apparently wants us to address a statutory argument that emily list did not raise and then to accept that statutory claim even though we find it unpersuasive and inconsistent with precedent.we respectfully decline the concurrence proposal 
the fec rules challenged by emily list c,f,and the first amendment.sections f and also exceed the fec authority under the federal election campaign act,as does the provision of c that applies to administrative expenses.the fec may not enforce c,f,or.we reverse the judgment of the district court and direct it to enter judgment for emily list and to vacate the challenged regulations.
so ordered.
if there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication,it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality unless such adjudication is unavoidable.spector motor serv.mclaughlin.thus,if a case can be decided on either of two grounds,one involving a constitutional question,the other a question of statutory construction or general law,the court will decide only the latter.ashwander tva.brandeis,concurring.because these regulations must be vacated as contrary to the statute,we need not and should not reach the first amendment issue.but if we going to answer an unnecessary constitutional question,we at least ought to get it right.in light of mcconnell fec,d,i have grave doubts about the court analysis,which bears at most a passing resemblance to the parties briefs,and which will profoundly affect campaign finance law in this circuit.i thus respectfully concur only with part iv of the court opinion,except for footnotes,and.
though i do not join their first amendment holding,i agree with my colleagues conclusion that we must vacate the regulations challenged here the multiple candidate allocation regulation,f the solicitation regulation,and the administrative costs allocation regulation,c.i begin with first principles.the federal election commission fec is an agency within the executive branch.the executive branch can not make law,but instead executes laws enacted by the legislative branch.in executing the law,the fec may issue necessary rules,a,but,as with all agencies,the fec acts contrary to law if it promulgates regulations in excess of its statutory jurisdiction,c.see also.pub.serv.comm fcc,d a n agency literally has no power to act unless and until congress confers power upon it.
by the plain language of the federal election campaign act feca,the fec lacks the power it now asserts.to fall within fec jurisdiction,a gift,subscription,loan,advance,or deposit of money or anything of value must be provided to a political committee for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office,a i,and any money expended by such a committee must also have been done for that same purpose,id.a i.there is no other reasonable way to read congress words.for the fec to have any role,money must be used for the purpose defined as an objective,goal,or end,black law dictionary ed of influencing an election for federal office.the inescapable corollary is the fec has no authority over money given or spent solely for the purpose of influencing state or local elections,an activity unaffected by feca requirements and prohibitions.mcconnell,at.
here,the fec has set aside congress command that the agency jurisdiction be bounded by the purpose for which money is spent.instead of strictly minding this jurisdictional marker,the fec conclusively presumes a federal purpose drives any spending that might influence a federal election the question though is not whether spending influences a federal election,but whether it was spent for that reason.otherwise,the word purpose becomes superfluous,a result that this court can not accept,reiter sonotone,d,especially for a jurisdictional provision like this one,see,am.van lines,nlrb.under feca,federal effects are simply not enough 
nor does labeling spending that may affect both state and federal elections as somehow solve the fec problem.regulating on the basis of such a label still assumes there must be a federal purpose behind any spending that might influence,even tangentially,a federal campaign.because that necessary assumption is false,these regulations remain invalid.only after a federal or identified does the fec power come into play.if a federal purpose can be shown,then allocation ratios like those promulgated here may well be appropriate under feca,but just asserting that there must be a federal purpose skips the threshold jurisdictional question 
these regulations give short shrift to the purpose of spending and so must be vacated.indeed,we have already rejected the fec view.just fours years ago,in shays fec,we held feca requires that to qualify as expenditure in the first place,spending must be undertaken for the purpose of influencing a federal election and agreed with the fec that time,place,and content may be critical indicia of communicative purpose.though a federal 
intent is obvious in statements urging voters to elect or defeat a specified candidate or party,the same may not be true of ads identifying a federal politician but focusing on pending proposed budget,for example,or government reform appearing three years before the next election.nor is such purpose necessarily evident in statements referring,say,to a connecticut senator but running only in san francisco media markets.
shays confirms what feca says context matters.referencing a federal candidate may reveal a federal purpose,but if an ad will not be aired to her constituents or if it will run years before the next election,then absent some persuasive indicia of a federal purpose,a reference by itself to the candidate does not trigger fec jurisdiction.this was the fec position in shays,and it should be the fec position now.feca unambiguous text requires no less.
under the multiple candidate allocation regulation,political committees must use hard money for p ublic communications that refer to one or more clearly identified federal candidates,regardless of whether there is reference to a political party,but do not refer to any clearly identified candidates.f.the rule is categorical.even if a communication only says vote no on state ballot initiative waste enough taxes in washington,merely referring perhaps by means of a montage of grainy photos to united states senators of both parties with a penchant for spending,the ad is per se deemed to have a federal purpose.this is true even if those big spenders hail from distant states,are not up for reelection for years,and the spot will not be shown anywhere near their voters.whether such an ad could affect a federal race is doubtful,but the fec goes further and says these ads always reflect a federal purpose.in an age when even pizza shops and dealers invoke the stereotype of wasteful federal spending to sell their wares,the fec lack of sophistication is startling.
the fec approach also ignores that a state campaign may be more effective if the campaigning group can mention a federal official endorsement.many federal politicians are of national stature,particularly those associated with hot button political issues.if,for example,a referendum would make it more difficult to get an abortion,a group may trumpet a statement denouncing it from a prominent united states senator,while a group may respond with a statement from an equally prominent senator.to say,as the fec does,that citing these statements can only be done for the purpose of influencing federal elections is to pretend away the power of celebrity.just as michael fox name might be used in commercials for a stem cell amendment because his association makes for effective politics,see alfonso serrano,stem cell opponents to air celebrity ad.shtml,an and senator debbie stabenow endorsement might be used to support state candidates because her association makes for effective state politics,particularly to targeted demographics 
the solicitation regulation respects congress language no better.the regulation declares any donation made by any person in response to any communication is a contribution to the person making the communication if the communication indicates that any portion of the funds received will be used to support or oppose the election of a clearly identified federal candidate.a.this rule applies even if a solicitation banner headline says only a certain percentage of the donation will be used for federal activities.hence,even if someone gives in response to a solicitation that unambiguously says of what is received will be spent on local elections,the fec asserts jurisdiction over the entire gift.if a gift is made subject to this disclaimer,how is the full given for the purpose of influencing a federal election 
the solicitation regulation also says i f the solicitation does not refer to any clearly identified candidates,but does refer to a political party,in addition to a clearly identified federal candidate,then the entire gift becomes subject to the fec authority,id.b,and i f the solicitation refers to one or more clearly identified candidates,in addition to a clearly identified federal candidate,at least fifty percent of the total funds received are contributions subject to the fec,whether or not the solicitation refers to a political party,id.b.even if the solicitation is unmistakable that the entire gift will be spent on local elections,the fec nonetheless still claims jurisdiction over at least some of the resulting donations.
this line suffers from the same flaw as the multiple candidate allocation regulation it assumes merely referencing a federal candidate always unmasks a purpose of influencing a federal election and assumes those who give money in response to such a solicitation also unfailingly do so for the same purpose.that just not true.instead,a federal politician name can be used for reasons tied solely to state electioneering.again,consider an and senator stabenow.if she were to say emily list supported a democrat like me when i was running for state office,and i asking you to support emily list now so it can continue to work on behalf of women who are seeking state office,then under the solicitation regulation,the entire amount of any donations is subject to the fec that result conflicts with congress purpose requirement.
finally,the administrative costs allocation regulation is contrary to law.under c,committees must use at least percent federal funds for administrative expenses,costs of generic voter drives,and costs of public communications that refer to any political party.an obvious problem is this rule applies in years when there are no federal elections.if later this november emily list were to say vote a straight democratic ticket for the city counsel in a broadcast in walla walla,washington,no less than half of the cost would have to be expensed to a federal account,even though there is no federal race to influence.the fec is explicit if a communication mentions a political party,then context is irrelevant.see fec advisory,at,the duty to pay the costs of public communications that refer to a political party with at least percent federal funds does not change based on the activities of the committee in the particular state.
contrary to this regulation premise,moreover,certain administrative expenses do not always reflect a federal purpose,mixed or otherwise.a committee,for example,that opposes human cloning and thus supports many different state and federal candidates and laws throughout the nation may launch an outpost in a state that is considering an measure and organize a voter drive there even though the group has no intention of participating in any federal election.by this regulation,a full half of the costs must be expensed to the committee federal account.in fact,the fec would require the committee to use hard money for a leaflet that says both democrats and republicans endorse the initiative.such a leaflet is not generic party advertising,mcconnell,at.it is an ad for a state ballot initiative,not a political party,and it defies reason to say otherwise feca does not require this absurdity.
the court says emily list has waived part of its statutory claim.first,my colleagues concede emily list has challenged every other subpart of these regulations,and agree the fec has exceeded its statutory powers,but say because emily list only mentions administrative expenses in one section of its brief,it waives its argument about costs of generic voter drives and costs of public communications that refer to any political party.c.this is so even though the clauses are in the exact same sentence of the exact same regulation,and even though they violate the exact same section of feca for the exact same reason.this is perplexing.emily list comprehensively says n or are the regulations permitted by feca.feca was passed to regulate contributions and expenditures made with the purpose of influencing any election for federal office.emily list br.at emphasis added.and if there is any doubt,emily list opens its reply brief by saying t he regulations at issue in this case violate the first amendment,chevron,and the administrative procedure act.emily list reply br.at emphasis added.emily list also contends c requires using hard money for ads that state both democrats and republicans support a measure.id.at.it goes without saying that emily list never argues the regulations all violate feca,except for the second and third clauses in the second sentence of c.
second and even more perplexingly,in order to buttress its waiver argument,the same judges that read mcconnell narrowly as a case that views political parties as different in kind than independent expenditure committees,op.at,concludes emily list could not have successfully challenged c regulation of generic activities on statutory grounds because mcconnell specifically approved regulation of contribution and expenditure limits for these funds.id.at.if this were correct,it would mean the fec can constitutionally regulate a committee like emily list,and the court constitutional analysis is critically undermined.
no one disputes the fec can craft rules.an objective test,orloski fec,in fact,may be constitutionally required,see fec.right to life,d opinion of roberts.communications calling for the election or defeat of federal candidates certainly fall within the agency authority,and the fec may have a bit more leeway to regulate ads directed at federal electorates or aired during federal elections.shays,at.feca unambiguous text,however,forbids the commission from doing what it has done here promulgating proxies for purpose that wholly ignore all relevant contextual clues.the regulations consequently must be vacated as contrary to congressional will.
because this case can be decided on statutory grounds,we need not reach the constitutional question,and so should not reach the constitutional question.our precedent is not federal courts should not decide constitutional questions unless it is necessary to do so.before reaching a constitutional question,a federal court should therefore consider whether there is a nonconstitutional ground for deciding the case,and if there is,dispose of the case on that ground.kalka hawk.see also meredith fcc,united states thomas,ginsburg,concurring in part.my colleagues duck this rule,preferring to summon the awesome power of marbury madison.but in their eagerness to play john marshall,they do not follow him.the great chief justice himself cautioned no questions can be brought before a judicial tribunal of greater delicacy than those which involve the constitutionality of a legislative act.if they become indispensably necessary to the case,the court must meet and decide them,but if not,a just respect for the legislature requires,that the obligation of its laws should not be unnecessarily and wantonly assailed.ex parte randolph,cas.
the reasons to be keenly mindful of our institutional role and fully appreciate the solemnity of constitutional adjudication are obvious.nw.austin mun.util.dist.no.one holder,d.meekness,for one,compels us to recognize we are not the constitution only branch swears an oath to uphold it.see const.art.ii,cl.rostker goldberg,d.and if we misread a statute,congress can fix it not so with the constitution.
the court,however,is not content just answering a gratuitous constitutional question.its holding is broader than even the plaintiff requests.instead of arguing nonprofits have a constitutional right to pay for ads attacking federal candidates with soft money,emily list more modestly challenges the regulations as the functional equivalent of spending limits,prohibiting emily list from supporting state and local candidates in certain ways when its federal funds are exhausted and claims they are not properly tailored because they restrict vast amounts of nonfederal activity.emily list br.at summary of argument emphasis added.the court holds,nonetheless,that emily list is constitutionally entitled to pay of the costs of its advertisements out of a account,even for ads that attack or promote federal candidates.op.at 
because emily list actual claims are not bold enough,the court sua sponte spins a more aggressive its waiver charge all the more curious.nowhere does any party refer to justice blackmun separate opinion in california medical association fec,d.nor does emily list mention fec national conservative pac,d ncpac,fec massachusetts citizens for life,d mcfl,or north carolina right to life,leake,cir in other words,the cases upon which the court holding depends,see,op.at,none of the law review articles the court relies on are less and far from hashing out mcconnell footnote,id.at,neither party mentions it.the court today issues an expansive constitutional decision without the benefit of briefing.before deciding a complicated first amendment issue,we ought to ask for the parties views.
in attempting to connect its decision to the parties views,the court artfully the key question in this case,describing it as whether are more like individual citizens who under buckley have the right to spend unlimited money or more like political parties which under mcconnell do not.op.at.the court notes was cited and discussed often in the briefs and at oral argument.id.at.was cited and discussed by the parties,but never to support the proposition for which the court now relies on it.for instance,when asked by the court to respond to the fec reliance on,counsel for emily list offered this succinct critique of the court holding 
the court can you deal with fec counsel response on 
emily list yes.i mean,cal med is mysteriously produced here for the fec position.cal med did raise any of the issues in this case.cal med was a simple question of whether a committee that was making contributions to federal candidates had to observe a limit on contributions made to that federal program.that set a law now,that certainly what emily list does.i do think it bears at all on this invasion of our state and local programs through the promulgation of these excessive federal regulatory schemes.
tr.of oral arg.at.how true.
but even if it were judicially proper for me to do so,and even if the issues were briefed,i doubt i could join the court opinion in full.this is not because i dislike its outcome.indeed,i agree with what seems to be the unstated premise if the supreme court cases made any sense,the first amendment would protect much more than pornography,profanity,and pyrotechnics.see united states playboy entm t group,d cohen california,d texas johnson,d.the amendment purpose,after all,is to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail,fcc league of women voters,d a principle that has its fullest and most urgent application to speech uttered during a campaign for political office,eu county democratic cent,d.if those beautifully fierce words congress shall make no law are to do anything but condemn our constitutionalism as a failed experiment,then at least political speech in all its forms should be free of government constraint.
my colleagues distaste for the fec handiwork is to their credit.it shows they take the first amendment seriously.and they are right,of course,that if constitutional law were better acquainted with the constitution,regulations such as these would never survive article iii scrutiny.if an advertisement criticizes the president of the united states,the speaker of the house of representatives,or the chair of the senate committee on foreign relations,it can be a felony punishable by up to five years in prison to pay for that ad using money the federal government does know about or that comes from sources the federal government deems to have already given enough.see d.the first amendment,logically construed,can not condone such a weighty burden on political speech at the same time it forbids penalizing the production of virtual child pornography,ashcroft free speech,d.
i also agree with the court that corruption should only be understood in terms of quid pro a unease about money in politics.once corruption is disconnected from pay to play,congress has carte blanche to stifle speech,a license that is particularly pernicious as our overweening government ever enlarges itself.what generates passion in politics.money only measures its depth.the more power is at stake,the more money will be used to shield,deflect,or it.so long as the government can take and redistribute a man livelihood,there will always be money in politics.one man corruption is another man political accountability.
but there is a rub.we sit on a lower court and must follow the binding supreme court precedent until the court itself overrules it.we the people,united states.though we do not read the court above precedent unduly expansively,we also do not drag our feet it is not our role to fight a rearguard action against the logical implications of the court cases.united states gardellini.instead,we take its holdings as we find them,applying them to cover all they fairly address.stare decisis means nothing if we only are bound by those cases with which we already agree.like it or not,we can not ignore supreme court precedent.
modesty is dictated by the difficulty of applying mcconnell facial generalizations to real world events.it is hard to say exactly how contribution limits on hybrid committees,like emily list,should be analyzed after mcconnell.mcconnell involved a facial challenge addressing the constitutionality of bcra.trying to extrapolate from that case to this one is risky and reason enough to avoid the constitutional bog.suffice it to say that the supreme court majority,the dissenters,and the commentators all have read mcconnell as a maximalist opinion.see at.o ur decisions in buckley and mcfl were specific to the statutory language before us they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating speech.id.at.scalia,dissenting we have witnessed merely the second scene of act i of what promises to be a lengthy tragedy.id.at.thomas,dissenting t he court today upholds what can only be described as the most significant abridgment of the freedoms of speech and association since the civil war.id.at.kennedy,dissenting this new definition of corruption sweeps away all protections for speech that lie in its path.id.at.rehnquist,dissenting today decision,by not requiring tailored restrictions,has significantly reduced the protection for political speech having little or nothing to do with corruption or the appearance of corruption.see also richard briffault,the problem and the buckley problem,geo,mcconnell,however,transformed the constitutional landscape.
in both holding and discussion,the mcconnell court sided with the censor,going so far as to rely on theoretical anticipation to uphold a speech restriction,see at.upholding bcra f,which forbids state and local officeholders and candidates from using soft money to support or attack federal candidates,based on the eminently reasonable prediction that state and local candidates and officeholders will become the next conduits for the funding of sham issue advertising,and ending with an invitation for even more congressional action,id.at.we are under no illusion that bcra will be the last congressional statement on the matter.this is not the modus operandi of a tentative tribunal the court knew what it was doing,and said so.after mcconnell,if these regulations are within the fec statutory power,then there is no obvious reason they facially violate the first amendment 
it is true mcconnell upheld,against an equal protection challenge,a provision of bcra regulating political parties.but regulation of political parties is not mcconnell theme.the court broadly recognized and deferred to governmental interests in preventing corruption,the appearance of corruption,and circumvention of election regulations.mcconnell,at.arguably,this expansive rationale is broad enough to encompass some limits on independent expenditure committees,particularly for those political committees with a electoral mission.see briffault,geo.at hasen.at.emily list is a multicandidate political committee that has as its primary purpose electing ideologically compatible candidates,emily list br.at as such,it supports democratic candidates for federal office.see matthew stannard,cash is key for tauscher replacement,at,available at wlnr noting that a candidate in a federal primary race has touted the endorsement of emily list,a national fundraising organization that supported former representative ellen tauscher and backs democratic women who support abortion rights.thus,emily list is much more like a political party than the sierra club or the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals.
whether,under the high court current precedents,emily list could be regulated exactly like a political party is unknown.that it should not be regulated more harshly than a political party seems to be the committee complaint with the fec regulations challenged in this court.emily list br.at bizarrely,the regulation also treats nonparty pacs more harshly than any other type of committee,save national parties and candidates themselves.my point is not that mcconnell mandates such treatment only that nothing in the opinion logic clearly precludes it.the court does not think this is a persuasive interpretation of mcconnell.op.at.perhaps the court is right.but reading the case,as the court does,to sanction first amendment immunity for all nonprofits seems even more implausible.
precedent holds allocation and solicitation rules are contribution limits.this is key,as such limits receive less than strict scrutiny,given they entail only a marginal restriction upon the contributor ability to engage in free communication.mcconnell,at.quoting buckley,at.the overall effect of dollar limits on contributions is also merely to require candidates and political committees to raise funds from a greater number of persons.id.at.quoting buckley,at.unlike strict scrutiny,which requires narrow tailoring to serve compelling governmental interests,a contribution limit is valid if it satis
