the arizona citizens clean elections act created a public financing system to fund the primary and general election campaigns of candidates for state office.candidates who opt to participate,and who accept certain campaign restrictions and obligations,are granted an initial outlay of public funds to conduct their campaign.they are also granted additional matching funds if a privately financed candidate expenditures,combined with the expenditures of independent groups made in support of the privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly financed candidate,exceed the publicly financed candidate initial state allotment.once matching funds are triggered,a publicly financed candidate receives roughly one dollar for every dollar raised or spent by the privately financed candidate including any money of his own that a privately financed candidate spends on his campaign and for every dollar spent by independent groups that support the privately financed candidate.when there are multiple publicly financed candidates in a race,each one receives matching funds as a result of the spending of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.matching funds top out at two times the initial grant to the publicly financed candidate.
petitioners,past and future arizona candidates and two independent expenditure groups that spend money to support and oppose arizona candidates,challenged the constitutionality of the matching funds provision,arguing that it unconstitutionally penalizes their speech and burdens their ability to fully exercise their first amendment rights.the district court entered a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the matching funds provision.the ninth circuit reversed,concluding that the provision imposed only a minimal burden and that the burden was justified by arizona interest in reducing quid pro quo political corruption.
held arizona matching funds scheme substantially burdens political speech and is not sufficiently justified by a compelling interest to survive first amendment scrutiny.
a the matching funds provision imposes a substantial burden on the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.
petitioners contend that their political speech is substantially burdened in the same way that speech was burdened by the millionaire amendment of the bipartisan campaign reform act of,which was invalidated in davis federal election comm n.that law which permitted the opponent of a candidate who spent over of his personal funds to collect triple the normal contribution amount,while the candidate who spent the personal funds remained subject to the original contribution cap unconstitutionally forced a candidate to choose between the first amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations.at.this unprecedented penalty impose d a substantial burden on the exercise of the first amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech that was not justified by a compelling government interest,at.
the logic of davis largely controls here.once a privately financed candidate has raised or spent more than the state initial grant to a publicly financed candidate,each personal dollar the privately financed candidate spends results in an award of almost one additional dollar to his opponent.the privately financed candidate must shoulder a special and potentially significant burden when choosing to exercise his first amendment right to spend funds on his own candidacy,at.if the law at issue in davis imposed a burden on candidate speech,the arizona law unquestionably does so as well.
the differences between the matching funds provision and the law struck down in davis make the arizona law more constitutionally problematic,not less.first,the penalty in davis consisted of raising the contribution limits for one candidate,who would still have to raise the additional funds.here,the direct and automatic release of public money to a publicly financed candidate imposes a far heavier burden.second,in elections where there are multiple publicly financed candidates a frequent occurrence in arizona the matching funds provision can create a multiplier effect.each dollar spent by the privately funded candidate results in an additional dollar of funding to each of that candidate publicly financed opponents.third,unlike the law in davis,all of this is to some extent out of the privately financed candidate hands.spending by independent expenditure groups to promote a privately financed candidate election triggers matching funds,regardless whether such support is welcome or helpful.those funds go directly to the publicly funded candidate to use as he sees fit.that disparity in control giving money directly to a publicly financed candidate,in response to independent expenditures that can not be coordinated with the privately funded candidate is a substantial advantage for the publicly funded candidate.
the burdens that matching funds impose on independent expenditure groups are akin to those imposed on the privately financed candidates themselves.the more money spent on behalf of a privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly funded candidate,the more money the publicly funded candidate receives from the state.the effect of a dollar spent on election speech is a guaranteed financial payout to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes,and spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars to multiple candidates.in some ways,the burdens imposed on independent groups by matching funds are more severe than the burdens imposed on privately financed candidates.independent groups,of course,are not eligible for public financing.as a result,those groups can only avoid matching funds by changing their message or choosing not to speak altogether.presenting independent expenditure groups with such a choice trigger matching funds,change your message,or do not speak makes the matching funds provision particularly burdensome to those groups and certainly contravenes the fundamental rule of protection under the first amendment,that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston.
the arguments of arizona,the clean elections institute,and amicus united states attempting to explain away the existence or significance of any burden imposed by matching funds are unpersuasive.
arizona correctly points out that its law is different from the law invalidated in davis,but there is no doubt that the burden on speech is significantly greater here than in davis.arizona argues that the provision actually creates more speech.but even if that were the case,only the speech of publicly financed candidates is increased by the state law.and burdening the speech of some here privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups to increase the speech of others is a concept wholly foreign to the first amendment,buckley valeo,miami herald publishing tornillo.that no candidate or group is forced to express a particular message does not mean that the matching funds provision does not burden their speech,especially since the direct result of that speech is a monetary subsidy to a political rival.and precedents upholding government subsidies against first amendment challenge provide no support for matching funds none of the subsidies at issue in those cases were granted in response to the speech of another.
the burden on privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups also can not be analogized to the burden placed on speakers by the disclosure and disclaimer requirements upheld in citizens united federal election comm n.a political candidate disclosure of his funding resources does not result in a cash windfall to his opponent,or affect their respective disclosure obligations.
the burden imposed by the matching funds provision is evident and inherent in the choice that confronts privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.indeed every court to have considered the question after davis has concluded that a candidate or independent group might not spend money if the direct result of that spending is additional funding to political adversaries.arizona is correct that the candidates do not complain that providing a lump sum payment equivalent to the maximum state financing that a candidate could obtain through matching funds would be impermissible.but it is not the amount of funding that the state provides that is constitutionally problematic.it is the manner in which that funding is provided in direct response to the political speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.
b arizona matching funds provision is not justified by a compelling state interest,davis,supra,at.
there is ample support for the argument that the purpose of the matching funds provision is to level the playing field in terms of candidate resources.the clearest evidence is that the provision operates to ensure that campaign funding is equal,up to three times the initial public funding allotment.the text of the arizona act confirms this purpose.the provision setting up the matching funds regime is titled equal funding of candidates,stat.ann.and the act and regulations refer to the funds as equalizing funds,c.this court has repeatedly rejected the argument that the government has a compelling state interest in leveling the playing field that can justify undue burdens on political speech,see,citizens united,supra,at,and the burdens imposed by matching funds can not be justified by the pursuit of such an interest.
even if the objective of the matching funds provision is to combat corruption and not level the playing field the burdens that the matching funds provision imposes on protected political speech are not justified.burdening a candidate expenditure of his own funds on his own campaign does not further the state anticorruption interest.indeed,reliance on personal funds reduces the threat of corruption.davis,supra,at see buckley,supra,at.the burden on independent expenditures also can not be supported by the anticorruption interest.such expenditures are political speech not coordinated with a candidate.citizens united,at.that separation negates the possibility that the expenditures will result in the sort of quid pro quo corruption with which this court case law is concerned.see,at.moreover,t he interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of large contributions is served by contribution limitations.buckley,supra,at.given arizona contribution limits,some of the most austere in the nation,its strict disclosure requirements,and the general availability of public funding,it is hard to imagine what marginal corruption deterrence could be generated by the matching funds provision.
the state and the clean elections institute contend that even if the matching funds provision does not directly serve the anticorruption interest,it indirectly does so by ensuring that enough candidates participate in the state public funding system,which in turn helps combat corruption.but the fact that burdening constitutionally protected speech might indirectly serve the state anticorruption interest,by encouraging candidates to take public financing,does not establish the constitutionality of the matching funds provision.the matching funds provision substantially burdens speech,to an even greater extent than the law invalidated in davis.those burdens can not be justified by a desire to level the playing field,and much of the speech burdened by the matching funds provision does not pose a danger of corruption.the fact that the state may feel that the matching funds provision is necessary to allow it to calibrate its public funding system to achieve its desired level of participation without an undue drain on public resources is not a sufficient justification for the burden.
the flaw in the state argument is apparent in what its reasoning would allow.by the state logic it could award publicly financed candidates five dollars for every dollar spent by a privately financed candidate,or force candidates who wish to run on private funds to pay a fine,in order to encourage participation in the public funding regime.such measures might well promote such participation,but would clearly suppress or unacceptably alter political speech.how the state chooses to encourage participation in its public funding system matters,and the court has never held that a state may burden political speech to the extent the matching funds provision does to ensure adequate participation in a public funding system.
c evaluating the wisdom of public financing as a means of funding political candidacy is not the court business.but determining whether laws governing campaign finance violate the first amendment is.the government may engage in public financing of election campaigns,and doing so can further significant governmental interest s.buckley,at.but the goal of creating a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a manner consistent with the first amendment.arizona program gives money to a candidate in direct response to the campaign speech of an opposing candidate or an independent group.it does this when the opposing candidate has chosen not to accept public financing,and has engaged in political speech above a level set by the state.this goes too far arizona matching funds provision substantially burdens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups without serving a compelling state interest.

chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
under arizona law,candidates for state office who public financing can receive additional money from the state in direct response to the campaign activities of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.once a set spending limit is exceeded,a publicly financed candidate receives roughly one dollar for every dollar spent by an opposing privately financed candidate.the publicly financed candidate also receives roughly one dollar for every dollar spent by independent expenditure groups to support the privately financed candidate,or to oppose the publicly financed candidate.we hold that arizona matching funds scheme substantially burdens protected political speech without serving a compelling state interest and therefore violates the first amendment.
the arizona citizens clean elections act,passed by initiative in,created a voluntary public financing system to fund the primary and general election campaigns of candidates for state office.see.stat.ann.et west and supp.all eligible candidates for governor,secretary of state,attorney general,treasurer,superintendent of public instruction,the corporation commission,mine inspector,and the state legislature both the house and senate may opt to receive public funding.d west supp.eligibility is contingent on the collection of a specified number of contributions from arizona voters,b west,west supp.and the acceptance of certain campaign restrictions and obligations.publicly funded candidates must agree,among other things,to limit their expenditure of personal funds to,a west supp.participate in at least one public debate,a adhere to an overall expenditure cap,a and return all unspent public moneys to the state.
in exchange for accepting these conditions,participating candidates are granted public funds to conduct their campaigns in many cases,this initial allotment may be the whole of the state financial backing of a publicly funded candidate.but when certain conditions are met,publicly funded candidates are granted additional equalizing or matching funds.a,b,and c providing for e qual funding of candidates 
matching funds are available in both primary and general elections.in a primary,matching funds are triggered when a privately financed candidate expenditures,combined with the expenditures of independent groups made in support of the privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly financed candidate,exceed the primary election allotment of state funds to the publicly financed candidate.a,c.during the general election,matching funds are triggered when the amount of money a privately financed candidate receives in contributions,combined with the expenditures of independent groups made in support of the privately financed candidate or in opposition to a publicly financed candidate,exceed the general election allotment of state funds to the publicly candidate.b.a privately financed expenditures of his personal funds are counted as contributions for purposes of calculating matching funds during a general election.see citizens clean elections commission.admin.rule b f.
once matching funds are triggered,each additional that a privately financed candidate spends during the primary results in one dollar in additional state funding to his publicly financed opponent less a reduction meant to account for fundraising expenses.a.during a general election,every dollar that a candidate receives in contributions which includes any money of his own that a candidate spends on his campaign results in roughly one dollar in additional state funding to his publicly financed opponent.in an election where a privately funded candidate faces multiple publicly financed candidates,one dollar raised or spent by the privately candidate results in an almost one dollar increase in public funding to each of the publicly financed candidates.
once the public financing cap is exceeded,additional expenditures by independent groups can result in matching funds as well.spending by independent groups on behalf of a privately funded candidate,or in opposition to a publicly funded candidate,results in matching funds.c.independent expenditures made in support of a publicly financed candidate can result in matching funds for other publicly financed candidates in a race.ibid.the matching funds provision is not activated,however,when independent expenditures are made in opposition to a privately financed candidate.matching funds top out at two times the initial authorized grant of public funding to the publicly financed candidate.e.
under arizona law,a privately financed candidate may raise and spend unlimited funds,subject to contribution limits and disclosure requirements.contributions to candidates for statewide office are limited to per contributor per election cycle and contributions to legislative candidates are limited to per contributor per election cycle.see a,b.of state,office of the secretary of state,contribution limits,http election info all internet materials as visited june,and available in clerk of court case file.
an example may help clarify how the arizona matching funds provision operates.arizona is divided into districts for purposes of electing members to the state house of representatives.each district elects two representatives to the house biannually.in the last general election,the number of candidates competing for the two available seats in each district ranged from two to seven.see state of arizona official canvass,general election report compiled and issued by the arizona secretary of state.arizona fourth district had three candidates for its two available house seats.two of those candidates opted to accept public funding one candidate chose to operate his campaign with private funds.
in that election,if the total funds contributed to the privately funded candidate,added to that candidate expenditure of personal funds and the expenditures of supportive independent groups,exceeded the allocation of public funds for the general election in a contested state house race the matching funds provision would be triggered.see citizens clean elections commission,participating candidate guide election cycle.at that point,a number of different political activities could result in the distribution of matching funds.for example 
if the privately funded candidate spent of his own money to conduct a direct mailing,each of his publicly funded opponents would receive less the offset.
if the privately funded candidate held a fundraiser that generated in contributions,each of his publicly funded opponents would receive.
if an independent expenditure group spent on a brochure expressing its support for the privately financed candidate,each of the publicly financed candidates would receive directly.
if an independent expenditure group spent on a brochure opposing one of the publicly financed candidates,but saying nothing about the privately financed candidate,the publicly financed candidates would receive directly.
if an independent expenditure group spent on a brochure supporting one of the publicly financed candidates,the other publicly financed candidate would receive directly,but the privately financed candidate would receive nothing.
if an independent expenditure group spent on a brochure opposing the privately financed candidate,no matching funds would be issued.
a publicly financed candidate would continue to receive additional state money in response to fundraising and spending by the privately financed candidate and independent expenditure groups until that publicly financed candidate received a total of in state funds three times the initial allocation for a state house race 
petitioners in this case,plaintiffs below,are five past and future candidates for arizona state office four members of the house of representatives and the arizona state treasurer and two independent groups that spend money to support and oppose arizona candidates.they filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the matching funds provision.the candidates and independent expenditure groups argued that the matching funds provision unconstitutionally penalized their speech and burdened their ability to fully exercise their first amendment rights.
the district court agreed that this provision constitute d a substantial burden on the speech of privately financed candidates because it award s funds to a privately financed candidate opponent based on the privately financed candidate speech.app.to pet.for cert.in,internal quotation marks omitted.that court further held that no compelling interest was served by the provision that might justify the burden imposed,at.the district court entered a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the matching funds provision,but stayed implementation of that injunction to allow the state to file an appeal,at.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit stayed the district court injunction pending appeal,at after hearing the case on the merits,the court of appeals reversed the district court.the court of appeals concluded that the matching funds provision imposes only a minimal burden on first amendment rights because it does not actually prevent anyone from speaking in the first place or cap campaign expenditures.in that court view,any burden imposed by the matching funds provision was justified because the provision bears a substantial relation to the state important interest in reducing quid pro quo political corruption.at 
we stayed the court of appeals decision,vacated the stay of the district court injunction,see,and later granted certiorari.
discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of our system of government.buckley valeo,per curiam.as a result,the first amendment has its fullest and most urgent application to speech during a campaign for political office.eu san francisco county democratic central,quoting monitor patriot roy.laws that burden political speech are accordingly subject to strict scrutiny,which requires the government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.citizens united federal election comm n,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted see federal election comm massachusetts citizens for life.

at the same time,we have subjected strictures on speech that we have found less onerous to a lower level of scrutiny and upheld those restrictions.for example,after finding that the restriction at issue was closely drawn to serve a sufficiently important interest,see,mcconnell federal election comm n,internal quotation marks omitted nixon shrink missouri government pac,internal quotation marks omitted,we have upheld limits on contributions to,buckley,supra,at,caps on coordinated party expenditures,federal election comm colorado republican federal campaign,colorado ii,and requirements that political funding sources disclose their identities,citizens united,supra,at slip,at.
although the speech of the candidates and independent expenditure groups that brought this suit is not directly capped by arizona matching funds provision,those parties contend that their political speech is substantially burdened by the state law in the same way that speech was burdened by the law we recently found invalid in davis federal election comm n.in davis,we considered a first amendment challenge to the millionaire amendment of the bipartisan campaign reform act of,a.under that amendment,if a candidate for the united states house of representatives spent more than of his personal funds,a new,asymmetrical regulatory scheme came into play.at.the opponent of the candidate who exceeded that limit was permitted to collect individual contributions up to per contributor three times the normal contribution limit of.see ibid.the candidate who spent more than the personal funds limit remained subject to the original contribution cap.davis argued that this scheme burden ed his exercise of his first amendment right to make unlimited expenditures of his personal funds because doing so had the effect of enabling his opponent to raise more money and to use that money to finance speech that counteract ed and thus diminishe d the effectiveness of davis own speech.at.
in addressing the constitutionality of the millionaire amendment,we acknowledged that the provision did not impose an outright cap on a candidate personal expenditures,at.we nonetheless concluded that the amendment was unconstitutional because it forced a candidate to choose between the first amendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations.at.any candidate who chose to spend more than of his own money was forced to shoulder a special and potentially significant burden because that choice gave fundraising advantages to the candidate adversary.ibid.we determined that this constituted an unprecedented penalty and impose d a substantial burden on the exercise of the first amendment right to use personal funds for campaign speech,and concluded that the government had failed to advance any compelling interest that would justify such a burden,at.
the logic of davis largely controls our approach to this case.much like the burden placed on speech in davis,the matching funds provision imposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises his first amendment right s.at.under that provision,the vigorous exercise of the right to use personal funds to finance campaign speech leads to advantages for opponents in the competitive context of electoral politics.ibid.
once a privately financed candidate has raised or spent more than the state initial grant to a publicly financed candidate,each personal dollar spent by the privately financed candidate results in an award of almost one additional dollar to his opponent.that plainly forces the privately financed candidate to shoulder a special and potentially significant burden when choosing to exercise his first amendment right to spend funds on behalf of his candidacy.ibid.if the law at issue in davis imposed a burden on candidate speech,the arizona law unquestionably does so as well.
the penalty imposed by arizona matching funds provision is different in some respects from the penalty imposed by the law we struck down in davis.but those differences make the arizona law more constitutionally problematic,not less.see green party of garfield.first,the penalty in davis consisted of raising the contribution limits for one of the candidates.the candidate who benefited from the increased limits still had to go out and raise the funds.he may or may not have been able to do so.the other candidate,therefore,faced merely the possibility that his opponent would be able to raise additional funds,through contribution limits that remained subject to a cap.and still the court held that this was an unprecedented penalty,a special and potentially significant burden that had to be justified by a compelling state interest a rigorous first amendment hurdle,at.here the benefit to the publicly financed candidate is the direct and automatic release of public money.that is a far heavier burden than in davis.
second,depending on the specifics of the election at issue,the matching funds provision can create a multiplier effect.in the arizona fourth district house election discussed,see supra,at,if the spending cap were exceeded,each dollar spent by the privately funded candidate would result in an additional dollar of campaign funding to each of that candidate publicly financed opponents.in such a situation,the matching funds provision forces privately funded candidates to fight a political hydra of sorts.each dollar they spend generates two adversarial dollars in response.again,a markedly more significant burden than in davis.
third,unlike the law at issue in davis,all of this is to some extent out of the privately financed candidate hands.even if that candidate opted to spend less than the initial public financing cap,any spending by independent expenditure groups to promote the privately financed candidate election regardless whether such support was welcome or helpful could trigger matching funds.what is more,that state money would go directly to the publicly funded candidate to use as he saw fit.that disparity in control giving money directly to a publicly financed candidate,in response to independent expenditures that can not be coordinated with the privately funded candidate is a substantial advantage for the publicly funded candidate.that candidate can allocate the money according to his own campaign strategy,which the privately financed candidate could not do with the independent group expenditures that triggered the matching funds.citizens united,at slip,at the absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate or his agent undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate quoting buckley,at.
the burdens that this regime places on independent expenditure groups are akin to those imposed on the privately financed candidates themselves.just as with the candidate the independent group supports,the more money spent on that candidate behalf or in opposition to a publicly funded candidate,the more money the publicly funded candidate receives from the state.and just as with the privately financed candidate,the effect of a dollar spent on election speech is a guaranteed financial payout to the publicly funded candidate the group opposes.moreover,spending one dollar can result in the flow of dollars to multiple candidates the group disapproves of,dollars directly controlled by the publicly funded candidate or candidates.
in some ways,the burden the arizona law imposes on independent expenditure groups is worse than the burden it imposes on privately financed candidates,and thus substantially worse than the burden we found constitutionally impermissible in davis.if a candidate contemplating an electoral run in arizona surveys the campaign landscape and decides that the burdens imposed by the matching funds regime make a privately funded campaign unattractive,he at least has the option of taking public financing.independent expenditure groups,of course,do not.
once the spending cap is reached,an independent expenditure group that wants to support a particular candidate because of that candidate stand on an issue of to the group can only avoid triggering matching funds in one of two ways.the group can either opt to change its message from one addressing the merits of the candidates to one addressing the merits of an issue,or refrain from speaking altogether.presenting independent expenditure groups with such a choice makes the matching funds provision particularly burdensome to those groups.and forcing that choice trigger matching funds,change your message,or do not speak certainly contravenes the fundamental rule of protection under the first amendment,that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.hurley gay,lesbian and bisexual group of boston,citizens united,supra,at slip,at the first amendment stands against attempts to disfavor certain subjects or viewpoints federal election comm wisconsin right to life,opinion of roberts,the argument that speakers can avoid the burdens of a law by changing what they say does not mean the law complies with the first amendment 
arizona,the clean elections institute,and the united states offer several arguments attempting to explain away the existence or significance of any burden imposed by matching funds.none is persuasive.
arizona contends that the matching funds provision is distinguishable from the law we invalidated in davis.the state correctly points out that our decision in davis focused on the asymmetrical contribution limits imposed by the millionaire amendment.see,at.but that is not because as the state asserts the reach of that opinion is limited to asymmetrical contribution limits.brief for state respondents.it is because that was the particular burden on candidate speech we faced in davis.and whatever the significance of the distinction in general,there can be no doubt that the burden on speech is significantly greater in this case than in davis that means that the law here like the one in davis must be justified by a compelling state interest.
the state argues that the matching funds provision actually results in more speech by increas ing debate about issues of public concern in arizona elections and promot ing the free and open debate that the first amendment was intended to foster.brief for state respondents see brief for respondent clean elections institute.in the state view,this promotion of first amendment ideals offsets any burden the law might impose on some speakers.
not so.any increase in speech resulting from the arizona law is of one kind and one kind only that of publicly financed candidates.the burden imposed on privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups reduces their speech restriction s on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression.buckley,at.thus,even if the matching funds provision did result in more speech by publicly financed candidates and more speech in general,it would do so at the expense of impermissibly burdening and thus reducing the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.this sort of beggar thy neighbor approach to free speech restrict ing the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the first amendment.at 
we have rejected government efforts to increase the speech of some at the expense of others outside the campaign finance context.in miami herald publishing tornillo,we held unconstitutional a florida law that required any newspaper assailing a political candidate character to allow that candidate to print a reply.we have explained that while the statute in that case purported to advance free discussion,its effect was to deter newspapers from speaking out in the first instance because it penalized the newspaper own expression.pacific gas public util.comm of,plurality opinion.such a penalty,we concluded,could not survive first amendment scrutiny.the arizona law imposes a similar penalty the state grants funds to publicly financed candidates as a direct result of the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.the argument that this sort of burden promotes free and robust discussion is no more persuasive here than it was in tornillo 
arizona asserts that no candidate or independent group is obliged personally to express a message he disagrees with or required by the government to subsidize a message he disagrees with.brief for state respondents quoting johanns livestock marketing.true enough.but that does not mean that the matching funds provision does not burden speech.the direct result of the speech of financed candidates and independent expenditure groups is a monetary subsidy to a political rival.that cash subsidy,conferred in response to political speech,penalizes speech to a greater extent and more directly than the millionaire amendment in davis.the fact that this may result in more speech by the other candidates is no more adequate a justification here than it was in davis.see,at.
in disagreeing with our conclusion,the dissent relies on cases in which we have upheld government subsidies against first amendment challenge,and asserts that w e have never,not once,understood a subsidy given to one speaker to constitute a first amendment burden on another.post,at.but none of those cases not one involved a subsidy given in direct response to the political speech of another,to allow the recipient to counter that speech.and nothing in the analysis we employed in those cases suggests that the challenged subsidies would have survived first amendment scrutiny if they were triggered by someone else political speech 
the state also argues,and the court of appeals concluded,that any burden on privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups is more analogous to the burden placed on speakers by the disclosure and disclaimer requirements we recently upheld in citizens united than to direct restrictions on candidate and independent expenditures.see,at brief for state respondents,brief for respondent clean elections institute.this analogy is not even close.a political candidate disclosure of his funding resources does not result in a cash windfall to his opponent,or affect their respective disclosure obligations.
the state and the clean elections institute assert that the candidates and independent expenditure groups have failed to cite specific instances in which they decided not to raise or spend funds,brief for state respondents see,at,and have failed to present any reliable evidence that arizona triggered matching funds deter their speech,brief for respondent clean elections institute see,at.the record in this case,which we must review in its entirety,does not support those assertions.see bose consumers union of united states.
that record contains examples of specific candidates curtailing fundraising efforts,and actively discouraging supportive independent expenditures,to avoid triggering matching funds.see,app.rick murphy,dean martin app.to pet.for cert.in,at john mccomish,tony bouie.the record also includes examples of independent expenditure groups deciding not to speak in opposition to a candidate,app.arizona taxpayers action committee,or in support of a candidate,at club for growth,to avoid triggering matching funds.in addition,david primo,an expert involved in the case,found that privately financed candidates facing the prospect of triggering matching funds changed the timing of their fundraising activities,the timing of their expenditures,and,thus,their overall campaign strategy.reply brief for petitioner arizona free enterprise club afec freedom club pac et see also,at listing additional sources of evidence detailing the burdens imposed by the matching funds provision brief for petitioner afec freedom club pac et afec brief same brief for petitioner mccomish et same.
the state contends that if the matching funds provision truly burdened the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups,spending on behalf of privately financed candidates would cluster just below the triggering level,but no such phenomenon has been observed.brief for state respondents brief for respondent clean elections institute.that should come as no surprise.the hypothesis presupposes a privately funded candidate who would spend his own money just up to the matching funds threshold,when he could have simply taken matching funds in the first place.
furthermore,the arizona law takes into account all manner of uncoordinated political activity in awarding matching funds.if a privately funded candidate wanted to hover just below the triggering level,he would have to make guesses about how much he will receive in the form of contributions and supportive independent expenditures.he might well guess wrong.
in addition,some candidates may be willing to bear the burden of spending above the cap.that a candidate is willing to do so does not make the law any less burdensome.see davis,at that candidates may choose to make personal expenditures to support their campaigns despite the burdens imposed by the millionaire amendment does not change the fact that they must shoulder a special and potentially significant burden if they make that choice if the state made privately funded candidates pay a fine to run as such,the fact that candidates might choose to pay it does not make the fine any less burdensome.
while there is evidence to support the contention of the candidates and independent expenditure groups that the matching funds provision burdens their speech,it is never easy to prove a negative here,that candidates and groups did not speak or limited their speech because of the arizona law.elkins united states.in any event,the burden imposed by the matching funds provision is evident and inherent in the choice that confronts privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.davis,at.indeed even candidates who sign up for public funding recognize the burden matching funds impose on private speech,stating that they participate in the program because matching funds discourage opponents,special interest groups,and lobbyists from campaigning against them.gao,campaign finance reform experiences of two states that offered full public funding for political candidates.as in davis,we do not need empirical evidence to determine that the law at issue is burdensome.see,at requiring no evidence of a burden whatsoever.
it is clear not only to us but to every other court to have considered the question after davis that a candidate or independent group might not spend money if the direct result of that spending is additional funding to political adversaries.see,green party of,at matching funds impose a substantial burden on the exercise of first amendment rights internal quotation marks omitted mccomish bennett,at matching funds create potential chilling effects and impose some first amendment burden scott roberts,we think it is obvious that the matching funds subsidy imposes a burden on privately financed candidates at we know of no court that doubts that a matching funds subsidy like the one at issue here burdens the speech of privately financed candidates see also day holahan,it is clear that matching funds provisions infringe on protected speech because of the chilling effect they have on the political speech of the person or group making the triggering expenditure cited in davis,supra,at.the dissent disagreement is little more than disagreement with davis.
the state correctly asserts that the candidates and independent expenditure groups do not claim that a single lump sum payment to publicly funded candidates,equivalent to the maximum amount of state financing that a candidate can obtain through matching funds,would impermissibly burden their speech.brief for state respondents see tr.of oral arg.the state reasons that if providing all the money up front would not burden speech,providing it piecemeal does not do so either.and the state further argues that such incremental administration is necessary to ensure that public funding is not under or.see brief for state respondents.
these arguments miss the point.it is not the amount of funding that the state provides to publicly financed candidates that is constitutionally problematic in this case.it is the manner in which that funding is provided in direct response to the political speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups.and the fact that the state matching mechanism may be more efficient than other alternatives that it may help the state in finding the or its financing system to avoid a drain on public resources,post,at kagan,dissenting is of no moment the first amendment does not permit the state to sacrifice speech for efficiency.riley national federation of blind of.
the united states as amicus contends that p roviding additional funds to petitioners opponents does not make petitioners own speech any less effective and thus does not substantially burden speech.brief for united states.of course it does.one does not have to subscribe to the view that electoral debate is zero sum,see afec brief,to see the flaws in the united states perspective.all else being equal,an advertisement supporting the election of a candidate that goes without a response is often more effective than an advertisement that is directly controverted.and even if the publicly funded candidate decides to use his new money to address a different issue altogether,the end goal of that spending is to claim electoral victory over the opponent that triggered the additional state funding.see davis,at.
because the arizona matching funds provision imposes a substantial burden on the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups,that can not stand unless it is justified by a compelling state interest,at quoting massachusetts citizens for life,at.
there is a debate between the parties in this case as to what state interest is served by the matching funds provision.the privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups contend that the provision works to level electoral opportunities by equalizing candidate resources and influence.brief for petitioner mccomish et see afec brief.the state and the clean elections institute counter that the provision furthers arizona interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption.brief for state respondents brief for respondent clean elections institute.
there is ample support for the argument that the matching funds provision seeks to level the playing field in terms of candidate resources.the clearest evidence is of course the very operation of the provision it ensures that campaign funding is equal,up to three times the initial public funding allotment.the text of the citizens clean elections act itself confirms this purpose.the provision setting up the matching funds regime is titled equal funding of candidates.stat.ann.west supp.the act refers to the funds doled out after the act matching mechanism is triggered as equalizing funds.see c.and the regulations implementing the matching funds provision refer to those funds as equalizing funds as well.see citizens clean elections commission.admin.rule.
other features of the arizona law reinforce this understanding of the matching funds provision.if the citizens clean election commission can not provide publicly financed candidates with the moneys that the matching funds provision envisions because of a shortage of funds,the statute allows a publicly financed candidate to accept private contributions to bring the total monies received by the candidate up to the matching funds amount.stat.ann.f west.limiting contributions,of course,is the primary means we have upheld to combat corruption.buckley,at.indeed the state argues that one of the principal ways that the matching funds provision combats corruption is by eliminating the possibility of any quid pro quo between private interests and publicly funded candidates by eliminating contributions to those candidates altogether.see brief for state respondents.but when confronted with a choice between fighting corruption and equalizing speech,the drafters of the matching funds provision chose the latter.that significantly undermines any notion that the equal funding of candidates provision is meant to serve some interest other than an interest in equalizing funds 
we have repeatedly rejected the argument that the government has a compelling state interest in leveling the playing field that can justify undue burdens on political speech.see,citizens united,at slip,at.in davis,we stated that discriminatory contribution limits meant to level electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth did not serve a legitimate government objective,let alone a compelling one,at internal quotation marks omitted.and in buckley,we held that limits on overall campaign expenditures could not be justified by a purported interest in equalizing the financial resources of candidates.at see,at.after all,equalizing campaign resources might serve not to equalize the opportunities of all candidates,but to handicap a candidate who lacked substantial name recognition or exposure of his views before the start of the campaign.at.
leveling electoral opportunities means making and implementing judgments about which strengths should be permitted to contribute to the outcome of an election,davis,supra,at a dangerous enterprise and one that can not justify burdening protected speech.the dissent essentially dismisses this concern,see post,at,but it needs to be taken seriously we have,as noted,held that it is not legitimate for the government to attempt to equalize electoral opportunities in this manner.and such basic intrusion by the government into the debate over who should govern goes to the heart of first amendment values.
leveling the playing field can sound like a good thing.but in a democracy,campaigning for office is not a game.it is a critically important form of speech.the first amendment embodies our choice as a nation that,when it comes to such speech,the guiding principle is freedom the unfettered interchange of ideas not whatever the state may view as fair.buckley,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.
as already noted,the state and the clean elections institute disavow any interest in leveling the playing field.they instead assert that the equal funding of candidates provision.stat.ann.west supp,serves the state compelling interest in combating corruption and the appearance of corruption.see,davis,supra,at wisconsin right to life,at opinion of roberts.but even if the ultimate objective of the matching funds provision is to combat corruption and not level the playing field the burdens that the matching funds provision imposes on protected political speech are not justified.
burdening a candidate expenditure of his own funds on his own campaign does not further the state anticorruption interest.indeed,we have said that reliance on personal funds reduces the threat of corruption and that discouraging the use of personal funds disserves the anticorruption interest.davis,supra,at.that is because the use of personal funds reduces the candidate dependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse of money in politics.buckley,supra,at.the matching funds provision counts a candidate expenditures of his own money on his own campaign as contributions,and to that extent can not be supported by any anticorruption interest.
we have also held that independent expenditures do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.citizens united,at slip,at.by definition,an independent expenditure is political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.at slip,at.the circuit is broken.the separation between candidates and independent expenditure groups negates the possibility that independent expenditures will result in the sort of quid pro quo corruption with which our case law is concerned.see,at slip,at buckley,at.including independent expenditures in the matching funds provision can not be supported by any anticorruption interest.
we have observed in the past that t he interest in alleviating the corrupting influence of large contributions is served by contribution limitations.at.arizona already has some of the most austere contribution limits in the united states.see randall sorrell,plurality opinion.contributions to statewide candidates are limited to per contributor per election cycle and contributions to legislative candidates are limited to per contributor per election cycle.see.stat.ann.a,b.of state,office of the secretary of state,contribution limits,see supra,at.arizona also has stringent fundraising disclosure requirements.in the face of such ascetic contribution limits,strict disclosure requirements,and the general availability of public funding,it is hard to imagine what marginal corruption deterrence could be generated by the matching funds provision.
perhaps recognizing that the burdens the matching funds provision places on speech can not be justified in and of themselves,either as a means of leveling the playing field or directly fighting corruption,the state and the clean elections institute offer another argument they contend that the provision indirectly serves the anticorruption interest,by ensuring that enough candidates participate in the state public funding system,which in turn helps combat corruption see brief for state respondents brief for respondent clean elections institute.we have said that a voluntary system of public financing as a means of eliminating the improper influence of large private contributions furthers a significant governmental interest.buckley,supra,at.but the fact that burdening constitutionally protected speech might indirectly serve the state anticorruption interest,by encouraging candidates to take public financing,does not establish the constitutionality of the matching funds provision.
we have explained that the matching funds provision substantially burdens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent groups.it does so to an even greater extent than the law we invalidated in davis.we have explained that those burdens can not be justified by a desire to level the playing field.we have also explained that much of the speech burdened by the matching funds provision does not,under our precedents,pose a danger of corruption.in light of the foregoing analysis,the fact that the state may feel that the matching funds provision is necessary to allow it to find the and e its public funding system,post,at kagan,dissenting,to achieve its desired level of participation without an undue drain on public resources,is not a sufficient justification for the burden.
the flaw in the state argument is apparent in what its reasoning would allow.by the state logic it could grant a publicly funded candidate five dollars in matching funds for every dollar his privately financed opponent spent,or force candidates who wish to run on private funds to pay a fine in order to encourage participation in the public funding regime.such measures might well promote participation in public financing,but would clearly suppress or unacceptably alter political speech.how the state chooses to encourage participation in its public funding system matters,and we have never held that a state may burden political speech to the extent the matching funds provision does to ensure adequate participation in a public funding system.here the state chosen method is unduly burdensome and not sufficiently justified to survive first amendment scrutiny.
we do not today call into question the wisdom of public financing as a means of funding political candidacy.that is not our business.but determining whether laws governing campaign finance violate the first amendment is very much our business.in carrying out that responsibility over the past years,we have upheld some restrictions on speech and struck down others.see,buckley,supra,at,upholding contribution limits and striking down expenditure limits colorado i,at opinion of breyer,invalidating ban on independent expenditures for electioneering communication colorado ii,at upholding caps on coordinated party expenditures davis,at invalidating asymmetrical contribution limits triggered by candidate spending.
we have said that governments may engage in public financing of election campaigns and that doing so can further significant governmental interest s,such as the state interest in preventing corruption.buckley,at.but the goal of creating a viable public financing scheme can only be pursued in a manner consistent with the first amendment.the dissent criticizes the court for standing in the way of what the people of arizona want.post,at.but the whole point of the first amendment is to protect speakers against unjustified government restrictions on speech,even when those restrictions reflect the will of the majority.when it comes to protected speech,the speaker is sovereign.
arizona program gives money to a candidate in direct response to the campaign speech of an opposing candidate or an independent group.it does this when the opposing candidate has chosen not to accept public financing,and has engaged in political speech above a level set by the state.the professed purpose of the state law is to cause a sufficient number of candidates to sign up for public financing,see post,at,which subjects them to the various restrictions on speech that go along with that program.this goes too far arizona matching funds provision substantially burdens the speech of privately financed candidates and independent expenditure groups without serving a compelling state interest.
t here is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of the first amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs,includ ing discussions of candidates.buckley,at internal quotation marks omitted second alteration in original.that agreement reflects our profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited,robust,and.ibid.quoting new york times sullivan.true when we said it and true today.laws like arizona matching funds provision that inhibit robust and political debate without sufficient justification can not stand.

imagine two states,each plagued by a corrupt political system.in both states,candidates for public office accept large campaign contributions in exchange for the promise that,after assuming office,they will rank the donors interests ahead of all others.as a result of these bargains,politicians ignore the public interest,sound public policy languishes,and the citizens lose confidence in their government.
recognizing the cancerous effect of this corruption,voters of the first state,acting through referendum,enact several campaign finance measures previously approved by this court.they cap campaign contributions require disclosure of substantial donations and create an optional public financing program that gives candidates a fixed public subsidy if they refrain from private fundraising.but these measures do not work.individuals who bundle campaign contributions become indispensable to candidates in need of money.simple disclosure fails to prevent shady dealing.and candidates choose not to participate in the public financing system because the sums provided do not make them competitive with their privately financed opponents.so the state remains afflicted with corruption.
voters of the second state,having witnessed this failure,take an different tack to cleaning up their political system.they too enact contribution limits and disclosure requirements.but they believe that the greatest hope of eliminating corruption lies in creating an effective public financing program,which will break candidates dependence on large donors and bundlers.these voters realize,based on the first state experience,that such a program will not work unless candidates agree to participate in it.and candidates will participate only if they know that they will receive sufficient funding to run competitive races.so the voters enact a program that carefully adjusts the money given to officeholders,through the use of a matching funds mechanism,in order to provide this assurance.the program does not discriminate against any candidate or point of view,and it does not restrict any person ability to speak.in fact,by providing resources to many candidates,the program creates more speech and thereby broadens public debate.and just as the voters had hoped,the program accomplishes its mission of restoring integrity to the political system.the second state rids itself of corruption.
a person familiar with our country core values our devotion to democratic,as well as to uninhibited,robust,and debate,new york times sullivan,might expect this court to celebrate,or at least not to interfere with,the second state success.but today,the majority holds that the second state system the system that produces honest government,working on behalf of all the people clashes with our constitution.the first amendment,the majority insists,requires us all to rely on the measures employed in the first state,even when they have failed to break the stranglehold of special interests on elected officials.
i disagree.the first amendment core purpose is to foster a healthy,vibrant political system full of robust discussion and debate.nothing in arizona statute,the arizona citizens clean elections act,violates this constitutional protection.to the contrary,the act promotes the values underlying both the first amendment and our entire constitution by enhancing the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people.at internal quotation marks omitted.i therefore respectfully dissent.
campaign finance reform over the last century has focused on one key question how to prevent massive pools of private money from corrupting our political system.if an officeholder owes his election to wealthy contributors,he may act for their benefit alone,rather than on behalf of all the people.as we recognized in buckley valeo,per curiam,our seminal campaign finance case,large private contributions may result in political quid pro quo s,which undermine the integrity of our democracy.and even if these contributions are not converted into corrupt bargains,they still may weaken confidence in our political system because the public perceives the opportunities for abuse s.at.to prevent both corruption and the appearance of corruption and so to protect our democratic system of governance citizens have implemented reforms designed to curb the power of special interests.
among these measures,public financing of elections has emerged as a potentially potent mechanism to preserve elected officials independence.president theodore roosevelt proposed the reform as early as in his state of the union address.the need for collecting large campaign funds would vanish,he said,if the government provided an appropriation for the proper and legitimate of running a campaign,on the condition that a party receiving campaign funds from the treasury would forgo private fundraising.cong.rec.the idea was and remains straightforward.candidates who rely on public,rather than private,moneys are beholden to no person and,if elected,should feel no obligation toward any contributor.republican nat.comm.fec,supp,sdny,aff.by supplanting private cash in elections,public financing eliminates the source of political corruption.
for this reason,public financing systems today dot the national landscape.almost of the states have adopted some form of public financing,and so too has the federal government for presidential elections.see garrett,congressional research service report for congress,public financing of congressional campaigns overview and analysis.the federal program which offers presidential candidates a fixed public subsidy if they abstain from private fundraising originated in the campaign finance law that congress enacted in on the heels of the watergate scandal.congress explained at the time that the potentia l for abuse inherent in privately funded elections was all too clear.in congress view,public financing represented the only way to eliminate reliance on large private contributions and its attendant danger of corruption,while still ensuring that a wide range of candidates had access to the ballot,at emphasis deleted.
we declared the presidential public financing system in buckley valeo.congress,we stated,had created the program for the general welfare to reduce the deleterious influence of large contributions on our political process,as well as to facilitate communication by candidates with the electorate,and to free candidates from the rigors of fundraising.at.we reiterated that public financing as a means of the improper influence of large private contributions furthers a significant governmental interest.at.and finally,in rejecting a challenge based on the first amendment,we held that the program did not restrict or censor speech,but rather use d public money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and participation in the electoral process.at.we declared this result vital to a people,and so concluded that the program further ed,not abridge d,pertinent first amendment values.at.we thus gave state and municipal governments the green light to adopt public financing systems along the presidential model.
but this model,which distributes a grant at the beginning of an election cycle,has a significant weakness it lacks a mechanism for setting the subsidy at a level that will give candidates sufficient incentive to participate,while also conserving public resources.public financing can achieve its goals only if a meaningful number of candidates receive the state subsidy,rather than raise private funds.see,a public financing system with no participants does nothing to reduce the existence or appearance of quid pro quo corruption but a public funding program must be voluntary to pass constitutional muster,because of its restrictions on contributions and expenditures.see buckley,at.and candidates will choose to sign up only if the subsidy provided enables them to run competitive races.if the grant is pegged too low,it puts the participating candidate at a disadvantage because he has agreed to spend no more than the amount of the subsidy,he will lack the means to respond if his privately funded opponent spends over that threshold.so when grants do not keep up with campaign expenditures,more and more candidates will choose not to participate but if the subsidy is set too high,it may impose an unsustainable burden on the public fisc.see,at noting that large subsidies would make public funding prohibitively expensive and spell its doom at the least,hefty grants will waste public resources in the many state races where lack of competition makes such funding unnecessary.
the difficulty,then,is in finding the goldilocks solution not too large,not too small,but just right.and this in a world of countless variables where the amount of money needed to run a viable campaign against a privately funded candidate depends on,among other things,the district,the office,and the election cycle.a state may set grants,based on spending in past elections but even that approach leaves out many factors including the resources of the privately funded candidate that alter the competitiveness of a seat from one election to the next.see app.record evidence chronicling the history of variation in campaign spending levels in arizona legislative districts.in short,the dynamic nature of our electoral system makes ex ante predictions about campaign expenditures almost impossible.and that creates a chronic problem for public financing programs,because inaccurate estimates produce subsidies that either dissuade candidates from participating or waste taxpayer money.and so states have made adjustments to the scheme that we approved in buckley,in attempts to more effectively reduce corruption.
the people of arizona had every reason to try to develop effective measures.before turning to financing,arizonans voted by referendum to establish campaign contribution limits.see.stat.ann.west supp.but that effort to abate corruption,standing alone,proved unsuccessful.five years after the enactment of these limits,the state suffered the worst public corruption scandal in its history.brief for state respondents.in that scandal,known as azscam,nearly of the state legislators were caught accepting campaign contributions or bribes in for supporting a piece of legislation.following that incident,the voters of arizona decided that further reform was necessary.acting once again by referendum,they adopted the public funding system at issue here.
the hallmark of arizona program is its inventive approach to the challenge that bedevils all public financing schemes fixing the amount of the subsidy.for each electoral contest,the system calibrates the size of the grant automatically to provide sufficient but no more than sufficient funds to induce voluntary participation.in effect,the program designers found the goldilocks solution,which produces the just right grant to ensure that a participant in the system has the funds needed to run a competitive race.
as the court explains,arizona matching funds arrangement responds to the shortcoming of the model by adjusting the public subsidy in each race to the expenditures of a privately financed candidate and the independent groups that support him.see.stat.ann.et west and west supp.a publicly financed candidate in arizona receives an initial to get his campaign off the ground.see west.but for every dollar his privately funded opponent or the opponent supporters spends over the initial subsidy,the publicly funded candidate will to a point get an additional cents.see west supp.once the publicly financed candidate has received three times the amount of the initial disbursement,he gets no further public funding,see,and remains barred from receiving private contributions,no matter how much more his privately funded opponent spends,see a.
this arrangement,like the model,makes use of a amount to provide financial support to participants.for example,all publicly funded legislative candidates collect an initial grant of for a general election race.and they can in no circumstances receive more than three times that amount after that,their privately funded competitors hold a marked advantage.but the arizona system improves on the model in a crucial respect.by tying public funding to private spending,the state can afford to set a more generous upper limit because it knows that in each campaign it will only have to disburse what is necessary to keep a candidate reasonably competitive.arizona can therefore assure candidates that,if they accept public funds,they will have the resources to run a viable race against those who rely on private money.and at the same time,arizona avoids wasting taxpayers dollars.in this way,the clean elections act creates an effective and sustainable public financing system.
the question here is whether this modest adjustment to the public financing program that we approved in buckley makes the arizona law unconstitutional.the majority contends that the matching funds provision substantially burdens protected political speech and does not serv e a compelling state interest.ante,at.but the court is wrong on both counts.
arizona statute does not impose a restriction,ante,at,or substantia l burde n,ante,at,on expression.the law has quite the opposite effect it subsidizes and so produces more political speech.we recognized in buckley that,for this reason,public financing of elections facilitate s and enlarge s public discussion,in support of first amendment values,at.and what we said then is just as true today.except in a world gone,additional campaign speech and electoral competition is not a first amendment injury.
at every turn,the majority tries to convey the that arizona matching fund statute is of a piece with laws prohibiting electoral speech.the majority invokes the language of limits,bar s,and restraints.ante,at.it equates the law to a restrictio n on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted.it insists that the statute s the speech of some elements of our society to enhance the speech of others.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.and it concludes by reminding us that the point of the first amendment is to protect against unjustified government restrictions on speech.ante,at.
there is just one problem.arizona matching funds provision does not restrict,but instead subsidizes,speech.the law impose s no ceiling on speech and do es not prevent anyone from speaking.citizens united federal election comm n,slip,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted see buckley,at holding that a public financing law does not abridge,restrict,or censor expression.the statute does not tell candidates or their supporters how much money they can spend to convey their message,when they can spend it,or what they can spend it on.rather,the arizona law,like the public financing statute in buckley,provides funding for political speech,thus facilitat ing communication by candidates with the.at.by enabling participating candidates to respond to their opponents expression,the statute expands public debate,in adherence to our tradition that more speech,not less,is the governing rule.citizens united,at slip,at.what the law does all the law does is fund more speech 
and under the first amendment,that makes all the difference.in case after case,year upon year,we have distinguished between speech restrictions and speech subsidies.there is a basic difference,we have held,between direct state interference with first amendment protected activity and state encouragement of other expression.rust sullivan,quoting maher roe,see also,federal election comm massachusetts citizens for life,regan taxation with representation of,national endowment for arts finley,at scalia,concurring in judgment noting the fundamental divide between abridging speech and funding it government subsidies of speech,designed to stimulate expression,are consistent with the first amendment,so long as they do not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.board of regents of of.system southworth,see,rosenberger rector and visitors of of,finley,at.that is because subsidies,by definition and contra the majority,do not restrict any speech.
no one can claim that arizona law discriminates against particular ideas,and so violates the first amendment sole limitation on speech subsidies.the state throws open the doors of its public financing program to all candidates who meet minimal eligibility requirements and agree not to raise private funds.republicans and democrats,conservatives and liberals may participate so too,the law applies equally to independent expenditure groups across the political spectrum.arizona disburses funds based not on a candidate or supporter ideas,but on the candidate decision to sign up for public funding.so under our precedent,arizona subsidy statute should easily survive first amendment scrutiny 
this suit,in fact,may merit less attention than any challenge to a speech subsidy ever seen in this court.in the usual first amendment subsidy case,a person complains that the government declined to finance his speech,while bankrolling someone else we must then decide whether the government differentiated between these speakers on a prohibited basis because it preferred one speaker ideas to another.see,at regan,at.but the candidates bringing this challenge do not make that claim because they were never denied a subsidy.arizona,remember,offers to support any person running for state office.petitioners here refused that assistance.so they are making a novel argument that arizona violated their first amendment rights by disbursing funds to other speakers even though they could have received but chose to spurn the same financial assistance.some people might call that chutzpah.
indeed,what petitioners demand is essentially a right to quash others speech through the prohibition of a universally available subsidy program.petitioners are able to convey their ideas without public financing and they would prefer the field to themselves,so that they can speak free from response.to attain that goal,they ask this court to prevent arizona from funding electoral speech even though that assistance is offered to every state candidate,on the same entirely unobjectionable basis.and this court gladly obliges.
if an ordinary citizen,without the hindrance of a law degree,thought this result an upending of first amendment values,he would be correct.that amendment protects no person,nor any candidate,right to be free from vigorous debate.pacific gas public util.comm of,plurality opinion.indeed,the amendment exists so that this can occur robust,forceful,and contested.it is the theory of the free speech clause that falsehood and fallacies are exposed through discussion,education,and more speech.whitney california,brandeis,concurring.or once again from citizens united m ore speech,not less,is the governing rule.at slip,at.and this is no place more true than in elections,where voters ability to choose the best representatives depends on debate on charge and countercharge,call and response.so to invalidate a statute that restricts no one speech and against no idea that only provides more voices,wider discussion,and greater competition in elections is to undermine,rather than to enforce,the first amendment 
we said all this in buckley,when we upheld the presidential public financing system a ruling this court has never since questioned.the principal challenge to that system came from candidates not eligible for benefits surely more compelling plaintiffs than petitioners,who could have received funding but refused it.yet we rejected that attack in part because we understood the federal program as supporting,rather than interfering with,expression.see,at see also regan,at relying on buckley to hold that selective subsidies of expression comport with the first amendment if they are viewpoint neutral.buckley rejected any idea,along the lines the majority proposes,that a subsidy of electoral speech was in truth a restraint.and more buckley recognized that public financing of elections fosters first amendment principles.t he central purpose of the speech and press clauses,we explained,was to assure a society in which uninhibited,robust,and public debate concerning matters of public interest would thrive,for only in such a society can a healthy representative democracy flourish.at,quoting new york times,at.and we continued l aws providing financial assistance to the exercise of free speech including the campaign finance statute at issue enhance these first amendment values.at.we should be saying the same today.
the majority has one,and only one,way of separating this case from buckley and our other,many precedents involving speech subsidies.according to the court,the special problem here lies in arizona matching funds mechanism,which the majority claims imposes a substantia l burde n on a privately funded candidate speech.ante,at.sometimes,the majority suggests that this burden lies in the way the mechanism diminish es the effectiveness of the privately funded candidate expression by enabling his opponent to respond.ante,at quoting davis federal election comm n,see ante,at.at other times,the majority indicates that the burden resides in the deterrent effect of the mechanism the privately funded candidate might not spend money because doing so will trigger matching funds.ante,at.either way,the majority is wrong to see a substantial burden on expression 
most important,and as just suggested,the very notion that additional speech constitutes a burden is odd and unsettling.here is a simple fact arizona imposes nothing remotely resembling a coercive penalty on privately funded candidates.the state does not jail them,fine them,or subject them to any kind of lesser disability.so the majority analogies to a fine on speech,ante,at,are inapposite.the only burden in this case comes from the grant of a subsidy to another person,and the opportunity that subsidy allows for responsive speech.but that means the majority can not get out from under our subsidy precedents.once again we have never,not once,understood a subsidy given to one speaker to constitute a first amendment burden on another.and that is so even when the subsidy is not open to all,as it is here.yet in this case,the majority says that the prospect of more speech responsive speech,competitive speech,the kind of speech that drives public debate counts as a constitutional injury.that concept,for all the reasons previously given,is wholly foreign to the first amendment.buckley,at.
but put to one side this most fundamental objection to the majority argument even then,has the majority shown that the burden resulting from the arizona statute is substantial see clingman beaver,holding that stringent judicial review is appropriate only if the burden is severe i will not quarrel with the majority assertion that responsive speech by one candidate may make another candidate speech less effective,see ante,at that,after all,is the whole idea of the first amendment,and a benefit of having more responsive speech.see abrams united states,dissenting t he best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market and i will assume that the operation of this statute may on occasion deter a privately funded candidate from spending money,and conveying ideas by that means my guess is that this does not happen often most political candidates,i suspect,have enough faith in the power of their ideas to prefer speech on both sides of an issue to speech on neither.but i will take on faith that the matching funds provision may lead one or another privately funded candidate to stop spending at one or another moment in an election.still,does that effect count as a severe burden on expression by the measure of our prior decisions which have upheld campaign reforms with an equal or greater impact on speech the answer is no.
number one any system of public financing,including the model upheld in buckley,imposes a similar burden on privately funded candidates.suppose arizona were to do what all parties agree it could under buckley provide a single upfront payment say,to a participating candidate,rather than an initial payment of plus of whatever his privately funded opponent spent,up to a ceiling the same.that system would diminis h the effectiveness of a privately funded candidate speech at least as much,and in the same way it would give his opponent,who presumably would not be able to raise that sum on his own,more money to spend.and so too,a system may deter speech.a person relying on private resources might well choose not to enter a race at all,because he knows he will face an adequately funded opponent.and even if he decides to run,he likely will choose to speak in different ways for example,by eschewing dubious,charges because his opponent has the ability to respond.indeed,privately funded candidates may well find the system more burdensome than arizona assuming the lump is big enough.pretend you are financing your campaign through private donations.would you prefer that your opponent receive a guaranteed,upfront payment of,or that he receive only,with the possibility a possibility that you mostly get to control of collecting another somewhere down the road me too.that the first reason the burden on speech can not command a different result in this case than in buckley.
number two our decisions about disclosure and disclaimer requirements show the court is wrong.starting in buckley and continuing through last term,the court has repeatedly declined to view these requirements as a first amendment burden,even though they some campaign speech.it is undoubtedly true,we stated in buckley,that public disclosure obligations will deter some individuals from engaging in expressive activity,at see davis,at.yet we had no difficulty upholding these requirements there.and much more recently,in citizens united and doe reed,we followed that precedent.disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak,we reasoned,but they do not prevent anyone from speaking.at slip,at quoting citizens united,at slip,at.so too here.like a disclosure rule,the matching funds provision may occasionally deter,but impose s no ceiling on electoral expression,at slip,at.
the majority breezily dismisses this comparison,labeling the analogy not even close because disclosure requirements result in no payment of money to a speaker opponent.ante,at.that is indeed the factual distinction a matching fund provision,we can all agree,is not a disclosure rule.but the majority does not tell us why this difference matters.nor could it.the majority strikes down the matching funds provision because of its ostensible effect most notably,that it may deter a person from spending money in an election.but this court has acknowledged time and again that disclosure obligations have the selfsame effect.if that consequence does not trigger the most stringent judicial review in the one case,it should not do so in the other.
number three any burden that the arizona law imposes does not exceed the burden associated with limits,which we have also repeatedly upheld.limits,we have stated,impose direct quantity restrictions on political communication and association,buckley,at emphasis added,thus significant ly interfer ing with first amendment interests,nixon shrink missouri government pac,quoting buckley,at.rather than potentially deterring or diminish ing the effectiveness of expressive activity,ante,at quoting davis,at,these limits stop it cold.yet we have never subjected these restrictions to the most stringent review.see buckley,at.i doubt i have to reiterate that the arizona statute imposes no restraints on any expressive activity.so the majority once again has no reason here to reach a different result.
in this way,our campaign finance cases join our speech subsidy cases in supporting the constitutionality of arizona law.both sets of precedents are in accord that a statute funding electoral speech in the way arizona does imposes no first amendment injury.
the majority thinks it has one case on its side davis federal election comm n,and it pegs everything on that decision.see ante,at.but davis relies on principles that fit securely within our first amendment law and tradition most unlike today opinion.
as the majority recounts,davis addressed the constitutionality of federal legislation known as the millionaire amendment.under that provision which applied in not involving public financing,a candidate expenditure of more than of his own money activated a change in applicable contribution limits.before,each candidate in the race could accept from any donor but now,the opponent of the candidate could accept three times that much,or up to per contributor.so one candidate expenditure of personal funds on campaign speech triggered discriminatory contribution restrictions favoring that candidate opponent.
under the first amendment,the similarity between davis and this case matters far less than the differences.here is the similarity in both cases,one candidate campaign expenditure triggered something.now here are the differences in davis,the candidate expenditure triggered a discriminatory speech restriction,which congress could not otherwise have imposed consistent with the first amendment by contrast,in this case,the candidate expenditure triggers a speech subsidy,which all parties agree arizona could have provided in the first instance.in first amendment law,that difference makes a difference indeed,it makes all the difference.as i have indicated before,two great fault lines run through our first amendment doctrine one,between speech restrictions and speech subsidies,and the other,between discriminatory and neutral government action.see supra,at.the millionaire amendment fell on the disfavored side of both divides to reiterate,it imposed a discriminatory speech restriction.the arizona clean elections act lands on the opposite side of both it grants a speech subsidy so to say that davis largely controls this case,ante,at,is to decline to take our first amendment doctrine seriously.
and let me be clear this is not my own idiosyncratic or post hoc view of davis it is the davis court,contemporaneous view.that decision began,continued,and ended by focusing on the millionaire amendment discriminatory contribution limits.at.we made that clear in the very first sentence of the opinion,where we summarized the question presented,at in this appeal,we consider the constitutionality of federal election law provisions that impose different campaign contribution limits on candidates and our focus on the law discriminatory restrictions was evident again when we examined how the court prior holdings informed the case,at we have never upheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes different contribution limits for candidates and then again,when we concluded that the millionaire amendment could not stand,at explaining that the the activation of a scheme of discriminatory contribution limits burdens speech.our decision left no doubt because we repeated the point many times over,see also,at,the constitutional problem with the millionaire amendment lay in its use of discriminatory speech restrictions.
but what of the trigger mechanism in davis,as here,a candidate campaign expenditures that,after all,is the only thing that this case and davis share.if davis had held that the trigger mechanism itself violated the first amendment,then the case would support today holding.but davis said nothing of the kind.it made clear that the trigger mechanism could not rescue the discriminatory contribution limits from constitutional invalidity that the limits went into effect only after a candidate spent substantial personal resources rendered them no more permissible under the first amendment.see,at.but davis did not call into question the trigger mechanism itself.indeed,davis explained that congress could have used that mechanism to activate a,increase in contribution limits in that case,the court stated,davis argument would plainly fail.at the constitutional infirmity in davis was not the trigger mechanism,but rather what lay on the other side of it a discriminatory speech restriction.
the court response to these points is difficult to fathom.the majority concedes that our decision in davis focused on the asymmetrical contribution limits imposed by the millionaire amendment.ante,at.that was because,the majority explains,davis presented only that issue.see ante,at.and yet,the majority insists without explaining how this can be true,the reach of davis is not so limited.and in any event,the majority claims,the burden on speech is greater in this case than in davis.ante,at.but for reasons already stated,that is not so.the burden on speech in davis the penalty that spending triggered was the discriminatory contribution restriction,which congress could not otherwise have imposed.by contrast,the thing triggered here is a subsidy,of a kind this court has approved for almost four decades.maybe the majority is saying today that it had something like this case in mind all the time.but nothing in the logic of davis controls this decision 
for all these reasons,the court errs in holding that the government action in this case substantially burdens speech and so requires the state to offer a compelling.but in any event,arizona has come forward with just such an interest,explaining that the clean elections act attacks corruption and the appearance of corruption in the state political system.the majority denigration of this interest the suggestion that it either is not real or does not matter wrongly prevents arizona from protecting the strength and integrity of its democracy.
our campaign finance precedents leave no doubt preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption is a compelling government interest.see,davis,at federal election comm national conservative political action,ncpac.and so too,these precedents are clear public financing of elections serves this interest.see supra,at.as buckley recognized,and as i earlier described,public financing reduce s the deleterious influence of large contributions on our political process.at see,at.when private contributions fuel the political system,candidates may make corrupt bargains to gain the money needed to win election.see ncpac,at.and voters,seeing the dependence of candidates on large contributors or on bundlers of smaller contributions,may lose faith that their representatives will serve the public interest.see shrink missouri,at the assumption that large donors call the tune may jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance public financing addresses these dangers by minimizing the importance of private donors in elections.even the majority appears to agree with this premise.see ante,at we have said that public financing as a means of eliminating the improper influence of large private contributions furthers a significant governmental interest 
this compelling interest appears on the very face of arizona public financing statute.start with the title the citizens clean elections act.then proceed to the statute formal findings.the public financing program,the findings state,was inten ded to create a clean elections system that will improve the integrity of arizona state government by diminishing the influence of money.a west.that measure was needed because the prior system of private fundraising had u ndermine d public confidence in the integrity of public officials allowed those officials to accept large campaign contributions from private interests over which they had governmental jurisdiction favored a small number of wealthy special interests over the vast majority of arizona citizens and c os t average taxpayers millions of dollars in the form of subsidies and special privileges for campaign contributors.b the state,appearing before us,has reiterated its important interest.the clean elections act,the state avers,deters quid pro quo corruption and the appearance of corruption by providing arizona candidates with an option to run for office without depending on outside contributions.brief for state respondents.and so arizona,like many state and local governments,has implemented public financing on the theory which this court has previously approved,see supra,at,that the way to reduce political corruption is to diminish the role of private donors in campaigns 
and that interest justifies the matching funds provision at issue because it is a critical facet of arizona public financing program.the provision is no more than a disbursement mechanism but it is also the thing that makes the whole clean elections act work.as described earlier,see supra,at,public financing has an achilles heel the difficulty of setting the subsidy at the right amount.too small,and the grant will not attract candidates to the program and with no participating candidates,the program can hardly decrease corruption.too large,and the system becomes unsustainable,or at the least an unnecessary drain on public resources.but finding the is near impossible because of variation,across districts and over time,in the political system.enter the matching funds provision,which takes an ordinary amount,divides it into thirds,and disburses the last two of these to the extent necessary via a mechanism.that provision is just a of the program approved in buckley a,it bears repeating,that prevents no one from speaking and discriminates against no message.but that can make the difference between a wholly ineffectual program and one that removes corruption from the political system if public financing furthers a compelling interest and according to this court,it does then so too does the disbursement formula that arizona uses to make public financing effective.the one conclusion follows directly from the other.
except in this court,where the inescapable logic of the state position is virtually ignored.the court,to be sure,repeatedly asserts that the state interest in preventing corruption does not sufficiently justif y the mechanism it has chosen to disburse public moneys.ante,at see ante,at.only one thing is missing from the court response any reasoning to support this conclusion.nowhere does the majority dispute the state view that the success of its public financing system depends on the matching funds mechanism and nowhere does the majority contest that,if this mechanism indeed spells the difference between success and failure,the state interest in preventing corruption justifies its use.and so the majority dismisses,but does not actually answer the state contention even though that contention is the linchpin of the entire case.assuming against reason and precedent that the matching funds provision substantially burdens speech,the question becomes whether the state has offered a sufficient justification for imposing that burden.arizona has made a forceful argument on this score,based on the need to establish an effective public system.the majority does not even engage that reasoning.
the majority instead devotes most of its energy to trying to show that level ing the playing field,not fighting corruption,was the state real goal.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted see ante,at.but the majority distaste for leveling provides no excuse for striking down arizona law.
for starters,the court has no basis to question the sincerity of the state interest in rooting out political corruption.as i have just explained,that is the interest the state has asserted in this court it is the interest predominantly expressed in the findings and declarations section of the statute and it is the interest universally understood stretching back to teddy roosevelt time to support public financing of elections.see supra,at.as against all this,the majority claims to have found three smoking guns that reveal the state true and nefarious intention to level the playing field.but the only smoke here is the majority,and it is the kind that goes with mirrors.
the majority first observes that the matching funds provision is titled equal funding of candidates and that it refers to matching grants as equalizing funds.ante,at quoting.well,yes.the statute provides for matching funds above and below certain thresholds a synonym for match is equal and so the statute uses that term.in sum,the statute describes what the statute does.but the relevant question here according to the majority own analysis is why the statute does that thing otherwise said,what interest the statute serves.the state explains that its goal is to prevent corruption,and nothing in the act descriptive terms suggests any other objective.
next,the majority notes that the act allows participating candidates to accept private contributions if but only if the state can not provide the funds it has promised for example,because of a budget crisis.ante,at citing f.that provision,the majority argues,shows that when push comes to shove,the state cares more about leveling than about fighting corruption.ante,at.but this is a plain misreading of the law.all the statute does is assure participating candidates that they will not be left in the lurch if public funds suddenly become unavailable.that guarantee helps persuade candidates to enter the program by removing the risk of a state default.and so the provision directly advances the act goal of combating corruption.
finally,the court remarks in a footnote that the clean elections commission website once stated that the act was passed by the people of arizona to level the playing field.ante,at.i can understand why the majority does not place much emphasis on this point.some members of the majority have ridiculed the practice of relying on subsequent statements by legislators to demonstrate an earlier congress intent in enacting a statute.see,sullivan finkelstein,scalia,concurring in part united states hayes,roberts,dissenting.yet here the majority makes a much stranger claim that a statement appearing on a government website in written by reveals what hundreds of thousands of arizona voters sought to do in when they enacted the clean elections act by referendum.just to state that proposition is to know it is wrong.
so the majority has no evidence zero,none that the objective of the act is anything other than the interest that the state asserts,the act proclaims,and the history of public financing supports fighting corruption.
but suppose the majority had come up with some evidence showing that arizona had sought to equalize electoral opportunities.ante,at.would that discovery matter our precedent says no,so long as arizona had a compelling interest in eliminating political corruption which it clearly did.in these circumstances,any interest of the state in leveling should be irrelevant.that interest could not support arizona law assuming the law burdened speech,but neither would the interest invalidate the legislation.
to see the point,consider how the matter might arise.assume a state has two reasons to pass a statute affecting speech.it wants to reduce corruption.but in addition,it wishes to level the playing field.under our first amendment law,the interest in preventing corruption is compelling and may justify restraints on speech.but the interest in leveling the playing field,according to precedent,can not support such legislation so would this statute assuming it met all other constitutional standards violate the first amendment 
the answer must be no.this court,after all,has never said that a law restricting speech or any other constitutional right demands two compelling interests.one is enough.and this statute has one preventing corruption.so it does not matter that equalizing campaign speech is an insufficient interest.the statute could violate the first amendment only if equalizing qualified as a forbidden motive a motive that itself could annul an otherwise constitutional law.but we have never held that to be so.and that should not be surprising it is a fundamental principle of constitutional adjudication,from which we have deviated only in exceptional cases,that this court will not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive.united states,see,at declining to invalidate a statute when congress had the undoubted power to enact it without the suspect motive accord,turner broadcasting system,fcc,renton playtime theatres.when a law is otherwise constitutional when it either does not restrict speech or rests on an interest sufficient to justify any such restriction that is the end of the story.
that proposition disposes of this case,even if arizona had an adjunct interest here in equalizing electoral opportunities.no special rule of automatic invalidation applies to statutes having some connection to equality like any other laws,they pass muster when supported by an enough government interest.here,arizona has demonstrated in detail how the matching funds provision is necessary to serve a compelling interest in combating corruption.so the hunt for evidence of leveling is a waste of time arizona law survives constitutional scrutiny no matter what that search would uncover.
this case arose because arizonans wanted their government to work on behalf of all the state people.on the heels of a political scandal involving the purchase of legislators votes,arizonans passed a law to sever political candidates dependence on large contributors.they wished,as many of their fellow americans wish,to stop corrupt dealing to ensure that their representatives serve the public,and not just the wealthy donors who helped put them in office.the legislation that arizona voters enacted was the product of deep thought and care.it put into effect a public financing system that attracted large numbers of candidates at a sustainable cost to the state taxpayers.the system discriminated against no ideas and prevented no speech.indeed,by increasing electoral competition and enabling a wide range of candidates to express their views,the system further ed first amendment values.buckley,at citing new york times,at.less corruption,more
