the issue in this case is whether the legislature violated article v,section of the florida constitution by enacting chapter,laws of florida,which creates five offices of criminal conflict and civil regional counsel to handle representation in criminal cases where a public defender has a conflict.we conclude that the creation of the five regional offices to handle representation in criminal cases where a public defender has a conflict does not implicate article v,section,which requires that the public defender in each circuit be elected.the legislative scheme is an organizational structure that supplants the prior system of private registry counsel and does not establish de facto public defenders in violation of the constitution.for these reasons,we reverse the trial court grant of a petition for writ of quo warranto and conclude that the legislature did not act in contravention to article v,section by enacting the legislation 
facts and procedural history 
we begin with an outline of the legislation that is currently under attack.on may,the legislature enacted chapter,laws of florida the act,creating a revamped system of counsel to represent indigent defendants primarily in those cases in which the public defender has a conflict.the act establishes five offices of criminal conflict and civil regional counsel occcrc to be located within the geographic boundaries of each of the five district courts of appeal.stat.each of the occcrc is headed by a regional counsel,who is appointed by the governor to a term and must be either a member in good standing of the florida bar or of the bar of another state for the preceding five years.the process by which regional counsel are appointed is as follows the supreme court judicial nominating commission submits three qualified candidates to the governor,the governor appoints a regional counsel from this list unless it is in the best interests of the fair administration of justice for the governor to request the submission of three new candidates,and the senate must confirm each nominee.id.the regional counsel is in charge of hiring assistant regional counsel and other support staff pursuant to the general appropriations act.stat.although each office is assigned to the justice administrative commission for administrative purposes,they are not subject to control,supervision,or direction by the commission in the performance of their duties.stat.
the legislature established the occcrc to provide adequate representation to persons entitled to counsel under the federal or state constitution or as authorized by general law in a fiscally sound manner,while safeguarding constitutional principles.id.accordingly,the act amended the system by which indigent persons are provided with legal representation at the public expense,as required by the state and federal constitutions or as authorized by general law.stat.as was the case under the previous system,the public defender in each circuit is primarily responsible for representing indigent defendants who have been charged or arrested for an enumerated list of criminal offenses and in a limited number of civil proceedings.see.stat.however,in cases where the public defender determines that a conflict of interest exists,rather than appointing private counsel from a registry list,the new system mandates that the occcrc be appointed first.see.stat then,if one of the occcrc has a conflict,the act requires the court to appoint private counsel from the registry.stat.the significant change in organization was in part motivated by revision to article v,which shifted the majority of the burden of funding the court system from the counties to the state,and also to respond to the chronic problem of conflict representation in indigent defense cases.see.comm.on crim.civ.just,pcs for sb staff analysis.subsequently,pursuant to the procedures set forth in the act,the governor appointed the five regional counsel.
in the wake of the gubernatorial appointments,the florida association of criminal defense lawyers facdl filed a petition for writ of quo warranto,asserting that the governor exceeded his constitutional authority by appointing the regional counsel in the petition,facdl contended that the act improperly established a second tier of public defender offices to handle criminal conflict cases.in response to the petition,the governor asserted that the act did not create a parallel system of unelected public defenders,but rather a system to represent criminal defendants only where the public defender is unable to do so.ultimately,the trial court agreed with facdl and issued an order granting the petition.
initially,the trial court determined that facdl had standing to bring the action because it was a member of the general public that is authorized to enforce a public right,such as state officials performing their duties in conformity with the constitution the court then determined that the regional counsel are essentially public defenders that have not been subject to the qualifications of the constitution.the court found that the legislature has attempted to create a hybrid state office,which is a public defender for purposes of funding but not for purposes of the qualifications under article v,section.because the constitution expressly requires public defenders to be elected and reside in the circuit,the court concluded that the legislature was improperly attempting to amend the constitution by legislative fiat.the trial court therefore concluded that the governor acted outside his authority by appointing the five regional counsel and the senate would exceed its authority by confirming the appointments.accordingly,the trial court quashed the five appointments,enjoined any further action by the secretary of state and the senate to confirm the appointments,and enjoined the regional counsel from performing any duties authorized under the act.this appeal followed.
the issue before the court is whether the five offices of criminal conflict and civil regional counsel and the five appointed regional counsel are public defenders subject to the qualifications set forth in article v,section of the florida constitution.of particular relevance to the issue before the court are the provisions of chapters and,florida statutes,which created the occcrc and set forth guidelines for how they will operate within the current indigent defense system.because the issue before the court involves the determination of a statute constitutionality and the interpretation of a provision of the florida constitution,it is a question of law subject to de novo review.see.dep t of revenue city of gainesville,so d,zingale powell,so d.
although the court review is de novo,statutes come clothed with a presumption of constitutionality and must be construed whenever possible to effect a constitutional outcome.see city of gainesville,so d at quoting.dep t of revenue howard,so d.as this court has stated,s hould any doubt exist that an act is in violation of any constitutional provision,the presumption is in favor of constitutionality.to overcome the presumption,the invalidity must appear beyond reasonable doubt,for it must be assumed the legislature intended to enact a valid law.franklin state,so d.if possible,the act must be construed to avoid unconstitutionality and to remove grave doubts on that score.id.
when reviewing constitutional provisions,this court follows principles parallel to those of statutory interpretation.zingale,so d at.first and foremost,this court must examine the actual language used in the constitution.city of gainesville,so d at.if that language is clear,unambiguous,and addresses the matter in issue,then it must be enforced as written.soc.of ophthalmology.optometric ass n,so d.additionally,this court endeavors to construe a constitutional provision consistent with the intent of the framers and the voters.zingale,so d at quoting caribbean conservation.fish wildlife conservation comm n,so d.this is because 
the fundamental object to be sought in construing a constitutional provision is to ascertain the intent of the framers and the provision must be construed or interpreted in such manner as to fulfill the intent of the people,never to defeat it.such a provision must never be construed in such manner as to make it possible for the will of the people to be frustrated or denied.
id.quoting caribbean,so d at.
with these interpretation principles in mind,we first examine the origins of the office of the public defender and discuss the actual language of article v,section of the constitution,the provision that sets forth the qualifications for public defenders in this state.next,we review the relevant provisions of chapter,which established the occcrc and set forth the details of the occcrc system.lastly,we evaluate whether the occcrc are essentially public defenders that should be subject to the requirements of article v,section.
public defenders under article v,section of the constitution 
in an effort to meet its responsibility to provide counsel to indigent defendants,as guaranteed under the sixth amendment to the constitution and applied to the states in gideon wainwright,d,the florida legislature first established the office of the public defender in.see ch,laws of enacting section,florida statutes,which created the office of the public defender.in state ex rel.smith brummer,so d,a case involving the authority of the public defender to accept an appointment from a federal court,this court briefly discussed the history and purposes of the office of the public defender.we explained 
the office of the public defender is a creature of the state constitution and of statute,not of the common law.the state of florida,in order to meet its responsibility to provide the assistance of counsel guaranteed to defendants against state action by the sixth amendment of the united states constitution,made applicable to states through the fourteenth amendment,has created this office in article v,section of the florida constitution.the functioning of that office is regulated by statute,sections,florida statutes,and by court rule.florida rule of criminal procedure.section sets forth the duties of the public defender to represent any indigents who face possible loss of liberty,or any indigent minor alleged to be a delinquent child,and to handle felony appeals in the state or federal courts.
brummer,so d at footnote omitted accord state ex rel.smith jorandby,so d.
the legislature approved a proposal to amend the constitution and elevate the office of the public defender to the level of a constitutional officer,which was approved by the electorate and adopted in.see art.v.see also summary of amendment revising florida court structure,senate joint res.noting that t he position of public defender gains constitutional status in article v in the amendment.article v,section of the florida constitution,entitled public defenders,has remained relatively unchanged since its adoption.the constitutional provision states 
in each judicial circuit a public defender shall be elected for a term of four years,who shall perform duties prescribed by general law.a public defender shall be an elector of the state and reside in the territorial jurisdiction of the circuit and shall be and have been a member of the bar of florida for the preceding five years.public defenders shall appoint such assistant public defenders as may be authorized by law.
although the actual text of section has been subject to little interpretation by the judiciary,the plain language is clear.the provision essentially sets forth the following minimal qualifications for the position each judicial circuit shall have one public defender the public defender must be elected for a term of four years and the public defender must be an elector of the state,reside in the territorial jurisdiction of the circuit in which he or she is elected,and be a member in good standing of the florida bar for the preceding five years.see id.beyond these minimal qualifications,the constitution does not specify any additional details about how the public defender in each circuit is to operate or what duties are to be performed.in fact,section clearly and unequivocally grants the legislature the authority to control the duties to be performed,which naturally includes the types of cases for which public defenders are appointed.
other than article v,section,which only discusses a public defender qualifications and does not restrict the types of cases that are to be handled,there are no provisions in the constitution that restrict the legislature inherent authority to,at a minimum,establish a system of counsel to handle the public defender conflict cases.as this court has previously noted 
the constitution of this state is not a grant of power to the legislature,but a limitation only upon legislative power,and unless legislation be clearly contrary to some express or necessarily implied prohibition found in the constitution,the courts are without authority to declare legislative acts invalid.the legislature may exercise any lawmaking power that is not forbidden by organic law.
chiles phelps,so d,quoting savage bd.of pub.instruction,so.absent a constitutional limitation,the legislature discretion reasonably exercised is the sole brake on the enactment of legislation.bush holmes,so d,quoting state bd.of pub.instruction,so.thus,the mere creation of the occcrc as a system to handle cases in which the public defender has a conflict appears to be well within the legislature plenary power.however,in the context of this case,the concern is not whether the legislature has the plenary authority to create a system to handle public defender conflict cases,but whether the system as created violates the qualifications for public defenders set forth in article v,section.
because section is essentially a qualifications provision,that is,one that sets forth the minimum qualifications for a certain constitutional office,as opposed to one that outlines specific duties that such an office must perform,this court jurisprudence in this area is the most relevant.we have consistently held that statutes imposing additional qualifications for office are unconstitutional where the basic document of the constitution itself has already undertaken to set forth those requirements.state ex rel.askew thomas,so d,holding that no qualifications were created in a constitutional provision stating that school board members shall be chosen as provided by law,because that provision only discussed the manner of choosing members not what their qualifications had to be accord cook city of jacksonville,so d,t he legislature i s prohibited from adding to or taking from the qualifications of this constitutionally authorized office.citing thomas state ex rel.cobb,so d.for instance,the court has found a law unconstitutional where it attempted to require a school board official to have a specific teaching certificate,where the constitution already listed the requirements.see cobb,so d at.
likewise,the legislature is prohibited from adding to the disqualifications of a constitutional office,where limitations are specifically expressed in the constitution,such as term limits for elected officials.see cook,so d at,holding that local charters unconstitutionally provided for term limits on city and county officers where article vi,section of the florida constitution set forth the only disqualifications applicable to county offices maloney kirk,so d,holding a law unconstitutional that purported to amend the disqualifications for governor,namely,to disqualify persons who had accepted improper influences in an election,in an effort to avoid the results of an election,even though the disqualifications were clearly outlined in the constitution in re investigation of a circuit judge of the eleventh judicial circuit of florida,so d,holding that the legislature was not authorized to enact a statute providing for the removal of a judge in a substantially different manner than outlined in the constitution.
a review of our case law concerning constitutional provisions that set forth the qualifications for office leads us to the following conclusions.if article v,section of the constitution sets the qualifications for the office of the public defender,namely,that there be one elected public defender in each circuit,who is an elector of the state,resides in that circuit,and has been a member in good standing of the florida bar for the preceding five years,then the legislature is forbidden from substantially altering these qualifications.see cook,so d at thomas,so d at maloney,so d at.however,if the legislature has not created another public defender and consequently has not altered the qualifications for that position,then the act does not collide with article v,section.accordingly,we next examine the pertinent provisions of chapter to shed light on the overarching question in this the occcrc and regional counsel are public defenders subject to article v,section of the constitution.
b.the system of counsel under chapter 
chapter revised the system of representation contained in chapter,part iii of the florida statutes,which deals with public defenders and other counsel.the legislature intent in revising the system was clearly expressed as follows 
the legislature finds that the creation of offices of criminal conflict and civil regional counsel and the other provisions of this act are necessary and best steps toward enhancing the publicly funded provision of legal representation and other due process services under constitutional and statutory principles in a fiscally responsible and effective manner.
it is the intent of the legislature to facilitate the orderly transition to the creation and operation of the offices of criminal conflict and civil regional counsel,as provided in this act,in order to enhance and fiscally support the system of representation for eligible individuals in criminal and civil proceedings.to that end,the legislature intends that the five criminal conflict and civil regional counsel be appointed as soon as practicable after this act becomes law,to assume a term beginning on july,the justice administrative commission shall assist the regional counsel as necessary in establishing their offices.in addition,it is the intent of the legislature that the various agencies and organizations that comprise the state judicial system also assist with the transition from current law to the creation and operation of the regional offices.
consistent with this intent,the legislature amended section,which details the process by which indigent persons are appointed counsel,as follows 
counsel circuit registries minimum requirements appointment by court.
counsel shall be appointed to represent any individual in a criminal or civil proceeding entitled to counsel under the federal or state constitution or as authorized by general law.the court shall appoint a public defender to represent indigent persons as authorized in.the office of criminal conflict and civil regional counsel shall be appointed to represent persons in those cases in which provision is made for counsel but the public defender is unable to provide representation due to a conflict of interest or is not authorized to provide representation.
a private counsel shall be appointed to represent persons indigents in those cases in which provision is made for counsel but the office of criminal conflict and civil regional counsel public defender is unable to provide representation due to a conflict of interest or is not authorized to provide representation.
b private counsel appointed by the court to provide representation shall be selected from a registry of individual attorneys maintained under this section established by the circuit article v indigent services committee or procured through a competitive bidding process.
laws of revisions shown in underline and.as is evident from this provision,the legislature continues to rely,first and foremost,on the public defenders to provide counsel to indigent persons in criminal and civil proceedings.it is only when a public defender is unable to provide representation because of a conflict of interest or is not authorized to provide representation that a regional counsel office is appointed in its place.id.furthermore,the legislature maintains the registry system whereby private counsel are appointed in cases in which neither the public defender nor a regional counsel can provide representation.id 
beyond the process by which counsel is appointed to represent indigent persons,we also examine the provisions concerning the duties of both the public defender and the occcrc.this is because a comparison of the duties of each entity is directly relevant to determining whether the occcrc are in fact public defenders.as to the duties of the public defender,section,florida statutes entitled duties of the public defender,requires that it provide representation to any indigent person who is under arrest for or charged with a felony,a misdemeanor authorized to be prosecuted by the state attorney,violations of chapter punishable by imprisonment,criminal contempt,a violation of a local ordinance if the county has contracted with the public defender and the accused is subject to imprisonment upon conviction alleged to be a delinquent child pursuant to a petition filed in circuit court sought by petition to be involuntarily committed for mental illness under chapter,as a sexually violent predator under chapter,or to residential services as a person with developmental disabilities under chapter appealing a conviction and sentence of death to this court on direct appeal or appealing a matter in any of the preceding situations.see id.stat.similarly,the occcrc are required to provide representation to indigent defendants in exactly the same types of criminal cases as the public defender.see.stat.however,though the types of criminal cases handled may be the same,the fact that the occcrc only step in when the public defender has a conflict is key to our determination that the occcrc are not in fact public defenders.we will now endeavor to explain why we reach this conclusion.
whether the occcrc are de facto public defenders 
in deciding whether the occcrc are public defenders for purposes of the constitution,the court must essentially define their legal character.facdl relies almost exclusively on the legislature statements in sections,florida statutes,and,florida statutes,which define the occcrc as public defenders.in section,the legislature defines the offices of the public defenders to include the enumerated elements of the public defenders offices and five offices of criminal conflict and civil regional counsel.similarly,in section,the legislature states that the term public defenders offices includes the offices of criminal conflict and civil regional counsel.however,these two clauses are the only provisions in the act defining the occcrc as public defenders,are contained in chapter court system funding,and are used solely for purposes of implementing the constitutional guidelines concerning funding.
in the context of our constitutional inquiry in this case,we agree with the governor that the legal character of the occcrc should depend on what they do,not on how they might be characterized for purposes of funding.accordingly,we reject the assertion that the occcrc are public defenders simply because they are defined as such for the sole purposes of funding.rather,we focus on the duties of the occcrc as compared to those of the public defender.initially,as just discussed,we acknowledge that there is no difference between the types of criminal cases that are handled by the public defender and the occcrc.thus,there is some overlap between the occcrc and the public defender when it comes to the types of criminal cases each entity handles.
what is critical to our decision is that the occcrc are appointed in criminal cases only where the public defender must withdraw due to a conflict of interest.see.stat.therefore,the occcrc do not compete or otherwise act concurrently with the public is only when the public defender steps aside that a regional counsel steps in in fact,section was not revised by chapter.this is significant because,despite the creation of the occcrc,the public defender maintains primary responsibility for representation in all criminal cases,as it has since the public defender system was created in.moreover,by creating the occ
