background 
the constitution requires congress to conduct a decennial census in such manner as they shall by law direct for apportioning congressional representation to the states.const.art.i,cl.id.amend.xiv.by means of the census act,congress has delegated broad discretion to the secretary of commerce to conduct the census in such form and content as he may determine,including the use of sampling procedures and special surveys.a.the secretary,in turn,oversees the bureau of the census,an agency within the department of commerce responsible for conducting the decennial census.
although the constitution mandates only that the census be taken for reapportionment purposes,the census data is used for myriad other purposes.wisconsin city of,d describing secondary uses of census data.appellants challenge the census results because of their effect on the allotment of federal and state funds,as well as the redistricting of their respective state legislatures.
sampling and the census act 
at issue in this case is whether the secretary was required to statistically adjust the results of census pursuant to,as amended in.since,the bureau has employed sampling techniques to gather supplemental information regarding the population.bureau of the census,dep t of commerce,accuracy and coverage evaluation statement on the feasibility of using statistical methods to improve the accuracy of census,june,report.
in,the secretary requested that congress enact a law that would clearly authorize the use of sampling in conducting the census.utah evans,d citing legislative history dep t of commerce house of,d amended opinion same.in response,congress amended the census act by enacting,which provided that the secretary may,where he deems it appropriate,authorize the use of the statistical method known as sampling in carrying out the provisions of this title for purposes other than apportionment.census act of,stat,codified at see dep t of commerce,at.in,congress amended to provide 
except for the determination of population for purposes of apportionment of representatives in congress among the several states,the secretary shall,if he considers it feasible,authorize the use of the statistical method known as sampling in carrying out the provisions of this title.
census of population act of,stat,emphasis added.
since the enactment and revision of,the bureau has considered the use of statistical sampling to compensate for the error rate in the decennial census.in particular,it has studied the possibility of implementing statistical adjustments to the census data to compensate for the undercount of the population and the disproportionate undercount or differential undercount of racial and ethnic minorities,children,and renters.see.see also wisconsin,at.however,for both census and census and most recently for census,the secretary ultimately decided against the use of the statistically adjusted data as the official census and relied instead on the headcount data.id.at.
in,the bureau submitted a plan to congress for census.see bureau of the census,dep t of commerce,report to congress the plan for census,census plan.the census plan incorporated the findings of the national academy of sciences nas that sampling could be used as an alternative to traditional means of enumeration accordingly,the census plan provided for a limited use of sampling in ascertaining the population.significantly,the census plan would have resulted in one set of census results the initial headcount data adjusted by statistical sampling techniques.id.at.
the census plan precipitated legal challenges to the use of statistical sampling in determining the population.in,the supreme court held that the census act prohibits the proposed uses of statistical sampling in calculating the population for purposes of apportionment.dep t of commerce,at.following department of commerce,the bureau modified its plan to statistically adjust the census only for purposes other than apportionment.
the accuracy and coverage evaluation report 
on june,the bureau issued the report,which described the statistical methodology to be used for census.the report set forth the bureau preliminary determination that the use of the statistically adjusted data was feasible in terms of both the statutory deadline for releasing redistricting information and the improvement of the census accuracy.id.at.
the methodology is based on a dual system estimation,also referred to as.id.at.this statistical method compares the results of the initial census with those of surveys from sample blocks of the population to determine the under or of initial census data according to characteristics geography,age,sex,race,and housing status.id.it then extrapolates the rate of error for each group to the entire population and statistically adjusts the initial data on a nationwide scale.see generally wisconsin,at.colorfully describing by analogy to counting pumpkins in a large pumpkin patch.
the report made a preliminary determination that it was feasible to use the methodology to produce statistically adjusted census data by the april,statutory deadline.the report defined statutory term feasible as encompassing two components operational and technical feasibility.id.operational feasibility referred to the logistical possibility of adjustment in light of other aspects of the census plan,timing,and funding constraints.id.at.in contrast,technical feasibility referred to the determination that the use of sampling is expected to improve the overall accuracy of census data.id.
although the report reflected an initial prediction that the would improve the census,the bureau needed to study the data further to determine whether the had met its expectation of improv ing overall numeric and distributive accuracy and reduc ing the differential.id.at.the report recommended that statistical correction is appropriate absent strong evidence that it will degrade the overall quality of the final census data.id.however,it cautioned 
the census bureau will not release corrected redistricting data until it has brought its technical judgment to bear in assessing the available data to verify that its expectations have been met.the census bureau will consider operational data to validate the successful conduct of the,assess whether the measurements of undercount are consistent with historical patterns of undercount and independent demographic analysis benchmarks,and review measures of quality.
to ensure that the final decision was insulated from political manipulation,the bureau proposed that the executive steering committee for policy escap a committee of senior bureau officials and the effectiveness of and make a recommendation to the census bureau director regarding the use of the statistically corrected census data.id.at.
promulgation and revocation of the daley rule 
on october,former secretary of commerce william daley promulgated a rule in compliance with the procedures of the apa,delegating the adjustment decision to the director of the bureau report of tabulations of population to states and localities pursuant to c and availability of other population information,codified at a daley rule.the daley rule required that escap recommendation regarding the use of data be published.b.it also provided that the escap report would be released to the public and to the census director simultaneously.id.b.in addition,the daley rule required that the adjusted data be released to the public if the census director decided,against the recommendation of escap,not to use the adjusted data.id.b.
on february,secretary evans revoked the daley rule in all respects,except for the release of the escap report to the public.report of tabulations of population to states and localities pursuant to c and availability of other population information revocation of delegation of authority.the revocation did not provide for a public comment period,based on secretary evans finding that it was a rule of agency organization,procedure and practice.id.at citing b a.
the escap report 
in accordance with the report recommendations,escap studied the proposed statistical adjustment to census.as defined by regulation,escap was chaired by the bureau associate director for decennial census and included senior statisticians,demographers,and other senior professionals.b.on march,escap unanimously recommended against the use of the data.see executive committee for accuracy and coverage evaluation policy,recommendation concerning the methodology to be used in producing the tabulations of population reported to states and localities pursuant to c,escap report,report notice.
escap studied the operation of the according to the criteria set forth in the report,including conduct of key operations,consistency with historical measures of undercount,and quality measures.id.after many weeks of examining voluminous evidence,escap was unable to recommend the use of the data due to unresolved concerns about its reliability.id.at.in particular,escap found that the data diverged widely from the demographic analysis estimate of the undercount and reflected possible synthetic and balancing errors.although further research may have proved the data to be more accurate,escap uncertainty due to these concerns is too large at this time to allow for a recommendation to adjust.id.
adjustment decision 
following the release of the escap report,the acting director of the bureau,william barron,adopted escap recommendation not to use the data for redistricting purposes.subsequently,secretary evans adopted both the acting director and escap recommendation not to use the data and directed that only the unadjusted data be released for purposes of redistricting.
procedural history 
on february,appellants brought this lawsuit against secretary evans,challenging his revocation of the daley rule without notice and comment.following the release of the escap report and secretary evans adjustment decision,appellants moved for a temporary restraining order and injunctive relief on the grounds that secretary evans adjustment decision deprived them of federal and state funding as well as proper representation in their respective state legislatures.they argued that the adjustment decision violated because he had decided against the use of sampling even though it was feasible.
the district court denied both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and dismissed the action.applying the standard set forth in chevron,natural resources defense council,d,the district court found that deference to secretary evans interpretation of was appropriate because the statute did not reveal congress intent regarding the secretary obligation to release the adjusted data.in addition,the district court found secretary evans interpretation of to be a permissible construction of the statute.finally,the district court concluded that escap application of this standard was reasonable in light of the inconsistency of the data with the demographic analysis,as well as concerns with synthetic and balancing errors.accordingly,the district court upheld secretary evans adjustment decision.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court interpretation of.silver sage partners,city of desert hot springs,cir.we must affirm its decision to deny injunctive relief unless it incorrectly applied the law,relied on clearly erroneous factual findings,or otherwise abused its discretion.contract servs.network,aubry,cir.
iii.discussion 
in this case,appellants seek to enjoin secretary evans adjustment decision as violative of because,they contend,the use of the data for redistricting purposes was feasible.in addition,appellants argue that secretary evans adjustment decision was invalid because the authority to make that decision had been delegated to the director of the bureau under the daley rule,and his revocation of the rule failed to comply with the apa procedures.
legality of secretary adjustment decision under 
this is not the first time that the secretary of commerce adjustment decision has been the subject of a legal challenge.following census,the supreme court upheld the secretary decision not to statistically adjust the census as well within the constitutional bounds of discretion over the conduct of the census.wisconsin,at.more recently,the supreme court held in department of commerce that prohibited the secretary from statistically adjusting the census for purposes of apportionment.at.in this case,we are called upon to answer a question not answered by either wisconsin or department of commerce whether imposes an obligation on the secretary to statistically adjust the census for redistricting purposes 
in reviewing secretary evans interpretation of,we follow the test established in chevron.first,we must determine whether congress intent is clear as to the precise issue involved.chevron,at.if we answer this question in the affirmative,our inquiry is at an end.id.at.however,if the statute is ambiguous as to the question at issue,then we go to the second step and determine the meaning of the statute language by giving deference to the governing agency interpretation of the statute language.royal foods rjr holdings,cir citing chevron,at.
statutory analysis of 
our starting point in construing is the language of the statute itself.id.citing chevron,at.we look to the text of the statute to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.id.quoting robinson shell oil,d.
the relevant provision of states that the secretary shall,if he considers it feasible,authorize the use of the statistical method known as sampling in carrying out the provisions of this title.from the statutory language,the parties ascribe very different meanings.appellants urge us to find that creates a presumption in favor of the adjusted data and admits of little administrative discretion.appellees,on the other hand,argue that confers broad discretion upon the secretary to determine in what instances and against what standard the use of sampling should be found feasible 
confers discretion upon the secretary 
first,we disagree with appellants that creates a presumption in favor of the adjusted data.appellants conflate the secretary feasibility determination with what should follow from his finding of feasibility.thus,appellants conveniently skip over the critical first the secretary considered it feasible to adopt the adjusted data as the official census for redistricting purposes.yet,the operation of hinges entirely on this condition.
our reading of the plain statutory text is that the combination of terms shall and if he considers it feasible demonstrates congress intent to strongly encourage the use of sampling while conferring meaningful discretion upon the secretary to determine whether statistics should be used in any given instance.the language of is straightforward.it requires the secretary to incorporate the use of statistical methodologies in the taking of the census if and where he considers it feasible.by its plain terms,the statute directs the secretary to use sampling,but only if he considers it feasible.as a corollary,no sampling need be used if the secretary does not consider it feasible.
section does not specify under what conditions the secretary should find the use of sampling feasible.nowhere does state,as appellants would have us read it,that the secretary should presume that statistical information is more reliable than unadjusted headcount data,or that he should strain to find the use of sampling feasible even though he is not fully certain about the ramifications of that choice.instead,the statute vests discretion in the secretary both to set the standard for feasibility and to decide whether that standard has been met.
ignoring the clear statutory language if he considers it feasible,appellants argue that requires the secretary to statistically adjust the census if feasible.however,it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.trw andrews,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,we can not accept appellants proposed statutory interpretation because it renders the if he considers it portion of the phrase meaningless.
in addition,appellants argue that the statutory language in creates a presumption in favor of the adjusted data.they cite board of pardons allen,d,as support for the proposition that the use of the term shall,followed by the discretionary language if he considers it,creates a presumption in favor of doing that which is the subject of the statute.however,allen itself reveals the error in appellants argument.
in allen,the supreme court held that a montana statute created a liberty interest in parole when it provided that the parole board shall release on parole any prisoner when in its opinion there is reasonable probability that the prisoner can be released without detriment to the prisoner or to the community.at.first ellipses in original quoting.code ann.in holding that the parole statute created a presumption of release once the predicate conditions had been found,the supreme court did not engraft on the statute a presumption that the parole board find the prisoner did not pose a danger to herself or to the community rather,the parole board retained very broad discretion to determine whether those conditions had been met in the first place.see id.at.relying on greenholtz inmates of.penal corr.complex,d.
similarly,does not stack the deck in favor of a finding of feasibility by creating a presumption that the adjusted data is more accurate than the unadjusted or headcount data.we would be remiss if we were to interpret in such a way as to require the secretary to statistically adjust the census even if he and a panel of experts were uncertain as to the reliability of the adjusted data,just as the montana legislature surely did not intend for the state parole board to release a prisoner whose potential for future detriment could not be ascertained.the better reading of the statute is that congress intended to strongly encourage the use of sampling however,it left to the secretary meaningful discretion whether a sampling methodology should be used in any given instance.
viewing in the context of the census act as a whole,we are further convinced that congress has delegated to the secretary discretion to choose appropriate methodologies and different sampling techniques.most notably,a confers broad discretion to the secretary to conduct the census in such form and content as he may determine,including the use of sampling procedures and special surveys.a.
because congress conditioned the use of sampling on the secretary consideration of its feasibility,does not create a presumption in favor of statistical adjustment of the census,nor does it require the secretary to consider the adjusted data as the default data for census.instead,grants broad discretion upon the secretary to consider as an initial matter what uses of sampling are feasible.
b.the term feasible is ambiguous 
appellants also argue that admits of little administrative discretion because the secretary is empowered to decide only whether a use of sampling is minimally feasible,capable of being done,executed,or effected.however,unlike other cases in which the statutory term feasible was limited to physical possibility,this proposed definition would run counter to the statutory objectives of the census act.thus,we find that the term feasible as used in is an ambiguous term left open to the secretary reasonable interpretation.
it is well established that we must consider the context in ascertaining the meaning of the statute.brower evans,cir.the context relevant to our analysis relates to the design of the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.id.quoting united states,d.we may consider the purpose of the statute in its entirety,and whether the proposed interpretation would frustrate or advance that purpose.id.quoting united states mohrbacher,cir.
appellants do not dispute the fact that the overall goal of the census act is accuracy.see wisconsin,at.so stating.yet,their proposed definition of feasible would run counter to this goal.their proposed definition would require the secretary to use sampling so long as it was capable of being done even if the methodology was flawed and produced skewed results.thus,feasible must mean more than sheer physical or financial possibility.indeed,the plain meaning of feasible incorporates whether a particular action is capable of being successfully done or accomplished.black law dictionary ed emphasis added.whether a task can be done successfully necessarily derives its meaning from the objective at hand.because the fundamental objective of the census act is accuracy,the use of sampling could not be successful if its methodology or result was inaccurate.
accordingly,must be read in light of the overall purpose of the census act in order to avoid flawed results.nevertheless,it is unclear to what extent the secretary may consider accuracy in his feasibility determination.must he be,or certain that the use of sampling would produce accurate results section leaves these questions unanswered.because does not specify the circumstances under which the secretary must find sampling feasible,the statutory term remains ambiguous.see biodiversity legal found.babbitt,cir finding that statutory phrase to the maximum extent practicable was ambiguous because its ordinary meaning did not specif y the circumstances under which the agency could forgo its statutory deadline.
further,the choice of language if he considers it as a of feasible demonstrates that congress intended for the secretary to make such judgment calls.this phrase indicates that congress did not intend to limit the secretary discretion to a finding of whether a particular use of sampling is capable of being done.rather,it left the choice to the secretary as to whether sampling could be used,bringing to bear his expertise on the effectiveness of different statistical methodologies and their compatibility with the other aspects of the census.thus,unlike other cases in which the agency had little administrative discretion in making a feasibility determination,reflects congress intent for the secretary to strike a balance as to the feasibility of using sampling in any given instance.see citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d holding that discretion was severely constrained when statute forbid construction on any public parkland unless there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such land quoting,supp.v am.textile mfrs,donovan,d holding that congress had struck policy balance in enacting statute that agency shall set the standard which most adequately assures,to the extent feasible,that no employee will suffer health detriments quoting b.
in sum,by providing an open definition of feasible,qualifying it further with the language if he considers it feasible,and refraining from the inclusion of any criteria to guide the secretary decision,the statute conferred discretion upon the secretary to establish his own standard for determining the feasibility of using the adjusted data emphasis added.thus,the secretary interpretation of need only be reasonable.chevron,at.
secretary interpretation of 
because we have concluded that congress has not spoken to the precise question at issue,we must defer to the secretary interpretation of.we will uphold his interpretation so long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.if his reading fills a gap or defines a term in a reasonable way in light of the legislature design,we give that reading controlling weight,even if it is not the answer we would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.regions hosp.shalala,d quoting chevron,at.
the secretary interpreted statutory term feasible as having two components operational feasibility logistical possibility and technical feasibility increased accuracy.at.operational feasibility refers to the bureau ability to conduct the with available resources and within required deadlines or time frames.id.at.technical feasibility,on the other hand,refers to whether the statistical methodology will improve the accuracy of the census for uses of the data.id.
the report set forth an objective framework for evaluating the technical feasibility of the data according to the conduct of key operations,the consistency of the results with historical measures of undercount,and measures of quality.the report stated that its preliminary analysis had led it to expect that the will improve overall numeric and distributive accuracy and that it will reduce the differential undercount.id.thus,it tentatively recommended that statistical correction is appropriate absent strong evidence that it will degrade the overall quality of the final census data.id.nevertheless,it refrained from making a final determination until after escap had studied the data in light of the above criteria.id.subsequently,escap adopted the report criteria for evaluating the feasibility of statistical adjustment and studied the effectiveness of the data to see if its expectations for improved accuracy had,in fact,been met.
we find that this interpretation of is a permissible reading of the statute.the secretary definition of feasible reflects the plain meaning of the term feasible,whether the adjustment of census was capable of being successfully done or accomplished.black law dictionary ed.the inclusion of accuracy in the secretary interpretation of feasible is reasonable in light of congress objective to attaining as accurate a census as possible.see regions,at.further,the criteria by which the data were to be evaluated creates an appropriate standard against which the achievement of improved accuracy could be assessed.
appellants accept the report as the proper for guiding the secretary adjustment decision.but,they argue that the report established a legal standard,which bound the secretary to order adjustment unless he found strong evidence that it would degrade the overall census results.
appellants argument is unavailing.it is clear from the context of the report that its determinations were tentative in nature.although the report suggested that strong evidence should be found in order to decide against adjustment,the report cautioned that the bureau still needed to conduct an objective review before making a final determination to release the statistically corrected data.it concluded that the bureau will not release corrected redistricting data until it has brought its technical judgment to bear in assessing the available data to verify that its expectations of improved accuracy have been met.id.at.
in addition,the statements made in the report did not have the force of law because the report was not the product of a formal adjudication or rulemaking.see christensen harris county,d holding that opinion letters and other interpretations that are not arrived at after,for example,a formal adjudication or rulemaking lack the force of law and do not warrant deference.therefore,we need not defer to its statements implying that statistical adjustment would be presumed unless the secretary was able to point to strong evidence of unreliability.id.
accordingly,the report did not limit escap discretion to a strong evidence determination.instead,the report set forth an objective framework for guiding escap analysis of the operational success of the according to certain specified criteria.moreover,it made clear that the use of the adjusted data was contingent on escap verification of its expectancy that the would improve the census overall.
secretary feasibility determination 
having found that the secretary permissibly interpreted,we must next decide whether his adjustment decision was arbitrary or capricious.under the apa,the secretary adjustment decision must stand unless it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
we have held that a decision is considered arbitrary and capricious if the agency relied on irrelevant factors,failed to consider a crucial aspect of the issue before it,offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.midwater trawlers.dep t of commerce,cir quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,d.our inquiry must be searching and careful,but the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one.marsh or.natural res.council,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we must not substitute our judgment for that of the secretary.see id.
in determining that the use of the data was not feasible,would not improve the accuracy of the census,escap considered the criteria set forth in the report.the escap report stated that its study included a consideration of operational data to validate the successful conduct of the whether the measures of undercount were consistent with historical patterns of undercount and independent demographic analysis benchmarks and a review of quality measures.following weeks of studying voluminous evidence,escap found some disturbing inconsistencies and possible errors in the methodology.because it was unable to resolve its concerns in the time available,it recommended against the release of the adjusted data for redistricting purposes.id.at.
in analyzing the data,escap found a surprising inconsistency between the da demographic analysis and estimates.id.at.whereas the demographic analysis estimated that the unadjusted census overcounted the population by million persons,the indicated that the census had undercounted the population by million persons.id.at.even assuming that undocumented immigration had doubled during the,the demographic analysis estimated an undercount of only million persons.id.at.although the source of the problem could also have been the census data or the demographic analysis techniques,escap had pinpointed other concerns about corruption of the data and,therefore,concluded that the inconsistency might be attributable to an undiscovered problem in the or census methodology.id.at see also id.at.
two factors,in particular,called into question the reliability of the data.first,escap expressed concern that synthetic error might have corrupted the data.id.at.synthetic error,in this case,may have resulted from the assumption that persons in a particular group would be undercounted by the initial census consistently nationwide.id.based on its studies,escap found that synthetic error might have led to an error in estimating the population of certain groups by as much as.id.at.
second,escap was concerned that balancing error had occurred.id.the was conducted by use of two different surveys the an independent survey used to measure missed persons and the a of census records used to measure erroneous inclusion of persons.id.balancing error may have occurred because the and the were handled differently,with more time and effort spent on the.id.accordingly,escap found that the error could introduce an upward bias in the data,thereby explaining the greater undercount found by the id.
based on these reasons,escap recommended against the use of the data.it explained 
the escap recommendation to use the unadjusted data was a difficult one.the committee conducted a number of analyses directed at understanding the inconsistency with demographic analysis and the synthetic and balancing error issues,but could not find a complete explanation in the time available.the committee believes it likely that further research may establish that adjustment based on the would result in improved accuracy.however,the uncertainty due to these concerns is too large at this time to allow for a recommendation to adjust.
appellants argue that the escap report misapplied the strong evidence standard set forth in the report and reversed the presumption in favor of the adjusted data.their argument rests upon statements in the escap report that the majority of the evidence suggested the adjusted data was more accurate.however,appellants mischaracterize the record.each of escap statements regarding the improved accuracy of the adjusted data was tempered with escap concern regarding possible errors in the data or methodology 
moreover,appellants unpersuasively attempt to construct a legal standard out of a scientific inquiry.we agree with the district court reasoning that t he meaning of strong evidence should not be gauged by comparison to legally derived standards of proof,such as preponderance of the evidence.city of los angeles evans,no,slip op.at.rather,considering that escap study was a technical assessment of the data,s trong evidence in that context was meant to mean the sort of evidence that would give professionals in the field pause before recommending the use of the adjusted data.id.
in the alternative,appellants challenge the strength of the evidence against the data,asserting that escap was being overcautious.they point to one article,which has asserted that escap concerns were weak and derivative in nature.see margo anderson stephen fienberg,counting and estimation methodology for improving the quality of censuses.
however,because the determination as to whether escap concerns were warranted requires a high level of technical expertise,we must defer to the informed discretion of the responsible federal agenc y.marsh,at.quoting kleppe sierra club,d.as one district court aptly observed,disputes regarding the bureau use of statistics in taking the census are best resolved not by the courts but by the bureau itself,whose experience with prior censuses and expertise in the collection and analysis of statistical information render it especially qualified to make the appropriate decisions.city of philadelphia klutznick.
we can not substitute our judgment for that of the agency charged with administering.marsh,at.under our narrow standard of review,it is sufficient that the bureau panel of experts decided,based on their consideration of the relevant factors,that the data carried too high a risk of a fundamental flaw and could not be certain within the time frame allotted that the adjusted data would improve the accuracy of the census given the substantial divergence of the data from the demographic analysis,as well as concerns with synthetic and balancing error,we can not say that the secretary adoption of escap recommendation not to use the adjusted data was arbitrary or capricious.therefore,we uphold his adjustment decision.
revocation of daley rule 
appellants raise an additional challenge to secretary evans adjustment decision.appellants argue that he did not have the authority to make the decision because it had been delegated to the director of the bureau by the daley rule.further,they assert that secretary evans attempt to revoke this rule was ineffective because it failed to comply with the apa procedures.
assuming arguendo that the daley rule was substantive and that the revocation was accomplished improperly,the revocation was harmless error because the director of the bureau also adopted escap recommendation not to use the statistically adjusted data for purposes of redistricting.see riverbend farms,madigan,cir holding that apa requires us to take due account of harmless error.in other words,we know that the result would have been exactly the same even if the delegation had remained in place all,including the director of the bureau,rejected the use of the adjusted data.thus,we decline to overturn the secretary adjustment decision on the basis that it was violative of the apa procedures.
iv.conclusion 
section confers broad discretion on the secretary to decide if and when sampling is feasible in the taking of the decennial census.we find that secretary evans interpretation of the statute,as permitting him to consider accuracy as a component of feasibility,was a permissible construction of the statute.further,his decision not to statistically adjust census was neither arbitrary nor capricious.finally,no harm flowed from any violation of the apa procedures.therefore,we uphold secretary evans adjustment decision.because we affirm the district court dismissal of the action,we need not address the question whether injunctive relief would have been an appropriate remedy in this case.
section of the census act requires that,for purposes other than apportionment,the secretary of commerce shall authorize the use of statistical sampling methods to compensate for errors in the census if he considers it feasible.the majority approves the secretary decision not to authorize statistical sampling,although the record shows that the secretary did not consider whether such sampling was feasible,or at least did not base his decision on that consideration,as the statute requires.furthermore,even if the secretary had considered whether sampling was feasible,he could not have reached the conclusion that he did under a reasonable definition of the word feasible.
no census has ever succeeded in counting every person residing in the united states.the census,according to the census bureau estimate,resulted in an undercount of,or million people.bureau of the census,dep t of commerce,report to plan for census,at revised hereinafter plan for census.studies by the bureau since have also shown that,decade after decade,some groups of people are much more severely undercounted than others.groups subject to this differential undercount include racial and ethnic minorities,children under the age of,and people who rent rather than own their homes 
the differential undercount has a profound and unjust effect on polities and communities in which members of undercounted groups disproportionately reside.billions of dollars of state and federal funds marked for distribution on the basis of population are,in fact,distributed on the basis of these inaccurate census data.see,waterhouse coopers,effect of census undercount on federal funding to states and local areas,at i study prepared for census monitoring board.states also use the census figures as their measure of population when redrawing election districts.plan for census,at.the result is that residents of some places with large numbers of racial and ethnic minorities,children,and less than their fair share of public funds and services and wield less than their proportionate share of electoral power.
statistical sampling is a means of correcting the undercount and the inequities it causes.it was for this purpose that congress in amended of the census act to its current form,requiring the secretary to use statistical sampling if he considers it feasible,stat,codified as amended at.in,in response to the inaccuracy of the census,congress went still further,directing the commerce department to contract with the national academy of sciences nas to study the means by which the government could achieve the most accurate population count possible.decennial census improvement act of,a,stat.the act specifically required the nas to consider the appropriateness of using sampling methods,in combination with basic techniques or otherwise,in the acquisition or refinement of population data.id.b.
it is important to observe how these two pieces of legislation work together.the amendment to the census act instructs the secretary that if he considers sampling to be feasible,he must authorize its use the act establishes a specific method for consider ing the use of sampling,namely a scientific evaluation to be conducted by the nas.
the nas did conduct a study and concluded not only that sampling was appropriate,but furthermore that improved coverage or data quality could not be achieved by traditional census methods of physical enumeration,even with additional funding.see plan for census,at quoting nas panel.t o continue trying to count every last person physically,the nas reported,is fruitless.id.following the various nas analyses,the census bureau prepared a report to congress in that included a plan for census providing for a limited use of sampling in order to ensure an accurate and census.id.at.the bureau accuracy and coverage evaluation report,issued in june,provided a detailed evaluation of the feasibility of the proposed method of statistical sampling and concluded that it was both operationally and technically feasible,and that barring unforeseen circumstances the adjusted data will be more accurate than the uncorrected data.accuracy and coverage evaluation.then secretary of commerce william daley adopted these conclusions,although a final decision about whether to issue adjusted numbers was deferred until the data were collected and analyzed for reliability.
after a change in administration following the disputed presidential election of,however,the executive steering committee on policy escap,the committee of the census bureau charged with evaluating the effectiveness of the sampling program,issued a report recommending the release of the unadjusted figures,rather than the corrected figures,as the official census data.escap made this recommendation despite its own evaluation that the was a design and operational success,that the operations appear to have been in control,performed as expected,and produced data as good or better than the data produced by the survey,and that u nder what the committee considered reasonable assumptions,state,congressional district,and county level analyses showed a marked improvement for adjustment.notice of recommendation and report.
escap based its recommendation not to use the figures on its lack of certainty that sampling would improve the accuracy of the census.id.at.it cited an unexplained discrepancy between those figures and those that resulted from the bureau demographic analysis da,which provides an independent benchmark for evaluating census data.id.at.escap concluded that the discrepancy most likely resulted from one of the following three causes inaccuracies in the census,resulting in incorrect assumptions for the da inaccuracies originating in the da itself,or inaccuracies in the census,as corrected by the id.at.in other words,escap recommended against using the figures because one of the possible causes of the discrepancy between those figures and the da involved a problem with the figures,and despite the fact that a majority of the evidence indicates both the continued existence of a differential undercount of the population and the superior accuracy of the adjusted numbers.id.at.although it found that the adjusted numbers were probably superior,escap recommended against using them because of t he potential for a reversal of these findings.id.at emphasis added.as the escap concluded,the experts could not be certain within the time frame allotted that the adjusted data would improve the accuracy of the census.id.at.that,as i explain below,does not constitute a determination as to feasibility,or even a consideration of that question.
the da and the did agree in one important respect both showed that census perpetuated the historic phenomenon of the differential undercount.id.at.
acting census bureau director william barron,who was a member of escap,forwarded to the newly appointed secretary of commerce donald evans his recommendation that the secretary not release the adjusted data.on march,secretary evans adopted the escap recommendation and ordered that the unadjusted data be released for redistricting and federal funding purposes.
because this court is required to review a federal agency implementation of its governing statute,the majority is correct that the proper mode of analysis is the framework established in chevron natural resources defense council,d.first,the court must examine the statutory language at issue to determine whether congress provided a clear directive to the agency.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,however,the statute does not provide a clear answer,the court must uphold the agency interpretation if it is reasonable.id.at.
the statutory language at issue provides that the secretary shall,if he considers it feasible,authorize the use of the statistical method known as sampling in carrying out the provisions of this title.in my view,the secretary violated the clear intent of congress by failing to base his decision on a consider ation of whether sampling was feasible.i would therefore consider the matter settled under chevron step one.furthermore,even if i were persuaded that the secretary did consider feasibility,i believe the record precludes a finding that he considered sampling not to be feasible under any reasonable definition of the word.in short,any conclusion that he reached would necessarily be arbitrary and capricious.i would,therefore,hold that his decision must be rejected under chevron step two as well.
under the majority interpretation,does not require the secretary to do anything rather,congress use of the word shall merely demonstrates congress intent to strongly encourage the use of sampling,at emphasis added.courts,however,do not customarily ascribe to the word shall the sense of encourage ment.to the contrary,long established supreme court law describes the word shall as creating a mandatory obligation.see,lopez davis,d the statute use of the permissive may contrasts with congress use of a mandatory shall elsewhere in the statute to impose discretionless obligations lexecon,milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach,d the panel instruction comes in terms of the mandatory shall,which normally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion.
the mandatory effect of the word shall in this instance is confirmed by the statutory history.before the amendments,was highly permissive.as adopted in,it read,t he secretary may,where he deems it appropriate,authorize the statistical method known as sampling,stat.emphasis added.the amendments replaced the permissive may with the mandatory shall t he secretary shall,if he considers it feasible,authorize the statistical method known as sampling,stat,emphasis added.this change in language clearly evinces congressional intent to create a mandatory obligation on the part of the secretary.under the majority interpretation,however,the new language has precisely the same effect as the old.see united states redman,cir the amendment of language must properly be understood as evidence of an intent to abandon the standard established by the old language in favor of something different.
by changing the language of the statute from may to shall,congress demonstrated a clear preference for the use of sampling and limited the scope of the secretary discretion to prevent its use.the may of the provision allowed the secretary to base his determination whether to authorize sampling on whatever factors he reasonably found relevant,including whether as a general or abstract matter he considered sampling to be a more desirable process than employing unadjusted data.the decision whether to use sampling might properly have involved a wide range of philosophical and public policy issues.before,the secretary was invited to weigh all such considerations in making his determination.by amending the statute,however,congress effectively answered the indefinite range of policy answered them in favor of sampling.it concluded that sampling is to be used,when and if feasible.the determination as to feasibility was vested in the secretary,who was to exercise his reasoned discretion in making that judgment.under the amended statute,the secretary discretion is limited to one consideration whether he considers sampling to be feasible in the particular instance.he may not consider whether samplin
