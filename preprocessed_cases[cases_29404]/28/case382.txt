the oklahoma constitution grants its citizens the right to propose laws and amendments to the constitution and to enact or reject the same at the polls independent of the legislature through the initiative and referendum processes.const.art.v.to place an initiative to amend the oklahoma constitution on the ballot,a proponent must gather signatures totaling fifteen percent of the total number of votes cast at the last general election for the state office receiving the highest number of votes.const.art.v.the signatures must be gathered within days of the filing of the petition.stat.ann.tit.

under oklahoma law,the secretary of state does not count signatures gathered by circulators.stat.ann.tit,requiring the petition circulator to swear by affidavit to be an elector in order for the gathered signatures to be counted.const.art.iii,defining elector as all citizens of the united states,over the age of eighteen years,who are bona fide residents of this state see also in re initiative petition,striking all signatures gathered by circulators in re initiative petition,disqualifying signatures gathered by an individual who was not a qualified elector.in addition,who circulate petitions face criminal penalties including fines imprisonment.stat.ann.tit.
plaintiff yes on term limits,yotl is an oklahoma organization seeking to place on the ballot a proposed amendment to the oklahoma constitution imposing term limits for various state offices.plaintiff robert murphy is the vice president of yotl and an oklahoma resident.plaintiffs sherri ferrell and eric rittberg are professional petition circulators.neither ferrell nor rittberg is a resident of oklahoma.yotl and murphy wish to hire professional circulators,including ferrell and rittberg,to aid in the signature gathering process.ferrell and rittberg claim they would work for yotl if not for the ban on circulators.
yotl and murphy contend there are not enough professional circulators who are oklahoma residents to gather the required signatures.in addition,they contend that hiring professional,circulators is significantly more and effective than hiring and training resident circulators.this is so,they argue,because professional circulators do not have to go through the training process.in addition,they claim professional circulators have greater productivity due to prior experience with the difficulties of signature gathering and strong incentives to collect valid signatures in order to remain marketable in their field.
plaintiffs filed suit in the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma against susan savage,individually and in her official capacity as oklahoma secretary of state,and drew edmondson,individually and in his official capacity as oklahoma attorney general.plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the civil and criminal enforcement provisions of oklahoma ban on circulators under the first amendment,privileges and immunities clause,and dormant commerce clause of the united states constitution.the district court concluded plaintiffs had standing to challenge the civil provisions of the ban,but lacked standing as to the criminal provisions because they could not establish injury in fact.thus,plaintiffs could move forward only with their claims against the secretary of state.
the district court first considered whether the ban violates the first amendment.it applied a strict scrutiny analysis to the ban,concluding oklahoma had a compelling interest in protecting and policing both the integrity and reliability of its initiative process and the ban was narrowly tailored to meet this compelling interest.
in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied heavily on oklahoma evidence calling into question the integrity of certain circulators,including rittberg.oklahoma presented evidence that during his career as a professional circulator,rittberg falsely claimed to be a resident of colorado failed to register as required in missouri before circulating petitions in that state and was part of a team of circulators in montana who unlawfully attested to signatures gathered outside of their presence and engaged in bait and switch tactics 
the district court also relied on evidence regarding oklahoma experience with circulators in the taxpayer bill of rights tabor petition drive in.oklahoma presented evidence that during the tabor drive,circulators unlawfully participated in signature gathering.in addition,some circulators listed motel addresses as their permanent residences.the evidence demonstrated that the motels did not have residence information for a number of these circulators.thus,they were extremely difficult for the tabor petition protestants to locate.due to the motel addresses and lack of cooperation from the petition proponents and circulators,the protestants could not question many of the circulators within the protest period.the oklahoma supreme court eventually invalidated the tabor petition,citing criminal wrongdoing and fraud in the initiative process.in re initiative petition,at.
the district court found this evidence demonstrative of the questionable integrity of circulators and the difficulties of policing the petition process when circulators participate.thus,the court concluded the ban was necessary to protect the integrity and reliability of the petition process.moreover,the court concluded the ban was narrowly tailored to protect the integrity of the process.the court reasoned that circulators have already demonstrated a propensity to flout state laws regarding the petition process and oklahoma has no way to compel the circulators to return to the state for questioning.in addition,the district court found the ban allows oklahoma to more effectively police the petition process,since resident circulators are easily located and subject to the state subpoena power.finally,the district court rejected plaintiffs proposal that circulators agree to return to oklahoma in the event of a dispute and have their gathered signatures stricken if they fail to return.according to the court,the agreement to return would be unenforceable and the proposed penalty of striking petition signatures would disenfranchise oklahoma voters.
the district court then rejected plaintiffs privileges and immunities clause and dormant commerce clause claims because the ban survived the more stringent first amendment analysis.plaintiffs appeal to this court.
