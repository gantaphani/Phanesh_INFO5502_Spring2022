the secretary of state for the state of colorado state appeals the district court grant of summary judgment which held that the state imposition of additional qualifications on a person seeking federal office violated article i,cl.of the united states constitution.we have jurisdiction under and,for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
the state denied douglas campbell nomination by petition as a candidate for election to the united states house of representatives for the november,election.campbell sought a preliminary injunction against the state in the court below,which was denied.the state then moved to dismiss,and the district court transformed the pleadings into for summary judgment under.c.
the material facts are not in dispute in july,campbell,sought access to the ballot as an unaffiliated candidate for the united states house of representatives for the second congressional district of colorado through nomination by petition.under colorado law,n o person is eligible to be a designee or candidate for office unless that person fully meets the qualifications of that office as stated in the constitution and statutes of this state on or before the date the term of that office begins.ann.
campbell was a resident of arvada,colorado,and at the time he submitted his nominating petition to the state,he was not a registered voter.in august,the state informed campbell that his name would not appear on the november ballot because he was not registered to vote in colorado as required under.ann.g.specifically,g states 
no person shall be placed in nomination by petition unless the person is an eligible elector of the political subdivision or district in which the officer is to be elected and unless the person was registered as unaffiliated,as shown on the books of the county clerk and recorder,for at least twelve months prior to the last date the petition may be filed.
the district court found that this provision violated the qualifications clause of the united states constitution,which provides 
no person shall be a representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years,and been seven years a citizen of the united states,and who shall not,when elected,be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen.
art.i,cl.specifically,the district court stated that the provision 
imposes three restrictions on persons seeking election to the house of representatives that are not found in the united states constitution.each is a contradiction of the constitutional language.first,the nominees must reside in the particular district in which they seek election the constitution permits residence anywhere in the state of election.second,voter registration in colorado requires residency in the state for at least thirty days.the constitution requires state residency only when elected.third,colorado prohibits voter registration by convicted felons serving sentences or on parole.see.the constitution contains no such restriction on election to congress.
app.at.the district court entered summary judgment in favor of campbell.this appeal timely followed.
ii.discussion 
a.the registration requirement 
the state emphasizes that the statute registration requirement is a valid exercise of the state power because it serves an important regulatory interest.specifically,the state likens g to the california statute at issue in storer brown,d distinguishes g from an impermissible substantive qualification characterizes the statute requirement to register as procedural in nature suggests the statute serves to inform the electorate at large and claims the statute encourages a representative democracy.we shall consider each contention in turn.
the elections clause 
the state contends that g is not an additional qualification but rather an enhancement to the state authority to regulate its ballot under the elections clause of the united states constitution.the elections clause provides that the times,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof const.art.i,cl.that the states maintain a discretionary power over elections,a power restricted to the procedural regulation of the times,places and manner of elections,is not in dispute.the federalist see also the federalist examining the potential danger of confiding the ultimate right of regulating its own elections to the union itself.see,libertarian party of illinois rednour,cir holding that illinois ballot access petitioning requirements were entirely procedural.
the supreme court has recognized that states have a legitimate interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot.illinois state bd.of elections socialist workers party,d.the elections clause gives states authority to enact the numerous requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to enforce the fundamental right involved,without the abridgment of fundamental rights.term limits,thornton,d striking down arkansas term limits for election to congress internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the state suggests that the district court should have applied a more flexible approach,weighing the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments against the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.burdick takushi,d quoting anderson celebrezze,d.under burdick,because campbell does not allege that g is discriminatory,the state need only show an important regulatory interest.see id.the state purports that regulation of the ballot satisfies this interest.
regulatory interest 
in support of its regulatory interest,the state relies heavily on storer brown,d,in which the supreme court upheld california sore loser ballot restriction.that provision limited independent candidate access to those candidates who were not affiliated at any time in the preceding one year with a qualified political party,thus prohibiting a candidate from losing a party primary and running as an independent.the court stated that the requirement no more establishes an additional requirement for the office of representative than the requirement that the candidate win the primary to secure a place on the general ballot or otherwise demonstrate substantial community support.id.at.the state contends that storer disaffiliation requirement is analogous to colorado requirement of registration as a disaffiliated candidate and should therefore be upheld.campbell distinguishes storer requirement as a general state policy aimed at maintaining the integrity of the various routes to the ballot.id.at.
applying the flexible standard of the character and magnitude of the asserted injury against the state proffered regulatory agree that the regulation involved in storer is distinguishable from the registration requirement in the case at hand.in storer,the court recognized that the requirement served to prevent a losing candidate from continuing the struggle and to limit the names on the ballot to those who have won the primaries and those independents who have properly qualified.id.at.it required the candidate to demonstrate a significant amount of public support before she gained access to the ballot,thereby winnow ing out and finally reject ing all but the chosen candidates.id.it also further ed the state interests in the stability of its political system,id.at,without discriminating against independents.see id.at.the sore loser disaffiliation requirement was therefore a valid exercise of california power under article.see id.at.
in contrast,here,colorado registration requirement does little to winnow out chosen candidates,but rather completely excludes those who have not registered.in storer,disaffiliation did not require a candidate to register,but only to be clear of political party affiliations for a year before the primary.id.at.in fact,the independent party candidate must not have been registered with another party for a year before he files his declaration.id.at.emphasis supplied.the colorado registration requirement does not
