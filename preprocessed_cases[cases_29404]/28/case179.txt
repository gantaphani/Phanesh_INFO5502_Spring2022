geneal warf and glenn the warf appellants,individually and on behalf of a class of absentee voters,appeal the district court order denying their motion for a preliminary injunction and granting summary judgment to the board of elections of green county,the and members of the board of elections,the county of green county,kentucky and billy joe lowe,on the warf appellants claim of unconstitutional disenfranchisement.the warf appellants allege that their voting rights under the fourteenth amendment were violated by a kentucky state trial court judgment that declared void all votes cast by absentee ballot in the general election for the office of green county clerk.the district court determined that the kentucky trial court decision to void every absentee ballot cast followed kentucky precedent and therefore did not rely on rules,standards,and procedures in violation of due process.
for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the facts underlying the voters challenge arise from the election for the office of green county court clerk.the november,general election held in green county,kentucky featured a race for the office of court clerk between the incumbent democratic candidate,carolyn scott scott,and the republican challenger,billy joe lowe lowe.after the polls closed,the board of elections of green county board of elections certified scott as the winner of the election as she received the majority of the total votes cast.although lowe received the majority of votes cast by machine,scott received enough absentee votes to prove victorious by a margin of votes 
lowe thereafter filed suit in the green circuit to contest the election results,claiming that there had been irregularities in the handling of absentee voting during the election.lowe alleged that scott,who had served one term as clerk prior to the election and had previously served for years as deputy clerk,engaged in multiple improprieties including affixing campaign materials to absentee voting applications that were sent to prospective absentee voters and placing the absentee voting machine in her personal office instead of elsewhere in the clerk office.lowe sought to have all absentee ballots cast in the election declared void and be certified the winner of the election.
on june,a special judge of the green circuit court issued findings of fact,conclusions of law,and final judgment in the case.the court determined that scott had placed campaign stickers on the outside of at least thirteen envelopes containing absentee ballot the absentee ballots september and october.prior to sending out the ballot applications,scott had sought legal advice and was advised by a local attorney that inasmuch as the envelopes contained applications and not ballots there would be no problem in placing the stickers on the envelopes.on october,however,scott received a telephone call from the kentucky attorney general office about the practice and subsequently stopped using the campaign stickers.on october,scott received a letter from that same office advising her that the use of campaign stickers on official correspondence sent from her office was,at a minimum,inappropriate.the court further determined that scott had placed the absentee voting machine in her personal office rather than elsewhere in the clerk office and that the door to scott office was closed at times when other persons,including potential absentee voters,were in scott office with her.
the court then concluded that scott conduct amounted to two distinct election irregularities.first,scott used county funds to promote her own campaign by sending campaign stickers on absentee ballot applications in violation of,at a minimum.ann,which prescribes the form for transmitting absentee ballot applications and absentee ballots second,scott improperly used her office by placing the absentee voting machine within her personal office,affording her the powerful opportunity to influence potential voters as they made use of the machine.the court then identified the case as one fall ing into a very special category of election contest cases,in that it involved allegations that an incumbent clerk misused her own office to her electoral advantage.the court reviewed kentucky law involving election contests and concluded that precedent placed upon scott,as the incumbent clerk,the burden of showing that the balloting was conducted legally,and that all requirements of the law to insure its fairness,at least,were met substantially.see crowe emmert.because scott could not meet this burden,and in light of the court finding that scott conduct so tainted the entirety of the absentee ballots cas t via machine and paper in the election for the office of green county court clerk such that it call s into question the integrity of all said ballots,the court voided all absentee ballots cast and declared lowe to be the winner.
scott thereafter filed an appeal with the court of appeals of kentucky,which dismissed her appeal as untimely.scott subsequent petition for discretionary review was denied on december.
while scott petition for discretionary review was pending before the kentucky supreme court,the warf appellants filed the instant action in federal court.the warf appellants moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the board of elections from enforcing the judgment of the kentucky trial court.the appellees thereafter moved for summary judgment and dismissal.on march,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees and denied the warf appellants request for injunctive relief.warf bd.of elections,wl.the district court determined that the kentucky trial court did not stray from past kentucky precedent and that the burden of proof was properly placed on the incumbent clerk and that there was no indication that the kentucky court had relied on rules,standards,and procedures in deciding to void the absentee ballots.id.at.the district court therefore concluded that a constitutional violation had not been established and declined to intervene in the matter.id.
the warf appellants timely appealed.
on march,the warf appellants filed a motion before this court seeking certification of a question of law to the kentucky supreme court.they sought to certify the question of 
whether kentucky law provides an exception to the general rule that in a regular election contest the burden of proof rests with the contestant,thus the burden of proof to the contestee in circumstances where the contestee is the incumbent county clerk.
the warf appellants concurrently filed a similar petition for certification of law before the kentucky supreme court.that petition was denied by the kentucky supreme court on october.
the decision whether or not to utilize a certification procedure lies within the sound discretion of the district court.pennington state farm mut.auto ins,cir quoting transam.ins.duro bag,cir internal quotation marks omitted.certification is most appropriate when the question is new and state law is unsettled,but the federal courts generally will not trouble our sister state courts every time an arguably unsettled question comes across our desks.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
certification of the question presented here is inappropriate under the circumstances.as noted above,the kentucky supreme court has already denied the appellants request to certify the question.the appellants also did not raise the certification request before the district court,therefore causing that court to expend considerable time and resources addressing the question.see id.at.finally,there is applicable kentucky precedent to guide our consideration of the issues before us.for these reasons,we deny the certification motion and will resolve the case on its merits.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.white baxter healthcare,cir williams mehra,cir en banc.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we must review all the evidence,facts,and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,u.in order to defeat a summary judgment motion,the nonmoving party must show sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact.gaylord entm t,cir.entry of summary judgment is appropriate against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.celotex catrett,u.
the right to vote is a fundamental right,preservative of all rights.league of women voters brunner,cir quoting yick wo hopkins.because the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights,any alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.reynolds sims.the constitution,however,leaves the conduct of state elections to the states.shannon jacobowitz,cir quoting gamza aguirre,cir.the p rinciples of federalism,therefore,limit the power of federal courts to intervene in state elections.id.at quoting burton georgia,th cir internal quotation marks omitted.courts have long recognized that not every state election dispute implicates federal constitutional rights.burton,at.as such,o nly in extraordinary circumstances will a challenge to a state or local election rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation.shannon,at quoting curry baker,cir alteration in original.
we have held that t he due process clause is implicated,and relief is appropriate,in the exceptional case where a state voting system is fundamentally unfair.brunner,at citing griffin burns,cir.d ue process is implicated where the entire election process including as part thereof the state administrative and judicial corrective process fails on its face to afford fundamental fairness.griffin,at.such an exceptional case may arise,for example,if a state employs rules,standards and procedures,that result in significant disenfranchisement and vote dilution,brunner,at,or significantly departs from previous state election practice,see roe alabama,cir intervening where failure to exclude contested absentee ballots constituted a departure from previous state practice griffin,at intervening where state court disrupted practice of voting by absentee and ballot.federal courts,however,have uniformly declined to endorse action s under with respect to garden variety election irregularities.griffin,at see also brunner,at t he federal courts should not be asked to count and validate ballots and enter into the details of the administration of the election.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
it is evident from the record that the green circuit court decision to void all of the absentee ballots cast altered the outcome of the election and resulted in significant disenfranchisement.the decision impacted eleven percent of the voting electorate and resulted in lowe being declared the winner.see warf,wl,at.while this level of impact may be sufficient to warrant federal intervention,the result must rise to the level of fundamental unfairness.see griffin,f d at describing disenfranchisement of almost ten percent of the qualified and voting electorate as one of the perhaps exceptional cases where a district court could properly exercise the limited supervisory role that such courts have in election cases.the question is therefore whether the court decision to void the absentee ballots amounted to an election procedure which,in its basic respects,was flawed to the level of fundamental unfairness.id.at.
the green circuit court reviewed state precedent and concluded that the case fell into a very special category of election contest cases because it involved an interested incumbent clerk charged with misus ing her own office to her political advantage.the court,relying on crowe,noted that an incumbent clerk has the burden of showing that the balloting was conducted legally and that all requirements of the law to insure its fairness,at least,were met substantially.see at.the court then described its conclusions regarding the alleged election irregularities.it concluded that t here is no question that scott included campaign advertising materials with absentee ballot applications,and that such activity is prohibited by statute,and can not be tolerated.it further concluded that scott by her own testimony,placed herself in a precarious position by locating the absentee ballot machine in her personal office.as a result,according to the green circuit court,crowe placed on scott the burden to show that she had not improperly influenced any specific voter.the court determined that scott could not meet her burden because she failed to put in place any appropriate checks and balances to prevent her own overreaching.rather,despite the fact that t he full extent to which scott was successful in influencing the number of absentee votes cas t in her favor can not be determined,her conduct so tainted the entirety of the absentee ballots cas t that it call ed into question the integrity of all said ballots.
the warf appellants contend that the decision was a clear departure from precedent because it improperly reassigned the burden of proof in the election contest from the contestant to the contestee.according to the appellants,the burden of proof in a kentucky election contest has always been upon the contestant,regardless of whether the actions of an incumbent county clerk are challenged.see gross west.they argue that rather than creating an exception for cases involving incumbent county clerks,crowe merely applied rules that shift the burden of proof to the contestee only where the contestant proof is so compelling that without some contrary showing by the contestee,no reasonable could fail to find for the contestant finally,the warf appellants contend that the remedy imposed by the green circuit voiding of all absentee unprecedented,and that the proper course of action would have been to void the entire election.
while it appears that the green circuit court may have misinterpreted crowe on the issue of which party bore the ultimate burden of persuasion in the election contest,we do not believe that,given the shifting burden of production under kentucky law in this context and the evidence of irregularities identified by the court,the green circuit court decision in this case was an unreasonable application of controlling law rising to the level of fundamental unfairness.
the warf appellants are correct that the burden of proof in state election contests generally falls upon the contestant.see,gregory stubblefield,overruled on other grounds by upton knuckles,gross,at see also.ann.providing that the contestant in election contests must produce his evidence in chief within thirty days.civ.setting out the general burden of proof in civil litigation.and the appellants are also correct that kentucky election law presumes that elections are valid and that elections returns are regular.see mcintosh helton,gregory,at.
the kentucky courts,however,have repeatedly held that a challenge to the actions of an incumbent county clerk regarding absentee ballots should receive particularly close scrutiny.see parrigin sawyer,arnet hensley,crowe,at.they have explained that when an incumbent clerk is a candidate for,he finds himself in an extremely high position of trust and responsibility,parrigin,at quoting crowe,at,and that irregularities in absentee ballot procedures can not be tolerated,especially when they are committed by a candidate and obviously inure to his advantage.id.the kentucky courts have therefore require d those in charge of absentee ballots to show that the balloting was conducted legally,and that all the requirements of the law to insure its fairness,at least,were met substantially.crowe,at.this requirement has included placing upon the incumbent county clerk the duty to go forward with the proof.id.
although this broad language from crowe may appear at first glance to place the full burden of is,both the burdens of production and the contestee where he is the incumbent co
