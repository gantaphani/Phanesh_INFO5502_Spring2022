the defend bayview hunters point committee dbhpc gathered the required number of signatures on a petition to force a citywide referendum on an ordinance adopting a redevelopment plan for the bayview hunters point community.the city and county of san francisco the city rejected the petition because it failed to include a copy of the redevelopment plan that had been incorporated by reference in the ordinance when the board of supervisors of the city and county of san francisco voted to approve it.dbhpc ensuing petition for a writ of mandate compelling the clerk of the board of supervisors clerk to accept the referendum petition was denied by the trial court,and this appeal followed.we affirm the judgment denying dbhpc relief.
background 
in may,the city approved san francisco ordinance,entitled ordinance adopting the redevelopment plan for the bayview hunters point redevelopment project the ordinance.the ordinance approved and adopted a redevelopment plan that added nearly acres to the previously existing hunters point redevelopment project area the plan.the plan itself,which was set forth in a document,was not physically attached to the ordinance when it was passed,but was kept in a public file in the office of the clerk,and incorporated by reference into the ordinance.section of the ordinance stated in relevant part,by this reference,the redevelopment plan,a copy of which is on file with the clerk is incorporated in and made a part of this ordinance with the same force and effect as though set forth fully herein.the bulk of the ordinance consisted of findings that the plan was consistent with the city general plan and key planning code provisions,and findings required by the california community redevelopment law crl and california environmental quality act 
under the crl,an ordinance adopting or amending a redevelopment plan is subject to referendum if a petition containing signatures of at least percent of the entire vote cast within the city in the last gubernatorial election is submitted to the clerk within days of the plan adoption.health,subd.b.in june,dbhpc began circulating such a petition.the petition included a copy of the ordinance,but not a copy of the incorporated plan.
on august,dbhpc filed signed petitions with the clerk,and the department of elections of the city and county of san francisco certified a few weeks later that the petitions had a sufficient number of valid signatures.on september,the city attorney issued a written opinion to the clerk stating that the petition did not comply with section of the elections code because it failed to attach or include any part of the plan.the city attorney opined that the failure to include the plan prevented prospective signers from understanding the substance of the ordinance or the referendum overturning it,required the clerk to reject the petition,and precluded the board of supervisors from submitting the petition to the voters for a referendum on the ordinance.the clerk thereupon informed dbhpc that she was not accepting the petition.
trial court proceedings 
dbhpc filed its petition for writ of mandate or administrative mandamus complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief on december.it sought an order and judgment declaring the petition valid and suspending further operation of the ordinance.
the trial court denied the petition for writ of mandate on june.in its statement of decision,the court described the issue presented as whether a document incorporated by reference in an ordinance is an essential part of the text of the ordinance within the meaning of california elections code.under the relevant case law,according to the court,the key factor in construing the text requirement of section is ensur ing that voters receive essential information necessary to make an informed decision.in that regard,whether a document was physically attached to an ordinance at the time of its passage or incorporated into it by reference was immaterial in the court view.
the court found in this case that the meaning of the ordinance could not be discerned without reference to the plan since a voter reviewing the petition without the plan would not be aware of,among other things,the boundaries of the redevelopment project,the plan restrictions on the use of eminent domain,or the inclusion in the plan of affordable housing,employment,or community development components.the court also rejected dbhpc argument that the city should be estopped from rejecting the petition because the clerk certified the text presented to the voters by providing dbhpc with a certified copy of the ordinance that did not attach the plan.
the court entered judgment in favor of the city and this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
dbhpc contends that documents incorporated by reference in an ordinance are not part of its text for purposes of elections code section,the city interpretation of section raises serious first amendment questions and must therefore be avoided,and the city is estopped from denying the adequacy of the petition 
this case presents only questions of law based on undisputed material facts.our review of the trial court decision is therefore de novo.mansell board of administration th,d.
application of the text requirement 
dbhpc maintains that the trial court arrived at the wrong conclusion by misconstruing the case law interpreting elections code section and similar statutes.we begin by reviewing the relevant case precedents and dbhpc contentions regarding them.
relevant case law 
metropolitan water dist.marquardt cal d,metropolitan involved a challenge to the validity of a statewide water resources bond act that had been passed by the legislature and submitted to a vote of the people.id.at.the water bond act included a provision,water code section,adopting and incorporating by reference the terms of the existing state general obligation bond law,which established procedures for the issuance,sale,and repayment of bonds in general.id.at.the ballot pamphlet accompanying submission of the water bond act to the voters did not include the full text of the general bond law despite a provision of the bond law,section of the government code,requiring that any proposed bond act submitted to the voters contain the full text of both the bond act and the general bond law.id.at,fn.as an initial matter the court found that section was superseded by article xvi,section of the california constitution,which specified that the only requirement for publication was that the complete text of the proposed laws be provided in the ballot pamphlet sent to voters.metropolitan,at.
the supreme court rejected the opponents argument that article xvi,section of the california constitution should also be construed to require inclusion of the general bond law in the ballot pamphlet the general bond law was an existing law,not a proposed one,and was not part of the text of the bond act but was merely incorporated by reference.the meaning of text is the exact written or printed words of a work.see webster third new internat.dict.oxford english dictionary.the words of the bond act provide for the adoption of the general bond law,but the bond act does not contain the words of the general bond only states that it adopts that law.metropolitan,supra,cal d at,italics added.the court added that leaving the general bond law text out of the ballot pamphlet would not have had an adverse impact on voters t he fact that the general bond law is not printed does not deprive the voters of essential information.the general bond law contains only the formal procedure for the issuance,sale,and repayment of bonds,which would not ordinarily be expected to influence the voters in approving or rejecting any particular bond act.the matters which will be of primary interest to the voters,namely,the amount of the bonds authorized to be issued and the purpose for which the proceeds may be used,will be found in each proposed bond act.citation.id.at.
dbhpc argues that metropolitan is directly on point and in itself requires reversal of the trial court decision.according to dbhpc,metropolitan stands for the proposition that a document or text merely incorporated by reference in a measure to be voted on by the people is not part of the text of the measure.we think that overgeneralizes metropolitan holding beyond its peculiar facts.the court was construing the phrase complete text of the proposed laws.italics added.two facts were critical to the court decision first,the omitted material was the text of an existing law that would remain on the books whether the water bond act passed or not.second,the adoption and incorporation of the general bond law into the water bond act was entirely peripheral to the substance and purpose of the latter.the court conclusion that the general bond law was not part of the text of the bond act but was merely incorporated in it by reference can not be divorced from these facts,which formed the underpinning for the court conclusion that the omission of the bond law text from the ballot pamphlet would not deprive voters of essential information.metropolitan,supra,cal d at.we do not believe metropolitan can fairly be generalized to a fact pattern in which the text incorporated by reference in a measure to be considered by voters or potential referendum petition signators is of central importance in understanding the purpose and effect of the measure.
metropolitan is the only supreme court case cited by the parties construing a text requirement analogous to that in elections code section.there are several court of appeal decisions construing such requirements,however.according to dbhpc,the lesson of these decisions can be summed up as follows no case has ever held that documents not physically attached to ordinances are text for purposes of circulating referendum petitions.as discussed post,we do not share that view of the case law.
billig voges d.billig upheld the rejection of a referendum petition that included the full text of the city attorney summary of a rezoning ordinance,but left out a portion of the ordinance and two exhibits which comprise d the major portion of the ordinance.id.at.the court found that this violated former elections code section,which required that the petition contain the text of the ordinance or the portion of the ordinance which is the subject of the referendum.id.at,fn.italics omitted.the court stated b ecause a referendum petition asks electors to make a decision about their acceptance or nonacceptance of a proposed ordinance,it requires that voters be fully informed of the substance of the challenged measure so that the petition reflects the actual,informed will of the people.id.at,italics added.
at issue in chase brooks d.chase,was whether a referendum petition was defective under former elections code section for failing to include as part of the complete text of an ordinance an exhibit to it containing the full legal description of the affected real property.id.at.the court held that the petition did not substantially comply with that elections code provision because the petitions fail to apprise prospective signers of the precise location of affected real property to permit them to informatively evaluate whether they should sign the referendum petition challenging the substantive provisions of the ordinance.chase,at.regarding the practical utility the lengthy legal description would have for potential petition signers,the court stated granted,the metes and bounds legal description within exhibit a might not improve a prospective signer ability to determine the exact and precise location of the affected real property.however,directional references to and from knoll road within the description establishes at least a point of probable common knowledge.in any event,it provides prospective signers with the entire text of the challenged ordinance containing the legal description,thus improving the chances prospective signers will not be confused regarding the breadth of the challenged ordinance,italics added.
nelson carlson th,d nelson involved a fact pattern very similar to that presented here.the city council passed a resolution adopting a land use plan amendment.the fifth paragraph of the resolution stated the plan is detailed in exhibit b attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference id.at,d,italics added.exhibit b,in turn,was a document stating,exhibit b is the draft general plan and local coastal program land use plan amendment dated february.id.at,d.the actual general plan was several hundred pages long and roughly two and inches thick.id.at,d.the opponents of the resolution failed to attach a copy of the plan to the petition along with the resolution,and the city clerk refused to certify it for that reason,among others id.at,d.
citing chase and billig,the court of appeal in nelson sided with the clerk the failure to attach to the referendum petition the exhibit containing the plan presents a fatal defect in this case.the resolution focus was on the adoption of the plan and that document was incorporated into it.without the plan individuals reviewing the petition had no way of informatively evaluating whether to sign it.nelson,supra,th at,d.the court also addressed the objection that inclusion of the lengthy plan document would not have assisted voters no case has considered a document as voluminous as the plan considered here.we conclude plaintiffs were required to attach the plan to their referendum petition.this conclusion enforces the express requirements of elections code section.as billig noted,the meaning of the term text in section is clear.by it the legislature intended referendum petitions must contain the exact wording of the challenged measure.citation.here,the plan was the resolution focal point and was expressly made a part of it.section delineates no exception to the requirement that the petition contain the text of the challenged legislation.if the legislature had wanted to allow an exception for bulky ordinances or resolutions it could have provided for that situation.id.at,d,italics added.
in mervyn reyes th,d mervyn,a department store challenged the validity of an initiative petition adopted by ordinance that changed the land use designation of land owned by the store another division of this court held that the petition was invalid for failing to contain the text of the proposed measure.mervyn,at,d.the petition referred to,but did not actually contain,the various provisions of the city general plan that were enacted by the ordinance mervyn,at,d.the court held for all the reasons given in the above cited unbroken line of initiative and referendum cases covering the period to,we find that the petition in the instant case did not substantially comply with elections code section.the approximately pages of general plan sections omitted from the petition were the key element of the initiative.governmental land use decisions can be challenged by initiative or referendum.in either case,it is imperative that persons evaluating whether to sign the petition be advised which laws are being challenged and which will remain the same.only inclusion of the existing general plan will accomplish such purpose.mervyn,at,d,italics added,fn.omitted.
we paula herrera th,d we care involved an initiative petition to add a provision to a city general plan requiring that any increase in density for projects involving or more acres be approved by popular vote.id.at,d.opponents of the measure argued that the petition was invalid under mervyn and other cases because it failed to include the text of the general plan.the court of appeal disagreed and distinguished the earlier cases we care petition does not omit the text of an incorporated exhibit or any other portion of the proposed enactment.instead,the petition contains the full and complete text of everything that will be enacted if the voters approve it.the city points out that we care petition seeks to amend the general plan.it believes this requires that the land use portion of the general plan be included in the petition.but the amendment does not change any land use or density designated in the general plan.nor does it even purport to prohibit any change in land use or density.it simply adds a provision to the general plan requiring that any increase in density for
