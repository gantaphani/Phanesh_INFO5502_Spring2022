factual and procedural background 
the pra requires political committees to report certain information about their contributors to the state.specifically,political committees must file disclosures,which,among other things,identify those individuals who have contributed more than during or after a campaign,in addition to each contributor address,occupation,and employer.cal,f.the state of california then publishes this information on the website of the california secretary of state the secretary,and produces hard copies upon request.
appellants,to whom we refer as the prop committees or the committees,are political committees that supported the november passage of proposition.that proposition amended the california constitution to provide that o nly marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california.cal,art.i.proposition was subsequently invalidated.see hollingsworth perry,d citing perry schwarzenegger,d.
prior to proposition passage,the prop committees submitted disclosures to comply with the pra reporting deadlines.these disclosures were published on the secretary website,and are available in hard copy.following proposition passage,the committees initiated this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of california,challenging the constitutionality of the pra disclosure requirements both facially and as applied to them.the committees argued that their donors have been harassed as a result of the committees pra disclosures,and they sought an injunction exempting them from the pra future reporting deadlines,and declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the state to purge all records of their past pra disclosures.
on january,the district court denied appellants motion for a preliminary injunction.appellants did not appeal the district court order under a.instead,they complied with the pra january,disclosure deadline,reporting those contributors who donated after october,and before december.the secretary published these disclosures on her website,and made them publicly available in hard copy on november,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state on all counts.appellants timely appealed,asking us to reverse the judgment of the district court and to order the state to purge all records of appellants pra disclosures.

discussion 
facial challenges 
appellants assert that the pra reporting threshold and reporting requirements are facially unconstitutional in the context of ballot initiatives.our decision in family pac mckenna directly precludes appellants challenge to the threshold,cir holding that and contribution disclosure thresholds survive exacting scrutiny in the context of ballot initiatives.appellants facial challenge to the reporting requirements fails as well.
legal standard 
contribution disclosure requirements are subject to exacting scrutiny.citizens united fec,d buckley valeo,d.in applying exacting scrutiny,we first ask whether the challenged regulation burdens first amendment rights.if it does,we then assess whether there is a substantial relation between the burden imposed by the regulation and a sufficiently important governmental interest.citizens united,at family pac,at citing human life of.brumsickle,cir.
although disclosure is generally a less restrictive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of speech,citizens united,at,contribution disclosure requirements may burden first amendment rights by,among other things,deterring individuals who would prefer to remain anonymous from contributing,family pac,at internal quotation marks omitted.to justify these burdens and to survive exacting scrutiny,the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on first amendment rights.doe reed,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court recognizes three substantial government interests that campaign contribution disclosure requirements may serve.buckley,at see also doe.at.first,disclosure requirements may serve a substantial informational interest by providing the electorate with information about the source of campaign money,the individuals and interests seeking their vote,and where a particular ballot measure or candidate falls on the political spectrum.buckley,at family pac,at.this interest is particularly important in the ballot initiative context.as we explained in family pac 
the governmental interest in informing the electorate about who is financing ballot measure committees is of great importance.disclosure enables the electorate to give proper weight to different speakers and messages by providing the voting public with the information with which to assess the various messages vying for their attention in the marketplace of ideas given the complexity of the issues and the unwillingness of much of the electorate to independently study the propriety of individual ballot measures,we think being able to evaluate who is doing the talking is of great importance disclosure also gives voters insight into the actual policy ramifications of a ballot measure.knowing which interested parties back or oppose a ballot measure is critical,especially when one considers that language is typically confusing,and the policy ramifications of the ballot measure are often unknown.
family pac,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also human life of,at t he high stakes of the ballot context only amplify the crucial need to inform the electorate.
disclosure requirements may also help preserve the integrity of the electoral process by deterring corruption and the appearance of corruption.doe.at buckley,at explaining that disclosure requirements deter those who would use money for improper purposes either before or after the election.this interest extends generally to promoting transparency and accountability in the electoral process,and those states that allow ballot initiatives have considerable leeway to protect the integrity and reliability of the initiative process.doe.at citations and quotations omitted.
finally,disclosure requirements may permit accurate.d isclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering the data necessary to detect violations of contribution limitations.buckley,at.such records further enhance the public future associational rights by offering voters information about which policies those seeking their vote have previously endorsed.
both the supreme court and our court have rejected facial challenges to contribution disclosure requirements in several cases,holding that these substantial interests outweigh the modest burdens that the challenged disclosures impose on first amendment rights.see,doe.at holding that a state law authorizing private parties to obtain copies of referendum petitions is substantially related to the important interest of preserving the integrity of the electoral process family pac,at human life of,at alaska right to life comm.miles,cir.
application 
the pra imposes reporting requirements on ballot committees,which require them to disclose the names of,and other identifying information about,contributors who donate or more.the pra reporting deadlines are semiannual.accordingly,donations that are made prior to an election,but after the final reporting deadline,are reported after the election concludes.appellants argue that this requirement is unconstitutional,because a state only interest in disclosure is its interest in an informed electorate,and this interest allegedly expires with the election conclusion.we reject appellants narrow view of the government interest in disclosure.
a state interests in contribution disclosure do not necessarily end on election day.even if a state interest in disseminating accurate information to voters is lessened after the election takes place,the state retains its interests in accurate,deterring fraud,and enforcing contribution limits.as a practical matter,some lag time between an election and disclosure of contributions that immediately precede that election is necessary for the state to protect these interests.in this case,for example,appellants contributions surged nearly,by over million between the final reporting deadline and election day.absent reporting requirements,california could not account for such donations.and,without such reporting requirements,donors could undermine the state interests in disclosure by donating only once the final reporting deadline has passed.accordingly,we hold that the government interest in disclosing contributions to ballot initiative committees is not merely a interest,and we affirm the district court judgment with regard to appellants facial challenges.
ii.as applied challenges 
appellants also challenge the pra disclosure requirements as applied to themselves.
to the extent that appellants seek an injunction requiring the state to purge records of their past pra disclosures,any claim for such relief is moot.to the extent that appellants seek a exemption from california pra requirements,such a claim is not ripe.accordingly,we dismiss as non justiciable appellants appeal from the district court judgment rejecting their claims,and we direct the court to vacate this portion of its opinion.

present controversy 
legal standard 
it is not enough that a case presents a live controversy when it is filed.fec.right to life,d.an actual controversy must exist at all stages of federal court proceedings.spencer kemna,d.this means that,at all stages of the litigation,the plaintiff must have suffered,or be threatened with,an actual injury traceable to the defendant that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.id.quoting lewis cont l bank,d.t he judicial branch loses its power to render a decision on the merits of a claim,nome eskimo cmty.babbitt,cir,when a federal court can no longer effectively remedy a present controversy between the parties,doe,at quoting feldman bomar,cir.

application 
appellants request for an injunction requiring the state to purge all records of their pra disclosures does not present a live controversy.
before commencing this lawsuit,appellants voluntarily complied with all pra reporting requirements,and they have continued to do so throughout this litigation.appellants most recently filed pra disclosures on january,more than two years after filing this appeal.each pra disclosure that appellants have submitted is published on the secretary website,and is publicly available in hard copy 
the record is replete with evidence that appellants pra disclosures have been accessed and republished by third parties.appellants themselves provided detailed documentation of several websites that have published their contributors names,employers,and addresses.appellants also represent that one site allows individuals to search for any city and print a map graphically illustrating the name,address,contribution amount,occupation,and employer of each individual in that city who contributed to at least two major california newspapers have compiled searchable databases that enable easy access to look up contributors and time magazine directed its readership to a website that publishes the information contained in appellants pra disclosures.
in light of the disclosures,and their vast dissemination,we can no longer provide appellants with effective relief.the information that appellants seek to keep private has been publicly available on the internet and in hard copy for nearly five years.third parties already have control over this information.moreover,we have no way of knowing how many individuals have viewed appellants pra disclosures retained copies of the disclosures or their contents or reproduced the disclosures.accordingly,we can not remedy appellants alleged harms,and their request for an injunction requiring the state to purge their past pra disclosures does not present a live controversy 
capable of repetition,yet evading review 
we further hold that appellants request for injunctive relief does not fall within the mootness exception for cases that are capable of repetition,yet evading review.
legal standard 
as we explain above,a federal court loses its jurisdiction to reach the merits of a claim when the court can no longer effectively remedy a present controversy between the parties.doe,at quoting feldman,at nome eskimo,at.there is an exception to this rule,however,where an otherwise moot action is capable of repetition,yet evading review.lewis,at.under the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception,we will decline to dismiss an otherwise moot action if we find that the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.right to life,at internal quotation marks omitted.
for a controversy to be too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,it must be of inherently limited duration.doe,at emphasis added.this is so because the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception is concerned not with particular lawsuits,but with classes of cases that,absent an exception,would always evade judicial review.id.at see also bunker.united states in re bunker,cir t he exception was designed to apply to situations where the type of injury involved inherently precludes judicial review charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedures jurisdiction and related matters ed collecting cases.notably,regardless of any injunction that might issue,a woman can only obtain an abortion so long as she remains pregnant.roe wade,d.we can only invalidate a temporary injunction so long as that injunction remains in effect.carroll president comm rs of princess anne,d enyart conference of bar exam rs,cir.and where a purportedly invalid law inhibits a political candidate or party ability to win an election,we can only remedy that impediment before the election occurs.norman reed,d.we recognize these types of controversies as inherently limited in duration,because they will only ever present a live action until a particular date,after which the alleged injury will either cease or no longer be redressible.the limited duration of such controversies is clear at the action inception.
actions seeking to enjoin future conduct are different.such actions only become moot if the challenged conduct actually occurs and causes an injury that can not be reversed.these actions are not of inherently limited duration,because the challenged conduct might never occur.and,a court can ensure that a live controversy persists until the action is fully litigated by enjoining the challenged conduct until the litigation concludes.see doe,at.
because mootness concerns whether we have power to hear a case,we apply the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception sparingly,and only in exceptional situations.lewis,u.at.controversies that are not of inherently limited duration do not create exceptional situations justifying the rule application,because,even if a particular controversy evades review,there is no risk that future repetitions of the controversy will necessarily evade review as well.as we have explained,t he exception was designed to apply to situations where the type of injury involved inherently precludes judicial review,not to situations where review is precluded as a practical matter.bunker,at.
for this reason,where preliminary injunctive relief is available to maintain a live controversy,it is of no consequence to the mootness inquiry that a particular party has failed to actually obtain such relief.a party may not profit from the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception where through his own failure to seek and obtain prompt relief he has prevented an appellate court from reviewing the trial court decision.id.at see also newdow roberts.in such circumstances,we have no power to hear the action,and the controversy must be resolved in a future action presenting a live dispute.doe,at see also headwaters,bureau of land,cir holding that a party may not invoke the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception where its failure to obtain prompt relief has prevented judicial review bunker,at.
lawsuits seeking to enjoin the disclosure of sensitive information do not fall into the mootness exception for cases that are capable of repetition,yet evading review,because there is no inherent limit on the duration of such controversies.for example,in a case challenging campaign contribution disclosure requirements,the court can maintain a live controversy by issuing an order that either temporarily excuses the plaintiffs from complying with the challenged requirements or temporarily precludes the state from disclosing the challenged information.doe,at.whether a party actually obtains such an order in a particular case does not affect our jurisdictional inquiry.see id.
application 
the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception does not apply to appellants claims,because there was no inherent limit on the duration of this controversy.a court order temporarily excusing appellants from the pra reporting deadline or enjoining the state from publicly disclosing appellants filings could have permitted the parties to fully litigate this case on the merits.appellants simply failed to obtain such an order.
after the district court denied appellants motion for a temporary restraining order,appellants did not file an interlocutory appeal,nor did they seek an injunction pending appeal.by the time appellants claims reached us,the information that appellants seek to keep private had been publicly available for nearly five years.if appellants were to bring a similar action in the future,their claims would not,by their nature,again evade review,because a different litigation strategy could maintain a live controversy until the action final resolution 
in reaching this conclusion,we emphasize that the justiciability of disputes concerning the disclosure of sensitive information may well turn on whether preliminary relief is granted at an action inception.as this case demonstrates,the premature disclosure of information can eviscerate a live controversy.nevertheless,the fact that preliminary relief is technically available to maintain a live controversy will also deprive federal courts of jurisdiction to consider the action as one that is capable of repetition,yet evading review.accordingly,we advise courts to exercise the utmost caution at the early stages of actions concerning the disclosure of sensitive information,and to consider this mootness catch when assessing whether the denial of preliminary relief will likely result in irreparable harm.see winter natural res.def.council,d.
finally,appellants urge that they are entitled to an injunction exempting them from complying with future pra disclosure requirements,because they expect to participate in future campaigns opposing marriage.this claim for relief is not ripe for judicial review.
legal standard 
the ripeness doctrine seeks to identify those matters that are premature for judicial review because the injury at issue is speculative,or may never occur.alcoa,bonneville power,cir see also abbott labs.gardner,d.for adjudication of constitutional issues,concrete legal issues,presented in actual cases,not abstractions,are requisite.united pub.workers of am.mitchell.internal quotations omitted.concrete legal issues require more than mere hypothetical threat s,and where we can only speculate as to the specific activities in which a party seeks to engage,we must dismiss a claim as nonjusticiable.id.at.
we have explained that the ripeness inquiry contains both a constitutional and a prudential component.thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc.the constitutional component overlaps with,and is often indistinguishable from,the injury in fact prong of our standing analysis.id.whether we view injury in fact as a question of standing or ripeness,we consider whether the plaintiff face s a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute operation or enforcement or whether the alleged injury is too imaginary or speculative to support jurisdiction.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.if this constitutional requirement is not satisfied,we lack jurisdiction,and we need not consider the prudential component of the ripeness inquiry.
we typically look to three factors to assess whether a challenge is ripe for review under article iii.id.we first consider whether the plaintiff articulates a concrete plan to violate the law.id.internal quotation marks omitted.with regard to this prong,a general intent to violate a statute at some unknown date in the future is not sufficient,id,and the plaintiff must establish a plan that is more than hypothetical,wolfson brammer,cir.
next,we typically look to whether the government has communicated a specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings under the statute.thomas,at.our analysis under this second prong is somewhat different,however,in a challenge that alleges a free speech violation under the first amendment.see wolfson,at.in such actions,the plaintiff need not establish an actual threat of government prosecution.id.rather,the plaintiff need only demonstrate that a threat of potential enforcement will cause him to,and not follow through with his concrete plan to engage in protected conduct.id.
finally,we consider the history of past prosecution or enforcement under the statute.thomas,at.under this third prong,the government active enforcement of a statute may render the plaintiff fear of injury reasonable.id.
weighing these factors,we will only conclude that a action is ripe for judicial review if the alleged injury is reasonable and imminent,and not merely theoretically possible.id.at.a claim is not ripe where t he asserted threat is wholly contingent on the occurrence of unforeseeable events,or where the plaintiffs do not confront a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute operation or enforcement.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the application of these principles is illustrated in renne geary,d,in which the supreme court dismissed a challenge to a provision in the california constitution prohibiting political parties and committees from endorsing,supporting,or opposing candidates for nonpartisan offices.in that case,the republican committee submitted an affidavit stating 
it is the plan and intention of the republican committee to endorse candidates for nonpartisan offices in as many future elections as possible.the republican committee would like to have such endorsements publicized by endorsed candidates in their candidate statements in the san francisco voter pamphlet,and to encourage endorsed candidates to so publish their endorsements by the republican committee.
in holding that the republican committee did not present a ripe controversy,the renne court explained that the committee d id not allege an intention to endorse any particular candidate and there is no factual record of an actual or imminent application of the challenged provision sufficient to present the constitutional issues id.at citations omitted.
application 
at this stage,any challenge based on appellants future activity fails to tender the underlying constitutional issues in clean cut and concrete form.socialist labor party gilligan,d quoting rescue army mun.court.the only information that we have regarding appellants intended future activities is that appellants expect to participate in future campaigns opposing marriage,and that,in so doing,they wish not to comply with the pra disclosure requirements.
appellants have not offered any information regarding when they may next support a campaign opposing marriage,what type of campaign they will support,where they will support it,what their involvement will entail,or whether their donors will likely face personal harassment.without this information,we can not discern a concrete plan to engage in protected conduct.rather,the scant information that appellants provide merely demonstrates a general intent to engage in protected conduct at some unknown date in the future,along with a speculative fear that appellants donors may be personally harassed as a result of disclosing their contributions to such an effort.wolfson,at.these hypothetical plans and fears do not create an immediate threat of.and,as in renne,there is no factual record of the state bringing pra enforcement actions against those who do not comply with the statute disclosure requirements.renne,at.accordingly,any claim based on appellants future activities is not ripe under the thomas factors.
in reaching this conclusion,we emphasize that we have no right to pronounce an abstract opinion upon the constitutionality of a s tate law,poe ullman,d.challenges to contribution disclosure laws are in nature.whether a group will succeed in asserting such a challenge depends on factors such as the group size,the nature of the campaign,the political tenor in the community,and the actions of third parties and government entities.see brown socialist workers campaign comm.ohio,d.unlike california pro life council,getman,cir and new mexicans for bill richardson gonzales,cir upon which the dissent opinion that we could issue regarding appellants claims would require us to speculate about the nature of events that might take place at some unknown time in the future,and to declare the constitutionality of a state law in the context of these uncertain circumstances.under article iii,we lack the authority to issue such an opinion.see renne,at a determination of the constitutionality of legislation,in advance of its immediate adverse effect in the context of a concrete case,involves too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court judgment with regard to appellants facial challenges.we dismiss this appeal as non justiciable with regard to appellants challenges,and we remand these claims to the district court with instructions that the court vacate the portion of its opinion concerning appellants challenges.see bunker,at.appellants shall bear costs on appeal.
affirmed in part dismissed in part and remanded with instructions.
i do not disagree with the majority disposition of appellants facial challenges.the majority is correct that our precedent,including our decision in family pac mckenna,cir,forecloses those challenges.however,i disagree with the majority determination that appellants challenges are nonjusticiable.
the majority offers three rationales for its holding that appellants challenges are.first,the majority concludes that those challenges are moot,insofar as various internet websites have republished the information contained in appellants disclosures.majority op.at.second,the majority concludes that appellants can not avail themselves of the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.the majority reaches this conclusion on the ground that this exception only applies to cases in which there is an inherent limit on the duration of the controversy,and faults appellants for not seeking and obtaining immediate relief from our court after the district court denied their motion for a temporary restraining order.id.at.finally,the majority concludes that insofar as appellants seek an injunction exempting them from complying with future disclosure requirements,this claim is not ripe because it rests on merely speculative contentions from appellants about their future activities.id.at.
for the reasons stated below,i disagree with each of these three conclusions.accordingly,i respectfully dissent from the majority decision to dismiss appellants challenges as.
the majority holds that appellants request for an injunction requiring california to purge all records of their disclosures does not present a live controversy.majority op.at.the majority reasoning as to this issue relies on our decision in doe reed,cir.however,i believe that reed was wrongly decided,as judge randy smith explained in his concurrence in that case.see id.at smith,concurring in the judgment.
reed involved facts much like those presented in this appeal.the plaintiffs in that case sought an injunction preventing the state of washington from releasing to the public the names of people who signed petitions supporting a referendum.id.at.because those petitions were already widely available on the i nternet,the majority dismissed the case as moot.id.
while judge randy smith concurred with the judgment,he wrote separately to explain that supreme court precedent makes clear that the case was not moot,insofar as continued government disclosure of confidential materials can be prevented.id.at.as he explained,our court could have afforded the plaintiffs a viable remedy,albeit a much less effective remedy than they originally sought.id.as he further explained,there were several respects in which a viable remedy was available from us.first,our court could have fashion ed some form of meaningful relief by ordering the state to destroy or return any and all copies of the petitions it may have in its possession,because the state continued possession of those materials itself constituted an affront to the citizen privacy.id.at,quoting church of scientology of cal.united states,d.second,he pointed out that the majority had mistakenly assume d that every person in the united states or the state of washington has access to a computer to search for the petitions,whereas in actuality a significant percentage of the public either lacks access to the internet or would not know where to look for the petitions on the internet.id.at.thus,by granting the plaintiffs the injunctive relief they requested,our court could have prevent ed further government disclosure to individuals without access or desire to download petitions from websites,which would have slowed or reduced the dissemination of potentially private information,citing massachusetts,d.
i agree with the reasoning of judge smith concurrence in reed.i write here to emphasize that the supreme court decision in church of scientology of california united states clearly states that the type of claim raised by the plaintiffs in reed,and by appellants in this case,is not moot.there,the court acknowledged that there are circumstances in which the judiciary may not be able to return the parties to the status quo ante,because there is nothing a court can do to withdraw all knowledge or information once that information has been disseminated.church of scientology,at.nonetheless,church of scientology held that a court can fashion some form of meaningful relief in such circumstances.id.the court stated that even if the government retains only copies of the disputed materials,a citizen still suffers injury by the government continued possession of those materials,namely,the affront to the citizen privacy.id.at.accordingly,church of scientology held that a court does have power to effectuate a partial remedy by ordering the government to destroy or return any and all copies it may have in its possession,and further held that the availability of this possible remedy is sufficient to prevent a case from being moot.id.
the majority in reed failed to recognize that church of scientology is controlling.instead,it ignored the holding of church of scientology on the basis of its commonsense conclusion that once a fact is widely available to the public,a court can not grant any effective relief to a person seeking to keep that fact a secret.reed,at.it should go without saying,however,that the commonsense conclusion of two circuit judges can not trump an express holding of the supreme court.church of scientology is still the controlling law of all circuits,including the ninth circuit.reed can not change that.indeed,the majority should have interpreted reed in such a way as to render it consistent with church of scientology.
as church of scientology makes clear,we could order the state of california to destroy or return any and all copies of appellants disclosures that the state may have in its possession.church of scientology,at.thus,under binding supreme court precedent,there is available to us a possible remedy that is sufficient to prevent this case from being moot.id.
the majority goes the opposite direction,and attempts to distinguish church of scientology by stating that church of scientology involved a finite set of tangible records that had only been disclosed to a party to the action,whereas this case involves records that have been widely available on the internet for several years.majority op.at.thus,the majority concludes that we can not provide the effective relief that the supreme court recognized in church of scientology.id.but this conclusion simply repeats the error of the panel in reed.as pointed out above,church of scientology clearly holds that a case is not moot if we can effectuate a partial remedy by ordering the government to destroy or return any and all copies of records it may have in its possession.church of scientology,at.the fact that records may have been widely available on the internet is not relevant to the inquiry mandated by church of scientology.again,that inquiry is whether we can fashion some form of meaningful relief by remedying the injury to citizens caused by the government continued possession of records,where that possession is an affront to the citizen privacy.id.at.
church of scientology teaches that courts should not declare a case moot if any effective relief may be granted.forest guardians johanns,cir citation omitted.as one of our sister circuits has explained,this is a high threshold for judging a case moot,insofar as it requires that we find an appeal moot in the constitutional sense only if events have taken place that make it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever.united artists theatre walton,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.both reed and the majority in this case err by effectively lowering this standard,in contravention of church of scientology.that opinion tells us that we should find a case moot only if it is impossible for us to grant any effectual relief whatever.church of scientology,at.by contrast,the majority holds that this case is moot because it is unlikely that we will be able to provide significant effective relief.but that is not the standard set by church of scientology.
for the reasons stated above,and in accordance with the concurrence of judge randy smith in reed,i conclude that reed was wrongly decided.under the governing law of church of scientology,appellants challenges are not moot.the majority should have distinguished reed and followed church of scientology,not the opposite 
having concluded that appellants challenges are moot,the majority proceeds to consider whether those challenges may nonetheless be subject to the exception to mootness for injuries that are capable of repetition,yet evading review.as discussed above,i do not believe that the challenges are moot.but even if they were moot,i believe that the majority errs in concluding that the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness does not apply to this case.
the majority correctly states that the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception applies where the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.fed.election comm.right to life,d.in my view,appellants satisfy both of these requirements.i consider each in turn.
as to the first requirement,appellants filed their original complaint on january,two months after the election on proposition took place.under california law,appellants were required to disclose the names of their contributors by january.as the majority observes,the district court denied appellants motion for a preliminary injunction on january.majority op.at.the next day,appellants complied with the law and made their disclosures.id.such a short span of time is clearly in its duration too short for a claim of this nature to be fully litigated.right to life,at.
the majority does not contend that this claim could have been fully litigated in so brief a time.rather,it faults appellants for failing to seek preliminary injunctive relief,and concludes that their failure to do so precludes this claim from falling under the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.in reaching this conclusion,the majority relies upon our opinions in headwaters,bureau of land management,cir,and bunker.partnership united states,cir.however,i believe that these opinions do not preclude us from deciding that the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception applies to this case.
in headwaters,we stated that w here prompt application for a stay pending appeal can preserve an issue for appeal,the issue is not one that will evade review.headwaters,at.likewise,in bunker we stated that a party may not profit from the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness,where through his own failure to seek and obtain a stay he has prevented an appellate court from reviewing the trial court decision.bunker,at emphasis added.but the abstract proposition stated in both of these cases,the proposition that if a party fail s to seek and obtain a stay,that party may not avail itself of the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness does not speak to the particular facts of this case.as pointed out above,the district court issued its order on appellants motion for a preliminary injunction on january,while appellants were required to make their disclosures by january.thus,under the majority opinion,appellants would have had a single day to seek and obtain a stay from our court in order to profit from the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.id.this draconian constraint is not established by the opinions cited by the majority,which merely speak in general terms of a party obligation to seek and obtain a stay so as to enable our court to review the lower court decision.
a recent case in one of our sister circuits emphasizes the unfair position in which appellants have been placed by the majority holding as to this issue.on december,the district of utah held that amendment of the utah constitution is unconstitutional,and enjoined the state of utah from enforcing various statutory provisions that prohibit a person from marrying another person of the same sex.kitchen herbert,wl,at.a few hours after that order was issued,the state of utah filed a motion to stay the order.see kitchen herbert,wl,at.although the district court ordered expedited briefing,it did not rule on the motion to stay for three days.see id.it was not until two weeks later that the supreme court issued a stay pending final disposition of the appeal by the tenth circuit.see herbert kitchen,d.
as this example illustrates,it is simply not realistic to expect a party to seek and obtain a stay within the span of a single day.yet that is what the majority effectively requires.on the facts of this case,i would hold that our decisions in headwaters and bunker do not prohibit appellants from satisfying the first requirement of the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.
the majority asserts that the analysis above errs by focusing on the wrong for determining whether a controversy inevitably evades review.majority op.at.the majority contrary analysis hinges on its discussion of types of controversies that are inherently limited in duration.id.at.the majority argues that the mootness exception discussed here only applies to inherently limited controversies,which it defines as those that will only ever present a live action until a particular date,after which the alleged injury will either cease or no longer be redressible.id.at.
to my mind,the majority discussion of an inherently limited controversy is somewhat metaphysical.the present controversy unquestionably had an inherent limit namely,january,when appellants were required by law to make their disclosures.in the same way,a controversy involving a law that inhibits a political candidate or party ability to win an election has,as its inherent limit,the date of that election.id.at.whatever distinction might be drawn between these two scenarios,it can not be that only the latter has an inherent limit.
although the majority does not say as much,it appears to posit a distinction between controversies whose inherent limit is a event and those whose inherent limit is an artificial creation of the legal system.an example of the former,which the majority regards as n otabl e,is pregnancy,insofar as the date on which a baby is born is independent of anything the law might decree.id.by contrast,the limit in this case was the disclosure deadline mandated by california state law.
this distinction is not established by the cases the majority cites.moreover,i believe that this distinction,although crucial to the majority holding,can not be reconciled with our precedent.in effect,the majority has established a new test for determining whether this exception to mootness applies to a given case.under the newly invented test of the majority,in cases in which the inherent limit on the controversy derives from some event such as a pregnancy the exception will invariably apply.by contrast,in cases in which the inherent limit derives from an event that may be delayed via court order,the exception will never apply,because it will always be possible for a court to ensure that a live controversy persists until the action is fully litigated by enjoining the challenged conduct until the litigation concludes.id.at.
although such a test may have a certain intuitive appeal,it is not the law of our circuit,as the majority own citations indicate.the majority relies on bunker,which held that a party may not profit from this exception to mootness where through his own failure to seek and obtain prompt relief he has prevented an appellate court from reviewing the trial court decision.id.at,citing bunker,at emphasis added.this citation demonstrates the obvious novelty of the test introduced by the majority.in bunker,we held that the significant factor,in determining whether this exception to mootness applies,is a party own failure to seek and obtain relief.that is,in our analysis of this exception to mootness we looked to the party own diligence in seeking relief,rather than evaluating the case in the abstract and determining whether it was the type of controvers y that is invariably inherently limited in duration.id.at.
put another way,the majority holds that this exception to mootness is only available in cases whose limited duration is clear at the action inception.id.at.but the cases relied upon by the majority consider a party failure to obtain prompt relief during an action.id.at.if it were true that the question of whether this exception to mootness applies could be resolved solely by considering an action in abstract form from its inception,then there would have been no reason for our prior cases to consider a party failure to seek and obtain relief over the course of litigating the action.the new majority rule is inconsistent with our prior case law.
thus,the majority holding here clearly creates new law for our circuit,and does so in a way that can not be reconciled with our court precedent.the majority relies on reed for its reasoning as to this point.id.at.i quote below the entirety of the discussion of this issue in reed 
there was no inherent limit on the duration of this controversy.the district court granted a temporary restraining order the day after plaintiffs filed their complaint in july.the petitions were not released until october.the release was not timed to a month deadline inherent in this type of petition.and unlike other cases granting an exception the issues in this case were not moot once the election was held.citation omitted because it is reasonably foreseeable that this type of challenge could be fully litigated before becoming moot,this type of challenge does not evade review.
whatever might be said of this holding,it does not provide a justification for the novel test that the majority has invented.
in similar contexts,we have not relied upon the distinction used by the majority to preclude review of this case under this exception to mootness.our recent decision in enyart national conference of bar examiners,cir,is instructive in this regard.in enyart,we considered an appeal from preliminary injunctions entered by the district court.id.at.those injunctions required the national conference of bar examiners to allow the plaintiff to take certain bar examinations using assistive software.id.at.we held that even though those injunctions only related to particular administrations of those examinations,which had since come and gone,the appeals were not moot because the situation was capable of repetition,yet evading review.id.at.as we explained,d ue to the limited duration of the injunctions,and in particular because little more than a month passed between the issuance of the injunctions and the final execution of their terms,it was practically impossible for the appellant to obtain review of the district court orders.id.at.
thus,in enyart,we held that a period of little more than a month rendered it practically impossible for a party to obtain appellate review.id.by the same logic,it was almost certainly impossible for appellants to obtain review from us of the district court order on appellants motion for a preliminary injunction in the single day available to them.
the majority attempts to distinguish enyart by stating that it dealt with an issue of an entirely different nature.majority op.at.the point of my discussion of enyart,however,is that it considered whether a party could practically obtain appellate review of a district court order.enyart,at.this reinforces my point that the relevant inquiry,when considering this exception to mootness,is a pragmatic one namely,whether it is practically possible for a party to obtain the appellate relief it needs rather than the metaphysical one mandated by the majority.
in sum,because it was practically impossible under the facts of this case for appellants to obtain appellate review,i would hold that appellants have satisfied the first requirement of the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.
in light of its conclusion that appellants failed to satisfy the first requirement of the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness,the majority does not address the second requirement namely,the requirement that there must be a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.right to life,at.because i believe the majority conclusion as to the first requirement is e
