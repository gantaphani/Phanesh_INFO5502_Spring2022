background 
this case raises the question of whether michigan procedures applying to voters whose id cards are returned to the state as undeliverable violate the national voter registration act of nvra,et.currently,when a voter id card is returned as undeliverable,defendants change that individual status from active to rejected,meaning that the individual name will not appear on local precinct lists on election day.see defs.mot.for stay,ex.b,attach.at dep t of state,voter registration housekeeping reminders pls.resp.to mot.for stay,ex.at voter registration module.on october,the district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining this practice and ordering defendants to reinstate the active status of all individuals removed pursuant to this policy since january,unless the rejection was warranted for some other lawful reason.
section of the nvra provides requirements that states must follow in the administration of voter registration.first,state election officials must ensure that any eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election whenever a valid voter registration form is postmarked or received by the appropriate state official no later than days before the date of the election.a.the appropriate state election official must then send notice to each applicant of the disposition of the application.a.a registrant name may not be removed from the official list of eligible voters except at the registrant request,due to criminal conviction or mental incapacity as provided by state law,the death of the registrant,or due to a change of the registrant residence.a.removal by reason of change of residence,however,may be conducted only in accordance with specific requirements set forth in subsections b,c,and d of section of the nvra.specifically,d provides the circumstances under which a state may remove a name from voting rolls 
a state shall not remove the name of a registrant from the official list of eligible voters in elections for federal office on the ground that the registrant has changed residence unless the registrant

in michigan,the nvra has been implemented through the michigan election law.michigan sets four requirements that an individual must meet by the time of the next election in order to be entitled to be registered as an elector the person shall be a citizen of the united states not less than years of age a resident of the state for not less than days and a resident of the township,city,or village on or before the thirtieth day before the next regular or special election or primary election.comp.laws.since the election cycle,michigan has employed a statewide voter registration database,the qualified voter file qvf,which is maintained by the secretary of state.comp.law o see also defs.resp.in opp.to mot.for prelim.inj.at.the qvf allows local election officials throughout the state to access the voter registration database and to add,change,or delete records contained in the qvf.comp.laws p.once the proper local clerk receives and reviews an application and determines that the applicant is qualified as an elector,that clerk enters the voter information into the qvf.see pls.resp.to mot.for stay,ex.at voter registration module.individuals entered into this database can be identified with different status labels.active is the default label which allows an individual to vote without further action or verification.see defs.mot.for stay at.individual entries can also be marked as rejected or cancelled,and names bearing these labels will not appear on the lists of voters distributed to polling places on election days.pls.resp.to mot.for stay,ex.at voter registration module defs.mot.for stay,ex.thomas aff.entries can also be marked as verify or challenged,and individuals labeled as such will appear on precinct voter lists,but will be required to provide further information before casting a ballot.see pls.resp.to mot.for stay,ex.at voter registration module.

the plaintiffs assert that michigan practice of changing voter status based on an undeliverable voter id card violates the provisions of the nvra detailing the conditions that must be met before an individual can be removed from state voting rolls this issue was brought to defendant attention on july,in a letter from bradley heard of the advancement project,which asserted that michigan treatment of undeliverable voter id cards violated the nvra.defs mot.for stay at see also pls.br.in supp.of mot.for prelim,ex.heard ltr.the defendants failed to respond to this letter until august,when they denied that the policy violated the nvra and refused to make any changes to the practice.pls.br.in supp.of mot.for prelim,ex.thomas ltr.
on september,the plaintiffs filed suit in the district court seeking an expedited hearing and injunctive relief.the plaintiffs asserted,among other things,that the practice violates section d of the nvra.see d.the plaintiffs contended that,because an individual becomes eligible to vote once his or her name is entered on the qvf,before an id card is even issued,removing that individual from active to rejected status violates section d,which provides the exclusive method for removal of registered voters.the plaintiffs requested that the district court enter a preliminary injunction ordering,in relevant part,that the defendants discontinue the practice of immediately rejecting a voter registration based on the return of the original voter id card as undeliverable,treat the return of original voter id cards in the same manner as the return of duplicate id cards,restore to active status all voters whose registrations were rejected pursuant to.comp.laws c after january,and who are not ineligible for some other reason,and maintain and preserve relevant records.
the defendants filed a brief in opposition to this motion on september,and the plaintiffs replied on september.with the permission of the district court,each of these filings exceeded the usual page limits and included extensive additional materials.on september,the district court held a hearing on the motion.the district court issued a preliminary injunction on october,the district court found that the practice violated d of the nvra.specifically,the district court found that individuals become registrants for purposes of the nvra as soon as they are placed on the qvf and designated active and thus can not be removed unless the requirements of d have been met.regarding this practice,the district court found that the plaintiffs have made a strong showing of success on the merits and a substantial but not overly strong showing of irreparable harm and that the preliminary injunction would work very little hardship on the defendants and would be in the public interest.dist.prelim.inj.order at,wl.specifically,the district court ordered that the defendants

on october,the defendants petitioned the district court for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal,and the district court denied this motion on october.the defendants filed the instant motion in this court seeking a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal on october,arguing that the district court abused its discretion in granting preliminary injunctive relief.first,the defendants argue that they can demonstrate a strong likelihood of success on the merits for two reasons plaintiffs did not have standing to bring their claims and michigan practice does not violate the nvra because an individual whose original voter id card is returned as undeliverable never actually becomes a registrant,and so is never removed from the voting rolls.the defendants next argue that the plaintiffs will not be harmed if the preliminary injunction is stayed,because the risk of voter disenfranchisement is small.further,the defendants argue that,without a stay,they will suffer irreparable harm due to the interruption of their preparations for holding the upcoming election on november.finally,the defendants argue that the public interest in enforcement of legitimate statutory processes to ensure that only qualified persons are registered to vote weighs in favor of granting a stay.
ii.analysis 
in deciding whether to grant a stay of a preliminary injunction,defendants have the burden of showing whether the movant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits,whether the movant would suffer irreparable injury absent a stay,whether granting the stay would cause substantial harm to others,and whether the public interest would be served by granting the stay.northeast ohio coal.for the homeless blackwell,cir.
in considering defendants motion for a stay of the district court preliminary injunction,we are deciding whether the defendants are likely to be able to show that the district court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.when we review a district court ultimate determination as to whether the four preliminary injunction factors weigh in favor of granting or denying preliminary injunctive relief,we review for an abuse of discretion.certified restoration dry cleaning network,tenke,cir.we review de novo the legal conclusions made by the district court,and we review its factual findings for clear error,but our review of the district court ultimate decision regarding injunctive relief is reviewed under the highly deferential standard.id.quoting leary daeschner,cir.therefore,when considering defendants motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction,we must determine whether the defendants are likely to be able to show that the district court abused its discretion when it issued the preliminary injunction.we conclude that the defendants have not shown that it is likely that the district court abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction,and we must therefore deny defendants motion to stay the preliminary injunction.
likelihood of success on the merits 
defendants have not shown that they are likely to succeed in showing that the plaintiffs lack standing.see sandusky county democratic party blackwell,cir.similarly,defendants are unlikely to succeed in demonstrating that the practice is lawful the district court finding that the practice violates the nvra is a conclusion of law that we would review de novo if we were reviewing the grant of the preliminary injunction.certified restoration dry cleaning network,at.in order to establish a likelihood of success on the merits,the defendants must show that a de novo review of the district court decision that the application of.comp.laws c violates the nvra would result in a determination that michigan practice does not violate federal law.we hold that michigan practice likely violates the clear language of the nvra and that defendants have not,therefore,shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of this issue.

d emphasis added.
a simple reading of this statute reveals exactly whom this statute protects and from what states may not remove registrants from an official list of eligible voters based on a change in residence unless certain conditions have been met.we believe that,if a person is a registrant,a state may not remove his or her name from an official registration list on the grounds that his or her residence has changed unless the specified criteria of d are met.we conclude that it is highly unlikely that the defendants will be able to show that the district court interpretation of the nvra was erroneous.
given the clarity of the statute,it is not surprising that defendants do not dispute the fact that,if persons rejected under the practice are registrants,such removals violate the nvra.rather,as was the case in the district court,t he parties dispute over the legality of the undeliverable id practice essentially boils down to a disagreement over the meaning of the word registrant,as it appears in the nvra.dist.prelim.inj.order at.defendants contend that,because the nvra does not define registrant,state law must provide the definition.defendants also assert that,under michigan law,an individual is registered to vote only after he or she has received an original voter id card.defendants argue that an individual whose original voter id card was returned as undeliverable was never a registrant in michigan such that the protections of the nvra apply.accordingly,defendants assert that they can reclassify these individuals as rejected voters within the qvf even if the conditions required by the nvra have not been met.for the following reasons,we are not persuaded that defendants arguments are likely to succeed.
first,we do not agree that state law must be used to define registrant.in fact,michigan law recognizes that federal law determines who is a registrant notwithstanding another provision of law to the contrary,a person who is a qualified elector in this state and who registers to vote in a manner consistent with the national voter registration act of is considered a registered voter under this act.comp.laws t.the district court correctly observed that making the question of who is a registrant a matter of state law would frustrate the nvra purpose of regulating state conduct of elections,by essentially permitting states to decide when they will be bound by the nvra requirements.dist.prelim.inj.order at while the nvra allows states to have their own eligibility requirements and registration procedures and policies,it places limits on those policies.one such limit is the nvra mandate that registrants can be removed from voter rolls only if certain conditions are met.if states could define registrant,they could circumvent the limitations of the nvra by simply restricting the definition,and hence the federal protections of the nvra,to a very limited class of potential voters.a federal statute can not adequately protect the rights of individuals from actions of the state if the state is free to define the protected class as broadly or as narrowly as it chooses.if we were to adopt defendants view,states could completely ignore the requirements of the nvra,d.we refuse to import such a reading to this statute 
because state law can not control the definition of registrant,we resolve the meaning of registrant under the nvra as a matter of federal law.we have found no case which has considered this issue.because the ultimate goal of registering to vote is to permit a person actually to vote,we think that,at the very least,a person becomes a registrant,for the purposes of the nvra,from the first moment that he or she is actually able to go to the polls and cast a regular ballot.
though the definition of registrant is governed by federal law,because that definition involves determining when an individual is actually able to cast a vote,we must look to state law defining when an individual can first go to the polls and cast a regular vote,regardless of what label state law may attach to that individual according to defendants,once a clerk determines that an application passes initial review,that applicant name is entered into the qvf as an active voter.pls.resp.to mot.for stay,ex.at voter registration module.if the original voter id card is not returned to the clerk as undeliverable,that individual is considered a registered voter without any further action by the clerk.defs.mot.for stay at see also.comp.laws,if,however,the original voter id card is returned to the clerk as undeliverable,the clerk must go back into the qvf and change that individual voter status from active to rejected.defs.mot.for stay,ex.b,attach.at dep t of state,voter registration housekeeping reminders.defendants assert that because state law dictates that such voters shall be deemed not registered.comp.laws c,the fact that the status of these voters was changed from active to rejected does not constitute removal of a registrant under the nvra.we conclude that defendants argument is not likely to succeed on the merits.
defendants entire argument is based on their assertion that the definition of registrant must apply to the nvra.however,as we explained above,this can not be the case.while state law is vital in determining when a person becomes actually eligible to vote,the labels that state law places on individuals are not binding for purposes of the nvra.said another way,it does not matter whom michigan decides to call a registrant what matters is,functionally speaking,when an individual becomes able to cast a ballot.
in michigan,an individual must meet four specific requirements in order to be eligible to vote the person shall be a citizen of the united states not less than years of age a resident of the state for not less than days and a resident of the township,city,or village on or before the thirtieth day before the next regular or special election or primary election.comp.laws.receipt of the original voter id card is not a requirement for eligibility.instead,the original voter id card that is sent out by the state of michigan is the notice of disposition of the application to register to vote required by a.if this were not the case,it appears that michigan would be in violation of that section of the nvra.michigan does not contest that the original voter id card serves this purpose or assert that some other document serves as the required notice.because a notice of disposition alerts an individual that the state has determined that he or she meets state eligibility requirements,it necessarily follows that the eligibility decision has already been made.indeed,the voter who checks his or her status after his or her name has been entered on the qvf will find the message yes,you are registered even before the voter id card is mailed to him or her.pls.resp.to mot.for stay,ex.voter information center.therefore,receipt of the original voter id card can not be part of the eligibility decision.
applying this lens of analysis,a simple example illustrates why this status change on the qvf from active to rejected is meaningful and why individuals in michigan are protected registrants under the nvra from the moment the clerk identifies them as active in the qvf.suppose that the clerk received a voter application from doe,and per state law,entered him into the qvf as active,and then sent him an original voter id card.suppose also that doe never received this original voter id card,but due to human error,loss,or delay,the clerk did not receive the original voter id card marked as undeliverable until after the election.on election day,doe would appear as active in the qvf,and thus his name would appear on the poll list and he would be permitted to cast a regular ballot.defendants assert that such a scenario is unlikely,but they can not deny the fact that once doe has been entered into the qvf as active,he will be treated as a regular voter.because michigan has chosen to treat individuals as active,as individuals permitted to cast ballots upon entry of their applications into the qvf,defendants can not then withdraw this active voter status without complying with the nvra.once the state takes the step of identifying individuals as active voters,those individuals clearly become registrants protected by the nvra.
throughout their motion for a stay,the defendants highlight the fact that a prior district court case determined that the practice did not violate the nvra.see ass of cmty.orgs.for reform now miller miller i.the dissent similarly relies on miller i,stating that it involv ed the same michigan practice,the same michigan statute,and the same provision of the nvra.dissent at.this reliance is misplaced.the district court decided miller i two years before michigan implemented the qvf,and the district court opinion in miller i contains no mention of this system or how it would work.additionally,the miller i court did not have full information regarding the intricacies of the system or how michigan would implement it.
instead,the district court in miller i rejected a claim that under the nvra an applicant is registered upon merely filling out a registration application.id.at.contrary to the dissent characterization,miller i did not reject the view that an applicant is automatically registered to vote for purposes of the nvra merely upon filling out the registration application and being placed on the official roll.dissent at emphasis added.miller i did not address the consequences of being placed on any official list such as the qvf,and was instead limited to considering the consequences of filling out a registration application.miller i.at.in the instant case,plaintiffs do not argue,and we do not hold,that filling out an application is the event that triggers nvra protection.instead,we conclude that it is likely that once michigan gives an individual active status in the qvf,the status that would permit the individual to cast a regular ballot on election day,the individual becomes a registrant protected by the nvra.the district court in miller i did not address such an argument,and thus miller i is not relevant to this determination.
further,the miller i court found that under the nvra the states are still left the task of determining that an applicant is eligible,and that the registration form as submitted complies with state law.id.at.nothing in our holding today contradicts that finding.to the contrary,michigan is still free to set eligibility standards and to evaluate whether each applicant meets those standards.however,once michigan chooses to categorize an individual in such a way that would allow him or her to go to the polls and cast a regular ballot,regardless of what michigan calls that person,he or she is a registrant for purposes of the nvra.currently,once the state determines that an applicant is qualified as an elector and affords an individual active status in the qvf,that individual is entitled to cast a ballot and thus is a registrant under the nvra.accordingly,our conclusion today does not contradict the district court opinion in miller i,but rather modifies it in light of michigan decision to list approved applicants as active in the qvf once the clerk has reviewed their applications.
we disagree with the dissent claim that sixth circuit precedent conflicts with the district court interpretation of the nvra here.first,the sixth circuit opinion in miller ii addressed only the constitutional challenges to the nvra made by michigan in its appeal.miller ii,at we agree with the district court that the nvra is constitutional,and that all of the involved plaintiffs are entitled to bring suit.because no issues concerning the miller i district court interpretation of specific nvra or michigan state law provisions were raised on appeal,we had no occasion to address that district judge interpretation of the provisions at issue in this stay motion before us now.thus,the sixth circuit opinion in miller ii is irrelevant to today case.
second,our opinion in bell marinko,cir,is similarly distinct in marinko,we considered an ohio law that allowed registered voters to challenge the right of any person to vote.id.at.ohio law instructed the board of elections to conduct a hearing to investigate the residency of each challenged individual,and,if the board concluded that the challenged individual was not a resident of the precinct and therefore ineligible to vote,the board should remove that person from the rolls.id.at.the ohio law considered in marinko is very different from the one at issue here.plaintiffs here challenge the rejection of eligible voters.the individuals who would be harmed by michigan practice are eligible voters.these eligible voters are entitled to the protections of the nvra.id.at the national voter registration act protects only eligible voters from unauthorized removal.by contrast,the ohio law at issue in marinko permitted the state,after a hearing on the issue,to remove the names of ineligible individuals from its rolls.id.the rejection of an eligible voter based solely on the practice is not at all similar to a state determination that a particular challenged individual is not an eligible voter and should therefore be removed from the voting rolls.here there has never been a determination that the voters are ineligible.to the contrary,the only determination made as to the voters here is that they are eligible,a determination the clerk receiving the application makes before forwarding the applicant an original voter id card.comp.laws 
we determined in marinko that the particularized challenge hearing for each specific voter established that the voter was not in fact a resident of the precinct and therefore that the voter was not eligible to vote in the precinct and could be removed from the voting rolls.we wrote,because the nvra does not bar the board continuing consideration of a voter residence,and instead encourages the board to maintain accurate and reliable voting rolls,we find that the board procedures in this case do not contravene the nvra.id.marinko thus endorses the approach utilized by ohio to investigate a particular voter proper residence for voting purposes.marinko does not endorse the michigan practice of withdrawing all voters active status if their original voter id cards are returned to the clerk as undeliverable.
under our analysis,an individual is a registrant under the nvra at the time that he or she is listed as active in the qvf,and any such individual who is rejected under the michigan system because his or her original voter id card is later returned as undeliverable has had his or her rights,as defined by the nvra,d,violated.we therefore conclude that the defendants have not met their burden of making a sufficient demonstration that,ultimately,the michigan practice does not violate the nvra.accordingly,we hold that the defendants have not shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits,and that this factor weighs heavily against granting the stay that the defendants seek.
harm to defendants 
the defendants assert that it is both possible and feasible for them to comply with the preliminary injunction.defs.mot.for stay at.they raise two potential harms they will face if the requested stay is not granted changing procedures to comply with the preliminary injunction will cause a resource drain for state and local officials and the reactivation required by the preliminary injunction will revive old records,so that if previously rejected individuals later to vote at a new address,their previous address will spring back up in the system,creating new inaccuracies.id.at.the defendants dispense with the second potential harm themselves,stating that a software program will have to be written to prevent potential errors.id.at.the defendants do not,however,forecast great confusion associated with the implementation of this new software.nor do they predict,after implementing this program,that any changes produced in compliance with the district court preliminary injunction will result in erroneous disenfranchisement.accordingly,the only harm left is the potential resource drain for state and local officials,of which writing the new computer program for the qvf is one aspect 
we are cognizant of supreme court decisions counseling courts to exercise proper judicial restraint before making precipitate changes to election procedures and policies when an impending election is imminent and a state election machinery is already in progress.reynolds sims,d see also purcell gonzalez,d.we have taken this potential practical problem into careful consideration,and we do not make light of the burden that the district court ruling may impose on michigan secretary of state.purcell,however,demands careful consideration of any legal challenge that involves the possibility that qualified voters might be turned away from the polls.purcell,at.in this case,the district court preliminary injunction ensures that qualified voters whose registrations were rejected due to the practice will not be turned away at the polls.moreover,the district court has determined that staying the preliminary injunction would likely put individual voters at risk of disenfranchisement.additionally,the preliminary injunction affects a small fraction of michigan voters,at most individuals,and the change is therefore not a precipitate alteration to the state entire voting methodology.see defs.mot.for stay at.
moreover,defendants have already ceased using the practice,see pls.resp.to mot.for stay,ex.dep t of state,federal court ruling,and appear already to have identified the voters whose voter status must be changed based on the preliminary injunction,see defs.mot.for stay at noting how many individuals must be reactivated.given the fact that defendants have quickly succeeded in complying with these components of the preliminary injunction,we can not see how implementing the final step of the preliminary injunction,changing these voters designation on the qvf as ordered by the district court,will cause irreparable harm.to the contrary,we conclude that defendants have shown no real harm to themselves or to voters especially in light of the fact that the preliminary injunction permits defendants to label these voters verify and require further verification of their eligibility at the polls.
because the only harm that the defendants assert is an administrative burden that they admit to be manageable,we conclude that this factor weighs against granting the requested stay.
substantial harm to others and public interest 
as discussed above,the preliminary injunction is necessary to protect the individual voters of michigan affected by the practice.the defendants raise a variety of potential harms to others and to the public that they suggest will result if their requested stay of the district court preliminary injunction is not granted.first,the defendants assert that court orders affecting elections may result in voter confusion and cause a chilling effect.defs.mot.for stay at.the defendants do not assert that compliance with the preliminary injunction will result in the wrongful removal of any voters.instead,the district court preliminary injunction ensures that each individual who has properly registered to vote but was removed due to an error that is out of his or her control will be able to cast a ballot on election day.granting the stay of the preliminary injunction would cause confusion,leaving recently registered voters who have not received their original voter id cards unsure of their status and of what they need to do in order to exercise their right to vote.
defendants also contend that,even if an individual is wrongly purged from the poll books due to the practice,he or she will still be able to cast a provisional ballot,and thus no disenfranchisement occurs.however,this argument ignores michigan law,which allows for some provisional ballots to go uncounted.in fact,in the elections,only of all provisional ballots cast in michigan were counted.see united states election assistance commission,election administration and voting survey,at.given that not all provisional ballots will necessarily be counted,the availability of provisional ballots may not protect those wrongly purged due to the practice from substantial harm.
the defendants next assert that because the preliminary injunction will likely restore to the rolls some individuals who are not qualified to vote,there is a risk of both fraud and actual voter fraud.though the public certainly has an interest in a state being able to maintain a list of electors that does not contain any false or erroneous entries,a state can not remove those entries in a way which risks invalidation of properly registered voters.marinko,at.the nvra strikes a balance between removing fraudulent registrations while ensuring that legitimate voters are able to vote,and michigan can not remove names from its rolls in a manner that fails to respect this balance that congress has drawn.currently,michigan practice carries a risk of disenfranchising a large group of qualified voters.
erroneous registrations harm the election itself only when improper registrants actually vote.importantly,the preliminary injunction allows the state to guard against voter fraud by allowing the state to recategorize individuals affected by the practice to verify status.see dist.stay order at.this option,which the state appears to be exercising,allows the state to require individuals reinstated by the preliminary injunction to verify their residence at the polls before casting a regular ballot.see pls.resp.to mot.for stay,ex.dep t of state,federal court ruling.this is the practice that the state uses to avoid voter fraud by verifying the eligibility of voters whose eligibility may be questionable.defendants do not argue that this system is insufficient to successfully weed out fraudulent voters.because the risk of actual voter fraud is miniscule when compared with the concrete risk that michigan policies will disenfranchise eligible voters,we must conclude that the public interest weighs in favor of denying the stay of the preliminary injunction.the preliminary injunction eliminates a risk of individual disenfranchisement without creating any new substantial threats to the integrity of the election process.accordingly,the district court preliminary injunction seeks to ensure that michigan elections are more fair,and to reach any other result would fly in the face of the very purpose of the nvra.
conclusion 
we hold that each of the four factors discussed above weighs against granting the stay of the district court preliminary injunction that the defendants seek.in reaching this conclusion,we note that the district court accepted voluminous submissions from the parties and conducted a hearing,and we have the benefit of considering that information.the district court carefully considered all of the materials presented at that hearing,and we can not say now that the district court abused its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction.
iii.conclusion 
in seeking a stay,the defendants carry the heavy burden of demonstrating that the district court likely abused its discretion in issuing the preliminary injunction.in order to meet this burden,defendants must convince this court that a stay is necessary in light of defendants likelihood of success on the merits any irreparable harm defendants will suffer if the stay is not granted any substantial harm to the plaintiffs that will result from a grant of the stay and what is in the best interest of the public.though,at this late date,we understand the prudence of a policy of limited federal court involvement in elections,this fact does not change defendants burden.considering that the defendants have indicated that the burden that the district court preliminary injunction imposes on them is not large the defendants are highly unlikely to succeed on the merits and without the preliminary injunction,plaintiffs members,along with members of the public as a whole,face wrongful disenfranchisement,we must deny the requested stay of the district court preliminary injunction.
i respectfully dissent.i believe it is important to emphasize preliminarily that the issue raised in this the same michigan practice,the same michigan statute,and the same provision of the national voter registration act nvra was litigated and decided against the plaintiffs almost thirteen years ago.specifically,the plaintiffs argued in association of community organizations for reform now acorn miller,as plaintiffs do here,that michigan voter identification card statute.comp.laws c violated the nvra because it authorized removal of registered voters from the official voter rolls in a manner other than those specified in d.in a opinion,the district court in miller rejected the view that an applicant is automatically registered to vote for purposes of the nvra merely upon filling out the registration application and being placed on the official roll.id.at.rather,the court explained that section c clearly provides that an applicant is not registered until he or she receives a voter identification card.id.at.because an applicant is not registered to vote under state law unless and until he or she receives the card,there was no conflict between the two statutes because under the nvra the states are still left the task of determining that an applicant is eligible,and that the registration form as submitted complies with state law.id.at.the decision in miller was later affirmed by this court,albeit without discussion of that particular holding.see acorn miller,cir therefore,i can not agree with the majority that the plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.
the district judge in this case acknowledged the existence of miller,but he disagreed with the earlier decision because,ultimately,he found that what the state may not do and still act consistently with the nvra is to place a potential voter name on the qualified voter file in a status that permits the registrant to vote,only to later mark the registration as rejected at a later date.see district court order at.in other words,the district court concluded that a person is to be regarded as a registrant,and is thus protected under the nvra,at the moment his or her name appears on the official list of eligible voters,id.at,and may only be removed pursuant to the specific provisions in the nvra.id.at.the majority shares this view.i believe this conclusion is not only inconsistent with the law as it has been applied in michigan ever since the district court opinion in miller,but,more importantly,it is inconsistent with sixth circuit precedent.
that precedent arose in bell marinko,d,which involved several individual plaintiffs who were included in ohio official list of registered voters.following an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiffs were found to be seasonal residents of the precincts in which they were registered to vote,and they had their registrations terminated based on,and pursuant to,an ohio state law that defined a qualified elector as a person who resided in the relevant precinct on a permanent basis they filed suit,alleging that the only way to be taken off an official voter list is in accordance with the specific conditions set forth in the nvra i at their own request,ii by reason of conviction of a crime or mental disability,or iii change of residence.id.at.the district court disagreed.it began by noting that the nvra was adopted to establish procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for federal office,while also assuring that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.id.quoting b,emphasis added.although the nvra sought to accomplish these dual objectives by,inter alia,ensuring that once registered,voters could not be removed from registration rolls because of a failure to vote or changed addresses,the district court noted that it was state law that determined as a threshold matter whether and when an individual is a qualified voter in the first instance.see id.at emphasis added.the ohio statute in bell required,among other things,that all voters continue to reside in the precinct until the next election.id.at quoting in re protest filed by citizens for merit selection of judges,ohio.the plaintiffs argued that the absolute language in the nvra required a finding that the defendants violated federal law because the conditions described in section a,noted supra,were not present,but the district court held 
t hat reading overlooks the precondition to being entitled to vote continu ing to reside in the precinct until the next election.if the residency precondition is not met,a person is not entitled to vote he is not a qualified elector.see in re protest,supra,ohio at,a person is not an elector or qualified elector unless his actual current residence is registered with the board of elections.
residency within the precinct is a crucial qualification.one simply can not be a qualified elector entitled to vote unless one resides in the precinct where he or she seeks to cast his ballot.and,if one never lived within a precinct,one can not continue to reside in the precinct.he or she is not,and can not be an eligible voter,even if listed on the board rolls as such.
the vra does not affect ohio ability to condition eligibility to vote on residence.nor did it undertake to regulate challenges,such as that presented here,to a registered voter residency ab initio.if the action of the board were to be found to violate a,the effect would be to grant,and then protect,the franchise of persons not entitled to vote.
i conclude that the vra can not be read in this manner.to do so would set the stage for chaos whenever a challenge to one of the most fundamental preconditions to within the.the vra and its manifest purposes,to make enrollment easy and protect the rolls from expungement on the basis of bias or other improper motive,while allowing disqualification when justified,would be frustrated.
id.at emphasis added.the district court determined that ohio voter residency challenge and disqualification process must be read in pari materia with the nvra,and it summed up its holding on this point as follows plaintiffs registered to vote.they exercised that franchise,presumably,until challenged.the ability of the challengers to assert that plaintiffs were not eligible,and had not ever been eligible,and of the board to consider and resolve that challenge,does not contravene a.id.at emphasis added.
on appeal,the plaintiffs in bell argued,just as the plaintiffs do here,that the nvra sets forth the exclusive reasons for which a state may remove a voter from a voting precinct list of registered voters,and,because the defendants below had removed the plaintiffs from the official list even though they did not meet that criteria,the removal violated the act.bell marinko.the sixth circuit ruled against the plaintiffs and held as follows 
section a of the act provides that the name of a registrant may not be removed from the official list of eligible voters except when the registrant requests such removal,when the registrant has been convicted of a crime,or when he or she is mentally incapacitated.also,section a allows for removal pursuant to a state program or activity that makes a reasonable effort to remove ineligible voters by reason of death or change of residence.appellants argue that because none of these has occurred,their names may not be removed.we disagree.
in creating a list of justifications for removal,congress did not intend to bar the removal of names from the official list of persons who were ineligible and improperly registered to vote in the first place.the national voter registration act protects only eligible voters from unauthorized removal.see a seeking to ensure that any eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election id.at a providing that the name of a registrant may not be removed from the official list of eligible voters except under specific circumstances emphases added.eligible voters,at a minimum,are those who qualify as bona fide residents of the precinct in which they are registered or wish to register to vote.see,collecting cases.residence,as defined in section a of the ohio revised code,is that place in which the person habitation is fixed and to which,whenever the person is absent,the person has the intention of returning.
id.at emphasis added.the court went on to explain that the purpose of the nvra was to ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained
