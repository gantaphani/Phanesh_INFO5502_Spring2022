the issue in this case is whether state legislation allowing people to vote by mail over an extended period violates a federal statute requiring that the election shall be held on a particular day.
voting integrity project,and several individuals brought a federal civil rights suit for declaratory and injunctive relief to establish that an oregon statute that allows oregonians to vote by mail for a substantial period prior to or as well as on this federal election day violates the federal election laws.this case concerns only legal issues,and no facts are in dispute.the state of oregon prevailed on summary judgment we have jurisdiction under.
federal law.
federal statutes establish the tuesday next after the first monday in november as federal election day for the election of united states representatives and senators and as the day on which electors of president and vice president shall be appointed.without question,congress has the authority to compel states to hold these elections on the dates it specifies.the constitution provides that 
t he times,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations,except as to the places of chusing senators 
likewise,congress may determine the time of chusing the electors for the electoral college 
until the,congress left the actual conduct of federal elections to the diversity of state arrangements.in,congress provided that in presidential election years t he electors of president and vice president shall be appointed,in each state,on the tuesday next after the first monday in november.further changes for the election of representatives,senators and the president and vice president were legislated as part of reconstruction in the.congress provided that 
t he tuesday next after the monday in november,in every even numbered year,is established as the day for the election,in each of the states and territories of the united states,of representatives and delegates to the congress commencing on the day of january next thereafter 
senators,of course,were not covered by this election day provision,because until the seventeenth amendment was ratified,they were selected by state legislatures,not elected.after ratification,congress provided that they should be elected at the same time as representatives were elected 
the law remains the same today.the first tuesday after the first monday in november is the day when presidential and vice presidential electors shall be appointed,and it is also the day for the election of representatives and senators 
ii.oregon law.
oregon law provides that elections shall be held the first tuesday after the first monday for federal and other offices but citizens do not necessarily vote on that day.oregon has adopted a novel procedure of allowing all voters to vote by mail for a substantial period before election day.oregon law now provides that the regular biennial elections shall be conducted by mail.the statute establishes an extended period,rather than a single day,during which citizens may vote.county clerks must mail the blank official ballots to all registered voters between and days preceding the election voters can mail the ballots back or deposit them at any time between when they receive them and election day mailed ballots are counted only if they are received no later than election day so the scheme contemplates that they will be mailed prior to election day.voting by mail does not require any certification that the voter will be out of the district on voting day or will be otherwise inconvenienced or unable to vote in person 
a vestige of traditional voting days remains.voters may vote the traditional way,by casting their ballots in person at a central location on voting day if they choose the secretary of state must designate places of deposit for ballots,which must be kept open on voting day for at least eight hours and at least until voters have the right to deposit their ballots at that place instead of mailing them in in addition to depositing a ballot at a place of deposit,any voter may obtain a replacement ballot and cast it at the county clerk office or one central location in the electoral district if the ballot mailed to them is destroyed,spoiled,lost,or never received 
iii.analysis.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo 
congress,exercising its authority under the constitution has designated the first tuesday after the first monday in november as the day for the election.appellant argues that under oregon new vote by mail statutes,much or most of the voting for these federal officials will now take place in oregon prior to the day congress has designated as the day for the election,thereby violating the federal statute.
appellant argues that by designating a federal election day,the first tuesday after the first monday in november,as the day for the election,emphasis added,congress implied that the designated federal elections were to take place on that day and no other days.that is a fair inference from the text.the word the precedes day,implying that the statute refers to a single day.this textual argument has considerable force.
appellant further argues that the legislative history shows that congress meant what the text implies.this argument also has force.we have studied the congressional globe an earlier analogue of today congressional record to discover what social problem congress addressed with this statute more than eleven decades ago.we encounter all the usual problems of legislative history,such as not knowing whether those who spoke represented the views of those who did not speak.some speakers dilute clarity with diplomacy,as can be expected of serious legislators trying to accomplish a serious purpose.
but it is plain that congress considered and rejected the practice of voting allowed by some states.in the debates regarding selection of the electoral college,there was discussion on the floor of the virginia practice,where it frequently happened that all the votes were not polled in one day.but the expense to some states of reforming the system was characterized as a slight consideration in the decision of a matter of such momentous importance.in the previous presidential election,both parties were charging each other with having committed great frauds,and both professed to be anxious to guard against them in future.it was argued that the time must be uniform in the states.
the intense debates became even more explicit in addressing voting.at this time,reconstruction was drawing to an end,a federal amnesty program allowed many confederate soldiers to regain the right to vote the redeemers were winning control of previously reconstructed southern states,and the democratic party was consequently drawing even with the republican party in national strength while the national election day was being considered in the house,a general amnesty bill for confederates was pending in the senate and reapportionment of representatives among the states was also being hotly debated the abolitionist leading debate said that the object of this amendment is to provide a uniform time of electing representatives in congress.he explained that a uniform day of election would address fraud on account of the facility for colonization and repeating among the large central states,the privilege is allowed the border states,in any man is so disposed,of throwing voters across from one into the other.though not mentioned during the debate,the anarchy and terrorism resulting from massive voting fraud in bleeding kansas by voters from missouri crossing the border to counter voters from new england could not have been so soon forgotten 
at the time,different states elected members of the house of representatives during different months much concern was expressed about the inconvenience of changing state constitutions and laws to accommodate a uniform national day some argued that the diversity of dates gives some states undue advantage,and it gives some parties undue advantage,though a senator from
