the issue presented in this appeal is whether florida manual recount procedures in those counties employing paperless touchscreen voting machines violate the rights of voters in those counties to equal protection and due process under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.for the reasons that follow,we hold that they do not 
florida voting system 
florida electronic voting systems act makes florida department of state responsible for developing and adopting standards for electronic voting and for certifying electronic voting systems for use in the state.see.stat.each county may then choose its own voting equipment from among those systems certified by the department of state.stat.see also.stat.in fifteen of florida counties,voters cast their votes using paperless touchscreen voting machines,which require that voters make their selections directly on computer screens by literally touching the screen as indicated.in the remaining counties,voters cast optical scan ballots.to vote using an optical scan ballot,a voter uses a pencil to fill in a bubble or arrow by the name of the candidate he wishes to vote for the ballot is then run through an automatic tabulation machine.voters casting absentee or provisional ballots in touchscreen counties also submit optical scan ballots.
manual recount procedures 
florida law provides for a recount procedure in certain close elections.first,if the margin of victory is of a percent or less,election officials conduct a machine recount,which entails ballots in precincts using optical scan ballots.stat.a,and,in touchscreen voting precincts,examining the counters on the precinct tabulators to ensure that the total of the returns on the precinct tabulators equals the overall election return.stat.a.second,if the results of the machine recount indicate a margin of victory of of a percent or less,officials conduct a manual recount of all overvotes and undervotes collectively,residual votes.stat.an overvote results when the elector marks or designates more names than there are persons to be elected to an office or designates more than one answer to a ballot question,and the tabulator records no vote for the office or question.stat.an undervote results when the elector does not properly designate any choice for an office or ballot question,and the tabulator records no vote for the office or question.stat.
during the manual recount phase,auditors review residual votes to determine if there is a clear indication on the ballot that the voter has made a definite choice.stat.a.to that end,the department of state is charged with adopting specific rules for each certified voting system prescribing what constitutes a clear indication on the ballot that the voter has made a definite choice,id.at b,and issuing detailed rules prescribing additional recount procedures for each certified voting system which shall be uniform to the extent practicable.id.at d.
the manual recount is a fairly straightforward process in optical scan counties auditors look for stray marks that may have misled the machines or other indicia that a voter has made a definite choice.for example,a voter might circle a candidate name rather than making the prescribed mark to indicate his choice.in touchscreen counties,however,this process has proved more difficult.it is impossible to overvote in a touchscreen county the touchscreen voting machines will not allow it.it is possible to undervote when using touchscreen voting machines,however,although the machines prompt a voter when he undervotes,providing him with an opportunity to choose a candidate for that race.
emergency rule 
because a touchscreen voter never records his vote onto paper,and there is no provision in these counties for contemporaneous of individual ballots,a manual recount in touchscreen counties does not allow for the same type of review of ballots for voter or machine error provided in optical scan counties.in light of these characteristics of touchscreen voting systems,the florida department of state originally did not require manual recounts in touchscreen counties an administrative law judge struck down the original rule that failed to require manual recounts,however,and the secretary of state promulgated emergency rule in its place.the substance of the emergency rule was incorporated into the permanent rule governing manual recounts on november,see florida department of state,division of elections rule rule.
rule provides that if a manual recount becomes necessary,the canvassing board shall order the printing of one official copy of the ballot image from each touchscreen voting machine that has recorded undervotes for the affected race.rule b.if the certified voting system is capable of electronically sorting and identifying undervotes,then the canvassing board shall order the printing of a report indicating the undervotes.id.the ballot image report shall then be examined by the counting teams to identify and highlight ballot images containing undervotes for the affected race to determine if there is a clear indication on the ballot image that the voter made a definite choice to undervote.rule b.for those machines capable of electronically sorting,the undervotes shall be identified by the machine.id.
after identifying the undervotes,the counting teams shall maintain a running tally of the number of undervotes totaled per touchscreen voting machine in each precinct and then tabulate the total number of undervotes from all machines in that precinct.the counting teams shall then compare the total number of undervotes manually recounted for each precinct to the total number of undervotes reported by the voting system in the complete canvass report.rule b.if the comparison of the undervotes for each precinct matches the total number reported for such precinct,then the counting team shall certify the results of the machine recount to the canvassing board.rule b.if a discrepancy exists,however,the counting teams are to the number of undervotes for such precinct at least two additional times and,if necessary,the canvassing board must investigate and resolve the discrepancy.id.
the emergency rule instructs that t he clear indication that the voter has made a definite choice to undervote shall be determined by the presence of the marking,or the absence of any marking,that the manufacturer of the certified voting system indicates shall be present or absent to signify an undervote.rule a.the rule goes on to specify how an undervote is designated for each of the three types of touchscreen voting machines currently certified for use in florida.see a.
state lawsuit 
on january,united states congressman robert wexler filed a complaint in state circuit court against theresa lepore,who at that time was supervisor of elections for palm beach county secretary of state glenda hood and the palm beach county board of county commissioners.wexler sought declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the defendants,in approving touchscreen voting machines for use in palm beach county,violated the right to vote of palm beach county citizens guaranteed by the florida constitution.specifically,the state complaint asserted that florida should not have approved and certified the sequoia avc edge voting system release for use in palm beach county because,as a paperless voting system,it does not allow for the manual recounts provided for by and of the florida statutes.
the state circuit court dismissed the action on the grounds that wexler lacked standing to pursue the claims.the court further found that wexler failed to state a cause of action for injunctive relief because the florida statutory scheme does not clearly require a voter verified paper ballot.wexler appealed the circuit court order to the fourth district court of appeal,which affirmed the dismissal.the fourth district court of appeal found that the secretary of state had adopted regulations regarding methods for recounting votes pursuant to the statutes,rendering wexler request for declaratory relief moot,as he would first have to challenge the adopted rules in an administrative setting.
