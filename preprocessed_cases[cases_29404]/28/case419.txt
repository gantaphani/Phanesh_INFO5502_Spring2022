background 
at a special session in december,the florida legislature passed the act,now codified at sections and of the florida statutes,which regulates legislative and executive lobbying activities in the state of florida.according to the act,no lobbyist or principal shall make,directly or indirectly,and no member or employee of the legislature.stat.a emphasis added,nor any agency official,member,or employee shall knowingly accept,directly or indirectly,any expenditure,id.a given the use of the conjunctive and,the act does not bar all lobbying expenditures instead,it bars only those expenditures that are made for lobbying purposes and are accepted by an official.
the act also includes a disclosure provision that requires lobbying firms to file quarterly statements reporting the total compensation paid or owed by their principals that is,their clients.id.a,a.lobbying firms must also disclose the full name,business address,and telephone number of each principal,as well as the total compensation that each principal paid or owed to the lobbying firm.id.a,a.
in addition to the disclosure provision,the act has enforcement provisions that allow for audits as well as for the filing of sworn complaints.id.for legislative lobbying,every sworn complaint or audit indicating a possible violation with the exception of an untimely report is subject to investigation by designated committees of either house of the legislature.id.if a violation is found,the committee must report its findings,together with a recommended penalty,to either the president of the senate or speaker of the house,as appropriate.id.the president of the senate or speaker of the house then submits the committee report and recommendation to their respective chamber and a final determination is made by a majority vote of the members.id.authorized penalties include a fine of not more than,reprimand,censure,probation,or prohibition from lobbying for a period of time not to exceed months.id.
for executive lobbying,every sworn complaint or audit indicating a possible violation with the exception of an untimely report is subject to investigation by the commission on ethics.id.a,c.if the commission finds probable cause of a violation,then it submits a report to the governor and the cabinet for a determination of the penalty.id.authorized penalties include reprimand,censure,or a prohibition on lobbying any agency for a period not to exceed two years.id.but,i f the violator is a lobbying firm,the governor and cabinet may also assess a fine of not more than.id.
in the district court,plaintiffs sought a declaration that the act was facially unconstitutional.they also sought preliminary and permanent injunctions against the act enforcement.plaintiffs argued that the act was not validly passed by the legislature because it was not read three times after it was introduced by the house.they argued that the act infringed upon the florida supreme court authority to regulate the practice of law and they argued that the act contravened florida separation of powers doctrine.plaintiffs also argued that the act expenditure restrictions,disclosure requirements,and enforcement provisions violated their rights to free speech,due process,equal protection,and privacy under both the united states and florida constitutions the district court denied plaintiffs motions for preliminary injunction and summary judgment,concluding that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their claims.the district court then granted summary judgment to the division of legislative information services,et,defendants on all of plaintiffs claims.plaintiffs now appeal.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs raise four issues.three involve questions of state constitutional law whether the act violates florida separation of powers doctrine whether the act was improperly enacted under the florida constitution and whether the act infringes upon the florida supreme court regulatory authority over the practice of law.the fourth issue involves a question of federal constitutional law whether the act is unconstitutionally vague or overbroad 
state law issues 
substantial doubt about a question of state law upon which a particular case turns should be resolved by certifying the question to the state supreme court.jones dillard,cir.here,substantial doubt exists about the three issues in this case that relate solely to matters of florida constitutional law.
first,plaintiffs assert that the act,or at least certain parts of it,violate florida separation of powers doctrine.they specifically challenge provisions in section that authorize designated committees of the legislature to provide advisory opinions on the applicability and interpretation of relevant provisions of the act,to investigate any person or lobbying firm alleged to have violated the act,and to make findings and a recommendation of punishment for ultimate decision by their respective houses.plaintiffs contend that these provisions,by assigning to the legislature the power to interpret and enforce the act as well as the power to adjudicate violations of the act,unconstitutionally encroach upon powers belonging to the judicial and executive branches of the state government.
on the second issue,plaintiffs claim that the act was not validly enacted pursuant to state constitutional provisions governing special sessions they argue that the act is invalid because it was not read three times after it was properly introduced by a vote instead,it was read twice before introduction and only once after introduction.
the third issue is whether the act infringes the florida supreme court authority to regulate the practice of law in florida.relying upon article v,section of the florida constitution plaintiffs contend that the act,especially its compensation reporting provisions,invades the exclusive jurisdiction of the florida supreme court to regulate the admission of persons to the practice of law and to discipline those admitted.according to plaintiffs,lobbying by lawyers constitutes the practice of law.thus,because the act requires lawyers who lobby on behalf of a client to report the compensation they received,plaintiffs argue that the act runs afoul of the rules regulating the florida bar.bar rules forbid lawyers from disclosing confidential client information,including compensation paid by the client,without the client consent.
having reviewed all the arguments and the case law,we conclude that the law in florida is not sufficiently for us to determine with confidence whether the act is unconstitutional under the state constitution.in particular,we are uncertain about whether the provisions of the act authorizing designated committees of the legislature to issue advisory opinions,to investigate violations of the act,and to recommend penalties to the legislature for violations of the act contravene the florida constitution separation of powers.we are also uncertain about whether the florida house of representatives properly waived the constitutional requirement that a proposed bill be read on three separate days after it has been
