addressing an issue of first impression in this circuit,we hold that the term costs under rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure does not include attorney fees recoverable as part of costs under and similar statutes.the district court therefore properly concluded that the statement in our previous opinion that e ach party shall bear its own costs of appeal,family pac mckenna,cir,did not preclude family pac,as prevailing party,from obtaining an award of appellate attorney fees under.
background 
family pac is a continuing political committee organized under washington law.see id.at.in its federal lawsuit,family pac alleged that three provisions of washington election law violated the first amendment as applied to ballot measure committees a provision requiring a political committee to report the name and address of each person contributing more than to the committee,a provision requiring a political committee to report the occupation and employer of each person contributing more than to the committee and a provision barring a political committee from accepting from any one person contributions exceeding within days of a general election.see id.the defendants are the washington state attorney general and the members of the washington state public disclosure commission,which administers and enforces the challenged provisions.see id.at.family pac moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted in part and denied in part.see id.at.the court held that the and disclosure requirements survived exacting scrutiny but struck down the day contribution limit as a violation of the first amendment.see id.
after both sides appealed,we affirmed on all issues.we agreed with the district court that the and disclosure requirements survived exacting scrutiny,but held that the day contribution limit was unconstitutional.see id.at.given that each side had been partly successful on appeal,our opinion stated that e ach party shall bear its own costs of appeal.id.at see fed.a.
shortly thereafter,family pac asked us to transfer consideration of attorney fees on appeal to the district court.see cir.the defendants collectively,the state opposed the motion,arguing that we had already precluded an award of attorney fees by stating that each party would bear its own costs.in a january order,we granted family pac motion to transfer consideration of attorney fees on appeal to the district court.we express ed no opinion as to whether an award of fees to any party is warranted but expressly noted that o ur instruction that each party shall bear its own costs on appeal did not address whether any party is entitled to attorney fees under.
on remand,family pac moved for an award of in attorney fees and expenses,including fees and costs on appeal,under.family pac excluded from its request attorney fees incurred solely on its unsuccessful claim challenging the and disclosure requirements.the state opposed the motion,arguing once again that appellate attorney fees were not available because this court already had ordered the parties to bear their own costs.
with minor adjustments,the district court granted family pac motion for fees.the court specifically rejected the state argument that our allocation of costs under federal rule of appellate procedure barred family pac from recovering appellate attorney fees.although the court recognized that this was an issue of first impression in this circuit,it noted that the third,fifth,seventh and eleventh circuits had all rejected the proposition that costs under rule includes attorney fees under.after addressing the state remaining arguments,the court awarded fees and expenses of.the state timely appealed.
discussion 
federal rule of appellate procedure governs the taxation of costs on appeal.the rule does not define the term costs,but rule e specifically enumerates the costs on appeal that may be taxed in the district court,and the advisory committee note cites as the statutory authority for the rule.section,in turn,contains a specific definition of costs.the civil rights attorney fees awards act of,meanwhile,is one of a number of federal fee shifting statutes that allow a prevailing party to recover a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.b the question presented here is how these two provisions rule and interact.relying on marek chesny,d,and azizian federated department stores,cir,the state argues that,because rule does not define costs,the term must be understood as encompassing all costs defined by federal law,including appellate attorney fees recoverable as part of costs under and similar statutes.the state contends that,because appellate fees under are costs under rule,this court previous direction that e ach party shall bear its own costs of appeal precludes family pac from recovering appellate attorney fees.we disagree.
the supreme court first considered the relationship between and another statute allowing for the recovery of costs in roadway express,piper,d,superseded by statute as stated in,singleton,cir.roadway express involved a former version of,a statute providing that lawyers who multiply court proceedings vexatiously may be assessed the excess costs they create.see id.at although did not define costs,the court concluded that it excluded attorney fees.the court reasoned,first,that when congress enacted the original version of in,the united states adhered more closely than it does today to the american rule,under which attorney fees ordinarily are not among the costs that a winning party may recover.id.at.the court assume d that congress followed that rule when it approved the act.id.second,the court noted that congress had approved a comprehensive measure setting the fees and costs for all federal actions in.see id.this measure enacted the predecessors of both and,and includes its own express definition of costs.in light of this history,the court reasoned that and should be read together as part of the integrated statute approved in,and,hence,should be understood as incorporating s specific definition of costs.id.at.as this definition did not include attorney fees recoverable as part of costs,the court concluded that the term costs under also excluded such fees.
the supreme court returned to the interplay between and another statute allowing the recovery of costs in marek chesny,d.marek involved federal rule of civil procedure.rule shifts to the offeree the costs incurred subsequent to an offer of judgment if the judgment finally obtained is not more favorable than the offer like former,at issue in roadway express,rule did not define the term costs.in contrast to roadway express,however,the court concluded that costs under rule includes attorney fees recoverable as part of costs.the court observed that by the time rule was adopted in the late,a number of federal statutes provided for an award of attorney fees as part of costs.see id.at.because t he authors of federal rule of civil procedure were fully aware of these exceptions to the american rule,the most reasonable inference was that the term costs in rule was intended to refer to all costs properly awardable under the relevant substantive statute or other authority.id.at.the court concluded that,absent congressional expressions to the contrary,where the underlying statute defines costs to include attorney fees,we are satisfied such fees are to be included as costs for purposes of rule.id.at.the court distinguished roadway express,stating 
we held in roadway express that came with its own statutory definition of costs,and that this definition did not include attorney fees.the critical distinction here is that rule does not come with a definition of costs rather,it incorporates the definition of costs that otherwise applies to the case.
we applied these supreme court precedents in azizian federated department stores,cir.the issue there was whether the term costs in federal rule of appellate procedure,which permits a district court to require an appellant to file a bond to ensure payment of costs on appeal,includes attorney fees recoverable as part of costs like former and rule,rule does not define costs.following marek,we observed that,at
