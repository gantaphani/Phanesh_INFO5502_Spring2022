john moore and joyce shockency brought this action against ramsey county,sheriff robert fletcher,and inspector nicholas,alleging violations of their first and fourteenth amendment rights by retaliatory employment actions after moore ran against fletcher in the election and shockency supported him.the district court denied defendants motion for summary judgment.fletcher and appeal from the order denying them qualified immunity the county also seeks to appeal.we affirm as to fletcher,reverse as to,and dismiss the county appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
in reviewing an order denying qualified immunity,we view the facts and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving part ies.scott harris,d internal quotations omitted.john moore and joyce shockency were employed as officers in the ramsey county sheriff department.in june moore told coworkers that he intended to run against sheriff robert fletcher in the fall election.fletcher informed moore in july that he was being transferred out of his position as patrol lieutenant and would then be supervised by nicholas,who was a political supporter and friend of the sheriff.after shockency publicly supported moore campaign,she was transferred from her position as sergeant in charge of the midnight patrol shift to a position in the transportation unit with significantly less responsibility.she was also replaced as manager of the field training program.
moore was hired as a deputy sheriff for ramsey county in and was promoted twice,attaining the rank of lieutenant and eventually commanding the entire patrol division.in the latter position he supervised employees and held the highest job available for his rank.he supervised several units,communicated department policy to the public,developed enforcement strategies for community policing,assisted with budget preparation,and composed strategy for long range improvements of the uniformed patrol division.
in july moore told coworker dennis flaherty about his decision to run for sheriff.flaherty was a supporter of the sheriff.ten days after moore conversation with flaherty,sheriff fletcher told him he was being transferred out of the patrol division to lead the apprehension division and that thereafter he would work under the supervision of inspector nicholas.fletcher also said,by the way,i spoke to flaherty.from the sheriff reference to his conversation with flaherty,moore understood that he was being transferred because of his campaign for sheriff.fletcher told him that his transfer was due to communication problems with his supervisor,undersheriff george altendorfer,but moore had never before heard anything about any communication problem.
although moore remained a lieutenant and retained his basic pay and benefits after his transfer,he claims he lost overtime pay and access to a take home vehicle.in january fletcher took away his responsibility for leading the apprehension division and moore began working with a partner from the unit.in september moore was assigned to be executive assistant and was given only administrative duties.the parties contest who was responsible for this decision.moore was the only lieutenant to have served in the apprehension division,and no other lieutenant was assigned to replace him when he was moved.
and moore did not get along from the beginning of moore transfer to apprehension.criticized moore for routine actions that were normally not subject to discipline.he gave moore dangerous assignments,such as requiring him per the sheriff to execute search warrants alone.he gave moore inconsistent orders and then disciplined him for not following some aspect of the orders.in august began requiring moore and his partner to keep daily logs indicating what they were doing during the day,even though it was not a step in the disciplinary procedure and no other officers had been required to do so.after moore was assigned to serve as his executive assistant in september,told him that he should not leave the office except for noon lunch.sheriff fletcher won reelection in november.
joyce shockency was hired as a dispatcher in.she was promoted to deputy sheriff in and to sergeant six years later.in january shockency requested a transfer to the patrol division where she was put in charge of the midnight shift.as the senior officer on duty she communicated with the afternoon and morning shifts to resolve all outstanding issues,reviewed all calls and reports,helped officers prepare for the night shift,processed outgoing mail,worked with dispatch on paperwork,and monitored deputies in the street by radio.she was also responsible for coordinating all first responders in times of emergency,coordinating with surrounding departments,and deciding when it was necessary to contact supervisors.in addition she developed and implemented the field training officer program,a substantial responsibility.shockency did not have any disciplinary problems.
fletcher saw shockency exhibit her support for moore candidacy by marching in a community parade and displaying one of his campaign buttons on her purse.in the summer of deputy don rindal told his colleague rick werdien that shockency would be removed from her position after the election and that he hoped to receive better assignments because of his support for sheriff fletcher.werdien told shockency about this conversation in the winter of.fletcher transferred her to the midnight transportation unit in january.that post was in a less active unit which only afforded her the opportunity to do deputy level work even though she had been serving as a sergeant.she was not allowed to arrest anyone,make a traffic stop,or assist other officers with law enforcement activities.her responsibility for the field training officer program was also taken away,she only supervised one person per shift,and she kept herself busy by filling the day shift cars with gas.at the time of her transfer she was told that she was being reassigned because of reorganization priorities and budget cuts.
moore and shockency sued under,claiming sheriff fletcher and ramsey county violated their first amendment rights to free speech and association by transferring them out of their positions and causing them to lose overtime pay and access to take home vehicles because of their campaign activities.moore also brought first amendment claims against inspector,alleging that demoted him to an executive assistant and improperly disciplined him because of his campaign.plaintiffs also alleged that defendants violated their equal protection and due process rights by treating their speech differently than that of other employees and caused them to lose their property rights in their prior jobs by the transfers.
in his deposition,sheriff fletcher testified that moore was transferred due to communication problems and shockency because of reorganization and budget changes.he added that politics should have no place in employment decisions and that the transfers were not made for political reasons.he affirmed that shockency had never had any disciplinary problems and that her performance had been consistently good and at times exceptional.the sheriff chief deputy,david metusalem,testified that moore and shockency were not part of fletcher management team which consisted of himself,the undersheriffs,and the department planning and policy director.moore and shockency were never invited to participate in management meetings.
sheriff fletcher,and the county moved for summary judgment.they argued that moore and shockency held policymaking positions which sheriff fletcher was entitled to fill with officers loyal to him so the transfers did not violate any constitutional rights and that all claims should be dismissed on the merits.fletcher and argued in the alternative that they were entitled to qualified immunity on the first amendment claims because it was not clearly established that moore and shockency could not be transferred for political patronage reasons.claimed in addition that he was not responsible for moore transfers and it was not clearly established that any other disciplinary action he took toward moore was an adverse employment action.
the district court ruled in favor of the defendants on one claim only.it concluded that plaintiffs had not shown infringement of a protected property right by the alleged adverse employment actions.they had not been terminated,and their rank and pay had not been adversely impacted.their due process claims were therefore dismissed.the court denied summary judgment on the equal protection claims it concluded that plaintiffs had made a prima facie showing that defendants had treated them differently from other employees who had exercised free speech rights and defendants had not rebutted that showing or offered a nondiscriminatory reason for their actions.the court also denied summary judgment on the first amendment claims,for genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether plaintiffs suffered adverse employment actions in retaliation for exercising their first amendment rights.it also denied the alternative motion of fletcher and for qualified immunity on the first amendment claims without undertaking the two step analysis required by the supreme court,see scott harris,d saucier katz,d,but concluding that the law was clearly established that defendants were prohibited from retaliating against plaintiffs for their protected speech.
fletcher and filed this interlocutory appeal arguing that the district court erred in not granting them qualified immunity on the plaintiffs first amendment claims.the county seeks to appeal also,arguing that it should have been dismissed on immunity grounds and that it should be dismissed along with the other appellants.
qualified immunity protects state officials from civil liability for actions that do not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.sexton martin,cir.analyzing whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity is a two step process,and the threshold question is whether the facts taken in the light favoring the nonmoving party show that the official action violated a constitutional right.saucier,at.if that answer is yes,the next question is whether the right was clearly established so that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.id.defendants bear the burden of proving that the law was not clearly established.burnham ianni,cir en banc.we review the denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity de novo,viewing all evidence in a light favorable to the non moving parties.gordon ex.rel.gordon frank,cir.
it is well established that a government employer can not take adverse employment actions against its employees for exercising their first amendment rights.connick myers,d.the employee speech rights are not absolute,for there are competing interests as explained by the supreme court in connick myers,d,and pickering bd.of,d.whether speech activity is constitutionally protected is determined by analyzing whether it relates to a matter of public concern.see connick,at.if the speech is protected,the public employer interest in promoting efficiency is balanced against that of the employee in speaking as a citizen.pickering,at.a government employer is not liable for an adverse employment action taken against its employees for their speech if the government interest outweighs the interest of the employees in their expressive conduct.richardson sugg,cir.
the parties do not dispute that participation in electoral activities is protected under the first amendment and that moore and shockency were exercising such rights.see burson freeman,d the first amendment has its fullest and most urgent application to speech uttered during a campaign for political office citation omitted.they disagree about whether appellees have alleged facts that show they suffered adverse employment actions in retaliation for their speech activity.saucier,at.changes in employment duties or conditions that cause material disadvantage to the employee constitute adverse employment actions,but tangential changes do not.see,ledergerber stangler,cir.lesser actions than demotion,suspension,and termination can be adverse employment actions if their cumulative effect causes an employee to suffer serious employment consequences that adversely affect or undermine his position.kim nash finch,cir adverse employment action occurred where plaintiff duties were drastically reduced,his personnel file was papered with negative reports,his evaluations were drastically lowered,and he was required to participate in special remedial training.a transfer constitutes an adverse employment action when the transfer results in a significant change in working conditions.fisher pharmacia upjohn,cir.
we conclude,taking the facts in the light most favorable to appellees as we must at this point,that fletcher retaliated against moore and shockency for their first amendment conduct by transferring them from supervisory positions into roles with significantly less responsibility.in moore case,he was removed from the highest position available for his rank where he commanded the entire patrol division and supervised employees.though initially transferred to lead the apprehension unit,he was later demoted to a street officer position,and eventually limited to desk work as the election approached.his transfer caused him to lose overtime pay and a take home vehicle.shockency had been the highest ranking sergeant in patrol and in charge of the midnight shift.her supervisory responsibilities were largely eliminated,she lost responsibility for the field training program and she was not given enough duties to fill her hours.we conclude that moore and shockency have alleged sufficient facts to show that fletcher caused them to suffer material changes in their employment that rose to the level of adverse employment actions.see,fisher,at kim,at decrease in compensation not required for adverse employment actions.
argues that he was not responsible for moore initial transfer to the apprehension unit nor for moore later transfer to serve as his executive assistant.although moore alleges that appointed him as his assistant,the portions of the record on which he relies do not support his position.that record indicates that moore learned about his assignment as executive assistant to through a september,memorandum from undersheriff john luey,a member of fletcher management team.sheriff fletcher testified that the decision was made by his management team,which did not include,and testified that the sheriff was responsible for the transfer.although we are to draw all inferences in favor of moore at this stage,we can not adopt a version of the facts that contradicts the record and infer that was responsible for moore demotion.see scott.at.moore also alleges that forced him to execute arrest warrants alone,but the record shows that these instructions were issued per the sheriff.moore contends in addition that he suffered material changes in his employment when made him record all of his time on log,ordered him to stay in his office at all times except for the noon lunch hour,and gave him written reprimands and placed negative notes in his file for conduct other officers were not criticized for doing.whether these additional actions rise to the level of adverse employment actions is a matter of contention relevant on the second step of the qualified immunity analysis.
appellants argue that they did not violate appellees first amendment rights because the department interest in efficiency outweighed the employee interest in protected activities.in order for the pickering balancing test to be relevant appellants must have produced evidence to show that the speech of moore and shockency adversely affected the efficiency of the sheriff department.see burnham,at.appellants assert that they need not show actual disruption,but only that the ordinary or foreseeable effect of the conduct would be to disrupt department efficiency,relying on wright illinois of children and family services,cir,quoting patkus consortium,cir.although law enforcement predictions of disruption are due some deference,the pickering balancing test only need be conducted if a government em
