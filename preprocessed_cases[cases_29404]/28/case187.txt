the district court issued an order on february,granting the plaintiffs motion for declaratory relief on the basis of the plaintiffs due process,equal protection,and voting rights act claims.in this order,the district court explained that t he senate,in its wisdom may vote to void an election,but only after it has developed and applied statewide uniform standards that govern which votes will be counted,practicable procedures to implement them,with an orderly mechanism for judicial review of disputed matters that may arise.at dist.order at.the district court also denied the plaintiffs request for injunctive relief,dismissed the plaintiffs claim for relief pursuant to,and denied the defendants motion to dismiss in all remaining respects.at.the defendants timely appealed this order.

ii.analysis 
the defendants argued at oral argument and in a subsequent letter brief that we should dismiss the case as moot in light of the fact that the election has been voided.the plaintiffs admit that their claims for injunctive relief were mooted by the senate actions in voiding the special election,but they assert that they have an ongoing interest in the declaratory relief issued by the district court.after reviewing the exact relief sought by the plaintiffs and granted by the district court,we agree with the defendants that this case is moot.
simply stated,a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.powell mccormack,d.regardless of whether the parties raised the issue of mootness,our first inquiry on appeal must be whether this case is moot.mcpherson.high sch.athletic ass n,cir en banc.we must so inquire because a federal court has no authority to render a decision upon moot questions or to declare rules of law that can not affect the matter at issue.united states city of detroit,cir quoting cleveland branch,city of parma,cir.the test for mootness is whether the relief sought would,if granted,make a difference to the legal interests of the parties.mcpherson,at internal quotation marks omitted.
