we shall conclude the constitutional guarantee of secret ballot must be balanced against the constitutional right of voters to cast a vote.we further conclude we should respect the legislature determination that fax voting is necessary to allow some voters overseas to vote in california.this is constitutional.
the voters allege improprieties in the fax voting system but have failed to adduce substantial evidence in support of their allegations.we shall therefore reverse the judgment.

the legislative counsel digest states as follows concerning enactment of section 
existing law permits an absent voter to return a ballot by mail to the elections official from whom it came or by personal delivery to the elections official or to a precinct board member at any polling place within the jurisdiction.
this bill would permit a special absentee voter who is temporarily living outside of the territorial limits of the united states or the district of columbia to return his or her ballot by fax transmission to the elections official.the ballot would have to be received by the closing of the election day polls and accompanied by an identification envelope and an oath of voter declaration in a prescribed form.a special absentee voter would be encouraged to return his or her ballot by fax transmission only when necessary for the ballot to be received on election day.this bill would require that the special absentee voter agree to waive his or her right to a secret ballot,but the elections official would nevertheless be required to adopt appropriate procedures to protect the secrecy of ballots returned by fax transmission.the elections official would be required to determine the voter eligibility to vote by comparing the voter signature from the materials returned by fax transmission to the signature on the voter affidavit of registration.
this bill would require the secretary of state to report to the legislature by december,regarding the number of ballots returned by fax transmission and the benefits and problems resulting from the return of ballots by fax transmission.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.stats,ch.
the legislative history of the enactment of section includes the following 
members in our military should be afforded the chance to have their votes counted and voices heard.it is difficult to register overseas voters and get their ballots to them on time in general.in addition,special absentee voters,such as military overseas voters and their families,have traditionally had a difficult time obtaining ballots,voting and returning their ballots in time to be counted.with the increased number of military personnel serving on various fronts around the world,this problem must be remedied.ab would make it possible for a special absentee voter,who is a member of the armed forces of the united states or any auxiliary branch thereof,or a spouse or dependent thereof,and who is temporarily living outside of the united states,who are unable to return their absentee ballots by mail in a timely manner to return them by fax to their county registrar.assem.com.on elections,redistricting and constitutional amendments,bill analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.
because a faxed ballot must be accompanied by an identification envelope,subd.a,and because the identification envelope contains the name and address of the voter fn,ante,someone inspecting an incoming fax ballot will know the identity of the person casting the faxed ballot.
nonetheless,we are of the view that the legislature may authorize voting by fax for citizens outside the country,and may require fax voters to waive their right to a secret ballot,without violating the secret ballot guarantee of article ii,section.
our supreme court has consistently held that the constitutional guarantee of a secret ballot should not stand in the way of measures that are reasonably necessary to ensure that citizens are able to cast a vote.
for example,in peterson city of san diego cal d,peterson,our supreme court held the constitutional provision that voting shall be secret was not violated by a municipal election conducted entirely by mail ballot.the plaintiff argued article ii,section,should be interpreted to require not only that the voter right to secrecy be protected by election procedures but also that the voters be required to cast their votes in secret.id.at.the plaintiff argued that,unless the voter was required to cast his ballot in secret at a polling place,the voter may demonstrate to another person how he voted
