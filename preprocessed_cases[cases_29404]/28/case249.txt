the constitutionality of the statute was in doubt from the beginning.on july,the state attorney general filed a petition with the wisconsin supreme court,seeking a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of the amendments.interestingly,the petition included the following disclosure a s officers of the court the office of the attorney general must advise the court that it has concluded that the constitutionality of the provisions noted above can not be defended because they are plainly in conflict with constitutional principles.in re constitutionality of the revisions to the wisconsin campaign finance law enacted in the special session of the legislature,pet.for leave to commence original action at.the wisconsin supreme court declined to issue an opinion on the constitutionality of the statute.
also on july,a coalition of wisconsin political associations,not including right to life,filed suit in the western district of wisconsin to challenge the statute constitutionality.see.realtors ass n,d at.the district court,on december,held that one section of the statute violated the first amendment on its face moreover,because the statute included a clause,the court held that all of the campaign finance sections of act were voided.the district court enjoined the board from enforcing the statute against the wisconsin realtors ass plaintiffs.the board did not appeal.
of course,the fact that a district court declared the statute to be unconstitutional does not automatically remove the offending text from wisconsin law.since january of,a group of legislators has attempted to formally repeal wisconsin act and make other changes to wisconsin law.see senate bill,available at http.because the bill is still pending,however,wisconsin act remains on the books.in fact,the board website includes a link to the body of wisconsin campaign finance law,including act.

on july,after the purported effective date of the statute and less than two weeks before the special elections scheduled for july,right to life filed suit in the western district of wisconsin,seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against the board.right to life feared that the board would enforce the statute because the injunctive relief provided to the wisconsin realtors ass plaintiffs did not extend to and the board refused to assure right to life that the law would not be applied.
after the litigation ensued,the board hastily issued a letter to right to life indicating that it would not enforce the law against the organization.nevertheless,right to life persisted in seeking injunctive relief.

the district court suggested that the board should change its website to reflect the wisconsin realtors ass decision.the board complied with that request,and the website now explains that by linking its website to wisconsin campaign statutes,the elections board,in no way,is attempting to enforce,adopt,or apply any of the statutory language that has been held unconstitutional see.
