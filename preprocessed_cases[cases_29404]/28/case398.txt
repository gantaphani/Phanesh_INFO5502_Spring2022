these appeals arise out of four cases filed in the district of colorado.in each case,the plaintiffs challenged one or more provisions of colorado fair campaign practices act fcpa.to,on first and fourteenth amendment grounds.the district court dismissed some plaintiffs for lack of standing,upheld most of the challenged provisions,and invalidated others as unconstitutional.all parties appealed,addressing various subsections of.definitions,contribution limits,voluntary spending limits,unexpended contributions,and independent expenditures while the appeals were pending,the colorado general assembly substantially amended the fcpa.see act of march.legis.serv.west hereinafter.various definitions in were added,deleted,or amended.section was repealed and replaced with.section was repealed and not replaced.section was amended was deleted.section was unaffected.
because we hold that the challenges to former,are now moot,we vacate the portions of the district court orders that deal with those sections or with individual plaintiffs standing to challenge them.the appeal as to is dismissed.we reverse the district court judgment as to,and.
discussion 
as stated above,this case includes appeals and from four separate district court actions.our review of the record,the parties notices of appeal,and the briefs indicates that the following provisions of the fcpa are at issue here,generally,and in addition to the substantive validity of the statutes,the parties have also briefed numerous questions relating to standing and ripeness.as explained below,many of the foregoing issues have been mooted by the passage of.
because the existence of a live case or controversy is a constitutional prerequisite to federal court jurisdiction,the court must determine whether a case is moot before proceeding to the merits.mcclendon city of albuquerque,cir citing beattie united states,cir.a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.city of erie pap,d quoting county of los angeles davis,d citation omitted.the crucial question is whether granting a present determination of the issues offered will have some effect in the real world.kennecott utah copper becker,cir quotations and citations omitted.a n actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.arizonans for official english arizona,d quotations and citations omitted.the parties must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome throughout the case.
in general,the repeal of a challenged statute is one of those events that makes it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior here,the threat of prosecution under one of the repealed sections could not reasonably be expected to recur.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d quoting united states concentrated phosphate export ass n,d.indeed,this court has held that a declaratory judgment on the validity of a repealed statute is a textbook example of advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.national advertising city county of denver,cir quotations and citations omitted.the parties have no legally cognizable interest in the constitutional validity of an obsolete statute.thus,the parties challenges to the requirement in,to as a whole and with respect to particular subsections,and to are clearly moot.see,deleting challenged language in.repealing.deleting.
the general assembly also repealed,see,but enacted a new contribution limitation statute in its place.see,codified at.where a new statute is sufficiently similar to the repealed statute that it is permissible to say that the challenged conduct continues,the controversy is not mooted by the change,and a federal court continues to have jurisdiction.northeastern.chapter of associated general contractors of america city of jacksonville,d see also coalition for the abolition of marijuana prohibition city of atlanta,cir a superseding statute or regulation moots a case only to the extent that it removes challenged features of the prior law.quotations and citation omitted rosenstiel rodriguez,cir.we have carefully compared each challenged provision in to the most analogous provision in,and we conclude that the differences between the statutes are too numerous and too fundamental to preserve our jurisdiction over the challenges.compare,with.compare,with.c compare,with.accordingly,the parties appeals with respect to subsections,and of are all moot.
a number of appellants and also contend that the district court erred in upholding or denying the standing of various parties to challenge the contribution limitations in or the voluntary spending scheme set forth in.it is not necessary for this court to decide whether a party had standing to assert a claim that has now become moot.see arizonans,at.accordingly,we need not resolve which parties did and did not have standing to assert their claims under and.for similar reasons,we need not determine whether or not the mooted claims were ripe.
arguments against mootness by colorado and amici 
colorado and amici insist that live controversies persist with respect to,and.colorado contends that the claims are not moot because plaintiffs may eventually seek attorneys fees as prevailing parties,and because there are or may be prosecutions under the repealed provisions.amici common cause and the league of women voters claim that common cause lawsuit challenging the validity of passage has placed the act in jeopardy of being invalidated,thereby leaving the constitutionality of the statute still very much in controversy.we find all three arguments to be without merit.
attorneys fees 
according to colorado,the appeals regarding,and are not moot because the plaintiffs may eventually seek attorneys fees.there is substantial supreme court and tenth circuit precedent to the contrary.
as the secretary correctly notes,the general rule is that an interest in attorney fees is insufficient to create an article iii case or controversy where a case or controversy does not exist on the merits of the underlying claim.in re western pac.airlines,cir quoting cox phelps dodge,cir citing lewis continental bank,d.the secretary argues that this case falls under an exception to the general rule for fees already incurred,relying heavily on the following language in dahlem board of education while a claim of entitlement to attorney fees does not preserve a moot cause of action,the expiration of the underlying cause of action does not moot a controversy over attorney fees already incurred,cir citations omitted,emphasis added.this language means only that a plaintiff may still recover and a defendant may still contest fees even when the merits have been rendered moot.id.the quote does not mean that an otherwise moot issue is revived whenever a prevailing party requests or might request fees.see lewis,at.cautioning lower courts to be sure that mooted litigation is not pressed forward,and unnecessary judicial pronouncements on even constitutional issues obtained,solely in order to obtain reimbursement of sunk costs.
with respect to colorado arguments regarding the merits of whether the plaintiffs are entitled to fees,we note that a joint motion was filed in district court to stay all proceedings concerning attorneys fees pending appeal,and that no fee request has been filed.our jurisdiction is based on our power to review final decisions of district courts.without a final decision from the district court as to whether plaintiffs are entitled to fees,the question is not before this court.
pending and possible future prosecutions 
the secretary also argues that the case is not moot because there is an outstanding state case involving a prosecution under the prior statute.resp.br.re mootness at june,citing league of women voters davidson,roa filed in.on may.league of women voters,however,does not involve any of the repealed provisions.instead,it relates to,and,all of which were unaffected by.
the secretary also claims that the challenges to are not moot because the state may,at some indefinite point in the future,begin prosecuting persons or organizations for violations,thereby having a residual effect on persons who violated the limits before the district court issued its injunction.resp.br.re mootness at june.we agree with the eighth circuit that an allegation of collateral consequences in a separate lawsuit does not fall within any exception to the mootness doctrine nebraska cent.interstate radioactive waste compact comm n,cir accord united states balint,cir t he defendants vulnerability to a future civil suit for contribution by a third party not before us does not preserve this appeal.the seventh circuit case cited by the state,charles daley,cir,is not inconsistent with these holdings.although the court in that case found the possibility that the plaintiffs would be prosecuted under statutes to be insufficiently speculative to moot their challenges,id.at,it also noted the basic principle that federal courts are without power to decide questions that can not affect the rights of the litigants in the case before them id.at quoting north carolina rice,d.in this case,our decision to vacate the district court orders regarding the repealed sections does not extinguish the state right to investigate and prosecute violations,nor does it impair the rights of potential defendants to challenge the constitutionality of the old statutes when and if such prosecutions actually occur.two guys from,mcginley,d agreeing with lower court that if threat of prosecution under arguably superseded state statute arose,and if a state court decided that the statute was still applicable,that would be time enough to consider that statute validity.thus,colorado potential prosecutions argument fails.
pending state court challenge to 
amici common cause and the league of women voters raise one additional argument against mootness that amicus common cause has a pending lawsuit in state court challenging the validity of passage under colorado open meetings act.common cause,colorado,filed june.according to amici,is thus in jeopardy of being invalidated,thereby leaving the constitutionality of the repealed provisions still very much in controversy amici br.in opp to mootness at june.at least one circuit has summarily rejected this argument as allowing parties to play off one court system against another.miller benson,cir whatever the outcome of the state case,this federal case lacks any continuing significance.of course,the amici are not parties,but it is noteworthy that common cause state lawsuit was filed only four days before its brief was filed in this than three months after the allegedly defective passage of.even if the timing of common cause lawsuit is purely coincidental,we do not believe that the mere filing of a lawsuit is sufficient to resurrect article iii jurisdiction over the repealed statutes 
ii.failure to preserve for appeal 
restricts the use of unexpended campaign contributions by providing a list of approved organizations and causes to which such funds may be distributed after a campaign ends.in pertinent part,the statute provides that unexpended campaign contributions to a candidate committee may be 
a contributed to a political party 
b contributed to a candidate committee established by the same candidate for a different public office,subject to the limitations set forth in section b and c,if the candidate committee making such a contribution is affirmatively closed by the candidate no later than ten days after the date such a contribution is made 
c donated to a charitable organization recognized by the internal revenue service 
d returned to the contributors,or retained by the committee for use by the candidate in a subsequent campaign.
ii in no event shall contributions to a candidate committee be used for personal purposes not reasonably related to supporting the election of the candidate.
a,as amended by emphasis added.in addition to the uses described above 
a person elected to a public office may use unexpended campaign contributions held by the person candidate committee for any of the following purposes 
i voter registration 
ii political issue education,which includes obtaining information from or providing information to the electorate 
iii postsecondary educational scholarships 
iv to defray reasonable and necessary expenses related to mailings and similar communications to constituents 
v any expenses that are directly related to such person official duties 
b,as amended by emphasis added.
of the four cases below,only the plaintiffs from durham plaintiffs challenged,at am.compl.by durham et,claim xiv,july.specifically,they take issue with the portion of the statute that prohibits the donation of unexpended campaign contributions to charitable organizations not recognized by the internal revenue service,et.br.at,et.reply br.at,arguing that the restriction infringes on first amendment freedoms.because plaintiffs have failed to preserve the issue for appeal,we have no jurisdiction to reach the merits of this claim.
on february,the district court dismissed durham plaintiff phil pankey,a colorado state senator,from all claims in this civil action except the following panckey sic claim is limited to the carryover provision contained in,at.of the thirteen original durham plaintiffs,only senator pankey had standing to challenge.thus,the district court dismissal of pankey claim effectively terminated the claim in its entirety.
accordingly,the district court never decided the challenge on the merits.indeed,the court first and last reference to after it dismissed the claim in february was in a footnote to its final order in august.
although plaintiff panckey sic continued to argue his claim xiv in civil action,challenging the regulation of unexpended campaign contributions set forth in,the court records reflect that plaintiff panckey sic only remaining claim is claim xv in civil action,wherein he challenges the carryover provision contained in.court order dated february.

we recognize that this case involved a massive number of claims and parties,and that what appears to be consent on paper may in fact have been confusion.but even if we allow plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt as to whether they consented to the dismissal of their challenge,we can not ignore the fact that neither their notice of appeal nor their docketing statement referenced or attached the district court order dated february.see fed.c trotter regents of of new mexico,cir.we therefore decline to address the claim.see smith barry,d holding that the requirements of fed.c are jurisdictional cox phelps dodge,cir noting that courts must consider jurisdictional issues sua sponte,even in the absence of briefing or argument citing paul fire marine ins.barry,d.
iii.merits 
plaintiffs challenges to,a,and remain viable.section defines terms used throughout the fcpa,including independent expenditure,political committee,and political message.section imposes notice and reporting requirements for independent expenditures.section provides mandatory content requirements for political messages produced by independent expenditures.
any judicial consideration of the constitutionality of campaign finance reform legislation must begin with the comprehensive decision in buckley valeo,d.kruse city of cincinnati,cir.in buckley,the supreme court addressed a challenge to several provisions of the federal election campaign act feca of.one provision imposed a annual cap on expenditure s relative to a clearly identified candidate.buckley,at.quoting e.in order to save the statute from constitutional infirmity on vagueness grounds,the court held that relative to must be narrowly construed to apply only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.id.at.emphasis added.
the buckley court articulated the rationale for its holding as follows 
t he distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.candidates,especially incumbents,are intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions.not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on various issues,but campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.
id.at.footnote omitted.this distinction between permissible restrictions on express advocacy and impermissible restrictions on issue advocacy remains viable,and provides the constitutional framework for our analysis.fec massachusetts citizens for life,d hereinafter mcfl fec colorado republican fed.campaign,cir,rev on other grounds,d.
in order to counter the tendency of the line between protected issue advocacy and regulable express advocacy to dissolve in practical application,the buckley court construed the allegedly vague statute at issue as applicable only to communications containing express words of advocacy of election or defeat at.according to the court,only communications containing words such as vote for,elect,support,cast your ballot for,smith for congress,vote against,defeat,reject,would be subject to regulation as express advocacy.id.ten years later,the court clarified that express words of advocacy were not simply a helpful way to identify express advocacy,but that the inclusion of such words was constitutionally required.mcfl,at.thus,communications that do not contain express words advocating the election or defeat of a particular candidate are deemed issue advocacy,which the first amendment shields from regulation,colorado republican fed.campaign,at vermont right to life,sorrell,cir iowa right to life,williams,cir fec christian action network,cir faucher fec,cir.
definitions of independent expenditure,political committee,a,and political message,
we begin with the plain language of the challenged provisions.the fcpa defines an independent expenditure as 
payment of money by any for the purpose of advocating the election or defeat of a candidate,which expenditure is not controlled by,or coordinated with,any candidate or any agent of such candidate.independent expenditure includes expenditures for political messages which unambiguously refer to any specific public office or candidate for such office,but does not include expenditures made by persons,other than political parties and political committees,in the regular course and scope of their business and political messages sent solely to their members.
emphasis added.a political message,which is incorporated in the definition of independent expenditure,is 
a message delivered by telephone,any print or electronic media,or other written material which advocates the election or defeat of any candidate or which unambiguously refers to such candidate.
emphasis added.any person making an independent expenditure over is subject to reporting and notice requirements,see,and to content requirements.see.a willful and intentional violation of or is a class two misdemeanor.see.a political committee,which incorporates both and,and which is in,is 
two or more persons who are elected,appointed,or chosen,or have associated themselves,for the purpose of making contributions to candidate committees,issue committees,political parties,or other political committees,or for the purpose of making independent expenditures.
a emphasis added.political committees are subject to the fcpa contribution restrictions,see,reporting requirements,see,and registration requirements.see.violations of the foregoing provisions are punishable by criminal and civil penalties.see.
without taking evidence or making factual findings,the district court ruled on june,that and a and implicitly,by virtue of its incorporation in did not apply to plaintiffs colorado right to life,crlc or citizens for responsible government,crg.the court therefore dismissed the claims on the merits.id.at.crlc and crg challenge both rulings.they urge this court to hold that the plain language of,a,and renders many substantive provisions of the fcpa applicable to crlc and engage in issue advocacy but not express advocacy.crlc et.br.at.because issue advocacy is core first amendment speech,village of schaumburg citizens for a better environment,d,the plaintiffs argue that the challenged definitions are substantially overbroad,secretary of state of joseph munson,d,not readily susceptible to a narrowing construction,virginia american booksellers ass n,d,and therefore facially unconstitutional.crlc et.br.at.in response,colorado claims that the district court was correct to defer to the secretary narrow construction,under which,a,and apply only to groups formed for the purpose of engaging in express advocacy.answer br.at.colorado asks us to affirm the district court ruling that because the statutes are not applicable to the plaintiffs,they have no standing to challenge them.in any case,the state argues,the statutes are not unconstitutional.
do crlc and crg have standing to challenge,a,and 
we construe the district court order of june,as a dismissal for lack of subject matter,for lack of rule b or h of the federal rules of civil procedure.see steel citizens for a better environment,d.we review a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo,applying the same standard used by the district court.sac fox nation of oklahoma cuomo,cir,cert.denied,d.accordingly,we review the district court interpretation of de novo,houston norton,cir,and construe the allegations in the complaint,and any reasonable inferences to be drawn from them,in favor of plaintiff s.seamons snow,cir see also apple glenn,cir applying same standard of review to sua sponte dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.
the district court described plaintiffs arguments in the following terms crg and crlc contended at the hearing that,although they were not a political committee and they did not engage in independent expenditures as defined by the statute,the provision s of the statute,when read together,made them political committees and brought them within the purview of the statute.order,june.our review of the record indicates that this characterization of plaintiffs arguments was inaccurate.at the hearing referenced by the district court,plaintiffs counsel cogently stated that both plaintiffs crg and crlc do have expenditures which unambiguously refer to candidates for state political office.therefore,they are deemed to have under the statute made an independent expenditure and therefore are deemed to be a political committee.tr.of on mot.for prelim,march.these claims were consistent with the allegations in the complaint.crlc et.compl.at,attached to crlc et.br.at.thus,we do not agree that plaintiffs conceded that the definitions were inapplicable to their organizations.indeed,taking all factual allegations in the complaint as true,and construing all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of plaintiffs,we find that the plain language of,a,and is clearly applicable to crg and crlc and that the organizations face a credible threat of prosecution under the fcpa.accordingly,we hold that the district court erred in denying crg and crlc standing to challenge the definitions.
are subsections,a,and applicable to crg and crlc and their activities 
the district court deferred to colorado narrow construction of the statute,which the court deemed reasonable in light of both the statute purpose and its plain language.order,june.colorado construction focuses on the emphasized portions of the following four clauses in the definition of political message as a message which advocates the election or defeat of any candidate or which unambiguously refers to such candidate,see.answer br.at,the provision that i ndependent expenditure includes expenditures for political messages which unambiguously refer to any specific public office or candidate for such office,see id.at the definition of political committee,in part,as two or more persons who have associated themselves for the purpose of making independent expenditures,see id.at and the exception in the definition of independent expenditure for expenditures made by persons,other than political parties and political committees,in the regular course and scope of their business and political messages sent solely to their members.see id.at.
and do crg and crlc make independent expenditures for political messages 
because the definition of independent expenditure incorporates the definition of political message,we begin our analysis with the definition of political message.under,a political message is a message delivered by telephone,any print or electronic media,or other written material which advocates the election or defeat of any candidate or which unambiguously refers to such candidate.colorado urges us to adopt its reading of.under the state construction,the disjunctive phrase advocates the election or defeat of or unambiguously refers to is read as if it were written in the conjunctive,thereby rendering the statute inapplicable to crlc and do unambiguously refer to candidates,but do not expressly advocate their election or defeat.see.answer br.at.in other words,colorado asks as to construe the fourth or in the definition as signifying and.we are unable to do so.
we interpret state laws according to state rules of statutory construction.phelps hamilton,cir.the goal of colorado courts in interpreting the meaning or scope of any statutory term is to effectuate the intent of the legislature.people mccullough,en banc citations omitted.w e look first to the language of the statute itself to determine the legislative intent.id.at.where the statutory language is clear and unambiguous on its face,there is no need to apply rules of statutory construction because it may be presumed that the legislature meant what it clearly said.in re title,ballot title submission clause summary for,en banc.although was originally proposed via ballot initiative,colorado courts employ the general rules of statutory construction when interpreting measures.bickel city of boulder,en banc.
the definition of political message in is clear and unambiguous.in re,at.we may therefore presume that the legislature meant what it clearly said,that all four uses of the word or in were intended to signify or not sometimes or and sometimes and.foutz united states,cir the word or is not a fertile word which is subject to varied constructions.we need not look to the state construction for assistance with this interpretation our inquiry ends with the plain language of the statute.we hold that the use of the disjunctive term or in renders the definition of political message applicable to messages which unambiguously refer to a candidate,even if such messages do not also advocate the election or defeat of that candidate.in sum,to qualify as a political message under,a message need only be delivered by telephone,any print or electronic media,or other written material,and either a advocate the election or defeat of any candidate or b unambiguously refer to such candidate.
colorado next argument focuses on the definition of independent expenditure in.the first sentence of the definition provides that a payment is an independent expenditure when it is made for the purpose of advocating the election or defeat of a candidate,and not controlled by,or coordinated with,any candidate or any agent of such candidate.the second sentence provides that i ndependent expenditure includes expenditures for political messages which unambiguously refer to any specific public office or candidate for such office.colorado argues that the second sentence does not expand upon the first,but merely clarifies its meaning.answer br.at.again,we disagree.
colorado is among the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions that read the word includes as a term of extension or enlargement when used in a statutory definition.colorado common cause meyer,en banc.therefore,t he use of includes in the statutory definition connotes that something else is encompassed by the definition beyond what was previously covered by the immediately preceding language.id.at citation omitted,emphasis added.in this case,that something else is expenditures for political messages which unambiguously refer to any specific public office or candidate for such office.
as noted above,our standard of review requires us to accept as true the factual allegations underlying plaintiffs challenges.see seamons,at apple,at.in their complaint,crlc and crg each allege that 
the organization purposes are to educate the public on issues relating to abortion,to restore protection of the life for sic unborn children,and to promote the sanctity of all innocent life.its major purpose is not to nominate,elect,or defeat candidates,or to pass or defeat ballot measures,and it does not engage in express advocacy.as part of its issue advocacy,crlc distributes voter guides prior to state elections which educate the voting public on the positions of candidates on issues of public concern.crlc voter guides unambiguously refer to specific candidates but do not expressly advocate the election or defeat of any candidate.
crlc et.compl.at,attached to crlc et.br.at,see also id.at same allegations with respect to crg.accepting these allegations as true,as we must,we hold that the voter guides distributed by crlc and crg clearly constitute political messages,as defined in.crlc and crg also allege that they are not associated with any political candidate,political party,or campaign committee.id.at.in light of our obligation to accord crlc and crg the benefit of all reasonable inferences,we infer from this allegation of independence that the distribution of voter guides is not controlled by,or coordinated with,any candidate or any agent of such candidate.we therefore conclude that the funds expended by crlc and crg to produce and disseminate voter guides are subject to regulation as independent expenditures,as the term is defined in.
ii.a were crlc and crg formed for the purpose of making independent expenditures 
colorado next argument relates to the definition of political committee in a,and relies heavily on common sense alliance davidson.in that case,the colorado supreme court interpreted an analogous fcpa provision,which defines issue committee,in part,as t wo or more persons who are elected,appointed,or chosen,or have associated themselves,for the purpose of accepting contributions and making expenditures to support or oppose any ballot issue or ballot question.i emphasis added.in response to the certified question of whether an organization formed for other purposes may later become an issue committee as defined by the fcpa,common sense alliance,at,the court held that the phrase for the purpose of must be read to include only those issue committees that were formed for the purpose of supporting or opposing a ballot initiative.organizations that form for another purpose and later commit to ballot issue activity are not within the clear ambit of the statute.id.at emphasis added.
this court is bound by the colorado supreme court interpretation of.johnson fankell,d neither this court nor any other federal tribunal has any authority to place a construction on a state statute different from the one rendered by the highest court of the state.american constitutional law,meyer,cir,aff,d.although common sense alliance construed for the purpose of in rather than a,it is a rule that identical words or phrases in the same statute have the same meaning.common cause,at w hen the legislature employs the same words or phrases in different parts of a statute,then,in the absence of any manifest indication to the contrary,the meaning attributed to the words or phrases in one part of the statute should be ascribed to the same words or phrases found elsewhere in the statute.thus,we hold that a political committee is formed when two or more persons associate themselves with the original purpose of making independent expenditures.
crlc,crg,and citizens for responsible government state political action committee filed their initial complaint on december.see docket for.the district court dismissed their claims on june.common sense alliance was decided almost three years later,on march.it is therefore not surprising that plaintiffs complaint only sets forth the organizations present purposes,without specifically alleging the purposes for which they were originally formed.giving plaintiffs the benefit of all reasonable inferences,we surmise that the organizations current purposes are consistent with their original purposes,and that they would be permitted to amend their complaint accordingly.thus,crlc and crg are political committees,as the term is defined in a,and the district court ruling to the contrary was erroneous accordingly,exception for expenditures made by persons,other than political parties and political committees,in the regular course and scope of their business does not apply to crg or crlc.
do crlc and crg face a credible threat of prosecution under the fcpa 
a plaintiff need not await and undergo a criminal prosecution in order to challenge a statute on constitutional grounds.babbitt united farm workers union,d quoting doe bolton,d.article iii standing exists w hen the plaintiff has alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest,but proscribed by a statute,and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder id.the plaintiff need not demonstrate to a certainty that it will be prosecuted.right to life,at,only that it has an actual and fear that the law will be enforced against it.id.quoting american booksellers,at.
throughout this litigation,colorado has insisted that under the state construction of,a,and,organizations like crlc and crg will not be prosecuted under the fcpa.answer br.at.such representations,however,are insufficient to overcome the chilling effect of the statute plain language.in this sense,this case presents an even more compelling threat of prosecution than the plaintiff faced in vermont right to life committee,sorrell,cir.the statute challenged in vermont right to life established content requirements for political advertisements that only implicitly advocate d the success or defeat of a candidate.id.at quoting.stat.ann.tit.the statute required all such advertisements to clearly designate the name of the candidate,party or political committee by or on whose behalf the same is published or broadcast.id.quoting.stat.ann.tit,emphasis added.the state read on whose behalf to mean only as the agent or representative of the plaintiff read the phrase to include any advertisement supporting a viewpoint with which a candidate is associated or with which his or her opponent takes issue id.at.while suggesting that the state construction was perhaps even better,the second circuit deemed the plaintiff construction reasonable enough to support a legitimate fear of prosecution.id.in this case,we need not defer to either side construction.as discussed above,crg and crlc are clearly covered by the plain language of the statute.
this case is also distinguishable from wisconsin right to life,paradise,cir,in which the court denied the plaintiff standing to challenge an ambiguously worded statute because the interpretive mandate sought in the lawsuit was already codified in an advisory opinion by the wisconsin attorney general and in regulations promulgated by the wisconsin election board.id.at.the court therefore held that the plaintiff fear of prosecution was not,id.at,characterizing the lawsuit as an attempt to resolve a controversy that has not yet arisen and may never arise.id.at.in the present case,we are aware of no such administrative regulations,and the secretary representations in this litigation are not binding on this or future administrations.see american booksellers,at a s the state attorney general does not bind the state courts or local law enforcement authorities,we are unable to accept her interpretation of the law as authoritative.accord.right to life,at citations omitted.we therefore hold that the fear of prosecution alleged by crlc and crg is sufficiently to support article iii standing.
are,a,and constitutional 
having determined that crlc and crg have standing to challenge,a,and on constitutional grounds,we now consider the merits of those claims.we review questions of constitutional law de novo.united states wynne,cir.although plaintiffs characterize their argument as an overbreadth challenge,crlc et.br.at,we must consider the supreme court admonition that overbreadth analysis is strong medicine,to be applied sparingly and only as a last resort.broadrick oklahoma,d.the court has recently affirmed that the overbreadth doctrine enables litigants to challenge a statute,not because their own rights of free expression are violated,but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.hill colorado,d quoting broadrick,at.emphasis added.in this case,it is unnecessary to employ the overbreadth doctrine because the challenged definitions are unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs crlc and crg.see brockett spokane arcades,d noting that one of the cardinal rules governing the federal courts is never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied quotations and citation omitted.the phrases which unambiguously refer to any specific public office or candidate for such office in,and or unambiguously refers to such candidate in,each extend the reach of the fcpa substantive provisions to advocacy with respect to public issues,which is a violation of the rule enunciated in buckley and its progeny.right to life,at.
we must next inquire whether the definitions,though unconstitutional as written,can be saved.see nlrb jones laughlin steel.the cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save and not to destroy.courts employ two mechanisms to preserve unconstitutional statutes from wholesale invalidation.see new york ferber,d american civil liberties union reno,cir.first,if a statute is readily susceptible to a narrowing construction that will remedy the constitutional infirmity,the statute will be upheld.american booksellers,at.if the language is not readily susceptible to a narrowing construction,but the unconstitutional language is severable from the remainder of the statute,that which is constitutional may stand while that which is unconstitutional will be rejected.brockett,at.quotations omitted.
can the definitions be saved by a narrowing construction 
in order to save the definitions,they must be construed to apply only to expenditures for communications that contain explicit words advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.see buckley,at.it is that a federal court must uphold a statute if it is readily susceptible to a narrowing construction that would make it constitutional the key to application of this principle is that the statute must be readily susceptible to the limitation we will not rewrite a state law to conform it to constitutional requirements.american booksellers,at.citations omitted,emphasis added.even the supreme court is without power to adopt a narrowing construction of a state statute unless such a construction is reasonable and readily apparent.stenberg carhart,d quotations and citations omitted see also united states,d statute must be genuinely susceptible to narrowing construction city of houston hill,d fairly or obviously susceptible erznoznik city of jacksonville,d easily susceptible.
in order to narrow and so that they are consistent with buckley,we would not only have to add qualifying language indicated with an underline,but would also have to disregard entire phrases indicated by strikeouts 
independent expenditure means payment of money by any person for the purpose of expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate,which expenditure is not controlled by,or coordinated with,any candidate or any agent of such candidate.independent expenditure includes expenditures for political messages which unambiguously refer to any specific public office or candidate for such office 
political message means a message delivered by telephone,any print or electronic media,or other written material which expressly advocates the election or defeat of any candidate or which unambiguously refers to such candidate.
to rewrite the statutes in this manner would exceed the power and function of the court,and would fail to bind state prosecutors,leaving the citizens of colorado vulnerable to prosecutions under the actual language of the statute.see stenberg.at american booksellers,at.accordingly,we decline colorado invitation to give the statute s a construction more restrictive than that provided by their plain language.wilson stocker,cir.as written,and are not susceptible of a narrowing construction.as explained below,however,we can sever the problematic language from the definitions and then narrowly construe the remaining text.
invalidation 
although we can not save the definitions with a narrowing construction,we need not invalidate the entire statutory scheme.in brockett spokane arcades,d,the court reversed the ninth circuit facial invalidation of a state obscenity statute according to the normal rule that partial,rather than facial,invalidation is the required course.id.at.the statute at issue codified the supreme court definition of obscenity,see miller california,d,including the requirement that the average person,applying contemporary community standards,would find that the material,when considered as a whole,appeals to the prurient interest brockett,at.quoting.a.unlike miller,which left the word undefined,the washington statute defined prurient as that which incites lasciviousness or lust.id.quoting.the court assumed without deciding that the ninth circuit was correct in holding that the inclusion of lust rendered the definition overbroad,see id.at,but held that f acial invalidation of the statute was nevertheless improvident.id.at.
noting that the same statute may be in part constitutional and in part unconstitutional,the brockett court held that if the parts are wholly independent of each other,that which is constitutional may stand while that which is unconstitutional will be rejected.id.at.quotations and citations omitted accord denver area educational telecomms.consortium,fcc,d breyer,concurring.t he rule that a federal court should not extend its invalidation of a statute further than necessary to dispose of the case before it applies with equal force in the first amendment context.brockett,at.in order to determine whether partial invalidation of a state statute is appropriate,federal courts look to state law.id.at.
the fcpa contains the following severability clause 
if any provision of this article or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid,such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the article which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application,and to this end the provisions of this article are declared to be severable.
under colorado law,a severability clause creates a presumption that the legislature would have been satisfied with the portions of the statute that remain after the offending provisions are stricken as being unconstitutional.people seven east colfax,en banc citation omitted,cited with approval in people district court,en banc.the presumption of severability raised by the clause is dispelled only if what remains is so incomplete or riddled with omissions that it can not be salvaged as a meaningful legislative enactment.city of lakewood colfax unlimited ass n,en banc quotations,alterations,and citation omitted,cited with approval in people district court,at accord montezuma well service,industrial claim appeals office of state.
in this case,the constitutionally problematic portions are discrete and their removal would not compromise the integrity or coherence of the statute in any way.the presumption of severability raised by is therefore controlling.we conclude that the unconstitutional phrases are severable,and we hereby declare subsections,a,and of invalid only insofar as they reach beyond that which may constitutionally be regulated.brockett,at.specifically,we strike only the language indicated below 
independent expenditure means payment of money by any person for the purpose of advocating the election or defeat of a candidate,which expenditure is not controlled by,or coordinated with,any candidate or any agent of such candidate.independent expenditure includes expenditures for political messages which unambiguously refer to any specific public office or candidate for such office 
political message means a message delivered by telephone,any print or electronic media,or other written material which advocates the election or defeat of any candidate or which unambiguously refers to such candidate.
without the stricken phrases,the remainder of the definitions are readily susceptible to an interpretation that is consistent with buckley and,that a political message is a message delivered by telephone,any print or electronic media,or other written material which expressly advocates the election or defeat of any candidate,and that an independent expenditure is payment of money for the purpose of expressly advocating the election or defeat of any candidate,buckley,at.
imposes disclosure requirements on independent expenditures exceeding under,the donor must provide written notice of each such expenditure to the secretary of state,as well as to each candidate in the race the provision.the notice must be in writing and must include the amount of the expenditure,a detailed description of the use of the expenditure,and the name of the candidate whom the expenditure is intended to support or oppose.the notice must be delivered to all candidates and to the secretary of state within hours after obligating funds for the expenditure.violations of are punishable by a penalty of ten dollars per day for each day that a statement or other information required to be filed is not filed by the close of business on the day due.
plaintiffs challenge on two grounds.first,they contend that the phrase obligating funds is impermissibly vague.second,they assert that the disclosure requirements,particularly the requirement,unconstitutionally burden their first amendment rights because the requirements are not narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest.because we hold that is not narrowly tailored,we need not reach plaintiffs vagueness argument.
as this court has recently noted,our analysis of any statute turn s in large measure on whether the regulation at issue is subject to a balancing test or strict scrutiny.campbell buckley,cir.the supreme court has recently affirmed that exacting scrutiny is necessary when compelled disclosure of payments is at issue.buckley american constitutional law foundation,d citation omitted hereinafter aclf see also timmons twin cities area new party,d regulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs rights must be narrowly tailored and advance a compelling state interest.campbell,at s trict scrutiny is employed where the quantum of speech is limited due to restrictions on campaign expenditures or the anonymity of supporters of a candidate or initiative.citations omitted.
a state may constitutionally require that independent expenditures be reported to some governmental entity and made available to the public,buckley,at.such requirements are supported by three compelling governmental interests.first,disclosure provides the electorate with information as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate in order to aid the voters in evaluating those who seek federal office.buckley,at.quotations and footnote omitted see also aclf,at.second,disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the app
