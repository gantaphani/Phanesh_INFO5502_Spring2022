north carolina provides three ways for a candidate to appear on a general election ballot when running for a partisan federal,state,county,or municipal office first,a recognized political party may nominate candidates.second,unaffiliated candidates may petition to appear on a general election ballot.third,and most relevant here,a new political party may nominate candidates.
in this appeal,al pisano,nicholas triplett,the north carolina constitution party,and the north carolina green party raise an challenge to north carolina may deadline for the formation of new political parties they contend that the deadline violates the first and fourteenth amendments because it imposes an unjustified,severe burden on their ability to field presidential candidates.they also assert that the deadline violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because it places an additional,substantial burden on them that is not imposed on unaffiliated candidates or recognized political parties.
the district court held that discovery was not necessary to determine the constitutionality of the deadline and upheld its validity,noting that the deadline has no impact on plaintiffs constitutional rights.even assuming that it did,however,the court concluded that the deadline is justified,and any burden it imposes is ameliorated by other aspects of north carolina statutory framework.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
we begin with a brief sketch of the relevant statutory framework before turning to the issues presented.
north carolina election law provides that a recognized political party may nominate candidates for federal,state,and local offices.mclaughlin bd.of elections,cir.recognized political parties must nominate their candidates by primary election unless only one candidate from that party seeks election for a particular office.id.at see also.north carolina recognizes a political party if it polled at least two percent of the entire votes cast in the state for governor or for presidential electors.see.a.
a new political party may also nominate candidates.see id.to do so,a qualifying new party must select its candidates by party convention and submit its nominees by july.id.to qualify as a new party,a group must file petitions with the state board of elections before pm on june in the election year in which the group desires to participate.id.a.a separate petition must be filed for each county in which the group gathers signatures.see id.b.
the petitions must collectively be signed by registered and qualified voters in north carolina equal in number to two percent of the total number of voters who voted in the most recent general election for governor,with at least signatures from each of at least four congressional districts.id.a.in addition to complying with the june deadline,a group must submit each petition for verification to the chairperson of the county board of elections in the county where the signatures were obtained by pm on may id.
groups seeking to form new political parties are not limited to a short time frame for gathering signatures and have notice of the number of signatures required years before the deadline.this is so because the number of required signatures is based on the total number of votes cast in the previous gubernatorial election.see id.a.north carolina does not preclude voters from signing petitions based on their party affiliation or from signing multiple petitions.
north carolina held a primary election on may.the republican presidential candidate was nominated in august,and the democratic presidential candidate was nominated in september.the general election was held on november.to nominate candidates for north carolina general election ballot,a group needed to collect and timely submit signatures,a figure amounting to two percent of the total number of votes cast in north carolina gubernatorial election.
the north carolina constitution party and al pisano filed suit against the executive director of the state board of elections and its members on march.on april,they filed an amended complaint,joined by the north carolina green party and nicholas triplett.plaintiffs allege that the may deadline violates the first and fourteenth amendments and the equal protection clause because it severely burdens their ability to field presidential candidates.although plaintiffs do not challenge north carolina two percent signature requirement,they argue that the deadline,in combination with the signature requirement,creates an impermissible barrier to ballot access.plaintiffs moved in the district court for a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of the may deadline in the presidential election,which the district court denied.
the parties subsequently held a conference in which they agreed not to take discovery until the district court ruled on defendants motion for summary judgment or plaintiffs motion under federal rule of civil procedure d for discovery.the district court denied the rule d motion on october,concluding that discovery was not needed to decide whether the may deadline is unconstitutional.the court allowed plaintiffs time to file additional affidavits before the court ruled on the summary judgment motion,but plaintiffs did not take advantage of that opportunity.
on march,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment it first stated that the filing deadline has no impact on plaintiffs rights and that it is instead the unchallenged two percent signature requirement that imposes a severe burden.the court then concluded,however,that the filing deadline is constitutional even if it does impose a burden.applying strict scrutiny,the court determined that the deadline is narrowly tailored and that any burden it imposes is significantly lessened by the alleviating factors in the overall statutory scheme.the district court also rejected plaintiffs equal protection claim,holding that groups seeking to form new political parties are not similarly situated to unaffiliated candidates or recognized political parties.this appeal followed.
plaintiffs first argue that the district court erred in denying their rule d motion.rule d mandates that summary judgment be denied when the nonmovant has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition.ingle ex rel.estate of ingle yelton,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a court should hesitate before denying a rule d motion when the nonmovant seeks necessary information possessed only by the movant.id.at.but a court may deny a rule d motion when the information sought would not by itself create a genuine issue of material fact sufficient for the nonmovant to survive summary judgment.id.at.we review a district court denial of a rule d motion for abuse of discretion.greater balt.ctr.for pregnancy concerns,at.
plaintiffs sought the following discovery production of any state records regarding minor parties attempts to gain ballot access for presidential candidates in north carolina a deposition of gary bartlett,then executive director of the state board of elections,to explore north carolina justifications for the may deadline and information from officials in other states as to the efficacy of later filing deadlines.they contend that this discovery was essential to their ability to oppose summary judgment.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion on this issue.to begin with,the record includes information regarding other minor parties efforts to gain ballot access in recent years.between and,the libertarian party qualified as a new party four times and qualified once as a recognized political party based on previous election results.the reform party qualified as a new party twice,and the natural law party and the americans elect party each qualified as a new party once.we also know that as of april,five groups other than plaintiffs had expressed interest in forming new political parties but had not submitted any signatures.in addition,the state board of elections posts the status of current statewide petitions in each county on its website.plaintiffs do not appear to dispute this record evidence they simply want more.
plaintiffs complain that they do not know precisely how many groups have attempted but failed to qualify as new political parties.true enough,but we are satisfied that this information by itself would not create a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to preclude summary judgment,given that the question before us is principally one of law,and there is a wealth of case law assessing similar challenges.
second,with respect to north carolina reasons for the may deadline,the record provides justifications.in a sworn declaration,bartlett highlighted the problems that the state fears would arise without requirements,including tremendous voter confusion and chaos.at bottom,plaintiffs want to compel north carolina to say more in support of the may deadline.but the fact that plaintiffs believe the state has provided only ephemeral support for the deadline goes to the merits of their claim not to whether the district court properly denied the rule d motion.
finally,plaintiffs sought information from officials in other states about possible alternatives to the may deadline,presumably to attack the merits of north carolina choice.the district court,however,did not bar plaintiffs from obtaining and presenting that evidence.to the contrary,it gave plaintiffs ample opportunity to offer additional affidavits before considering the summary judgment motion,but plaintiffs simply chose not to do so.
we find no abuse of discretion on this record.
we next consider whether the may deadline violates plaintiffs first and fourteenth amendment rights.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see green party state election comm n,cir.
it is well established that restrictions implicate substantial voting,associational and expressive rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments.mclaughlin,at.in analyzing whether state election laws impermissibly infringe on such rights,the supreme court has instructed us to weigh 
the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate against the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,taking into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff rights.

applying the framework,we have stated that election laws that impose a severe burden on ballot access are subject to strict scrutiny,and a court applying strict scrutiny may uphold the restrictions only if they are narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.mclaughlin,at internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,if a statute imposes only modest burdens,then a state important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions.green party,at internal quotation marks omitted.
when deciding whether a state filing deadline is unconstitutionally burdensome,we evaluate the combined effect of the state regulations.see wood meadows,cir when determining whether a given state filing deadline unconstitutionally burdens candidates and voters rights,a court must examine that state ballot access scheme in its entirety.
although the district court relied on our decision in mclaughlin when it applied strict scrutiny,we do not believe that mclaughlin addresses the appropriate level of scrutiny that we should apply here.there,we considered several challenges to north carolina statutory framework,including its retention requirement to qualify as a recognized political party.see at.then,as now,north carolina imposed a two percent signature requirement on groups seeking to form new political parties.see id.at.at the time,however,the state also required that a notarized affidavit and a verification fee accompany each signature id.at.furthermore,a political party could only retain the right to field candidates if its nominee for governor or for president received at least ten percent of the votes cast in the previous general election for governor or president id.at.
in mclaughlin,the libertarian party challenged the ten percent retention requirement,as it had satisfied the requirements to form a new political party multiple times.id.at.we recognized that the burden imposed by north carolina restrictions was undoubtedly severe because,as history reveal ed,those regulations ma d e it extremely difficult for any third party to participate in electoral politics.id.at.moreover,we expressed concern about the regulations impact on candidates for local offices.in effect,the regulations prevented any candidates for local offices from designating their party affiliation on the ballot unless their group met the two percent or ten percent if the corresponding number of signatures or votes far exceeded the number of people entitled to vote for that local office.id.at.concluding that strict scrutiny applied because the restrictions imposed a severe burden,see id.at,we nevertheless rejected the libertarian party challenge in light of applicable supreme court precedent,id.at.we did not expressly decide,however,whether north carolina filing deadline is constitutional 
nor does mclaughlin mandate that we apply strict scrutiny in this case.in mclaughlin,we considered a significantly more restrictive statutory framework in the context of a different type of challenge.north carolina no longer requires groups seeking new party status to submit notarized affidavits and verification fees,nor does it impose a ten percent retention requirement.see.thus,the pre history that we discussed in mclaughlin is immaterial to the question at hand whether the current statutory framework imposes a severe burden.in addition,plaintiffs challenge the filing deadline only in the context of presidential elections,which involve the entire statewide electorate.thus,our concern in mclaughlin about the regulations effect on candidates in local elections is irrelevant here.
with this background in mind,we address the constitutionality of the may deadline as applied to plaintiffs.consistent with the supreme court analytical framework,we base our conclusions directly on the first and fourteenth amendments and do not engage in a separate equal protection clause analysis.norman,at quoting anderson,at see also libertarian party of ohio blackwell,f d,cir same council of alt.political parties hooks,cir same.
we first address whether the filing deadline imposes a severe burden on plaintiffs constitutional rights.plaintiffs assert that the may deadline,in combination with the unchallenged two percent signature requirement,creates an impermissible barrier to ballot access specifically,plaintiffs contend that the may deadline prevents them from gathering signatures at the height of the presidential election season.according to them,early filing deadlines impose a severe burden by requiring parties to gather signatures when the election is remote,before voters focus on the campaigns.plaintiffs emphasize that the may deadline comes before most of the presidential candidates have been selected and before the candidates political platforms are defined.
plaintiffs argument ignores important alleviating factors in north carolina statutory framework.north carolina does not limit groups to a short time frame for gathering signatures,and groups are on notice of the number of signatures they need to collect years before the deadline.plaintiffs thus have ample opportunity to collect signatures when voters are engaged,such as during primaries and other elections.and they have a large pool from which to collect signatures,as the state does not preclude voters from signing petitions based on their party affiliation or from signing multiple petitions.
plaintiffs also misconstrue the timeline for presidential election cycles.although the republican and democratic parties did not officially nominate their candidates for president until august and september of,the names of potential recognizedparty candidates and their platforms were known well before the may deadline.given that north carolina held a primary on may
