in,the arizona legislature enacted a law requiring the voter registration form distributed by the arizona secretary of state to list the two largest parties as measured by number of registered voters on the form,as well as provide a blank line for other party preferences.the arizona green party,arizona libertarian party,and three of their members together,plaintiffs brought this action,alleging that the new voter registration form violated their first and fourteenth amendment rights.the district court concluded that the amended voter registration form survived constitutional scrutiny and granted the state motion for summary judgment.we have jurisdiction under u,and we affirm.
section a and the registration form 
in,the arizona legislature amended the statute that dictates the content of the voter registration form provided by the state the registration form.see.legis.serv.ch.west codified at.a.the amended statute provides,in relevant part 
a.the form used for registration of electors shall contain 
the registrant party preference.the two largest political parties that are entitled to continued representation on the ballot shall be listed on the form in the order determined by calculating which party has the highest number of registered voters at the close of registration for the most recent general election for governor,then the second highest.the form shall allow the registrant to circle,check or otherwise mark the party preference and shall include a blank line for other party preference options.
a.prior to the amendment,arizona law required only that voter registration forms include a blank space for t he registrant party preference.see.a.as of january,the two parties with the highest number of registered voters in arizona were the republican party,with approximately percent,and the democratic party,with approximately percent.the next largest party was the libertarian party,with approximately percent of registered voters 
in response to the amendment,the arizona secretary of state revised box on the registration form.in its current form,box appears as follows 
the blank line under the other checkbox is approximately.inch long.the registration form also provides the following instructions regarding box 
fill in your political party preference in box.if you leave this box blank as a first time registrant in your county,your party preference will be party not designated.if you leave this box blank and you are already registered in the county,your current party preference will be retained.please write full name of party preference in box.
arizona voter registration scheme 
under arizona law,qualified may register to vote in one of three ways 
they may obtain,fill out,and mail in the registration form,which can be downloaded from the secretary of state website or picked up from either the secretary of state office or any local county recorder office,see.
they may submit an online voter registration application using the ez voter registration process,available at the arizona department of transportation service website,see.b see also.dep t of transp.motor vehicle,service arizona,http last visited,or,
they may register in person at arizona motor vehicle division offices by filling out a section provided on the form for a driver license or renewal for individuals who want to register to vote.
section a applies only to the first of these three options that is,only the secretary of state is required to provide checkboxes for the two largest parties on the registration form.see.e providing that the content regulations set forth in a do not apply to registrations received from the department of transportation.like the secretary of state form before the amendment to a,the second and third options allow a registrant to indicate party preference by entering any party name,including a major party 
arizona ballot access laws 
under arizona law,there are two ways for a party to get its preferred candidate on the ballot first,a new political party becomes eligible for recognition upon filing a petition with the secretary of state signed by a number of qualified electors equal to one and percent of the total votes cast for governor at the last preceding general election at which a governor was elected.a.recognition entitles a new political party to be represented by an official party ballot at the primary election and accorded a ballot column at the succeeding general election through at least the next two regularly scheduled general elections for federal office immediately following recognition of the political party.b.
after these first two federal election cycles,a party may continue to be represented by an official party ballot during a primary election and accorded a ballot column in the succeeding general election that is,the party is entitled to continuing ballot access in one of two ways.first,a party is entitled to continuing ballot access if its candidate receives not less than five per cent of the total votes cast for governor or presidential electors at the last preceding general election for certain specified offices.a.second,a party is entitled to continuing ballot access if,on certain dates prescribed by statute,the party has registered electors in the party equal to at least of one per cent of the total registered electors in such jurisdiction.b.a party that loses continuing ballot access may get it back the same way a new party would gain access to the ballot it must submit another petition signed by a number of qualified electors equal to one and percent of the total votes cast for governor at the last preceding general election at which a governor was elected.see.b.
when plaintiffs filed their complaint,five parties had continuing ballot access republican,democratic,green,libertarian,and americans elect.during the pendency of this appeal,the arizona green party lost its continuing ballot access 
procedural history 
plaintiffs complaint,filed against defendant ken bennett,as arizona secretary of state,alleges that a violated their first and fourteenth amendment rights.plaintiffs sought an order from the district court enjoining the state from issuing voter registration forms that failed to treat equally the four parties with statewide continuing ballot access.on the parties for summary judgment,the district court denied plaintiffs motion and granted the state motion.plaintiffs timely appeal.
this court reviews the constitutionality of a statute de novo.see chamness bowen,cir.
a.the framework for resolving constitutional challenges to state election laws 
restrictions on voting can burden equal protection rights as well as interwoven strands of liberty protected by the first and fourteenth amendments namely,the right of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs,and the right of qualified voters,regardless of their political persuasion,to cast their votes effectively.dudurn,at quoting anderson celebrezze,d some internal quotation marks omitted as the supreme court has recognized,these rights are generally guaranteed by ensuring that political parties,including those that are new to the political scene,are given the opportunity to place their candidate on the ballot.see.state bd.of elections socialist workers party,d the freedom to associate as a political party has diminished practical value if the party can be kept off the ballot.indeed,because an election campaign is an effective platform for the expression of views on the issues of the day,and a candidate serves as a for citizens,anderson,at,the right to vote is heavily burdened if that vote may be cast only for one of two parties at a time when other parties are clamoring for a place on the ballot.williams rhodes,d.
at the same time,however,states retain the power to regulate their own elections.dudum,at quoting burdick takushi,d.common sense,as well as constitutional law,compels the conclusion that government must play an active role in structuring elections.id.at quoting burdick,at.the constitution itself provides that states may prescribe the times,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives.burdick,at quoting const.art.i,cl.brackets omitted.and,t o achieve these necessary objectives,states have enacted comprehensive and sometimes complex election codes.anderson,at.moreover,every law regulating elections,whether it governs the registration and qualifications of voters,the selection and eligibility of candidates,or the voting process itself,inevitably affects at least to some degree the individual right to vote and his right to associate with others for political ends.id.
thus,in order to resolve the tension between a party first amendment rights and the state interest in preserving the fairness and integrity of the voting process,the supreme court developed a balancing test.rubin city of santa monica,cir.in considering a constitutional challenge to an election law,we must weigh the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments against the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.nader cronin,cir per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,the severity of the burden the election law imposes on the plaintiff rights dictates the level of scrutiny applied by the court.id.quoting nader brewer,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also burdick,at t he rigorousness of our inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens first and fourteenth amendment rights.an election regulation that imposes a severe burden is subject to strict scrutiny and will be upheld only if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.cronin,at quoting brewer,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.by contrast,a state may justify election regulations imposing a lesser burden by demonstrating the state has important regulatory interests.id.quoting brewer,at.
section a imposes a de minimus burden on plaintiffs constitutional rights 
in cases previously examining differing treatments of minor and major political parties,we have held that,in determining the nature and magnitude of the burden that the state election procedures impose on the minor party,we must examine the entire scheme regulating ballot access.cronin,at quoting libertarian party of munro,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted the relevant inquiry is whether reasonably diligent minor party candidates can normally gain a place on the ballot,or if instead they only rarely will succeed.munro,at quoting storer brown,d see also anderson,at noting that the relevant inquiry in determining the constitutionality of election regulations is the ability of voters preferred candidates to get on the ballot.moreover,the party challenging the law bears the initial burden of showing that the state ballot access requirements seriously restrict the availability of political opportunity.munro,at.
plaintiffs have failed to make any such showing.section a does not directly inhibit the ability of any party to gain access to the ballot,nor does it articulate different criteria for major and minor parties who seek to get their candidates on the ballot.all new political parties and parties that have lost continuing ballot access are required to comply with the same criteria to get their candidate on the ballot.see.moreover,all political parties,major and minor alike,are entitled to continuing ballot access if their candidates gamer at least five percent of the total votes cast for governor or presidential electors at the last preceding general election for certain specified offices or,they have registered electors equal to at least of one percent of the total registered electors in the relevant jurisdiction by a specified date.
acknowledging that a does not directly burden their ability to get their preferred candidate on the ballot,plaintiffs instead assert that the statute indirectly restrict s the availability of political opportunity,munro,at,by encouraging voters to register with the two major parties over all others.this encouragement,plaintiffs contend,affects their ability to get their preferred candidate on the ballot,because continuing ballot access is linked at least partially to the number of voters who are registered with the party.
plaintiffs have failed,however,to adduce any evidence that a actually encourages individuals to register for major parties instead of minor ones.as an initial matter,plaintiffs have failed to show how many new voters actually use the registration form to register,as opposed to using one of the other three alternative means,which do not require use of the registration form.without some assessment of how many voters actually use the registration form,we can not even begin to gauge the impact it may have had on party registration rolls.
moreover,even if we were to assume that a significant number of voters used the registration form,plaintiffs failed to adduce any evidence statistical,anecdotal,or otherwise that the registration form has,in fact,encouraged voters to register for the major parties over minor ones.plaintiffs suggest that the registration form discourages voters from registering with minor parties by sending a message to the future voter that there are only two real political parties in this state,and that r egistering for any other party is a show of eccentricity that must be grudgingly tolerate d.however,plaintiffs failed to introduce even an iota of evidence in support of this assertion.the alleged psychological effects that the registration form has on registering voters is sheer speculation plaintiffs other contention that voters have been unable to register with the party of their choosing because the blank line below the word other in box is too short to contain even the word libertarian is similarly unsupported by any evidence in the record.
in sum,by failing to adduce evidence that the registration form actually discourages or prevents voters from registering with minor parties,plaintiffs have failed to meet their initial burden of showing that arizona ballot access requirements seriously restrict the availability of political opportunity.munro,at.at most,a imposes a de minimus burden on plaintiffs first and fourteenth amendment rights.
section a is rationally related to a legitimate state interest 
where,as here,a state election law imposes only a de minimus burden on a party first and fourteenth amendment rights,the state need demonstrate only that the statute at issue is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.cronin,at quoting munro,at internal quotation marks omitted in evaluating the constitutionality of such statutes,we may look to any conceivable interest promoted by the challenged procedures,whether or not the state cited that interest in its briefs or in the district court.munro,at see also dudum,at noting that,in sustaining an election law that did not impose a severe burden on constitutional rights,the supreme court in timmons twin cities area new party,d,expressly relied on a state interest admittedly not advanced in its briefs,but mentioned during oral argument.furthermore,we need not determine whether the interests served by a can be better served by other means as we recently concluded,when a challenged rule imposes only limited burdens on the right to vote,there is no requirement that the rule is the only or the best way to further the proffered interests.dudum,at finally,where,as here,the regulation at issue imposes only a slight burden on a party constitutional rights,that party bear s the burden of demonstrating that the regulations it attack s have no legitimate rational basis.munro,at.
plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden.section a is rationally related to arizona legitimate interest in ensuring that election official correctly register voters as members of parties of their choosing.by providing checkboxes for the two largest political parties,the registration form reduces the potential that an election official will incorrectly register a voter who wishes to affiliate with one of the state two most prominent parties.because the overwhelming majority of arizona voters are registered with one of the two major parties,the checkb
