a landmark reform to the nation campaign finance laws,the bipartisan campaign finance reform act of,stat,took aim at two perceived demons of federal electoral contests soft money,use of unregulated political party activities to influence federal elections,and sham issue ads,ostensibly advocacy functioning in practice as unregulated campaign advertising.these two tactics,given broad scope by permissive federal election commission rulings,infused federal campaigns with hundreds of millions of dollars in federally unregulated funds,much of it contributed by corporations and labor unions.now bcra house sponsors joined by senate sponsors as amici claim the fec has undone their hard work,resurrecting in its regulations practices bcra eradicated and thus forcing them to seek reelection in illegally constituted electoral contests.considering this facial challenge to the regulations,the district court invalidated some fifteen rules,finding some inconsistent with the statute and others arbitrary and capricious.the fec appeals regarding five key rules standards for coordinated communication,definitions of the terms solicit and direct,the interpretation of electioneering communication,allocation rules for state party employee salaries,and a de minimis exemption from allocation rules governing certain contributions,known as levin funds,to state and local parties.we affirm in all respects.
needless to say,federal campaign finance law is complex,and bcra is no exception.though few of its details are important to this litigation and those that are we describe later in our analysis,we here provide a brief overview of the statute background and objectives.
as the supreme court explained in mcconnell fec,d,which upheld bcra core provisions against constitutional challenge,bcra is the most recent federal enactment designed to purge national politics of what was conceived to be the pernicious influence of big money campaign contributions.id.at.quoting united states auto.workers,d.even before bcra,federal campaign finance laws,including the federal election campaign act of feca,stat,and amendments to that statute,restricted campaign contributions,defined as any gift,subscription,loan,advance,or deposit of money or anything of value made for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office.a i.individuals could contribute to federal candidates and their campaigns only within strict dollar limits,a,and corporations and labor unions could not contribute at all though they could sponsor special political funds known as political action committees or pacs,id.a,b c.see mcconnell,at.feca also restricted expenditures,any purchase,payment,distribution,loan,advance,deposit,or gift of money or anything of value,made for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office,a i.see mcconnell,at.
although in buckley valeo,d per curiam,the supreme court upheld feca contribution limitations as well as various reporting and disclosure requirements,the court invalidated expenditure limits for individual donors,candidates,and campaigns.see id.at.though unchallenged in buckley,feca also codified a ban on spending by corporations and unions.see mcconnell,at.fec.citizens for life,d.in addition,invoking constitutional avoidance,the buckley court construed the term expenditure to cover communications only where they advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office,and do so using express terms such as vote for,elect,support,cast your ballot for,smith for congress,vote against,defeat,reject.at.
in the political world,several terms of art emerged to describe the boundaries of this we shall use throughout this opinion.most important,contributions subject to federal source,amount,and disclosure requirements are called hard money or federal money.see mcconnell,at.funds outside feca sphere are called nonfederal or soft.see id.at.due to its reliance on specific phrases like vote for and vote against,the express advocacy standard became known as the magic words test.see id.at.
because feca defined both contribution and expenditure in terms of the purpose of influencing any election for federal office,see a,a emphasis added,donations aimed at state and local elections were unregulated,soft.thus,as mcconnell explains,questions arose concerning the treatment of contributions intended to influence both federal and state elections.at.charged with administering federal campaign finance laws,the federal election commission fec took a permissive view.although a literal reading of feca definition of contribution would have required funding such activities with hard money,the fec ruled that political parties could fund drives and generic party part with soft money.id.parties had to allocate such costs between hard and soft accounts,but rules in place after allowed national parties to fund as much as of their activities with soft money.id.at.even more generous,rules for state and local party organizations allowed allocation based on the ratio of federal to nonfederal offices on a given ballot,which in practice meant that they could expend a substantially greater proportion of soft money than national parties to fund activities.id.
over time,political parties took increasing advantage of these soft money opportunities.although the two major parties spent only million in soft money in the election cycle,by that figure had risen to of their total spending.id.at.because this soft money fell outside feca contribution limitations,parties could raise it in massive dollops from single contributors,including corporations and unions.see id.at.though federal candidates often played a key role in raising these funds,the parties shifted much of their soft money million in to the state level,where the fec more generous allocation rules applied,and where certain disclosure regulations applicable to national parties did not.see id.at.mcconnell fec,d,per curiam decision of district court.
just as soft money spending was exploding,a related phenomenon,sham issue ads,also developed.the term issue ad derives from buckley magic words construction of feca,the idea being that express advocacy relates to candidates whereas advocacy relates to issues.see mcconnell,at.however neat in theory,this distinction proved meaningless in the sham.see id.at.free to mention candidates by name and even discuss their views and voting records,those financing advocacy could generate ads functionally identical to campaign ads,notwithstanding the absence of magic words.see id.at.little difference existed,for example,between an ad that urged viewers to vote against jane doe and one that condemned jane doe record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to call jane doe and tell her what you think,id.at,a ruse employed in many ostensibly ads,see mcconnell,d at henderson,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.indeed,the record in the mcconnell litigation showed that even when permitted to employ express advocacy,advertisers typically used more indirect language.see mcconnell,at.
beginning in about,corporations and barred from direct contributions and expenditures,see a,but permitted to finance advocacy under the magic words construal of expenditure,see.citizens for life,at.spending large sums on such issue advertising.see mcconnell,at.mcconnell,d at.apparently negligible before that point,such spending climbed to hundreds of millions of dollars by.mcconnell,at.mcconnell,d at.the fec,compounding the problem,construed expenditure to mean magic words for political parties,too,thus freeing them to spend their soft money war chests on still more sham issue advertising.mcconnell,at.mcconnell,d at.
surveying the landscape in,a senate investigative committee concluded that the campaign finance system had suffered a meltdown.see mcconnell,at.quoting,vol,at.four years later,enacting reforms proposed by that committee,congress passed bcra.see id.at.among other changes,the new law barred federal candidates and national parties from fundraising,restricted activities to which state and local parties could devote nonfederal funds,and replaced the magic words standard for issue ads with a more robust concept termed electioneering communication.at the same time,compensating to some degree for these new restrictions,the statute raised hard money contribution limits.various plaintiffs challenged bcra constitutionality,but the supreme court largely rejected their claims in mcconnell.see at.
now we confront a lawsuit cutting the opposite not that bcra is too tough,but that fec implementing regulations are too lax.plaintiffs,appellees herein,are christopher shays and martin meehan,members of congress from connecticut and massachusetts,respectively,who were bcra principal sponsors in the house of representatives.the senate sponsors john mccain and russell feingold,joining the suit as amici,support this challenge.claiming standing not based on their sponsorship of the legislation,but rather as candidates waging reelection contests governed by bcra,shays and meehan challenged numerous fec interpretive rules in the district court for the district of columbia.they argued that by construing bcra prohibitions too narrowly,these rules effectively permit conduct that bcra bans,an effect that arises because the statute gives a defense against any sanction to any person relying in good faith on fec regulations.e.in an exceptionally thorough opinion ruling on for summary judgment,the district court invalidated and remanded some fifteen rules,while upholding a few more.see shays fec,d.despite a request from the fec,the court declined to stay its remand pending appeal.see shays fec,d.
the fec now appeals the district court summary judgment decision with respect to five rules standards for coordinated communication definitions of the terms solicit and direct the interpretation of electioneering communication allocation rules for state party employee salaries and a de minimis exemption from allocation rules governing certain contributions,known as levin funds,to state and local parties.following a preliminary discussion of our jurisdiction,we address each rule in turn.
as a threshold matter,the fec challenges our jurisdiction,asserting both that shays and meehan lack standing and that their claims are unripe.with respect to standing,the district court held that because the regulations shape the environment in which plaintiffs must operate as officeholders and candidates,shays and meehan could bring suit challenging those rules.see d at.as to ripeness,the court explained that despite the timing of shays and meehan suit,the purely legal nature of the issues removed any constitutional or prudential impediment to immediate consideration of their claims.see id.at.reviewing de novo,see,wrestling coaches ass dep t of,cert.denied,d fed.express air line pilots ass n,we agree with both conclusions.
derived from the constitution requirement for federal court jurisdiction,article iii standing requires plaintiffs to establish,as an irreducible constitutional minimum,that they face injury in fact caused by the challenged conduct and redressable through relief sought from the court.lujan defenders of wildlife,d see also friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.the first element,injury in fact,requires an invasion of a concrete and particularized legally protected interest.see mcconnell,at.harm must be actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the second element,causation,demands a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.id.internal quotation marks,alterations,and ellipses omitted.finally,redressability requires that it be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in addition to these constitutional requirements,parties claiming standing under the apa must show that their claims fall arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute in question.credit union admin.first bank trust,d internal quotation marks omitted see also amgen,smith.
we begin with the these requirements.never especially demanding,amgen,at internal quotation marks omitted,the zone of interests standard easily encompasses shays and meehan claims,considering that,as officeholders and candidates for office,they are among those who benefit from bcra restrictions on practices congress believed to be corrupting.of course,they are also among the targets of regulation,as the fec points out,see reply br.at,but that poses no obstacle.indeed,the statute regulation of candidates is part of the reason why candidates like shays and meehan possess apa standing,for who suffers more directly when political rivals get elected using illegal financing pdk,dea,deeming the zone of interests test satisfied where agency orders,by regulating petitioner supplier,necessarily regulate d petitioner.indeed,the fec can hardly maintain otherwise,for in arguing that this facial challenge is unripe,the commission urges shays and meehan to await specific abuses and then challenge them through feca and bcra unusual judicial review provision,which permits aggrieved parties to challenge the fec decision not to enforce,see chamber of commerce of the fec,discussing a an option that would make no sense if enforcement of these statutes could protect the two congressmen interests.accordingly,like the district court,we consider it that plaintiffs meet the zone of interests test.d at.
turning to the constitutional analysis,shays and meehan argue that because bcra thus protects them from prohibited campaign practices,the challenged rules,which they argue permit those very practices,cause them injury redressable through judicial review.recall that feca precludes any sanction as to any person who relies in good faith on fec rules,n otwithstanding any other provision of law.e see also supra at.given this defense,shays and meehan opponents may undertake any conduct permitted by the challenged regulations without fear of penalty,even if that conduct violates campaign statutes.thus,as shays and meehan see it,the fec rules infringe their interest in injury the congressmen believe supports standing.disagreeing,and relying chiefly on the supreme court denial of standing as to two sets of constitutional claimants in mcconnell,the fec disputes shays and meehan theory with respect to both injury in fact and causation.specifically,the commission argues that because shays and meehan challenge what the rules permit rather than what they constrain and because shays and meehan affidavits demonstrate no specific use of the rules by their political opponents,the two congressmen can not show injury.in addition,the commission asserts that because the rules grant shays and meehan the same legal options as their opponents,any disadvantage they suffer stems not from those rules,but from their own choice not to exploit them.we address these arguments in turn,starting with injury in fact and proceeding from there to causation.
since parties invoking jurisdiction at summary judgment may not rest on mere allegations,but must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts demonstrating standing,lujan,at.quoting.e,shays and meehan submitted affidavits in the district court supporting their standing claim.they assert that,as members of congress and candidates for reelection,they are not only subject to regulation under feca,bcra,and the commission implementing rules,but also directly affected by opportunities those statutes and regulations create for their potential election opponents and contributors to and supporters of their opponents.shays decl.meehan decl.thus,they aver that i f any of the campaign finance reforms embodied in bcra is subverted,eroded,or circumvented by the commission implementing regulations,i will be forced once again to raise money,campaign,and attempt to discharge my important public responsibilities in a system that is widely perceived to be,and i believe in many respects will be,significantly corrupted by the influence of money.shays decl.meehan decl.particularizing this claim of injury,the congressmen then identify consequences for their own campaigns flowing from fec subversion of each key category of bcra restrictions.for example,as to bcra provisions,shays and meehan state,i f fec regulations do not faithfully implement the ban,i face the strong risk that unregulated soft money contributions will again be used in an attempt to influence federal elections in which i am a candidate.shays decl.meehan decl.as to the sham issue ad provisions,they assert,i f those regulations do not faithfully implement bcra,i will be open to attack,during critical time periods just before the primary and general elections,in broadcast advertising campaigns mounted by groups seeking to evade the contribution limits,source prohibitions,and disclosure requirements imposed by congress.shays decl.meehan decl.
through these and other like assertions,shays and meehan aver that under fec regulations permitting what bcra prohibits,they suffer injury to their interest,protected by that statute,in seeking reelection through contests untainted by practices.they assert,in other words,that under such illegal rules,they are open to attack by advertising,face the strong risk that opponents will use improper soft money spending against them,and generally must raise money,campaign,and attempt to discharge their important public responsibilities in an environment rife with practices congress has proscribed.
in analogous cases,courts have routinely recognized this type of,illegal structuring of a competitive sufficient to support article iii standing.in the administrative context,for example,we have held that when agencies adopt procedures inconsistent with statutory guarantees,parties who appear regularly before the agency suffer injury to a legally protected interest in fair decisionmaking.electric power supply ass ferc,epsa quoting prof l air traffic controllers org.flra,patco upholding repeat litigant standing to challenge allegedly unlawful agency rules on ex parte communication see also lujan,at nn.indicating that plaintiffs possess standing to enforce a procedural requirement the disregard of which could impair a separate concrete interest of theirs and giving as an example the procedural requirement for an environmental impact statement before a federal facility is constructed next door to them.audubon soc y bentsen,en banc holding that litigants may establish injury in fact by show ing that the government act performed without the procedure in question will cause a distinct risk to a particularized interest of the plaintiff.by the same logic,shays and meehan,as regular candidates for reelection,suffer injury to a statutorily protected interest if under fec rules they must compete for office in contests tainted by practices.true,the forum here is an election,not agency rulemaking or adjudication,but much as administrative procedures determine how interested regulated parties may go about persuading agencies,so do the challenged fec campaign finance rules structure candidates regulated opportunities to persuade the electorate.thus,given that regulated litigants suffer legal injury when agencies set the rules of the game in violation of statutory directives,the same is true here insofar as the fec has exposed these regulated candidates to campaign practices.
likewise indicating that illegal structuring of a competitive environment injures those who are regulated in that environment,longstanding precedent establishes that when a statute reflect s a legislative purpose to protect a competitive interest,an injured competitor has standing to require compliance with that provision.hardin.utils,d.accordingly,when an agency authorizes certain brokerage services by regulated banks,rival securities dealers may challenge that decision based on their interest in limiting market competition.see clarke secs.indus.ass n,d upholding standing based on zone of interests test without specifically addressing article iii requirements see also credit union,at.stating that competitors of financial institutions have standing to challenge agency action relaxing statutory restrictions on the activities of those institutions ass of data processing serv,camp,d indicating t here can be no doubt as to injury in fact where an agency authorized competition in a market served by petitioner.and when the government grants an application to produce controlled substances,a current manufacturer of the same drugs may challenge that action because increased competition represents a cognizable article iii injury.md,dea,quoting liquid carbonic indus.ferc.
to be sure,in this case,the challenged rules create neither more nor different rival electoral analogue to participants in a market.nor,as the fec points out,do shays and meehan rivals enjoy special benefits unavailable to the two congressmen,reply br.at.yet shays and meehan do face intensified competition.that is,under fec rules permitting what bcra prohibits,the two congressmen must anticipate and respond to a broader range of competitive tactics than federal law would otherwise allow.for example,under one challenged regulation described in detail below,rival candidates may have supporters finance issue ads more than days before the election according to shays and meehan,bcra restricts such spending.see infra at discussing.likewise,rival state parties may spend soft money to pay employees devoting a quarter of their time to defeating shays and meehan the congressmen believe bcra requires hard money for such salaries.see infra at discussing c,d,c.
given that accounting for additional rivals constitutes injury in fact,see,md,at,shays and meehan need to account for additional thus,as the dissent concedes,additional campaign activity,see op.at henderson,dissenting likewise supports article iii standing.as with promulgation of illegal administrative procedures,both these competitors and additional alter the environment in which rival parties defend their concrete interests,their interest in persuading regulators,retaining customers,or winning reelection.considering that competitors may challenge one such form of of would be odd if they could challenge more elementary distortions that alter the competitive environment overall rules.bennett spear,d holding that parties who have competing economic and other interests in a certain water supply could challenge agency action reducing that supply in the aggregate.to draw an example from the case law,if drug producers may challenge permits for other manufacturers,see md,at squibb shalala,upholding drug manufacturer standing to challenge regulations governing approval of competing generic drugs,could they also challenge rules,say,allowing all producers to forgo mandated warnings,or to advertise in ways congress has forbidden and if securities dealers may challenge rules allowing banks to broker stocks,see clarke,at.inv.inst.camp,d upholding investment companies standing to challenge regulations authorizing banks to operate mutual funds,could they likewise dispute regulations allowing all or stay open until ten though a statute mandates closure by five no less than when agencies unleash illegal competitors or implement illegal procedures,such changes undermine statutorily protected expectations,requiring competitors to account for adverse activity prohibited by law.because shays and meehan have asserted equivalent intensified by thus face an equivalent need to adjust their campaign strategy,they too suffer harm to their legally protected interests.
indeed,our own case law,though avoiding resolving the issue definitively,supports applying competitor standing to politics as well as business.in gottlieb fec,although rejecting a pac standing to challenge use of public matching funds by a candidate it opposed,we explained,ameripac can not claim standing as a competitor because it was never in a position to receive matching funds itself.only another candidate could make such a claim.id.at emphasis added see also common cause fec,per curiam observing that a who had not appealed may be a political competitor of political parties.moreover,we stated in chamber of commerce fec,albeit in dicta,that if the fec declined to enforce certain rules affecting the plaintiff,a political competitor could challenge the commission dismissal of its complaint under feca judicial review provision,a.see at emphasis added.given that shays and the gottlieb do face genuine rivalry from candidates and parties in a position,gottlieb,at,to exploit loopholes,our cases thus support analogizing their situation to business rivalry,a context where,as explained above,ample precedent supports standing,see,clarke,at.inv,at.md,at squibb,at.
thus,at least two lines of precedent procedural rights and competitor standing cases embody a principle that supports shays and meehan standing that when regulations illegally structure a competitive an agency proceeding,a market,or a reelection defending concrete interests,retention of elected office in that environment suffer legal harm under article iii.as the district court recognized,opponents campaign finance options necessarily affect the way these politicians will run their campaigns,such that shays and meehan are at the very least harmed by having to anticipate other actors taking advantage of the regulations to engage in activities that otherwise would be barred.d at see also vote choice,distefano,cir holding that where state law required candidates to choose between public and private financing,that choice impact on the strategy and conduct of an political campaign constitutes an injury of a kind sufficient to confer standing.based on our case law and the supreme court,this harm is sufficient for article iii standing.
resisting this conclusion,the fec makes two arguments,both embraced by the dissent and both flawed.first,the commission points out that campaign finance restrictions benefit the general public as well as candidates.yet the same is true of other statutes that structure rivals playing routinely held to support such rivals standing.consider although congress may well have designed,lujan,at,environmental assessment requirements to advance a general public interest in environmental protection,lujan makes clear that one living adjacent to the site for proposed construction of a federally licensed dam has standing to challenge the licensing agency failure to prepare an environmental impact statement when following that procedure could prevent concrete injury,the flooding of plaintiff home,see id.at.likewise,although statutory restrictions on brokerage services and drug manufacturing serve one hopes to protect the public rather than simply to create monopolistic fiefs,businesses benefiting from such barriers to entry possess standing to enforce them.see clarke,at.md,at.by the same token,because practices may harm shays and meehan electoral prospects,and given that shays and meehan actively seek reelection in contests governed by the challenged far cry from living at the other end of the country from a challenged dam,op.at henderson,dissenting quoting lujan,at.the two congressmen may demand adherence to bcra requirements,notwithstanding that statute intended public benefits such as preventing corruption and supporting informed voting.warth seldin,d the art.iii judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury to the complaining party,even though the court judgment may benefit others collaterally.
the fec second argument is that mcconnell forecloses shays and meehan standing.it is true that in mcconnell the supreme court dismissed plaintiffs asserting a supposed competitive injury specifically,fundraising disadvantage due to bcra elevated hard money caps.at.in citing this dismissal,however,the fec removes mcconnell holding entirely from its context.
in mcconnell,the adams plaintiffs a group of voters,voter organizations,and candidates asserting constitutional challenges to bcra elevation of hard money two standing theories.first,they argued that the increases in hard money limits enacted by bcra deprive them of an equal ability to participate in the election process based on their economic status.id.at.disagreeing,the court explained that because p olitical free trade does not necessarily require that all who participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources,the asserted injury implicated no legally cognizable right and thus failed to show invasion of any legally protected interest,as required for standing.id.quoting.citizens for life,at.second,the adams plaintiffs asserted that because the federal candidates in their group would refuse on principle to accept large contributions,those candidates suffered fundraising disadvantage,making it more difficult for them to compete in elections.id.at.quoting complaint.rejecting this theory,too,the court explained their alleged inability to compete stems not from the operation of the elevated caps,but from their own personal wish not to solicit or accept large contributions,their personal choice.accordingly,the adams plaintiffs fail here to allege an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to bcra.id.
as the district court recognized,mcconnell analysis is distinguishable from this case because here,unlike in mcconnell where plaintiffs had no right to equal funding,a,protects the interest in fair reelection contests that shays and meehan assert.as the supreme court has long recognized,congress may enact statutes creating legal rights,the invasion of which creates standing,even though no injury would exist without the statute.linda richard,d see also lujan,at.reaffirming this principle.here,by banning certain campaign practices,congress has created such rights.and because shays and meehan fall within the zone of interests protected by bcra,see supra at,the congressmen hold a legally cognizable right,mcconnell,at,to enforce the statute prohibitions under the apa.see clarke,at,d the zone of interest test is a guide for deciding whether a particular plaintiff should be heard to complain of a particular agency decision.mudd white,describing the zone of interests test as assessing whether the plaintiff asserted interest is among the group of claims that is envisioned by the relevant statute.
obviously distinguishing the supreme court first holding on the adams plaintiffs lack of legally protected interest,this difference also places shays and meehan suit outside mcconnell competitive injury analysis.true,much as the adams plaintiffs could choose to accept hard money up to bcra maximum,shays and meehan could perhaps reduce or even neutralize their opponents advantages by exploiting illegal fec safe harbors themselves.to repeat examples given above,they too could have supporters finance issue ads or commit state party employees to federal races.but because being put to the choice of either violating bcra or suffering disadvantage in their campaigns is itself a predicament the statute spares them,having to make that choice constitutes article iii injury.vote choice,at upholding standing in a candidate constitutional challenge to state campaign finance laws requiring her to choose either to shun or to embrace public financing.indeed,in a constitutional system based on the rule of law,it would be ironic,to say the least,if article iii barred the courthouse doors to citizens like shays and meehan who,because of unlawful government action,may protect their interest in election to congress only by violating that lawmaking body own dictates.given that bcra prohibitions would apply absent the challenged safe harbors,shays and meehan asserted to defend their office in illegally constituted reelection not a matter of their personal choice,as it was in mcconnell,at.rather,it stems from the operation,of regulations permitting what bcra bans.thus,the dissent wrongly views the claimed predicaments in mcconnell and in this case as identical there no right existed here one does.see op.at henderson,dissenting.
mcconnell itself emphasizes the connection between its two adams holdings lack of legal harm and lack of competitive injury.as the court put it,the adams plaintiffs twin standing theories shared the same premise that bcra increased limits allow opponents to raise more money,and,consequently,the ability to compete or participate in the electoral process is diminished.id.having already rejected the premise cognizable funding inequity,the court naturally rejected the deduction wrongful disadvantage posed by plaintiffs second theory.instead,the court attributed the asserted injury to plaintiffs own if funding inequity was cognizable,what besides choice could explain the candidates disadvantage here,in contrast,due to bcra and the apa,shays and meehan asserted interest in getting elected through legally financed campaigns is fully cognizable.accordingly,their claimed injury,having to seek reelection in illegally structured contests and thus needing either to violate bcra or to suffer disadvantage,may support article iii standing.
furthermore,and clinching the point,mcconnell gives no indication of modifying,much less overruling,cases supporting shays and meehan like lujan,clarke,and hardin not to mention this court decisions in epsa,maryland pharmaceutical,and gottlieb,among others.nor did the court suggest that campaign finance laws require unique standing rules quite the opposite,mcconnell applies an entirely conventional standing analysis.see id.at.applying article iii standing test after observing that o n many occasions,we have reiterated the three requirements that constitute the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing internal quotation marks omitted.given the analogous precedent supporting standing,and considering that mcconnell is distinguishable in any event,shays and meehan have presented a valid theory of injury in fact.
this same involving illegally structured assures us that notwithstanding shays and meehan failure to show specific adverse use of challenged safe harbors,the congressmen asserted injury is sufficiently concrete and particularized,as well as actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,laidlaw,at.although the fec insists that the congressmen must demonstrate that specific rivals have exploited each challenged rule,our cases hold that when adverse use of illegally granted opportunities appears inevitable,affected parties may challenge the government authorization of those opportunities without waiting for specific competitors to seize them.see.energy power auth.ferc,noting that we have not required litigants to wait until increased competition actually occurs associated gas distribs.ferc,p etitioners sufficiently establish their constitutional standing by showing that the challenged action authorizes allegedly illegal transactions that have the clear and immediate potential to compete with petitioners own sales.
given what mcconnell calls the hard lesson of circumvention evident in the entire history of campaign finance regulation,at,it is indisputable here that regulated parties will seize opportunities created by the challenged rules and thus taint contests through which shays and meehan seek reelection.to give two simple examples,one of the challenged regulations permits state and local parties to finance certain salaries with soft money another allows such parties to use unregulated funds for generic party advertising costing less than.it seems obvious that party organizations fighting shays and meehan reelection will employ these options,rather than complying unnecessarily with hard money strictures.united transp.union icc,observing that courts routinely credit assertions founded on basic economic logic in upholding standing.accordingly,fec safe harbors will almost surely cause shays and meehan harm,squibb,at quoting el paso natural gas ferc,and the congressmen must therefore account for use of those safe harbors in their own campaign strategy,vote choice,at noting that because the coerced choice between public and private financing colored a candidate campaign strategy from the outset,the impact of that choice on the strategy and conduct of the candidate political campaign supported standing internal quotation marks omitted.hence,there is no need to wait for injury from specific transactions to claim standing.squibb,at quoting el paso natural gas,at.
cases in the administrative context point to the same conclusion.although we have described administrative litigants interest in fair decisionmaking,epsa,at quoting patco,at analogous to shays and meehan interest in fair reelection substantive,see ctr.for law educ.dep t of,shays and meehan right to electoral contests is also procedural insofar as campaign finance rules establish procedures through which candidates seek reelection.when parties claim standing based on violations of a procedural right,they can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.lujan,at.see also.outdoor council forest,indicating that in procedural rights cases the necessary showing supporting the constitutional minimal of,causation,and redressability is reduced.specifically,so long as the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of the plaintiff that is the ultimate basis of his standing,lujan,at,the party invoking jurisdiction may establish injury in fact by show ing that the government act performed without the procedure in question will cause a distinct risk to a particularized interest of that party.audubon,at.thus,to repeat lujan example mentioned earlier,parties living alongside a proposed dam may challenge errors in the construction licensing procedure,even though they can not establish with any certainty that adherence to the procedure will cause the license to be withheld or altered.lujan,at.and as we held in epsa,a repeat litigant may challenge rules on ex parte communications between the federal energy regulatory commission and certain outside parties,even before ferc ever applies them.see at.insofar as the litigant is seeking to enforce procedural requirements designed to protect its concrete interest in the outcome of hearings to which it is a party,its standing,we explained,is not defeated by the fact that it can not show,with any certainty,that its or its members financial interests will be damaged by the operation of the exemption.id.
by the same token,shays and meehan may challenge fec subversion of bcra guarantees without establish ing with any certainty,lujan,at,that the challenged rules will disadvantage their reelection campaigns.indeed,given the multiplicity of factors bearing on elections and the extreme political sensitivity of judgments about what caused particular candidates to win,requiring candidates to establish that but for certain campaign finance rules they could have won an election seems no more reasonable than requiring plaintiffs to demonstrate that,but for the procedural defect,the final outcome of the rulemaking process would have been different precisely the showing that administrative cases do not require.see ctr.for law,at citing lujan,at.because bcra establishes campaign procedures designed to protect the congressmen threatened concrete interest,lujan,at,in winning reelection,shays and meehan possess standing to insist on those procedures based on the distinct risk.audubon,at,documented in their affidavits,that political rivals will exploit the challenged rules to their disadvantage.see ctr.for law,at indicating that a federal agency arguably ultra vires publications of regulations purporting to authorize ex parte communications in violation of the sunshine act violates substantive rights created under the act,thus conferring standing on affected litigants challenging those rules discussing epsa,at.
again,the fec,like the dissent,cites mcconnell as contrary authority,but again the analogy falls short.dismissing different parties from those mentioned earlier mcconnell plaintiffs as opposed to adams plaintiffs,the mcconnell court found no standing as to plaintiffs challenging broadcast restrictions based on one senator stated desire to violate them during his next reelection over four years away.see mcconnell,at.because senator mcconnell current term does not expire until,the court observed,the earliest day he could be affected by the challenged provision is days before the republican primary election in.this alleged injury in fact is too remote temporally to satisfy article iii standing.id.at.contrary to the dissent suggestion that mcconnell broadly requires identification of some specific injury arising from the regulations,op.at henderson,dissenting,the court thus relied entirely on lack of immediacy in finding the mcconnell plaintiffs injury insufficient for standing.in other words,far from foreclosing standing for regulated parties like shays and meehan,the mcconnell court concluded that because any relevant application of the challenged rules would occur far in the future,the mcconnell plaintiffs were not in fact subject to regulation at all,id.at.as house members,shays and meehan face reelection every two indeed underwent reelection during the pendency of this appeal.accordingly,no comparable imminence problem exists here.following analogous cases such as lujan,epsa,and louisiana untouched by therefore conclude that shays and meehan suffer injury in fact insofar as fec rules permit practices,thereby depriving the congressmen of their right to reelection contests conducted in accordance with that statute.
as to causation,the two congressmen argue that their asserted of fair reelection contests guaranteed by fairly traceable to the fec rules because absent those rules bcra prohibitions would prevent their opponents from tainting their electoral fights or at least impose a sanction for doing so,e see also supra at.the fec sees the issue quite differently.since the challenged rules merely permit conduct by others rather than restrict conduct shays and meehan would themselves undertake,the commission insists its rules have caused the congressmen no harm.appellant br.at.
abundant precedent contradicts the fec view.in fact,the causation requirement for constitutional standing is met when a plaintiff demonstrates that the challenged agency action authorizes the conduct that allegedly caused the plaintiff injuries,if that conduct would allegedly be illegal otherwise.animal legal def.fund,glickman,en banc upholding standing in a facial challenge to regulations allegedly authorizing statutorily proscribed inhumane treatment of animals citing simon.welfare rts,d.thus,for example,in japan whaling association american cetacean society,d,scientists and possessed standing even though the agency action they to certify japan as a bad apple under international whaling restraints on rather than imposing them on.see id.at.likewise,to repeat examples given above,ferc litigants may challenge administrative procedures that could benefit rivals,see epsa,at,and economic competitors may challenge decisions allowing additional entrants into their markets,see,credit union,at.if it makes no difference in such cases that actual injury depends on action by spearing whales,competing economically,or trading secret missives with should it matter here that the challenged rules unchain shays and meehan opponents,rather than chaining the two congressmen.
attempting to show otherwise,the fec once again cites mcconnell dismissal of the adams plaintiffs.it insists that based on the supreme court holding,the only cause of shays and meehan asserted injury is the congressmen own choice not to fight fire with fire by exploiting fec safe harbors themselves.this causation theory fails for the same reason the fec injury argument fails.whereas in mcconnell the asserted injury stemmed from no law operation,at,shays and meehan of reelection only insofar as fec safe harbors permit what bcra forbids.consequently,regardless of how shays and meehan choose to negotiate the illegally structured environment in which the fec has placed them,shays and meehan injury is fairly traceable,laidlaw,at,to the fec alleged violation of congressional commands.
again,substantial precedent reassures us of this mcconnell never mentions,much less questions.at bottom,though dealing with the same as that case,shays and meehan suit is an entirely conventional administrative law claim,a facial challenge to allegedly invalid regulations affecting the congressmen interests.viewed in such terms,shays and meehan causation theory is unremarkable.as noted earlier,we held in aldf,based in part on supreme court precedent,that a plaintiff satisfies the causation prong of constitutional standing by establishing that the challenged agency rule permitted the activity that allegedly injured her,when that activity would allegedly have been illegal otherwise.at.japan whaling rests on the same view.although there the law was a treaty rather than a campaign finance statute,the causal theory was identical by tolerating what the law condemned,the government caused plaintiffs injury.see japan whaling,at.likewise,in competition cases,the supreme court has upheld challenges to rules allowing competition allegedly prohibited by,a claim that parallels shays and meehan.see,credit union,at.data processing,at.
although the fec insists this case falls outside the conventional rule because shays and meehan possess the same legal options as their rivals and thus could potentially benefit from the challenged rules,our case law shows otherwise.ordinarily,of course,mimicking injurious conduct does nothing to interrupt causation the in japan whaling could hardly protect their pastime by joining the hunt.and while here use of challenged rules could perhaps mitigate any harm to shays and meehan electoral prospects,the same was true in epsa,where the disputed regulations,which allowed ex parte communication with certain third parties called market monitors,could well have helped,rather than hurt,the petitioner.there,far from suggesting that potential benefit foreclosed standing,we held that petitioner satisfied article iii because it routinely appear ed before ferc in contested hearings in which market monitors have an interest,at condition that created opportunity for benefit as well as detriment.similarly,in lujan dam example,affected parties could insist on statutorily required procedures even though adherence to those procedures might well hasten,not prevent,the dam construction.see at nn.as in these cases,shays and meehan injury entails deprivation of a statutory right to fair decisionmaking,epsa,at quoting patco,at.accordingly,fec rules structuring reelection contests in violation of that right cause harm regardless of whether those rules ultimately hurt or help the congressmen reelection prospects.
to illustrate the counterintuitive character of the fec position,we think it worth noting that were the commission causation argument correct,shays and meehan would never have standing to challenge the rules.even if an opponent made express use of illegal safe harbors,even if that use demonstrably influenced voters,and indeed even if shays and meehan responded by seeking administrative enforcement and then challenging the fec dismissal of their review procedure the commission urges the congressmen to follow in its ripeness argument,see infra at the congressmen would nevertheless lack standing.as the fec sees it,even then,shays and meehan own scruples,not allegedly illegal fec rules,would have caused their injury.although an inescapable result of any standing doctrine application is that at least some disputes will not receive judicial review.audubon,at,that result would be surprising here given that shays and meehan,as directly regulated parties,are the most natural challengers for these rules,and agency regulations are ordinarily subject to review.bowen.acad.of family physicians,d noting the strong presumption that congress intends judicial review of administrative action united states nourse,pet.marshall,it would excite some surprise if,in a government of laws and of principle,a ministerial officer might,at his discretion,issue this powerful process,leaving to that debtor no remedy,no appeal to the laws of his country.
accordingly,finding mcconnell distinguishable,and following the long line of cases holding that affected parties may challenge regulations allowing what a statute prohibits,see,credit union,at.data processing,at.japan whaling,at.aldf,at,we conclude that shays and meehan have shown causation,as well as injury in fact.
this leaves only redressability.the fec does dispute this element,nor could it,for w here an agency rule causes the injury,as here,the redressability requirement may be satisfied by vacating the challenged rule.ctr.for energy econ.dev.epa,internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.thus,shays and meehan have satisfied all three requirements of constitutional standing.f orced,as they put it,to seek reelection in illegally structured contests,the congressmen seek no mere advisory opinion the evil article iii averts,see flast cohen,d.rather,because invalidation of fec safe harbors permitting what bcra bans would vindicate shays and meehan right to elections,the two congressmen possess such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult questions,baker carr,d.having reached this conclusion,we need not consider shays and meehan fallback argument that the challenged rules effects on disclosure requirements give them informational standing.
in addition to challenging standing,the fec argues that shays and meehan suit is unripe.a further requirement of justiciability,albeit one drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction,ripeness requires us to evaluate the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.park hospitality ass dep t of interior,d quoting reno catholic soc,d.under our case law,the primary focus of the ripeness doctrine is to balance the petitioners interest in prompt consideration of allegedly unlawful agency action against the agency interest in crystallizing its policy before that policy is subject to review and the court interest in avoiding unnecessary adjudication and in deciding issues in a concrete setting.at t fcc,internal quotation marks omitted.
here,as to fitness,because this case is purely one of statutory interpretation,whitman am.trucking ass ns,d,the issues are purely legal and thus presumptively suitable to judicial review,at t,at internal quotation marks omitted.in fact,in this case,no crystalliz ation of the disputed policies will ever occur,for as shays and meehan point out,conduct protected by the challenged safe harbors will never be subject to enforcement proceedings.as noted earlier,reliance on fec regulations affords a defense against fec sanction,see e.for that very reason,moreover,the regulations also cause hardship.by removing certain conduct from any risk of enforcement,the challenged safe harbors establish legal rights to engage in that conduct,thus creat ing adverse effects of a strictly legal kind.see ohio forestry ass sierra club,d.
making a related point,the fec also suggests that because feca permits judicial review to determine whether even decisions are contrary to law,see a supra at,shays and meehan can not show that no other adequate remedy in a court exists,as required for apa jurisdiction,see generally wrestling coaches ass n,at.we think this claim even weaker.to begin with,although we have identified impermissible interpretation of the act as an element of the contrary to law test,we did so in a case reviewing an advisory opinion,not an fec regulation.see orloski fec.were a regulation applicable,given that reliance on that regulation would afford a defense to any sanction,see e,the court might well uphold fec without ever reaching the regulation validity.chamber of commerce,at identifying the risk of enforcement under section a as a basis for standing though going on to invalidate the rule that would thus be enforced.moreover,because of that defense,the particular conduct at issue could never be sanctioned,though penalties might have been possible under valid rules.given these deficiencies,this alternative remedy hardly appears adequate,and so poses no barrier to shays and meehan facial challenge here.
on the merits,we undertake our analysis pursuant to two familiar standards of review chevron and the administrative procedure act.as both sides agree,because the regulations at issue interpret statutes the fec administers,we review them under the analysis set forth in chevron,natural resources defense council,d,asking first whether congress has spoken directly to the precise question at issue,and second,if it has not,whether the agency interpretation is reasonable.see fec,quoting chevron,at.reviewing fec regulations.at the same time,because the regulations reflect final agency action under the apa,we ask whether they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
applying these standards here,we affirm the district court invalidation of all five rules at issue in this appeal.in reviewing each rule,we begin with chevron step one,asking whether the rule runs counter to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress,chevron,at.we conclude that two solicit direct and electioneering communication this threshold inquiry.as to the remaining coordinated communication standard,salary allocation provision,and de minimis affirm the district court invalidation on apa grounds without reaching chevron step two.as our cases explain,our inquiry at the second step of chevron,whether an ambiguous statute has been interpreted reasonably,overlaps with the arbitrary and capricious standard,chamber of commerce of the fec,citing ass of regulatory utility comm rs icc,for w hether a statute is unreasonably interpreted is close analytically to the issue whether an agency actions under a statute are unreasonable,instrument fcc,see also am.transp.icc,both questions require us to determine whether the commission,in effecting a reconciliation of competing statutory aims,has rationally considered the factors deemed relevant by the act.here,we need not decide whether these three rules represent altogether impermissible interpretations of feca and chevron step two inquiry,see bluewater network epa,indicating that at chevron step two we defer to the agency interpretation as long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute quoting chevron,at.because in any event the fec has given no rational justification for them,as required by the apa arbitrary and capricious standard,see motor vehicle mfrs.of the,state farm mut.auto.ins,d interpreting the apa to require that agencies articulate a satisfactory explanation for their action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made quoting burlington truck lines,united states,d.
coordinated communication 
feca has long restricted coordination of spending between official campaigns and outside groups.the reason for this is obvious.without a coordination rule,politicians could evade contribution limits and other restrictions by having donors finance campaign activity,paying for a tv ad or printing and distributing posters.to avoid such subterfuge,feca defines contribution to include any expenditure made in cooperation,consultation,or concert,with,or at the request or suggestion of,a candidate,a b i,and then defines expenditure as any purchase,payment,loan,or gift made for the purpose of influencing a federal election,id.a.thus,if someone makes a purchase or gift with the purpose of influencing an election and does so in cooperation with a candidate,feca counts that payment as a campaign contribution.at the same time,and as a further stopgap,feca coordination provision designates any financing of the dissemination,distribution,or republication of campaign materials as an expenditure,and thus as a contribution when coordinated.id.a b iii.
bcra made two important changes to these provisions.first,as part of its effort to reign in party fundraising,the statute added a coordination rule for parties comparable to the preexisting rule for candidates.see id.a b ii.second,and more important here,congress ordered the fec to rewrite its regulations interpreting these provisions with respect to coordinated communication.see bcra c,stat.
under regulations,the fec determined whether public communications such as radio and television ads were coordinated based largely on whether the candidate had engaged in substantial discussion or negotiation with an outsider,resulting in collaboration or agreement.see shays,d at quoting old regulation.absent that degree of cooperation,the communication was considered uncoordinated and thus would not count as a feca contribution.bcra instructed the commission to scrap this approach.the regulations on coordinated communications are repealed,congress declared.the federal election commission shall promulgate new regulations on coordinated communications paid for by persons other than candidates,authorized committees of candidates,and party committees.the regulations shall not require agreement or formal collaboration to establish coordination.bcra c,stat.at.apart from this negative command shall not require bcra merely listed several topics the rules shall address,providing no guidance as to how the fec should address them.see id.
acting pursuant to this directive,the fec adopted the regulation at issue here.under its new test,communications count as coordinated and thus as contributions if someone other than the candidate,party,or official campaign pays for them,the communication itself meets specified content standards,and the payer interaction with the satisfies specified conduct standards.under the content only component at issue made within days of a general election or primary and directed at the relevant electorate may qualify as coordinated if they refer to a political party or clearly identified candidate for federal office.id.c.before the mark,the rule covers only communications that either recycle official campaign materials or expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.see id.c.
according to shays and meehan,this limitation on the rule coverage outside the window offers politicians and their supporters an unreasonably generous safe harbor.several examples should help illustrate their concerns.under the new rules,more than days before an election or primary,a candidate may sit down with a supporter and say,why do you run some ads about my record on tax cuts the two may even sign a formal written agreement providing for such ads.yet so long as the supporter neither recycles campaign materials nor employs the magic words of express advocacy vote for,vote against,elect,and so ads wo qualify as contributions subject to feca.ads stating congressman x voted times to lower your taxes or tell candidate y your family ca pay the government more are just fine.and even within days of the election though shays and meehan appear not to challenge this aspect of the rule,supporters need only avoid communications that identify candidates or parties by name.ads regarding,say,economic effects of high taxes or tragic consequences of foreign wars are not,even if formally coordinated with the official campaign.
the district court held that nothing in bcra permits such exclusions.although the court rejected shays and meehan chevron one argument,explaining that because bcra ordered promulgation of new regulations while provid ing no express guidance on the matter of content restrictions,congress had not spoken directly to the issue,see d at,it held that the fec regulations undercut feca statutory purposes and thus were entitled to no chevron two deference.id.at.a communication that is coordinated with a candidate or political party,the district court wrote,has value to the political actor.to exclude certain types of communications regardless of whether or not they are coordinated would create an immense loophole that would facilitate the circumvention of the act contribution limits,thereby creating the potential for gross abuse.id.at quoting orloski,at.
we reach the same result,though for slightly different reasons.regarding chevron step one,we agree that congress has not spoken directly to the issue at hand.to be sure,it seems hard to imagine that representatives and senators voting for bcra would have expected regulations like these.although congress abrogated the fec old collaboration or agreement standard,the new rule permits significant categories of,advocacy more than days before an where formal collaboration or agreement occurs.and while bcra electioneering communication provisions mentioned earlier and discussed below,see infra at,disavow the express advocacy standard mcconnell describes as functionally meaningless,at.fec has resurrected that standard here,allowing unrestricted collaboration outside the days so long as the communication paymasters avoid magic words and redistribution.that said,in the bcra provision most clearly on directive calling for new studiously avoided prescribing any specific standard,save abrogation of the collaboration or agreement test.given this lack of guidance in the statute,we can not say that bcra clearly forecloses the fec approach.see george warren epa.
nor do we see clearly contrary intent,as do shays and meehan,in feca preexisting expenditure and contribution definitions.true,under the statute,coordinated expenditures shall be considered to be a contribution,so if a communication involves expenditure and is made in cooperation,consultation,or concert with,or at the request or suggestion of a candidate or provision two elements,see b i,ii then the fec lacks discretion to exclude that communication from its coordinated communication rule.yet to qualify as expenditure in the first place,spending must be undertaken for the purpose of influencing a federal election or else involve financing for redistribution of campaign materials.see a,a b iii.and as the fec points out,time,place,and content may be critical indicia of communicative purpose.while intent is obvious,for example,in statements urging voters to elect or defeat a specified candidate or party,the same may not be true of ads identifying a federal politician but focusing on pending proposed budget,for example,or government reform appearing three years before the next election.nor is such purpose necessarily evident in statements referring,say,to a connecticut senator but running only in san francisco media markets.
insofar as such statements may relate to political or legislative goals independent from any electoral like influencing legislators votes or increasing public can not conclude that congress unambiguously intended to count them as expenditures and thus as contributions when coordinated.to the contrary,giving appropriate chevron deference,we think the fec could construe the expenditure definition purposive language as leaving space for collaboration between politicians and outsiders on legislative and political issues involving only a weak nexus to any electoral campaign.moreover,we can hardly fault the fec effort to develop an objective,test that does not unduly compromise the act purposes,considering that we approved just such a test for contribution in orloski.at.accordingly,we reject shays and meehan argument that feca precludes standards under chevron step one.and for the same reasons,we disagree with the district court suggestion that any standard looking beyond collaboration to content would necessarily create an immense loophole,thus exceeding the range of permissible readings under chevron step two,d at.
in our view,the challenged regulation fatal defect is not that the fec drew distinctions based on content,time,and place,but rather that,contrary to the apa,the commission offered no persuasive justification for the provisions challenged by shays and meehan,the and the weak restraints applying outside of it.as noted earlier,mcconnell describes the express advocacy test,which before bcra distinguished advocacy subject to feca from unregulated issue ads,as functionally meaningless.at.not only can advertisers easily evade the line by eschewing use of magic words,but they would seldom choose to use such words even if permitted.id.in the election cycle,just of candidate advertisements used magic words in,that number was a mere.id.at.of course,express advocacy could hardly fail to count as expenditure statements like vote for clearly aim to influence elections.nor could the fec permit redistribution of campaign material,since the statute unambiguously designates that activity as expenditure for purposes of this provision.see b iii.yet the commission took the further step of deeming these two categories adequate by themselves to capture the universe of electorally oriented communication outside the window.that action requires some cogent explanation,not least because by employing a functionally meaningless standard outside that period,the fec has in effect allowed a coordinated communication for much of each election cycle.
we see nothing in the fec official explanation that satisfies apa standards.the commission source for the period was an unrelated bcra provision requiring hard money financing for state party voter registration drives within days of an election.see.at describing the period for coordinated communication as based on a i,which defines such registration drives as federal election activity b restricting financing of federal election activity.drawing on this provision,the fec explained that congress has,in part,defined federal election activity in terms of a time frame,deeming that period of time before an election to be reasonably related to that election.at.yet this observation has no bearing on the issue before us absent evidence that registration activity and electoral advocacy occur on similar cycles.for all we know from this record,registration efforts may significantly influence elections only in the immediate to the vote,whereas advertisements may affect voters even when broadcast more than days before the race closes.in fact,in a companion provision to the voter registration rule,bcra imposes even stricter financing temporal public communication s that refer to a clearly identified candidate for federal office and that promote or support a candidate for that office,or attack or oppose a candidate for that office.a iii.although the fec acknowledged that its content standard was more conservative than this provision,see.at,it never explained why the for voter registration was more relevant than bcra rule for public communications,seemingly a far more comparable.
besides citing the voter registration rule,the fec listed two advantages of the first,it provides a rule.second,it focuses the regulation on activity reasonably close to an election,but not so distant from the election as to implicate political discussion at other times.at.the first of these bromides provides no independent basis for the rule a bright line can be drawn in the wrong place.the second does not so much answer the question as ask it.why is days reasonably close but not so distant without further explanation,we have no assurance that days reasonably defines the period before an election when advocacy likely relates to purposes other than influencing a federal line drawn by the statute expenditure definition,a.
taking a new tack in its briefs,the fec now argues that bcra itself indicates that days is reasonable because a statutory provision on electioneering communications ads that automatically count as contributions when coordinated with a a.see id.f,a c.the electioneering communication concept,discussed at greater length below,covers radio and television advertisements that clearly identify a candidate or party,target the relevant electorate,and appear within days of a general election or days of a primary.see id.f a infra at.obviously similar to the content standard for the period,the electioneering communication definition differs principally in that it is limited to radio and television,whereas the content standard applies to other media as well.see.at.although in its explanation the fec sought to distinguish the shorter for these communications rather than rely on it as justification for the rule,see.at,the commission now insists that if days is reasonable for these ads,then the commission drawing of a temporal line two to four times as far from the election for similar communications that are coordinated is surely permissible.appellant br.at.even assuming this post hoc rationalization for agency action is properly before us,see secs.indus.ass bd.of governors of the fed.reserve,d,we reject it.
for one thing,the proposition that is twice and four times,though arithmetically indisputable,is no reason to select that number over any other.why not triple,or multiply by alternatively,if to days is too short,as the fec indicated in its explanation,see.at,why not go all the way and apply the standard at all times,as in the public communication provision discussed earlier in any event,while electioneering ads are clearly one category of communications that may count as coordinated expenditures under bcra,nothing in the statute suggests they represent the even category.acknowledging as much,the fec own rule rejects the electioneering definition time limit expanding it to from,as well as its media limitations including print advertising and other media besides radio and tv.by the same token,nothing should prevent the fec from regulating other categories of advocacy,for the days.
finally,the fec points out that limiting its standard to express advocacy and campaign redistribution outside the days preserves space for political activities unrelated to elections.true enough,but so would regulating nothing at all,and that would hardly comport with the statute.notwithstanding its obligation to attempt to avoid unnecessarily infringing on first amendment interests,at,the commission must establish,consistent with apa standards,that its rule rationally separates advocacy from other activity falling outside feca expenditure definition.see state farm,at.t he agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.internal quotation marks omitted.the record before us,however,provides no assurance that the fec standard does not permit substantial coordinated expenditure,thus tossing out the proverbial baby spending qualifying as contributions with the bath water political advocacy,at invalidating rule where fec fail ed to undertake tailoring consistent with first amendment interests.
for their part,shays and meehan argue not only that the fec has in fact failed to justify its standard,but also that doing so would be impossible.in support of this claim,they urge us to take judicial notice that substantial advertising occurred beyond the window in recent presidential races,a fact that,if true,would undercut the commission view that it has drawn the line in the right place.that factual assertion,however,is better directed to the fec expertise,and indeed illustrates the sort of inquiry the commission should have undertaken.do candidates in fact limit advocacy to the four months surrounding elections,or does substantial communication occur outside that window do congressional,senatorial,and presidential covered by this on the same cycle,or should different rules apply to each and,perhaps most important,to the extent advocacy now occurs primarily within days,would candidates and collaborators aiming to influence elections simply shift coordinated spending outside that period to avoid the challenged rules restrictions the fec must carefully consider these questions,for if it draws the line in the wrong place,its action will permit exactly what bcra aims to prevent evasion of campaign finance restrictions through unregulated collaboration.
in sum,while we accept the fec premise that time,place,and content may illuminate communicative purpose and thus distinguish feca expenditures from other communications,we detect no support in the record for the specific standard the commission has promulgated.accordingly,finding the rule arbitrary and capricious under the apa,we shall affirm the district court invalidation.
solicit and direct 
as noted earlier,one of bcra main objectives is to shut down the soft money system whereby political parties employed funds outside feca controls to finance political activities related to federal elections.the cornerstone of this effort,mcconnell,at,a new prohibition on fundraising by national party organizations,provides as follows 
a national committee of a political party including a national congressional campaign committee of a political party may not solicit,receive,or direct to another person a contribution,donation,or transfer of funds or any other thing of value,or spend any funds,that are not subject to the limitations,prohibitions,and reporting requirements of this act.
a.the same prohibition extends to the national party committees officers and agents,as well as subordinate entities.see id.a.in addition,federal candidates and officeholders may not solicit,receive,direct,transfer,or spend soft money,id.e,nor may national,state,or local party organizations solicit or make or direct contributions to certain groups,id.d.
shays and meehan challenge fec regulations interpreting solicit and direct with respect to these provisions.in effect,the commission has interpreted both terms to mean ask.under its new regulations,to solicit means to ask that another person make a contribution,donation,transfer of funds,or otherwise provide anything of value,whether that gift is made directly or through a conduit or intermediary.m.t o direct means to ask a person who has expressed an intent to make a contribution,donation,or transfer of funds,or to provide anything of value,to make that contribution,donation,or transfer of funds,or to provide that thing of value,including through a conduit or intermediary.id.n.thus,in the fec view,fundraisers solicit money when they ask for it as in,please give to the party and they direct contributions when they ask for them following an expression of interest,such as when a donor says,i got money to burn and the politician responds,why not give it to x 
whether this interpretation is reasonable depends on the meaning of ask.shays and meehan argue that this term,as used in the regulations,requires an outright,explicit request please give that is contained in a single communication.appellee br.at.the district court shared this view,finding it supported by the fec explanatory statement that b y using the term ask,the commission defined solicit to require some affirmative verbalization or writing,thereby providing members of congress,candidates and committees with an understandable standard,contribution limitations prohibitions.see shays,d at.read this way,as the district court observed,the rule permits national parties,candidates,and officeholders to funnel nonfederal money into different organizations by simply not asking the donors to do so,but using more nuanced forms of solicitation.id.at.shays and meehan offer the following examples.under the regulation,a senator who told a group of party donors that it important for our state party to receive at least from each of you in this election with or without an accompanying not have asked under the commission regulations,and thus would have neither solicited nor directed funds in violation of bcra.appellee br.at.likewise,statements like x is an effective state party organization it needs to get as many contributions as possible would again neither solicit nor direct because they would not ask.id.at.
in its briefs,the fec questions this reading of the regulations,even calling it a straw man.reply br.at.at oral argument,however,commission counsel was unable to reassure us that the rules would cover nuanced situations like shays and meehan hypotheticals.indeed,though pressed to represent the fec views,counsel went no further than to call the congressmen hypotheticals gray area s,stating that he simply ca predict how the commission would vote on them.that response came as no surprise,for the fec official explanatory statement abundantly supports the narrow reading that the congressmen,like the district court,find embodied in the regulations.
during the rulemaking,commenters called the fec definition too narrow.at.they advocated construing solicit to mean request,suggest or recommend,as commission staff had proposed.id.yet the commission rejected this alternative,deeming it inconsistent with the need for clear definitions to avoid ambiguity,vagueness and confusion as to what activities or conversations would constitute solicitations.id.explaining the distinction,the commission observed that it objected to the impressionistic or subjective aspects of the term suggest and request.id.w hile the terms suggest or request encompass a wide array of activity,it is not clear that they would cover more direct verbalizations or writings captured by terms such as demand,instruct,or tell,which the commission believes are captured by the term ask.id.further 
the commission was unwilling to use the far more expansive term suggest,for concern that such a vague term could subject persons to investigation and prosecution based on highly subjective judgments about whether a particular remark or action constituted suggestion.the definition of solicit is intended to include a palpable communication intended to,and reasonably understood to,convey a request for some action.
id.internal quotation marks omitted.
although the fec explanation thus suggested that statements reasonably understood as asking could qualify as such,the commission could not have intended thereby to suggest that its rule covered indirect requests,for that interpretation would overlook the distinction the fec drew between ask and suggest.according to the fec,ask covers direct captured by verbs such as demand and tell whereas suggest does not.thus,by lopping off suggest as well as recommend from the staff proposal and sticking just with ask which the commission deemed essentially synonymous with request,id,the fec eliminated the definition indirect component.this produced a narrowing construction,one that mark s the boundary between permissible and impermissible solicitations,leaving unregulated a wide array of activity like the conduct in shays and meehan two the term solicit could plausibly cover.whereas solicit might otherwise cover coded statements,not to mention winks and nods,the fec,by limiting its rule to affirmative verbalization or writing,has spared itself any need to scrutinize such exchanges.nor will the fec have any need to delve into subjective meaning indicated by context.under the rule,it may simply determine whether the fundraiser in question made an explicit request.
reinforcing this view,we note that the fec construction of its regulations comports with the most natural meaning of ask.of course,we can imagine describing shays and meehan hypothetical senator as asking for money by saying it important that the party receive,just as we can imagine saying my mother asked me to come home when what she said was i love it when you visit.but this is hardly the most natural use of the word ask,which ordinarily means to call upon for an answer or to make a request terms implying a direct question or demand,rather than a statement of fact or opinion.see webster third new int l dictionary.moreover,using only ask rather than a series of verbs would seem odd unless the fec intended to narrow the statute meaning to that word principle,calling for an answer as opposed to suggesting or indicating.
thus,in proceeding with our chevron apa inquiry,we assume the regulations mean what the fec official explanation says they do,that the fec definitions require an explicit direct request for interpretation fec counsel refused to disavow at oral argument.adopting this same view,the district court deemed the fec definitions unreasonable under chevron step two.according to the court,although the terms solicit and direct were not so clear as to preclude the regulations under chevron step one,the rules construction of these terms to cover only direct requests create d the potential for gross abuse,thus defying congress evident purpose of divorc ing national political parties,as well as candidates for federal office and federal officeholders,from the nonfederal money business.d at,quoting orloski,at.we agree,though we locate our holding under chevron one,rather than two.
in undertaking our chevron step one inquiry into whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we employ the traditional tools of statutory construction,see chevron,at,including examination of the statute text,legislative history,and structure,as well as its purpose,bell atl.fcc,citations omitted.as the supreme court has emphasized,i n determining whether congress has specifically addressed the question at issue,a reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.the certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.fda brown williamson tobacco,d.
here,even setting context aside,we think solicit if not also direct more naturally connotes an indirect request than does ask,at least in the narrow sense of asking that the fec rule employs.to give an example,a charity brochure on starving children might well solicit though it does ask in the sense of calling for an answer.dep t of revenue william wrigley,d considering it evident that the term solicitation of orders includes,not just explicit verbal requests for orders,but also any speech or conduct that implicitly invites an order.but in any event,although s olicit can,of course,mean a variety of things,martin tractor fec,in the context of this case we find the fec narrow interpretation of that term as well as direct implausible.
reflecting congress effort to plug the loophole,mcconnell,at,bcra marshals solicit and direct as reinforcements for other,more straightforward prohibitions.candidates may not receive or spend soft money,nor may they solicit,direct,or transfer themselves or anyone else.see e.the same,receiving,transferring,soliciting,apply to national parties.see id.a.further,bcra surrounds these restrictions with yet more stopgaps,providing,for example,that even indirectly controlled entities count as parties for purposes of these restrictions,a,and then reinforc ing,mcconnell,at,the rules by requiring that certain activities receive federal,funding,b.given this context,and considering congress intent to shut down the system,we think it obvious that solicit and direct serve to reinforce bcra more direct prohibitions.barred from spending and receiving unregulated funds,candidates and parties might switch to raising such money for friendly outsiders.so bcra bans soliciting and directing as well.
the fec definitions fly in the face of this purpose because they reopen the very loophole the terms were designed to close.under the commission interpretation,candidates and parties may not spend or receive soft money,but apart from that restriction,they need only avoid explicit direct requests.instead,they must rely on winks,nods,and circumlocutions to channel money in favored that makes their intention clear without overtly asking for money.simply stating these possibilities demonstrates the absurdity of the fec reading.whereas bcra aims to shut down the soft money system,the commission rules allow parties and politicians to perpetuate it,provided they avoid the most explicit forms of solicitation and direction.
although this context alone satisfies us that the fec narrowing construction violates congressional intent,two further considerations reassure us that congress intended broader meanings for solicit and direct.the first is bcra repeal of the magic words standard for issue advocacy.as noted earlier,whereas law permitted unregulated financing of ads lacking explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate,buckley,at,bcra adopts more robust standards for communication oriented towards elections,see infra at a change understood to reflect congress judgment that the old standard was functionally meaningless,mcconnell,at.yet as the district court observed,the fec interpretation of solicit and direct is not unlike that under feca,where the express advocacy rule permitted labor unions and corporations to avoid regulation by simply avoiding buckley magic words,which effectively permitted such groups to sidestep feca prohibitions.d at.if imaginative advertisers are able to make their meaning clear without employing express terms like vote for and vote against,savvy politicians will surely be able to convey fundraising desires without explicitly asking for money.we see little reason why congress would have written bcra to allow the latter practice while stamping out the former.
second,as shays and meehan point out,the fec has long construed solicit elsewhere in feca as covering indirect requests.while allowing corporations and labor unions to create special accounts for political activity,feca restricts solicitation of contributions to those accounts.see b.interpreting this restriction,fec advisory opinions have held that unions and companies may solicit funds merely by praising contributors,see,fec advisory,or even just describing contribution procedures,see,fec advisory.as the commission own campaign guide puts it,solicitations are not limited to a straightforward request for contributions.fec campaign guide for corporations and labor organizations at.although the fec could of course reconsider these advisory rulings,and while solicit could perhaps carry different meanings in different contexts,this background reinforces our sense that congress anticipated a similarly broad construction of that term here.toyota motor,williams,d congress repetition of a term generally implies that congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with regulatory interpretations.
for all these reasons,we hold that congress has clearly spoken to this issue and enacted a prohibition broader than the one the fec adopted.in context,bcra terms solicit and direct cover indirect requests.because the fec rule,according to the commission own explanation,does not,we shall affirm its invalidation.in doing so,we express no view regarding a further argument presented by shays and to avoid statutory redundancy,direct must mean more than ask in response,when solicit means ask plain and simple.
electioneering communication 
shays and meehan third challenge relates to the fec regulatory definition of electioneering communication a new bcra concept that replaces the old magic words standard for issue ads.as noted earlier,in buckley the supreme court,based on constitutional avoidance,construed key feca provisions as applying only to communications that include explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate,magic words such as vote for and vote against.see at.this created a giant loophole.by simply avoiding express advocacy,corporations and labor unions,among others,could expend hundreds of millions of dollars in unregulated funds on broadcasts that appeared functionally identical to ordinary campaign advertising.mcconnell,at.now,bcra provisions upheld against constitutional challenge in mcconnell,see id.at,bar corporations and unions though not their pacs from financing ads meeting the statutory definition of electioneering communication,b see also mcconnell,at.further,bcra requires certain disclosures for electioneering communications,f,and,as noted earlier,such communications automatically qualify as feca contributions when coordinated with a candidate,id.a c see also supra at.
the key to these new restrictions is what counts as electioneering communication in the first place.as a general rule,the definition covers any broadcast,cable,or satellite communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate for federal office,is made within days before a general election or days before a primary,and is targeted to the relevant electorate.f.certain communications are then expressly exempted,among them news stories,commentary,and editorials unless the broadcaster is controlled by a political party or candidate.see id.f b i.in addition,bcra authorizes the fec to craft exemptions,subject to certain limitations described below.id.f b iv.
in an exceedingly complex regulation,the fec has laid out its interpretation of provisions defining electioneering communication.although the district court invalidated other aspects of this rule,only one point remains disputed the interpretation of made.
recall that bcra definition applies only to communications made within specified time periods,or days before an election.construing this phrase,the fec regulation defines made to mean publicly distributed,a,and then defines publicly distributed to mean aired,broadcast,cablecast or otherwise disseminated for a fee through the facilities of a television station,radio station,cable television system,or satellite system,id.b i emphasis added.the italicized words are the rub.according to shays and meehan,nothing in the statute supports limiting electioneering communications to purchased transmissions.as the congressmen see it,the statute applies equally to unpaid broadcasts,such as public service announcements.indeed,they worry that sham psas could become the new sham issue evading regulation though functionally indistinguishable from campaign ads.to give an example used by the fec in the very rulemaking here,supporters could us e a psa to associate a federal candidate with a endeavor say,a blood drive or veterans support effort in an effort to promote or support that candidate.electioneering communications.indeed,given a friendly broadcaster willing to forgo its fee,supporters could even air unambiguous election aids,ads clearly identifying a federal candidate,targeting the relevant electorate,and appearing close to the election.
the district court found that the fec definition violated congress clearly expressed intent under chevron step one.we agree.in effect,the commission has taken the three parts of bcra standard candidate identification,within or days,and targeted at the added a fourth for a fee.nothing in the statute suggests that congress contemplated such an element.certainly,the word made carries no such connotation.when one says,dinner is made,the implication is that dinner exists,not that someone paid for it.likewise here,to say a broadcast,cable,or satellite communication is made implies quite simply that the communication,that it was that someone paid a fee to make the transmission happen.nor does the context add any ambiguity.to the contrary,bcra says,communication made within a certain,days before a general election or days before a primary.obviously,the temporal reference the communication is made is the date of transmission,for that is the point when the ad may influence the election.but given that focus,it makes no sense to say that the communication is made only if someone paid a fee,an event that likely occurred earlier.the point,again,is simply that the transmission occurred.
attempting to concoct ambiguity,the fec protests,there is simply no mention of funding anywhere in the definition.appellant br.at.true,but so what the already capacious would require even more volumes if congress could be clear only by ruling out every possible limitation on statutory language.see,ry.labor executives ass mediation,en banc rejecting the claim that chevron step two is implicated any time a statute does not expressly negate the existence of a claimed administrative power,when the statute is not written in thou shalt not terms.when congress bans possession of a firearm or cocaine,we hardly scratch our heads and ask,gee,maybe they meant possession for a fee by the same token,when bcra says made,we presume,absent compelling indication otherwise,that it means made and not made for a fee.
of course,bcra does permit exemptions,and one might characterize this rule as such,given that it effectively excludes unpaid broadcasts from the definition.to be sure,the fec does characterize its action this way.instead,presumably because the district court held that the fec action exceeded the plain text of bcra exemption clause,see d at,the commission insists that its rule represents an interpretation of the statute.no matter.as the district court explained and as shays and meehan argue,the fec rule far exceeds any exemption bcra would permit,for the statute specifically provides that a communication may not be exempted if it falls within another provision describing public communication s that refer to a clearly identified candidate for federal office and that promote or support a candidate for that office,or attack or oppose a candidate for that office.see f b iv referencing id.a iii.exempting all communications regardless of content,the fec rule makes no pretense of following this command.to the contrary,as noted earlier,it permits broadcasters to run ad after ad lambasting or applauding federal candidates,right up to election day,provided the broadcaster sacrifices its bottom line for its beliefs.because bcra limitation on the exemption power forecloses exactly this possibility,the fec rule again conflicts with congress unambiguous intent.
rather than focusing on these textual problems,the fec briefs emphasize the risk that without its limiting construction,bcra electioneering communication restrictions could chill entertainment,educational,and documentary programs that mention or portray a federal candidate only incidentally,as well as psas featuring federal candidates and encouraging citizens to donate blood,for example.appellant br.at.although this rationale is hardly apparent in the rulemaking record,see.at bas ing the rule on the legislative history of bcra,and although in any event we need not consider it given our chevron one holding,we nevertheless think it worth pointing out that avoiding chilling particular types of communication could hardly justify the fec broad exclusion of all unpaid broadcasts,regardless of content.furthermore,because bcra already includes an express exemption for communication s appearing in a news story,commentary,or editorial,f b i,no further exemption was necessary to avoid chilling those.as for psas,excluding federal candidates from broadcasts promoting blood drives and other worthy causes for days out of every two years days before the primary plus days before the general election would hardly seem unreasonable given that such broadcasts could associate a federal candidate with a endeavor in an effort to promote or support that candidate a risk the fec itself acknowledged,in the very same rulemaking,in justifying its refusal to promulgate a general exemption for psas whether paid or unpaid,see.at.
to sum up,as an interpretation of electioneering communication,the regulation contradicts bcra plain text and thus fails chevron step one.insofar as it instead constitutes an exemption,it runs roughshod over express limitations on the commission power,thus again flunking chevron one.accordingly,we shall affirm the district court invalidation of this rule.
salary allocation 
yet another new bcra concept is federal election activity fea for short.central to congress effort to eliminate soft money influence,this concept identifies activities that state and local party organizations must finance with hard money.among them,as mentioned previously,are voter registration drives within days of an election,a i,and public communications attacking or supporting identified federal candidates whether or not state and local candidates are also mentioned or identified,id.a iii.of course,even before bcra,feca expenditure definition covered spending for the purpose of influencing federal elections,including spending by state and local parties.see id.a mcconnell,at.but as mentioned earlier,fec regulations governing activities with combined state and federal them,voter registration drives and generic party generous use of soft money by state and local parties.see mcconnell,at.see also supra at.bcra fea provisions supplant these regulations,making clear that the listed mixed purpose activities must be financed with federally regulated money.see b.
the issue before us relates to one category of fea salaries for employees devoting more than of their paid time to federal elections.see id.a iv.in any month during which a state or local party employee work crosses the threshold,the employee entire salary counts as fea,thus requiring the party to pay that salary exclusively with federally regulated funds.see id.a iv,b.in its regulations,the fec faithfully implemented this restriction,declaring that such salaries must be paid only with federal funds.c.but the fec also drew an inference that shays and meehan dispute.with respect to all other salaries,those for employees devoting of their time or less to federal activities,the fec eliminated any allocation requirement,thus freeing state and local parties to pay such employees salaries entirely with soft money.id.c,d,c.thus,under the commission rule,such parties may require every one of their employees to work as much as quarter day a week or federal elections without needing any federally regulated funds for those salaries.
as stated in the official explanation,the fec views this rule on salaries below the mark as an implication of bcra standard for salaries above that threshold.see prohibited excessive contributions funds or soft money,july.congress appears to have concluded,the fec wrote,that salaries for employees spending or less of their time on activities in connection with a federal election or on federal election activities do not have to be paid from any mix of federal funds.id.shays and meehan disagree.absent any change in feca expenditure definition,they argue,spending for the purpose of influencing federal elections,including state party salaries,must still be allocated.while holding that bcra did not unambiguously foreclose the commission rule,the district court concluded that because state parties could simply spread federal work over multiple federal employees,exclusive use of unregulated funds for such salaries would compromise the act purposes of preventing circumvention of its national party committee nonfederal money ban and stemming the flow of nonfederal money into activities that impact federal elections.d at.for this reason,the district court invalidated the rule under chevron step two.again,we shall affirm.
first,to the extent shays and meehan assert a bcra violation under chevron step one,we join the district court in rejecting their position.as the district court explained,the statute speaks only to how state,district or local political party committees should fund the activities of their employees who spend more than percent of their paid time on federal election activities.id.at.it says nothing at all about salaries below that threshold,much less anything unambiguous,as required by chevron one.but for the very same,because bcra says nothing at statute provision also does not carry the implication the fec attributes to it.in fact,far from suggesting that salaries may be funded entirely with unregulated money,as the fec believes,the statute,by singling out certain employees,those above the level,suggests that others salaries remain subject to preexisting law.
the statutory context confirms this reading.no exhaustive canvass of electoral costs,bcra fea definition covers just four categories,all of which involve activities with combined state and federal implications that could thus be used to disguise activities as a campaign.we have already mentioned three of the salaries,voter registration within days of an election,and ads attacking or supporting federal candidates in combination with state ones.see a i,iii,iv.the fourth comprises voter identification,activity,or generic campaign activity in connection with an election in which a candidate for federal office appears on the ballot regardless of whether a candidate for state or local office also appears on the ballot.id.a ii see also id.b exempting certain expenditures such as costs for buttons,and local party conventions from all four categories of fea.as a general rule,bcra requires exclusive hard money financing for each of these four activities.see id.b.the only exception,applicable only to limited types of fea and never to salaries,is the levin amendment a provision described below that permits partial financing of certain generic campaign activity with funds raised subject to special controls.see id.b see also mcconnell,at.infra at.
the purpose of these restrictions,as mcconnell says of the rule,is prophylactic.see at.before bcra,donors could lavish soft money on generic state party advertising and voter registration drives,notwithstanding the obvious benefits such efforts would have for federal candidates.now,outside the carefully circumscribed limits of the levin amendment,such activities must be financed entirely with federal money,even though they relate to state as well as federal elections.id.at.describing the fea provisions as captur ing some activities that affect state campaigns for nonfederal offices.likewise,before bcra,under fec allocation rules,see supra at,state parties could pay their workers largely with soft money.now those above the level must be paid entirely with hard,even though their activity benefits state as well as federal candidates.given this prophylactic state activities into the federal orbit due to the risk of concealed federal in the fea definition structure suggests congressional intention to deregulate federal activity.the fea provisions supplement,not supplant,preexisting controls.
indeed,the fec rules acknowledge as much.despite categorically exempting salaries from allocation,fec regulations continue to require that administrative costs be spread between hard and soft money accounts.see c.as the commission explained in the very same statement promulgating the rule,nothing in bcra or the legislative history suggests that congress intended the commission to abandon its longstanding allocation requirement for these expenses.at.likewise subject to allocation are fundraising costs associated with joint and federal campaigns,see c,as well as expenses apart from salaries and wages for voter identification,voter registration,and drives,and any other activities that urge the general public to register or vote,or that promote or oppose a political party that do not qualify as federal election activities,id.c.
these regulations clearly rest on the same bcra interpretation that we have while imposing additional constraints on fea activities,bcra makes no change to preexisting restrictions on expenditures.but if nothing in bcra evinces congressional intent to deregulate expenses like administrative and fundraising overhead,then neither does bcra support exclusion of salaries,those for employees devoting up to of their time to federal elections.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d describing a gency inconsistency as a possible reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice under the apa.indeed,the salary rule appears particularly irrational given the fec recognition that costs for voter registration,drives,and generic party matters,like salaries,that the fea definition specifically require allocation even when the activities do not qualify as fea.see c.
in sum,the fec has construed a bcra provision sweeping state activities within feca as an excuse to punt federal activities outside it.because this implication from the statute makes no sense,and because the commission gave no other justification for its rule,the regulation exempting salaries from allocation is arbitrary and capricious.we shall therefore affirm the district court invalidation of this rule as well.
to be clear,because we thus rely on the apa rather than chevron,nothing in our holding necessarily precludes the fec from remedying deficiencies in its explanation and repromulgating this rule on remand,though we are skeptical that it may do so.answering the district court concerns about potential abuse,the fec suggested in its briefs here that state and local parties may possess neither an incentive nor the necessary flexibility in their workloads and staffing to spread federal work among federal employees.appellant br.at see also reply br.at.but why so given the massive soft money sums infused into elections nearly half a billion dollars in alone,it strikes us as quite plausible that wealthy donors would swallow costs for increased state and local campaigning,were the result an army of workers devoting more than a day a week to federal elections.should the fec wish to adhere to its current view in future rulemaking,it must summon more substantial support than the conclusory assertions presented to us.
levin funds 
shays and meehan final challenge involves an exception to an exception.as noted in the last section,although federal election activity,as defined in bcra,generally requires hard money,the statute contains an levin amendment.see b mcconnell,at.that provision allows state and local parties to finance certain types of fea with money,called levin funds,subject to far less onerous controls than those for hard money.see generally mcconnell,at.the catch is that the party must allocate these fea costs between levin funds and hard money.see b.but under a regulatory exception to this shays and meehan organizations need not allocate if they spend no more than total on allocable expenditures,an amount the commission considers de minimis.see c.at.
to understand the fec rationale and shays and meehan objection,yet more detail about this complex statute is unfortunately necessary.first,levin funds are a sort of money.available to state and local party organizations in sums up to per donor per year,levin funds are exempted from federal disclosure requirements and restrictions though not from state law.see b b iii mcconnell,at.party entities using levin funds must raise them on their own,without help from national parties or even state and local affiliates.see a,b b iv,e mcconnell,at.furthermore,parties may use levin funds only for certain types of,generic party campaigning,activity,and voter identification and registration drives activities covered by two of the four fea categories,see b a referencing id.a i ii and under no circumstances may levin funds finance expenditures refer ring to a clearly identified candidate for federal office,b b i.see generally mcconnell,at.nor may they bankroll any broadcasting,cable,or satellite communication,save those that refer solely to a clearly identified candidate for state or local office.b b ii.
thus,a typical levin amendment activity might involve a generic effort by some state or local party organization to register voters and turn them out for an election where both state and federal offices are at issue.the party entity could finance that activity in part with money raised in contributions.usual hard money requirements would not apply,but,as noted earlier,the party would need to allocate the vote drive costs between hard money accounts and the levin funds raised in these donations.
by what criteria do parties allocate presumably the goal is to approximate the relative state and federal components of the activity assigning levin funds to the former and hard money to the latter,but much as with the coordinated communication issue discussed earlier,bcra leaves the question open.that is,rather than prescribing allocation rules itself,bcra simply refers to regulations prescribed by the commission.b a.so the commission promulgated rules,and these rules,in addition to providing guidance on allocation,include the de minimis exemption at issue in this appeal.
our cases recognize that agencies may promulgate de minimis exemptions to statutes they administer.see,ass of admin.law judges flra,envtl.def.fund,epa.power costle.predicated on the notion that the congress is always presumed to intend that pointless expenditures of effort be avoided,such authority is inherent in most statutory schemes,by implication.ass of alj,at internal quotation marks omitted.but there are limits.first,de minimis exemption power does not extend to extraordinarily rigid statutes.see id.at edf,at.by promulgating a rigid regime,congress signals that the strict letter of its law applies in all circumstances,thus rebutting the presumption against pointless applications.second,even absent rigidity,t he authority to create these exceptions does not extend to a situation where the regulatory function does provide benefits,in the sense of furthering regulatory objectives,but the agency concludes that the acknowledged benefits are exceeded by the costs.public citizen ftc,quoting.power,at emphasis removed.instead,situations covered by a de minimis exemption must be truly de minimis.that is,they must cover only situations where the burdens of regulation yield a gain of trivial or no value,edf,at internal quotation marks omitted,for otherwise the exemption reflects impermissible ing of congress calculations,public citizen,at,as opposed to avoidance of absurd or futile results,edf,at internal quotation marks omitted.
apparently attempting to satisfy these requirements,the fec gave three reasons for its exemption here.first,the commission attempted to show that the levin allocation rule is not extraordinarily rigid.see.at observing that the reporting requirements for federal election activity contain an exception for activity below in the aggregate in a calendar year and therefore concluding that congress did not take a rigid approach to low levels of federal election activity citing e a.we need not consider that argument,however,for even if the fec is correct on this point,its remaining two rationales give no assurance that exempted,levin expenditures totaling or less in a given year for a given party in fact de minimis.
in the first of the two remaining rationales,the fec observed,t he commission is particularly sensitive to the nature of the federal election activity to which this provision applies grassroots activities for which references to federal candidates are prohibited.at.there is a far weaker nexus,the commission went on,between federal candidates and this category of federal election activity than other types of federal election activity for which levin funds are prohibited.id.the fec point,we take it,is that the levin amendment includes only grassroots fea categories,voter registration drives and generic party campaigning,and that as such,the included fea categories involve a weaker nexus with federal candidates than those that congress excluded,salaries and public communications referring to specific candidates.
although this distinction may explain the pattern of included and excluded fea issue we need not rationale for including activities in the levin amendment obviously affords no justification for excluding them from levin allocation,the very form of regulation congress chose.see public citizen,at observing that de minimis exemptions may not congress calculations.yet that is precisely the effect of the fec exemption with respect to levin spending totaling or less in a given year for a given party entity.to put the same point somewhat differently,because the fec observations that covered activities are grassroots and bear a weaker nexus relate to levin fea in general,these rationales would apply equally to or even in levin congress could hardly have deemed trivial,edf,at.
the fec final rationale fares no better.observing that is only half of,the amount each levin contributor may donate subject to state law to each and every state,district,and local party committee,the commission declared t here is no danger that allowing a committee to use entirely levin funds for allocable federal election activity that aggregates or less in a calendar year will somehow lead to circumvention of the amount limitations set forth in the statute.at.this is certainly true.a party with only total expenditures can hardly evade the amount limitation on contributions.id.but the point of levin of this to restrict spending,not donations.specifically,allocation requires state parties to raise hard money for the federal component of activities,despite using levin funds for the remainder.thus,again,to establish that some level of fea,or de minimis,the fec must demonstrate that efforts below that level have trivial or no impact on federal elections.see edf,at.the fact that donors could contribute more than that amount to the state component of such activities does nothing to reassure us that the federal component is thus insignificant.nor does strike us as an obviously trivial amount,considering that donors could give that amount to each and every state,district,and local party observation the fec itself made,see.at.
thus,even assuming the levin amendment is flexible enough to permit de minimis exclusions,the record here presents no coherent justification for the specific exemption the fec chose.accordingly,the commission action again falls short of apa standards,so again we shall affirm the district court invalidation.
as the supreme court rather fatalistically observed in mcconnell,money,like water,will always find an outlet.at.offered there as a reason for no illusion that bcra will be the last congressional statement on campaign finance,this comment serves equally well here to illustrate the importance of faithfully implementing the statute congress has passed.for if regulatory safe harbors permit what bcra bans,we have no doubt that savvy campaign operators will exploit them to the hilt,reopening the very soft money floodgates bcra aimed to close.because the rules at issue in this appeal either fall short of congress mandate or lack record support showing otherwise,we affirm their invalidation by the district court.
so ordered.
i dissent from the majority opinion because i believe the appellees lack standing to bring this action under article iii of the united states constitution.in mcconnell fec,d,the united states supreme court iterated the three requirements that constitute the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing 
first,a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury in fact,which is concrete,distinct and palpable,and actual or imminent.second,a plaintiff must establish a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not th e result of some third party not before the court.third,a plaintiff must show the substantial likelihood that the requested relief will remedy the alleged injury in fact.
at.alteration original internal citations omitted.the appellees have failed to make this minimum showing because they have not identified an actual or imminent,concrete that is caused by the challenged regulations implementing the bipartisan campaign reform act of bcra,stat.instead they speculate that they may suffer vaguely described injuries at some future time.see decls.of shays and meehan,averring each appellee will be impact ed as a candidate who runs in elections that could be affected by funding of state and local activities that affect federal elections,each will be open to attack by groups seeking to evade the contribution limits,source prohibitions,and disclosure requirements imposed by congress and opponents will be able to interact and coordinate in unidentified ways that evade the contribution limits,source prohibitions,and disclosure requirements of federal law emphases added.or they complain of the subjective indignity of campaigning in a purportedly tainted electoral environment.see id,averring each will be forced to run for in a system that is widely perceived to be,and he believe s in many respects will be,significantly corrupted by the influence of money,each will face the strong risk that unregulated soft money contributions will again be used in an attempt to influence federal elections in which he is a candidate and the contribution regulations will affect the perception the public will form of me,my fellow,and fellow party members.such wispish injury claims fall far short of the injury showing required for article iii standing.see allen wright,d to satisfy constitutional component of standing doctrine injury alleged must be distinct and palpable,and not abstract or conjectural or hypothetical internal quotations omitted.the majority attempts to fill the gaps in the appellees allegations by invoking two standing under the novel heading illegal structuring of a competitive environment,which neither the supreme court nor we have ever before applied in a similar context.in its eagerness to manufacture standing,the majority stretches both doctrines past their breaking points.
first,the majority finds standing based on the procedural rights cases.under the procedural rights doctrine,courts have lowered the standing bar somewhat in cases in which a party has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests before an agency so that the primary focus of the standing inquiry is not the imminence or redressability of the injury to the plaintiff,but whether a plaintiff who has suffered personal and particularized injury has sued a defendant who has caused that injury.audubon soc y bentsen,quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.in electric power supply ass ferc,on which the majority relies,we applied the procedural rights doctrine to conclude that the electric power supply association epsa,a national trade association,and its members,which routinely appear before ferc in contested hearings,at,had standing to challenge a regulation creating an exception to the sunshine act statutory prohibition on ex parte communications in agency proceedings,see d a,b.the court reasoned that to establish standing,the plaintiffs did not need to show any certainty of financial loss because,a s regular participants in contested ferc hearings,epsa and its members have a right,protected by the sunshine act proscription against ex parte communications,to fair decisionmaking by the commission.at quoting prof l air traffic controllers org.flra.similarly,in cases challenging an agency refusal to prepare an environmental impact statement regarding a proposed federal project,we and other courts have found that a landowner whose property is threatened by the project has standing to challenge the agency refusal based on the congress intent to protect the landowner procedural right to an environmental impact statement from the agency.see.outdoor council forest,see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d u nder our case law,one living adjacent to the site for proposed construction of a federally licensed dam has standing to challenge the licensing agency failure to prepare an environmental impact statement,even though he can not establish with any certainty that the statement will cause the license to be withheld or altered,and even though the dam will not be completed for many years.the majority finds such cases analogous to this one.the analogy does not hold up.
in electric power,epsa had standing to challenge the regulation because it was seeking to enforce procedural requirements designed to protect its concrete interest in the outcome of hearings to which epsa is a party.at.epsa enjoyed a procedural right to an administrative proceeding free from ex parte communications because it was the beneficiary of one of the two interests underlying the sunshine ensure disclosure as an instrument of fair decisionmaking,for only if a party knows the arguments presented to a decisionmaker can the party respond effectively and ensure that its position is fairly considered.id.quoting prof l air traffic controllers,at.as the supreme court explained in defenders of wildlife,procedural rights are special the person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.at.the appellees do not qualify for this special relaxation of the usual injury standard for three reasons.
first,in the procedural rights cases,the courts have found a party has standing to challenge an agency decision which deprives the challenger of a procedural right that the congress intended to protect in proceedings before the same agency.see committee for full employment blumenthal,on many occasions we have reviewed agency action or inaction at the request of a party who alleged that its procedural rights as created either by the agency own regulations,or the administrative procedure act had been violated.in electric power,for example,we concluded that the epsa and its members had standing to seek review of the decision by the federal energy regulatory commission to permit ex parte communication in its own proceedings which the congress had intended to prohibit in the sunshine act in order to protect the right of fair decisionmaking in proceedings before the federal energy regulatory commission.see electric power,at as regular participants in contested ferc hearings,epsa and its members have a right,protected by the sunshine act proscription against ex parte communications,to fair decisionmaking by the commission.emphasis added.similarly,in the cases challenging an agency refusal to prepare an environmental impact statement regarding a proposed federal project,to which the supreme court alluded in defenders of wildlife,see,courts have found that a landowner whose property is threatened by the project has standing to challenge the agency refusal based on the congress intent to protect the landowner procedural right to obtain an environmental impact statement from the agency undertaking the project.here,there is no such connection between the fec or its rulemaking proceeding and the procedural right allegedly denied the appellees.the majority finds the appellee congressmen have standing to challenge the fec rulemaking procedure based not on a right to some guaranteed procedural protection before the commission but rather on an interest in fair reelection fights in future public elections.see.this unprecedented reliance on a right independent of any agency proceeding turns the procedural rights doctrine on its head and creates a wholly new and insupportable theory of standing.
second,even assuming candidates could have standing to challenge an agency proceeding based on a procedural right available and violable only in a future election campaign,bcra accords no such special right to the appellees or to any other candidate because bcra requirements were not designed to protect any interest,much less a concrete interest,belonging to a candidate in his capacity as candidate as opposed to his capacity as voter.see.audubon soc y,at according to defenders of wildlife,a plaintiff may have standing to challenge the failure of an agency to abide by a procedural requirement only if that requirement was designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of the plaintiff.quoting defenders of wildlife,at.emphasis added.in buckley valeo,d,the supreme court determined that the primary purpose of the federal election campaign act of feca,which bcra amends,was to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual financial contributions,mcconnell,at.quoting buckley,at,by which the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined,buckley,at.the buckley court found,the mcconnell court noted,that feca substantive contribution limits serve an interest in protecting the integrity of our system of representative democracy.at.quoting buckley,at.those bcra provisions which may be considered procedural that is,the provisions governing disclosure,recordkeeping and reporting vindicate three important interests providing the electorate with relevant information about the candidates and their supporters deterring actual corruption and discouraging the use of money for improper purposes and facilitating enforcement of the prohibitions in the act.mcconnell,at.citing buckley,at.none of these interests accrues to candidates qua candidates.the first two plainly benefit the general electorate as the court explained in buckley,a public armed with information about a candidate most generous supporters is better able to detect any special favors that may be given in return.buckley valeo,at.as for the third,recordkeeping,reporting and disclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering the data necessary to detect violations of the contribution limitations,buckley,at,thereby serving feca in reducing corruption and its appearance by limiting contributions.thus,bcra procedural provisions were designed to protect only the rights of voters generally to be informed about candidates and to exercise their franchise in an electoral system untainted or less tainted by corruption.they were not designed to benefit or protect candidates running for office.because each congressman appellee is claiming only harm to his and every citizen interest in proper application of the constitution and laws,and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large,he does not state an article iii case or controversy.defenders of wildlife,at.in short,he has no more standing than any other is to say none 
to support a candidate standing to challenge a campaign finance law violation under the procedural rights doctrine,the majority cites the example in defenders of a landowner who has a procedural right to challenge an agency failure to prepare an environmental impact statement regarding a proposed dam on land adjacent to his own.but there is a key distinction.the landowner has a concrete,particularized the general public to the interest which the environmental assessment requirements were designed to protect his particular corner of the environment may be adversely affected by the dam because of its proximity.thus,he has standing even though he can not establish with any certainty that the statement will cause the license to be withheld or altered,and even though the dam will not be completed for many years.defenders of wildlife,at.a candidate for public office,however,has no such special claim to the interest advanced by,preserving the integrity of our system of government by eliminating corruption.with regard to this interest,he is like one of those persons who live and propose to live at the other end of the country from the dam and therefore have no concrete interests affected.defenders of wildlife,at.
finally,to the extent that bcra creates any procedural protections and i would be reluctant to characterize bcra disclosure,recordkeeping and reporting requirements as protections for candidates,it is not the regulations procedural requirements that cause the appellees alleged injuries but rather the purported relaxation of bcra substantive restrictions on contributions and expenditures.see supra quoting from the appellees declarations.
in addition to the procedural rights cases,the majority also finds standing based on a line of cases establishing the rule that when a particular statutory provision invoked reflect s a legislative purpose to protect a competitive interest,the injured competitor has standing to require compliance with that provision.hardin.utils,d citations omitted.the majority competitive standing theory also suffers from three fatal defects 
first,as i just explained,bcra does not reflect a legislative purpose to protect a competitive interest of the appellees for the provisions the appellees seek to enforce are in no way concerned with protecting against competitive injury.hardin,at.explaining cases in which court found no standing notwithstanding existence of competitive economic injury.
second,the commission regulations have not caused the appellees a competitive injury.in association of data processing serv.orgs.camp,d,cited at,the supreme court found sufficient under article iii because the petitioners experienced increased competition for their customers as a result of the challenged government the supreme court held that the petitioners,data processing service providers,had standing to challenge a ruling by the comptroller of the currency that authorized national banks to provide data processing services to other banks and to bank customers because the petitioner not only allege d that competition by national banks in the business of providing data processing services might entail some future loss of profits for the petitioners,they also allege d that respondent american national bank trust company was performing or preparing to perform such services for two customers for whom petitioner data systems,had previously agreed or negotiated to perform such services.at.as the majority acknowledges,however,the appellees have suffered no increased competition as a result of the commission regulations which create neither more nor different rival candidates.the majority also concedes that the regulations offer no special benefits to the appellees rivals so as to implicate the other basis for competitive standing creating marketplace advantage for competitors.see,directv,fcc,holding prospective auction bidder had standing to challenge rule that put it at a substantial competitive disadvantage other bidders.as in mcconnell,because the challenged action neither confers a competitive benefit on competing candidates nor subjects the appellees to any competitive disadvantage,the appellees lack article iii standing.
in mcconnell,the adams plaintiffs alleged their candidates suffered a competit
