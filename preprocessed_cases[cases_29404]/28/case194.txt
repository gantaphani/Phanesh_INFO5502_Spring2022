as this case comes rapidly to the court,the parties share some common ground.no one disputes that federal law,as described in the help america vote act hava,stat.codified at et,helps americans cast votes and helps to ensure that their votes count in two distinct respects.in one respect,the act makes it easier for individuals to cast ballots by establishing a approach to dealing with disputes about an individual eligibility to vote,the most obvious feature of which is the right to cast a provisional ballot when an election official questions an individual eligibility to vote.in another respect,the act helps to ensure that those votes count,or to put it another way the act helps to ensure that those votes are not diluted by guarding against voter fraud.the one goal complements the other enabling the casting of one vote does little good if another voter fraudulently cancels it out.see crawford marion county election,d purcell gonzalez,d per curiam prichard united states,cir.
no one disputes that one of the tools that hava creates to address fraud is found in a b i.it says 
verification of voter registration information 
b requirements for state officials.
i sharing information in databases.
the chief state election official and the official responsible for the state motor vehicle authority of a state shall enter into an agreement to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration system with information in the database of the motor vehicle authority to the extent required to enable each such official to verify the accuracy of the information provided on applications for voter registration.
no one disputes that this provision places mandatory duties on the secretary of state.at a minimum,it requires the secretary of state,together with the head of ohio bureau of motor vehicles bmv,to agree to match information in bmv database with information in the statewide voter registration database swvrd.no one disputes that the purpose of this matching is to enable officials to verify the accuracy of the information provided on applications for voter registration.id.
and no one disputes that the secretary of state has put together an swvrd system manual,which is designed to implement these obligations.the pertinent section of that manual says the following 
bmv not confirmed this process is currently turned off 
upon receipt of a voter registration record or update,the secretary of state swvrd will validate certain voter information with the bmv.if the secretary and bmv validation is unable to match the voter record,it may not be confirmed.if this occurs the secretary swvrd sends the county boards of election a message stating that the record may not be confirmed.voter records that are not confirmed must have their information updated and resent to the secretary swvrd and validation with the bmv will be reattempted.
resp.to emergency,ex.at ex.to damschroder aff.emphasis in original.according to the secretary of state manual,that office at one point implemented a b i in this way first,if there was not a match between the secretary and bmv records,the secretary would send the county boards of elections a message indicating that the voter registration record can not be confirmed second,after that happened,the secretary required unconfirmed voter records to be updated and resent to the secretary for another effort to validate them with the bmv records,ex.at kindred aff.explaining the secretary earlier practice of sharing mismatch data with county boards.
the apparent turn ing off of this process,or at least the discovery that it had been turned off,prompted this dispute.for reasons that the record does not reveal and at a time the record does not reveal,the secretary of state apparently chose to deactivate at least part of the process,if not all of the process,described in section of her manual.in particular,she concedes that at some point she stopped communicating with the county boards about mismatches and stopped renewing validation requests with the bmv after obtaining a mismatch.the ohio republican party orp and larry wolpert,a state representative,supported by affidavits from two officials of different county boards of election,challenge the secretary interpretation of her duties under hava.as they see it,a b i requires the secretary to do what she formerly did under section of her manual or at least requires her to share records of mismatches with the local boards of election.if the statute requires the secretary only to identify mismatches but does not require her to share this information in a meaningful way with the county boards,they add,then the purpose of verifying voter records with driver license records would be defeated,and one of hava tools for ferreting out voter fraud would become an empty gesture.the secretary responds that the county boards of election technically still have access to this information because they have access to the swvrd,which permits them to check each absentee voter or any other type of voter for mismatches.but,in contrast to being given a list of mismatches by county or having the secretary assist them in addressing mismatch problems,the plaintiffs say that general access to the swvrd system is essentially unlike asking for a drink of water and being given access to a fire hose at full will do nothing to address the objective of this provision of hava.
this dispute and several others apparently grew out of the secretary august order to allow simultaneous registration and voting for six days in ohio in late september and early october.in resolving today dispute,the district court on october,entered a temporary restraining order tro directing the secretary to ensure that hava matching requirements are not rendered meaningless and to do so either by providing lists of mismatches to the county boards of elections or by providing the county boards of election with a method to search the swvrd so that they can isolate and review the mismatches and take appropriate action.order at.
a panel of this court vacated the order later that same.while i tend to agree with some aspects of the panel decision and sympathize with the lack of time it had to address these issues hours or so,i disagree with its key premises for vacating the district court tro.
before addressing those issues,it is important to point out why en banc review of the panel decision is appropriate in this matter.while in the normal course it often will be unwise and inefficient to grant en banc review of decisions like this one,this is not a normal the panel interlocutory reversal of the district court tro itself establishes.section a does not give courts of appeals authority to review temporary restraining orders but only injunctions.a.we have correctly construed that authority to extend to tros in limited cases,namely when a tro effectively operates as a and injunction because it gives the parties no meaningful appellate options about a significant issue of law given the imminence of an irreversible an execution,see,workman bredesen,cir,or as here an election.generally carson am.brands,d.the same considerations that justify the panel decision to review this imminence of a national election and the significance of the issues ample justifications for the en banc court to consider doing the same.
there are three problems with the secretary request to stay the district court tro.in the first place,her interpretation of a b i is not convincing.the key inquiry is this does the provision permit the secretary only to identify matches on the database and effectively keep them to herself or,as plaintiffs put it,throw them in the trash,resp.to emergency mot.at,or does it require her also to verify the registration mismatches either by doing the verification herself or in cooperation with the county boards of election so far as this record is concerned,the secretary has given no tenable explanation why her current interpretation of the statute,as opposed to the office prior implementation of the law,remotely furthers the objective of the law.a mismatch that she does not track down and that she does not allow the county boards of election meaningfully to track down is not a usable mismatch.when the secretary argues in her papers that she has no duty to provide the most system of hava compliance,emergency mot.at,that is something of a euphemism.as far as we can tell,the problem with the current system is not that it is insufficiently but that it is effectively useless.
but there is another problem with the secretary interpretation it straddles the two competing interpretive options presented by the provision rather than embracing one interpretation or the other.the most ruthlessly literal interpretation of the provision is this the law requires the secretary and the bmv only to enter into an agreement to match information in their databases and,once they have done that,they have satisfied hava that,other than the duty to share their data with each other,they have no duty to share mismatches with anyone else,to provide access to data showing the mismatches to anyone else or to investigate mismatches.the other interpretation of the provision is this in addition to creating the two databases and in addition to identifying mismatches between them,the secretary must verify the accuracy of the information provided on applications for voter registration,a b i,by correcting mismatches either at the secretary level or at the county board level in order to ensure that the voter registration records in the state are accurate and are updated regularly and in order to ensure that the state system of file maintenance makes a reasonable effort to remove registrants who are ineligible to vote,id.a a.the former interpretation does not require the secretary to provide access to mismatch data contained in the system only the latter interpretation does.
the secretary picks neither option by itself.she adopts option one in the main but then borrows from option two by conceding that she must provide access to the data containing evidence of mismatches.only then does she draw a line found nowhere in the the county boards must be given access they just need not be given meaningful access.call that interpretation what you will,but it is hardly a construction of the law mandated by its plain language.in picking option two,the district court embraced a sensible and coherent interpretation of these provisions,one sufficiently likely to succeed that it deserves our respect.
contrary to the dissent and amici interpretation,washington ass of churches reed,d,and florida state conference of the naacp browning,cir,offer no support for a contrary interpretation.these cases deal with whether hava preempts state laws that require successful matching before a voter can register to vote.reed and browning are thus two steps removed from today case we are not dealing with any precondition on voter registration,and no one is arguing that a successful match is a necessary precondition to anything.put simply,neither case addressed,in holding or dicta,the issue presented here namely,whether a b i,together with other provisions of hava,require the secretary to provide local election officials with meaningful access to mismatches identified in the swvrd.no decision on that issue,one way or the other,can fairly be said to create a circuit split,dissent at,for the simple reason that no other court of appeals has addressed the issue.
nor,it bears emphasizing,is anyone arguing that a mismatch necessarily requires that a registered voter be removed from the rolls.at most,the identification of a mismatch allows a county board to investigate whether the mismatch has a legitimate explanation say,a recent change of address.see ohio ann.d requiring election officials,before counting an absentee ballot,to verify that the absent voter ballot is eligible to be counted under section of the revised code id.providing that an absentee ballot shall not be accepted or counted,if election officials find that,among other things,the applicant is not a qualified elector in the precinct.nothing about this case or the relief plaintiffs seek will allow them to prevent a single voter from casting a ballot in the november election.at most,the relief could prompt an inquiry into the bona fides of an individual registration,and at most it could require an individual to cast a provisional ballot.at that point,the validity of the voter registration will be determined and,with it,the validity of his or her vote.that is not only sensible but it is also it also furthers both objectives of hava rather than just one of them.
in the second place,the risks of harm to each party and above all the risks of harm to the public support the tro.hava,all recognize,attempts to balance competing interests enhancing access to the ballot on the one hand while preserving the value of each vote from the diluting effects of fraud on the other.in doing so,the act no doubt imposes burdens on the states to further these goals,but the policy interests and hardship concerns that hava puts front and center are those affecting the rights of voters.once we balance those interests,they point unmistakably in one direction.the window to detect and deal with fraud in ohio begins to close on october,when the county boards of election open the first envelopes.see roa.all this order does is ensure that the county boards may,if they wish,investigate discrepancies by that part by using the swvrd or information already derived from that database that was designed for this purpose.if that information becomes available after october,when the opening begins,the opportunity to follow up on mismatches will be irretrievably lost,a concern that affects all ohio voters.at the same time,nothing about judge smith order will limit a single individual right to vote in the normal process or at a minimum through a provisional ballot.
the secretary arguments focus principally on burdens that the district court tro imposes on her,not on burdens or risks that the order imposes on ohio voters.she raises two burdens that it will be difficult for her office to develop a computer program to get access to this information and that any changes to the swvrd at this late stage in the election risk creating other problems in the election process.but why all of this is so is never explained,much less supported by affidavits from the secretary or her office.the bureaucrat this will be difficult to a hard sell given that the secretary office previously shared this kind of information with the county boards.and if the question is who will have a harder time obtaining meaningful access to the secretary or the county boards of is difficult to see how anyone can argue that the secretary faces the harder task.so far as the record shows,the only way the county boards can use the database would be to enter each name of every registered voter in the database to determine whether there was a mismatch for that voter.by contrast,the secretary told the district court that she could put the program together in two to three days.see roa.as between these burdens,i am to understand why the secretary alleged difficulties outweigh the counties.indeed,it may be that a list of mismatches is a public record under ohio public records laws,making the list available in a usable format under hava and ohio law.see ohio ann.id.a.
the secretary also argues that running such a program at this stage could create other problems for the election.here,too,her argument raises more questions than it answers because she again never explains why this is so,much less supports her position with affidavits from someone who would know.the past practices of the secretary providing this kind of information to the county boards suggest that she can mitigate these risks in the same ways she mitigated them before.and if for some reason that is not the case,she has not explained why the tro does not require relatively modest adjustments to the of which would filter the data to identify mismatched records and one of which would capture the mismatches for each of the counties in the state.as for risks to the database when it comes to other uses of the system during the election,it is not clear why running a report or copy of the database before making these adjustments would not compartmentalize,and thereby eliminate,any risks to the swvrd.but if all of these things are exceedingly difficult for the secretary,or worse if they would create a meaningful risk of harm to other parts of the database at this stage in the year,she needs to explain why rather than allowing her attorneys to speculate why.the record on all of this is the more conspicuously so given that it is the key risk of harm identified on the secretary side of the case and it is the one risk that must be balanced against the risk come october of allowing potentially fraudulent votes to be forever counted.
in the third place,the secretary mistakenly claims that the timing exigencies created by this case should be laid at the feet of the plaintiffs.all of this came to a head,the complaint alleges,when the secretary issued her august advisory.because state officials had spoken publicly about trying to resolve election disputes through alternative dispute resolution rather than the courts still a good idea by the way,we should not punish the plaintiffs for failing to run to court the day after the issuance of the advisory.see,mark niquette,lawyers urged to talk out election scraps,columbus dispatch,at.to this day,it remains unclear when the secretary told the public that she had changed the office prior policy on implementing a b i,when she told the public why she made these changes and whether she has made additional changes to the policy since.on this record,there is no cognizable basis for punishing the plaintiffs for bringing this challenge when they did.
as for the notion that courts should hesitate to alter election procedures on the eve of an election,that is far as it goes.when an election is imminen t and when there is inadequate time to resolve factual disputes,it will often be the case that courts will decline to grant an injunction to alter a state established practice.purcell,at.but that will not always be the case.this generalization surely does not control many polls open past their established times on election day or altering the rules for casting ballots or provisional ballots during election it is unclear why it ought to control this one.the question here is whether there is sufficient time to resolve these fact disputes when processing starts on october,and the district court determined that it will take two to three days to get the information,not that it can not be done.nor,it seems clear,are the plaintiffs challenging an established election practice of the state.the established practice in this case is the one the state used in the last national election,not the secretary innovation of it for this one.
at the panel stage,in deciding to vacate the district court tro,this court did not rely on the secretary position that the plaintiffs may not vindicate these rights through a private right of action under.at the en banc stage,however,the dissent has now embraced the secretary position as a ground for decision and maintains that plaintiffs have no right to bring a federal cause of action under this statute to enforce these provisions of hava.there is nothing wrong with this change of heart,particularly given how little time the panel had to address the issue,but it should prompt similar empathy for a district court judge forced to do the same thing make a quick decision about what can only be described as a deeply intricate issue.
at this stage in the case,there are several reasons for accepting the district court prediction on this issue.since maine thiboutot,d,the supreme court has made it clear that empowers claimants to file lawsuits against state officials who violate their constitutional and statutory rights because the provision covers rights secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.emphasis added.in deciding whether a claimant may enforce a given statute through a action,we consider three factors did congress intend the provision in question to benefit the claimant is the asserted right so vague and amorphous as to strain judicial competence and is the asserted right couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms blessing freestone,d internal quotations marks omitted see gonzaga doe,d.there is no doubt that the hava provisions at issue satisfy the second and third prongs of the test in enacting the requirements,congress did not merely express an aspiration that state officials would cooperate in sharing information it mandated that they shall enter into an agreement to match information for the purpose of enabl ing the officials to verify the accuracy of the information provided on applications for voter registration.a b i emphasis added.the statute thus imposes binding,enforceable duties on the secretary that do not strain judicial competence.
what is difficult is the first inquiry did the statute intend to benefit the claimants in one sense,the answer to that question seems straightforward.in sandusky county democratic party blackwell,cir,we held that another provision of with provisional ballots,a was intended to benefit individuals,and it would seem strange to infer that congress wished to pull apart the threads of hava by permitting individual enforcement of some of its mandatory provisions but not others.there also seems to be little doubt that a tool designed to facilitate governmental efforts to identify voter fraud is a tool that redounds to the benefit of individuals.the whole point of curbing fraud is to prevent the dilution of individuals votes,not to mandate requirements for their own stake.
what makes this question close and presumably what prompted the panel not to rely on this consideration as a basis for vacating the district court tro is the impact of the supreme court decision in gonzaga university doe,d,on this analysis.there,in discussing the first prong of the test,the court emphasized that it is rights,not the broader or vaguer benefits or interests,that may be enforced under and that such rights must be unambiguously conferred to support a cause of action brought under.id.at.picking up on this language,the secretary argues that the hava provision at issue in sandusky county t he individual shall be permitted to cast a provisional ballot,a differs from the language at issue here.even though the language in each case is mandatory and even though the language in each case identifies judicially enforceable obligations,the secretary argues that the requirements do not expressly identify any one individual or group of individuals as beneficiaries of the statutory obligation in the same way as this other provision of hava does.
this is a fair argument,one that this court will have to resolve with finality at some point.but it is not an argument with just one plausible answer or even a clear answer.the problem with contending that there is only one way to look at this issue is that the secretary assumes gonzaga requires language even when there is no individual to whom such language could apply.the beneficiary of every eliminated instance of voter fraud is never any one individual because the individual whose vote would have been individual,if you will,whose right to vote is never known or knowable.perhaps when a statute effectively benefits everyone but no one in particular,a right of action still may exist,all other things being equal perhaps it may not.but,either way,it is hard to maintain that the district court should have understood that gonzaga resolved this point since it did not address,much less discuss,this issue.nor did gonzaga overrule earlier holdings that generally permitted the beneficiaries of federal statutes to enforce them through.see,wilder.hosp.ass n,d.
there is one more oddity with accepting the secretary position.the inquiry requires a court to ascertain what congress meant in imposing certain mandatory duties on determine whether congress intended to create a federal right.at.to accept the secretary position in this case,however,we would have to infer that congress meant to make both halves of hava ease of voting and casting provisional ballots on the one hand and the provisions on the wished to allow citizens to enforce just one half of those policies.there is no indication in the statute,or for that matter in the legislative history,that this is what congress meant,and the fact that all of hava relevant provisions may be enforced by the united states attorney general or through administrative processes at the state level,suggests that all mandates should be privately enforceable or none should be.in the final analysis,the most that can be said about the secretary in its two pages of argument on this point before the district court dealt with none of these that it raises a difficult issue.the close answer to this question,together with the reality that all of the other risks of error support the plaintiffs,weigh in favor of denying the secretary motion to stay the tro.see ashcroft aclu,d hawaii housing authority midkiff,d rehnquist,in chambers roth bank of commonwealth,cir quoting hamilton watch benrus watch,cir to justify a temporary injunction it is not necessary that the plaintiff right to a final decision,after a trial,be absolutely certain,wholly without doubt if the other elements are present,the balance of hardships tips decidedly toward plaintiff,it will ordinarily be enough that the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious,substantial,difficult and doubtful,as to make them a fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.
that brings us to one final point.as the panel pointed out in vacating the district court tro,the record in this case is far from ample.that is true,but it will almost always be true in the context of a tro,the nature of which requires rapid decisionmaking.that is what makes the standard of of relevant to the disposition of this emergency appeal.see ne.ohio coal.for homeless blackwell,cir.the point is not just that we give substantial discretion to the district court view of the case in reviewing an order already issued it is that we entrust the district court to deal fairly with future implementation issues implicated by that order.when it comes to applying review here,one of the key obstacles to the secretary request for relief is the lack of any affidavit or other factual support for her arguments that altering the relevant computer programs will be difficult or will create material risks to other aspects of the election process.in upholding the district court october order and its october deadline,it is appropriate to assume what we should always assume in denying interim the district court will respond fairly to requests to adjust the tro if the secretary offers reasonable bases for doing so.with that assumption in mind and with the view that this court should now allow the district court to do its job in handling this difficult case,we deny the secretary motion to stay the district court october tro.
i concur in judge sutton opinion and offer these additional comments as well.
before us is the initial issue of whether to grant en banc review of the secretary of state motion to vacate or stay the district court temporary restraining order directing the secretary of state to comply with the help america vote act hava,et,by performing the required verification of a new registrant identity,establish a process by which county boards of election can access the information generated from the checks,provide county boards of election access to the information entered into the statewide voter registration database no later than october,and provide the boards of election an effective way to access and review mismatches between voter registration information and information in the ohio bureau of motor vehicles and social security administration databases.a panel of this court granted the motion,so not granting en banc review would have the effect of leaving the stay of the tro in place.
the question before us is one of exceptional importance,involving the interpretation and application of statutory provisions designed to combat voting fraud and the dilution of validly cast votes in the context of an election for president of the united states.although the importance of the issue is clear,the parties suggest that we also appropriately consider the role of the courts in intervening in election matters when an election is fast approaching.plaintiffs argue that this concern favors en banc consideration,while the secretary argues that it does not.from my perspective,this concern is better addressed in connection with the merits of the motion to vacate rather than in determining whether to grant en banc review.after all,the issue does not become less important because the election is a short time away.i therefore favor granting en banc review of the secretary motion to vacate.
turning to the merits of the motion,we review the entry of the temporary restraining order for abuse of discretion.in my view,the secretary has failed to show an abuse of discretion by the district court.
the secretary argument includes several legal issues.the panel adequately and correctly dealt with the jurisdictional issue.the private right of action issue is a difficult one and,while sandusky county democratic party blackwell,cir may well point toward its availability,it seems that the panel was wise to avoid it.i am inclined to disagree with the secretary position about the requirements of the statute for the reasons stated in judge sutton opinion.in any event,i can not say that the district court committed a legal error that would constitute an abuse of discretion.
turning to a balancing of the harms and the public interest,this is the point on which i disagree most strongly with the secretary position and the panel granting of the stay.the public interest lies in two areas carrying out the statutory goals of combating voter fraud and vote dilution and preventing disruption of elections.the harm to the plaintiffs is evident from the nature of the claim they assert they can hardly be required to show actual vote fraud to establish irreparable harm when the county election boards lack the means to detect any fraud that may exist.and from the evidence presented to the district court and the arguments made there by counsel for the secretary,disruption of the electoral process and interference with the secretary in carrying out her election responsibilities as a result of the district court order are purely speculative.thus,any harm to the public interest in avoiding election disruption is speculative as well.
as the secretary notes,she requested an evidentiary hearing before the district court,which the court denied.this is a typical ruling in situations involving the issuance of a temporary restraining order permitting an evidentiary hearing would be atypical.the parties did,however,have the opportunity to submit affidavits and make arguments to the district court.as far as i can tell,the secretary submitted no affidavits relating to harm to her in carrying out her duties or the public interest and her counsel oral arguments to the district court did not emphasize the harm point to any great degree.when questioned about how long compliance with plaintiffs requested relief would take,counsel said vaguely that it could take several days or may take longer.he noted no problems with carrying out the election otherwise as a result of reprogramming to provide the relief sought.the district court reading of the situation was that the parties might well be able to agree to a consent decree.although that did not occur,obviously,the secretary position in the district court gave no hint that ordering the requested reprogramming would impede the electoral process.
before this court,however,the secretary blasts the district court action,saying it acted recklessly and that its cavalier attempt to micromanage ohio officials administration of this election is breathtaking.she complains strenuously about creation of disorder and offers speculation about hidden dangers of reprogramming,without any evidence or even proffer of what the dangers might be from anyone who knows anything about the database.and she raises the point,not discussed at argument in the district court,that it is simply too late for court intervention.
the panel majority,while professing disapproval of the district court failure to engage in fact finding,adopts the secretary assertions in her brief on appeal without scrutiny,thus by indirection accepting them as facts.this adoption directly leads to a conclusion that the district court abused its discretion in the balancing of harms,a conclusion that is unsupported by anything that transpired in the district court.
the district court was faced with a situation in which the harms to plaintiffs seemed great,and the harms to the secretary amounted to some programming of uncertain magnitude.based on the secretary representations in the district court,the only public harm at issue was that asserted by the plaintiffs.there was no suggestion and certainly no evidence that granting the plaintiffs request might disrupt the electoral process or harm the public in any way.
abuse of discretion is a deferential standard,and its application here is not only the correct legal makes good practical sense.see purcell gonzalez,d per curiam concluding that the main error of the appeals court was its failure to accord proper deference to the findings of the district court.if we leave the district court order untouched,the secretary is free to take back to the district court any problems she may encounter in carrying out its order.she may also explore with the district court any difficulties that carrying out the order poses for the electoral process generally.she can raise with the district court issues about whether compliance with the order provides plaintiffs with any information they can actually use for any purpose at this point.in short,a district court is the proper forum for raising belated concerns about compliance,not this court.
returning to the question of en banc review,considered in light of the above analysis,one could argue that my focus on the balancing of the harms undercuts the reasons for granting en banc review.in other words,the argument would be that the case ceases to be one of exceptional importance if its resolution depends largely on a balancing of the harms.in this context,i disagree.the exceptional importance of this case lies as much in the public interest concerns and party concerns about the integrity of the electoral process as it does in whether we resolve with finality the existence of a private right of action or the secretary precise duties under hava.
involving the en banc court in the stay of a temporary restraining order is rarely a good use of our resources and rarely presents an issue of exceptional importance,given the procedural posture.this is one of the rare situations,however,where,given the panel opinion,our en banc intervention is required to protect important statutory and public values.purcell.at a state indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election process.quoting eu county democratic cent,d.
in my view,the court has correctly denied the motion to vacate.
i concur in the order primarily for the reasons given in the opinion of judge gibbons.
i write briefly to note my disagreement with judge moore statement of the interpretative issue before the court.judge moore asserts that the issue before this court is whether the help america vote act hava compel s states to use a certain type of match system to verify voters.moore dissent at.i respectfully suggest that is not the issue.the issue is type of system a state might system must yield a certain functionality of result.what the system must accomplish,and not how it must accomplish it,is the issue here.and hava speaks directly to that issue,by requiring that and information be matched to the extent required to enable the chief elections official and the secretary to verify the accuracy of the information provided on applications for voter registration.a b i emphasis added.
the problem,it appears,is that the secretary matching system does not enable anyone to do anything with the information it collects.and that,in my view,means the secretary system likely falls short of the functionality that hava requires.for this reason,among others,i believe the district court did not abuse its discretion in entering the order before us.
i dissent from the decision of this court to grant the motion for initial hearing en banc and the renewed petition for immediate en banc review,thereby reinstating the district court temporary restraining order tro that imposes burdens on the ohio secretary of state secretary that are contrary to federal and state law.this case is wholly inappropriate for initial or immediate hearing en banc.not only have the criteria for initial hearing or rehearing en banc not been satisfied,but also the en banc court is particularly to consider in the first instance swiftly developing issues in the compressed time period now available.the majority action is judicial activism in the extreme.
opposition to grant of en banc review 
the panel assigned to this case pursuant to sixth circuit rules has considered carefully the materials filed on behalf of both sides in this dispute and has issued an order staying the temporary restraining order improperly entered by the district court.the motion for hearing en banc filed by the ohio republican party and larry wolpert collectively orp at this time is nothing more than a blatant attempt of orp to overturn the duly authorized panel decision to stay the district court order that required the secretary of state to likely violate both the help america vote act hava and the national voter registration act nvra.by granting this motion and reinstating the district court tro,the majority of this court acts contrary to our own precedent,fails to follow the supreme court precedent,and creates a new circuit split.
the secretary should not be required by various federal judges to violate those federal statutes,nor should she be required to reconfigure and reprogram the state computers and practices this close to an election.because the granting of en banc hearing and the simultaneous reinstatement of the district court temporary restraining order will throw the election process in ohio into total chaos,i dissent.
on october,the sixth circuit panel stayed the district court temporary restraining order.in our opinion,we explained our reasoning and concluded as follows 
it is clear that the district court four specific orders insert the federal court into the delicate balance struck by hava.we have expressed our concern that under established law orp does not have a private right of action under a b i.assuming orp has the right to bring such an action,we believe that the secretary is likely to succeed on the merits of the issue of the proper interpretation of hava hava does not mandate that the secretary undertake the particularized matching required by the district court tro.further,the irreparable harm caused by the district court tro is significant.with less than a month until the election,and less than two weeks until the beginning of counting absentee ballots,the secretary can not be required to undertake the extensive reprogramming and other changes to the election mechanics without complete disruption of the electoral process in ohio.the irreparable harm to the voting public caused by the district court order is equally clear.finally,the intrusion into the state processes by the federal courts with the ensuing confusion regarding the applicable process weighs heavily against the district court order.
as the supreme court wrote in purcell,given the imminence of the election and the inadequate time to resolve the factual disputes,our action today shall of necessity allow the election to proceed without an injunction altering the state established practice.purcell gonzalez,d.we hereby stay the district court tro

orp asserts that hearing this case initially en banc and bypassing the duly assigned panel or rehearing en banc is appropriate because of the importance of the issues presented and the press of time.the time pressures in this case are entirely caused by orp challenges to the procedures initiated by the secretary of state office before the current secretary began her position in.while the secretary procedures have been known and in effect for a considerable time,orp waited to file its suit in the district court until september,and did not file its motion for this temporary restraining order until october.if orp had truly wanted to have review of the methods and procedures used by the secretary,it should have brought its action much earlier.more importantly,the nvra specifically requires that any program the purpose of which is to systematically remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters must be completed at least days prior to a federal election.c a.hava provides for removing voters in accordance with the nvra,and the latter does not permit registered voters to be removed based on computer matching.a a i.
thus orp has brought its action too late to obtain its requested relief orp claimed press of time is both and.the press of time is not a valid basis for obtaining hearing en banc in this case.
the other reason asserted by orp for hearing en banc is that the case is an extraordinary case,involving the integrity of the election for president of the united states in a state vital to both candidates chances at victory.the federal rules of appellate procedure allow hearing or rehearing en banc where the proceeding involves one or more questions of exceptional importance,each of which must be concisely stated.fed.b b emphasis added.yet orp completely fails to comply with the requirements of this rule it has not specified in its motion for hearing en banc any specific question of exceptional importance.orp utter failure to comply with the federal rules of appellate procedure suggests that its effort to obtain hearing en banc concerning this temporary restraining order is based on orp dissatisfaction with the panel composition or with the merits of the decision of the duly assigned sixth circuit panel to stay the previous temporary restraining order issued by the district judge in this case.orp is simply trying to get a different result by having a different forum within the sixth circuit.
in summary,a hearing en banc in this case is wholly unwarranted and entirely unjustified.granting a hearing en banc on this flawed motion and in light of the circumstances of this litigation is unsound intellectually and without any valid justification.any lawyer reading the motion for initial hearing en banc or its renewed motion can see that substantively it is baseless and procedurally it violates the federal rules of appellate procedure i dissent from the majority rash and meritless decision to grant en banc review and to reinstate the district court tro.
ii.orp has no private right of action 
in addition to disagreeing with this court decision to grant en banc review,i must dissent from its decision to reinstate the district court temporary restraining order.on its face,hava does not create a private right of action.supreme court precedent makes it absolutely clear that the provisions of hava at issue here,a a a b i,do not create federal rights enforceable by private plaintiffs under.for a statute to be enforced via,congress must have unambiguously intended to create an individual right.gonzaga doe,d.however,these provisions of hava regulate the conduct of officials involved in the voting process they do not create rights enforceable by individual voters.in sharp contrast to the statutory provisions that the supreme court and this circuit have recognized as establishing privately enforceable rights,the hava provisions at issue in this case contain absolutely no language.it is not surprising,therefore,that no court has interpreted these provisions as conferring a right enforceable by private plaintiffs under.instead hava provides its own enforcement mechanisms,specifying that the attorney general may bring suit to enforce hava.the attorney general has not brought suit 
a statute is enforceable via a private right of action under only if contains an unambiguously conferred right.gonzaga,at.i t is rights,not the broader or vaguer benefits or interests,that may be enforced under the authority of that section.id.if a statute by its terms grants no private rights to any identifiable class,then congress did not intend to create a private right of action.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.this inquiry begins with the text of the statute.for a statute to create such private rights,its text must be phrased in terms of the persons benefited.id.at.quoting cannon of chicago,d.by contrast,statutes that speak only in terms of institutional policy and practice or that have an aggregate focus do not confer a right that may be enforced via.id.at.similarly,s tatutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected do not confer enforceable rights.alexander sandoval,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the provisions of hava at issue here contain absolutely no language.instead,they impose an obligation on state officials to establish a system meeting certain criteria.section a a requires each state to implement a computerized statewide voter registration list that contains the name and registration information of every legally registered voter in the state and assigns a unique identifier to each legally registered voter in the state a a.section a b i further requires that t he chief state election official and the official responsible for the state motor vehicle authority of a state shall enter into an agreement to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration system with information in the database of the motor vehicle authority to the extent required to enable each such official to verify the accuracy of the information provided on applications for voter registration.a b i.these provisions focus on the administration of federal elections and the duties of state officials to establish institutional mechanisms meeting certain criteria.nothing in these provisions contains the sort of language that the supreme court has required to establish a privately enforceable right.
the paradigmatic statutes containing the requisite language are title vi of the civil rights act,and title ix of the education amendments of,a.those provisions contain similar explicit language.no person in the united states shall,on the ground of race,color,or national origin,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a no person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.because each of these provisions has an unmistakable focus on the benefited class,the supreme court has recognized that each creates privately enforceable rights.gonzaga,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
in gonzaga,by contrast,the supreme court found that a provision of the family educational rights and privacy act of ferpa prohibiting federal funding of educational institutions with a policy or practice of releasing records to unauthorized individuals did not create a privately enforceable right.that provision of ferpa provided that n o funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of educational records of students without the written consent of their parents to any individual,agency,or organization.gonzaga,at.quoting g b.distinguishing this ferpa provision from the language of title vi and title ix,the court noted that it spoke only to government officials rather than to individuals potentially benefited under the statute.id.at.the court concluded that the ferpa provision entirely lack ed the sort of language critical to showing the requisite congressional intent to create new rights.id.at.
unlike the individually focused language of title vi and title ix no person shall be subjected to discrimination,and like the ferpa provision at issue in gonzaga,the hava provisions in this case speak only to government officials.hava directs that state election officials implement a computerized statewide voter registration list,a a,and that they enter into an agreement to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration system with information in the database of the motor vehicle authority to the extent required to enable each such official to verify the accuracy of the information provided on applications for voter registration,a b i.in other words,these provisions require state officials to maintain a centralized statewide computerized voter registration list and to maintain that list according to certain standards.nothing in these provisions refers to the rights of individuals or voters.thus,unlike title vi and title ix and like the ferpa provision at issue in gonzaga,these hava provisions focus only on government officials,who are directed to take certain actions,rather than on individuals who may benefit from the provisions.consequently,like the ferpa provision at issue in gonzaga,these hava provisions lack the sort of language critical to showing the requisite congressional intent to create new rights.gonzaga,at.
the hava provisions at issue in this case also differ dramatically from the language contained in hava a,which we have held creates a private right enforceable via.see sandusky county democratic party blackwell,cir.the provision at issue in sandusky,hava a,provides that upon making the required affirmation,an individual shall be permitted to cast a provisional ballot.a emphasis added.in sandusky,we concluded that t his language mirrors the language of title vi of the civil rights act of and title ix of the education amendments of.at.we further noted that this language markedly differs from the statutory language found by the supreme court in gonzaga to be insufficiently focused on the benefited class to create an individually enforceable right.id.at.we also stated that of hava refers explicitly to the right of an individual to cast a provisional ballot,and requires states to post information at polling places about this right along with instructions on how to contact the appropriate officials if these rights are alleged to have been violated.id.at emphasis in original citing b e.by contrast,the hava provisions at issue in this case do not so much as mention individuals or rights.instead,these provisions are directed solely at regulating the conduct of state election officials.
finally,nothing in hava legislative history indicates that congress intended to create a private right of action to enforce the provisions at issue in this case,a a a b i.if anything,the legislative history weighs against the recognition of privately enforceable rights under hava,because congress apparently considered,and rejected,the creation of an express private right of action under hava.senator christopher dodd,a sponsor of hava and principal senate author of the conference report,stated that w hile he would have preferred that we extend a private right of action,the house simply would not entertain such an enforcement provision.nor would they accept federal judicial review of any adverse decision by a state administrative body.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of dodd.
despite the fact that hava does not create a private right of action,it imposes binding duties on the secretary of state which are enforceable through alternative means.in states receiving certain federal funding,individuals may challenge actions by the election officer through an administrative complaint system established by the state.see sandusky,at acknowledging this administrative remedy.regardless of funding,hava permits the attorney general to bring a civil action against any state to enforce hava requirements.see id.given these mechanisms,it is absurd to assert that hava does not impose binding,enforceable duties on the secretary congress has simply determined that private lawsuits are not the best method of enforcing hava.although we have previously held that these enforcement provisions do not foreclose private suits to enforce the right of an individual to a provisional ballot,see sandusky,at,these provisions suggest that congress did not intend for private suits to be the means of enforcing the hava provisions now at issue that are directed toward duties of state officials and are not creating individual rights.
therefore,pursuant to supreme court and sixth circuit precedent,orp has no explicit or implied private right of action to bring this lawsuit or to seek the relief granted by the district court and the en banc majority.therefore,i would dismiss this action because plaintiffs have failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted.the majority contrary finding that there is an implied private right of action here violates supreme court precedent such as gonzaga,at,and violates sixth circuit precedent that members of the majority have previously joined such judicial intervention in conflict with the intent of congress in writing the help america vote act is inexplicable and improper.i dissent from the majority decision to permit orp to proceed with its claims 
iii.the motion to vacate the tro should be granted 
even assuming that a private right of action exists under hava,i believe that northeast ohio coalition for homeless blackwell,cir,demands that this court issue a stay and vacate the district court temporary restraining order.
success on the merits 
the help america vote act,known as hava,requires each state to 
implement,in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner,a single,uniform,official,centralized,interactive computerized statewide voter registration list defined,maintained,and administered at the state level that contains the name and registration information of every legally registered voter in the state and assigns a unique identifier to each legally registered voter in the state in this subsection referred to as the computerized list.
a a.further 
the chief state election official and the official responsible for the state motor vehicle authority of a state shall enter into an agreement to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration system with information in the database of the motor vehicle authority to the extent required to enable each such official to verify the accuracy of the information provided on applications for voter registration.
under the plain language of the statute,it is clear that all that this section requires is that a state have an agreement between the election official and the motor vehicle authority official to share and compare information in the statewide voter registration system with information in the motor vehicle authority database and give the state election official and the motor vehicle official the ability to check voter registration information in the system.there is absolutely no language that imposes an affirmative duty on any state official to enable a purge of voters by either scouring the database to locate mismatches or by providing a system that would allow a person to make such a search.it is clear from the language of the statute and by looking at legislative history that hava matching requirement was intended as an administrative safeguard for storing and managing the official list of registered voters,and not as a restriction on voter eligibility.washington ass of churches reed,d.in fact,the two federal courts to consider the provision in question here,reed and florida naacp browning,cir,both rejected the argument asserted by orp that hava requires matching to be used to verify eligible voters.reed,d at browning,at.the reed court stressed that the matching system is simply one way that a new voter who registered by mail could be verified.reed,d at.reed went on to explain that a system that made matching the only way to verify voter identity would violate hava.id.at r equiring a match prior to registration directly conflicts with b.in browning,the eleventh circuit acknowledged that,while hava would allow a state to require that an individual have a match to be eligible to vote,hava did not compel such a requirement.browning,at.
though browning and reed disagree as to whether a state can choose to base voter eligibility solely on matching,they agree on the issue before this court hava does not compel states to use a certain type of match system to verify voters.all that hava requires is that election officials have some method by which to verify registrations.the language of hava does not mandate what system the states must use to match or verify votes,leaving such decisions to the discretion of the states.the majority of this circuit thus conflicts with the eleventh circuit and creates a circuit split that should be resolved by the supreme court.
it boggles the mind that the majority can distort this simple language to force a state to implement a specific type of match system.this conclusion flies in the face of hava own directive that the state gets to choose how to implement hava.the specific choices on the methods of complying with the requirements of this subchapter shall be left to the discretion of the state.emphasis added.i can not comprehend why the majority is going to such lengths to force this strained interpretation into the case law,and i dissent from the majority violation of the plain statutory language.
moreover,the majority view would require the secretary to violate the national voter registration act nvra and hava.hava specifically provides for the removal of voters in accordance with the provision of the national voter registration act of.a a i.nvra,however,does not permit registered voters to be removed based on computer matching.see.indeed,the nvra requires that any program the purpose of which is to systematically remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters must be completed at least days prior to a federal election.c a.the stated purpose of the tro is to allow for an effective way to access and review the mismatches located in the current database,because,allegedly,some mismatches will reflect voter fraud.dist.ord.at.thus,the tro demands a program the purpose of which is to systematically remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters.c a.therefore,the tro,now sanctioned by the majority forced interpretation of hava,mandates that the secretary violate federal law.congress can not have intended hava to be read in such a way.
applying the correct interpretation of this statute to the facts in this case,i believe ohio is likely in compliance with hava.currently,the secretary has a database which matches the information a voter provided when registering to vote with the information contained in the ohio bureau of motor vehicles database.if there is a mismatch,the database notes the mismatch.this record of mismatches in the database is accessible by both the secretary and the individual boards of election in ohio.the individual boards of election can query a voter match status in real time in order to verify registration this is all hava requires.it is true that the statewide voter database does not provide for a list of these mismatches,but hava does not require that level of.to be sure,it might be nice if the system printed out a list of individuals within,for example,a particular precinct,that did not match,but i refuse to manipulate the clear language of congress in hava to require ohio to comply with a particular interested private party view of what type of match system would be best.for all these reasons,i conclude that the likelihood that the secretary will succeed on the merits is great.
irreparable harm 
the district court found that there would be no harm to others,including the secretary,if it issued the tro that orp sought.this determination is wholly unsubstantiated and contrary to the realities of the tro issued.in a week,the database that the district court has ordered to be reprogrammed will be used to generate the election day poll books.secretary br.at.the district court made its reprogramming order without hearing any evidence pertaining to how such a reprogramming would affect the existing election system and,more importantly,how long it would take to test the reprogrammed system,retrain personnel,and ensure that the new reprogramming did not cause problems.the supreme court has exhorted courts to exercise proper judicial restraint before making precipitate changes to election procedures and policies when an impending election is imminent and a state election machinery is already in progress.reynolds sims,d see also purcell gonzalez,d.election procedures are matters of state law,and federal courts should hesitate to interfere,particularly when operating on limited information in the weeks preceding an election.see purcell,at.
the secretary must handle all problems related to the reprogramming that is required under the district court novel order embraced by the majority of the en banc court.the most alarming possible of reprogramming would be that a programming glitch could cause validly registered voters to be inadvertently purged from poll books.such a glitch would leave the secretary with a database that can no longer be trusted for use in generating the poll books required for the election,causing delays and inaccuracies in the creation of the poll books.secretary br.at.the short available to comply with the tro amplifies the risk of programming errors,one of numerous significant problems presented by the requirements imposed by the district court on short notice.
additionally,even if the reprogramming works perfectly,the secretary will be faced with a large number of mismatches to contend with at the last minute.see brennan ctr.amicus br.at ohio democratic party odp amicus br.at.because of the time limitations,voters whose information does not match may not be aware that there is any question about their registration and may not have or be able to obtain the documents necessary to further verify their registration.it is unlikely that the state can properly investigate all of the mismatches created by the tro,and as a result,properly registered voters will likely be forced to cast provisional ballots,will believe that they can not vote,or will be turned away at the polling places.see purcell,at.demanding careful consideration of any legal challenge that involves the possibility that qualified voters might be turned away from the polls.it is worth noting that the procedures each county uses to deal with these mismatches may not be uniform and could result in disproportionate disenfranchisement.see bush gore,d per curiam noting importance of statewide standards for resolving questions of voting procedure.this confusion over what hava requires in terms of matching would affect not only ohio,but every state in the country.odp amicus br.at.
moreover,at a time when the secretary is already busy with routine election procedures,the tro will require the secretary to expend significant scarce resources on the reprogramming and matching effort.this diversion of resources could leave the state unable to respond to routine election issues such as broken voting machines and lines at polling places.if significant energies are devoted to matching issues,the orderly administration of the election will suffer.for all these reasons,i conclude that the secretary would suffer irreparable injury if we do not grant a stay and vacate the district court tro.
substantial harm to others and public interest 
given the fact that hurriedly reprogramming the database could lead to the purging of validly registered voters,a stay of the district court intrusive tro is necessary to protect the voters of ohio.though i agree with the district court conclusion that safeguarding the legitimacy of the election of the president of the united states,dist.ord.at,is of great public importance,the tro is not required to protect that interest.it is striking that both the district court and the majority of this court have determined that the tro is the proper remedy without any factfinding.the district court stressed that the public,as well as orp,would be injured by voter fraud if a tro were not granted.dist.ord.at.this is the kind of inquiry that demands extensive factfinding.see purcell,at.however,rather than undertake such factfinding,the district court,citing two newspaper articles,merely assumed that there will be widespread voter fraud absent the issuing of a tro.numerous other newspaper articles quote election officials who distinguish fraud from actual voter fraud,and who indicate that actual improper voter registrations are already being detected.see,joe guillen,multiple registrants tell cuyahoga county elections board acorn workers begged for signatures,cleveland plain dealer at.given the shaky ground on which the district court suggestion of rests,i believe that this unsubstantiated fear does not warrant the district court intrusion into the established state practice.
additionally,available evidence indicates that this intrusive tro will cause more harm than it seeks to address.computer matching is not a reliable way to verify voter eligibility.brennan ctr.amicus br.at odp amicus br.at aclu amicus br.at.indeed,evidence from other states indicates that human error,not fraud,causes most mismatches.odp amicus br.at.data suggests that when the database match is conducted,anywhere from to percent of registered voters will fail to match.brennan ctr.amicus br.at.disturbingly,mismatches have been shown to bar voters more frequently than white voters.aclu amicus br.at.data from the secretary of state shows that there are at least new registered voters in ohio this year.rich exner,ohio voter registration surges,available at http www.cleveland.com datacentral index.ssf registration surges.html more.given these numbers,the tro issued by the district court and revived by today result,could result in anywhere between to registered voters being removed from voting rolls,being forced to cast provisional ballots,or being otherwise wrongly disenfranchised.
in contrast to these concrete projections,orp has failed to present evidence that any voters,including those who have registered in the last year,have committed actual voting fraud.indeed,data collected by the brennan center,the same organization that studied the failure rate of data matching,indicates that actual voter fraud is extremely rare.justin levitt,the truth about voter fraud,available at.org content resource truthabout voterfraud.the brennan center noted that claims of voter fraud are frequently used to justify policies that do not solve the alleged wrongs,but that could well disenfranchise legitimate voters.id.at.in fact,this report noted that t he most common source of superficial claims of voter fraud,and the most common source of error,probably involves matching voter rolls against each other or against some other source to find alleged double voters,dead voters,or otherwise ineligible voters.id.at.similarly,the league of women voters of ohio and the coalition on homelessness and housing in ohio studied the million votes cast in ohio between and,and found only four fraudulent ballots.let the people vote,available at reform report.pdf.therefore,the matching policy mandated by the tro purportedly to eliminate voter fraud is actually likely to cause mismatches which will erroneously be labeled voter fraud,thereby disenfranchising individual voters and undermining public confidence in election results the likelihood that this tro will undermine confidence in the election results and will adversely affect,and perhaps even disenfranchise,a large number of voters is greater and more disturbing than the possibility that fraudulent votes will dilute the strength of legitimate ballots.purcell,at.
on the eve of the presidential election,orp asks this court to derail election procedures that have been months in the making.the stay that the majority has vacated would simply have preserved the status quo and allowed ohio to conduct its elections in the orderly method it had planned.the majority ruling today upends all order,injects the potential for erroneous disenfranchisement of qualified voters into the election,and creates confusion surrounding voting rights on the unverified specter of potential fraud.in a case involving legislative apportionment,an issue which raises the same questions of vote dilution that prompted the district court to issue a tro,the supreme court highlighted the importance of not making hasty,unconsidered changes to election plans on the eve of major elections 
under certain circumstances,such as where an impending election is imminent and a state election machinery is already in progress,equitable considerations might justify a court in withholding the granting of immediately effective relief in a legislative apportionment case,even though the existing apportionment scheme was found invalid.in awarding or withholding immediate relief,a court is entitled to and should consider the proximity of a forthcoming election and the mechanics and complexities of state election laws,and should act and rely upon general equitable principles.with respect to the timing of relief,a court can reasonably endeavor to avoid a disruption of the election process which might result from requiring precipitate changes that could make unreasonable or embarrassing demands on a state in adjusting to the requirements of the court decree.
reynolds,at.
the tro perverts the clear language of hava,and makes a provision meant to ensure that every american who is eligible to vote can vote into a tool to effect widespread voter disenfranchisement.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of daschle.the harm that the tro will inflict on the secretary,the voters,and the public is clear elections in ohio will be chaotic at best,blatantly unfair at worst,and doubt will fall on the validity of election results across the state.the mere specter of voter fraud,often raised but seldom proven,is the only injury that orp asserts,and this unfounded threat can not be used to coerce courts into acceding to the demands of a partisan group that is intimately concerned with the results of the election it seeks to control.accordingly,i would hold,as i did previously,that we should stay the tro originally issued by the district court.
iv.conclusion 
it is clear that the district court four specific orders insert the federal court into the delicate balance struck by hava.i believe that under established law,there is no private right of action under a b i.even if orp had the right to bring such an action,which it does not,i believe that the secretary is likely to succeed on the merits of the issue of the proper interpretation of hava hava does not mandate that the secretary undertake the particularized matching required by the district court tro.further,the irreparable harm caused by the district court tro is significant.with less than three weeks until the election,and less than twelve days until the beginning of counting absentee ballots,the secretary can not be required to undertake the extensive reprogramming and other changes to
