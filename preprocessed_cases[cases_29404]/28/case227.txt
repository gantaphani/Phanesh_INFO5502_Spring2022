after his absentee ballot was rejected in the general election,bruce zessar filed suit alleging that his due process rights were violated because election officials failed to provide him with notice and a hearing prior to rejecting his ballot.the district court granted in part his motion for summary judgment,but before it entered final judgment,the illinois general assembly amended the portions of the state election code addressing absentee voting.notwithstanding this amendment,the district court entered final judgment in favor of zessar declaring unconstitutional the code as it stood prior to amendment.the district court also deemed zessar a prevailing party entitled to attorney fees under.the defendants appeal.because we conclude that the amendment of the election code mooted zessar challenge to the code,and that the district court conclusion that zessar was a prevailing party was in error,we vacate those portions of the judgment and remand for partial dismissal.
bruce zessar resides and is registered to vote in lake county,illinois.zessar submitted an absentee ballot intending to vote absentee in the general election held on november.his ballot was rejected because of a belief that the signatures on his absentee ballot application and ballot envelope did not match.election officials concede that zessar vote was rejected in error,and did not count in the election.making matters worse,zessar was not notified that his ballot had been rejected until he received a postcard explaining the basis for the rejection in.the parties agree that during the period between election day and the canvass,which was held on november,and rendered the election results final,zessar had no opportunity to challenge the rejection or otherwise rehabilitate his ballot.
the circumstances surrounding the rejection of zessar ballot arose under article nineteen of the illinois election code,which covers absentee voting,as it stood in.ilcs to.voters began the process of voting absentee by filing an application with local election authorities for an absentee ballot.ilcs.if the applicant was lawfully entitled to vote absentee in the requested location,election officials mailed the applicant a ballot.ilcs.a voter who received an absentee ballot would fill it out,place it in a certified envelope,and either mail it to the clerk office or deliver it in person.the clerk would then see that all such ballots were delivered to the appropriate precincts.ilcs.absentee ballots were not counted or otherwise verified before the evening of election day.on election day,however,the absentee ballot count began no later than id.once the polls closed,election judges in each precinct cast the absentee ballots by opening the carrier envelopes containing the ballots,announcing each voter name,and comparing the signature on the ballot envelope with that on the application.ilcs.a ballot would be rejected in four circumstances if the signatures on the envelope and application did not match if the voter was not registered in the precinct if the envelope was open,or had been opened and resealed or if the voter voted in person during the day.id.while the election code in effect in required notification to absentee voters whose ballots were rejected,ilcs,there was no requirement that the voters be notified in time to challenge the rejection before the canvass.in other words,sending zessar notice in january that his ballot was rejected at the beginning of november violated no portion of the illinois election code.
zessar filed a class action complaint on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated voters against willard helander,lake county clerk,the members of the lake county board helander,collectively,and the members of the illinois state board of elections state board.zessar alleged that the election code failure to provide for notice and a hearing before the rejection of his absentee ballot violated his due process rights as protected by the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution on march,the district court entered an order denying the defendants motion for summary judgment and granting,in part,zessar motion for summary judgment.the court determined that the election code failure to provide for notice and a hearing violated the due process clause,and that zessar was entitled to prospective injunctive relief.the court also held that the economic damages zessar sought were not an appropriate remedy,and that any equitable relief beyond implementing a lawful absentee voting system was not warranted.the district court did not enter judgment on its ruling,however,instead directing the parties to file proposed procedures for providing notice and a hearing to voters whose absentee ballots were rejected.
three days later,zessar filed an emergency motion for an injunction asking the district court to enjoin enforcement of the unconstitutional portions of the election code in the illinois primary elections which were going to take place on march.for reasons not appearing in the record before us,that motion was denied on march.the district court also denied motions by the state board and helander to file interlocutory appeals of the ruling on the summary judgment motion.
while the parties proposed procedures for handling absentee balloting were under consideration by the district court,the illinois general assembly passed public act act amending provisions of the election code such as the procedure for selecting election judges,ilcs,handling challenges at polling places,ilcs,and counting provisional ballots,ilcs.see.public act.more significantly for this case,the act also amended the procedures for absentee voting.the amendments,which took effect on july,provided that if a absentee ballot was rejected for one of the reasons stated above,the election authority had to notify the voter of the rejection within days after the rejection but in all cases before the close of the period of counting provisional ballots.ilcs.this notice had to state the reason for the rejection,and notify the voter that he could appear before the election authority on or before the fourteenth day after the election to show cause why the ballot should not be rejected.id.review of the voter challenge would be undertaken by a panel of three judges appointed for that purpose.id.the judges could review the contested ballots,envelopes,applications,and any other evidence submitted by the voter.id.the final determination on a ballot validity was not reviewable,and ballots determined to be valid were added to the vote tally for their precincts.id.
the defendants moved to dismiss zessar suit as moot based upon these amendments.zessar opposed dismissal,and argued that the amendments did not moot the suit because they still did not provide sufficient due process to absentee voters.the district court denied the motion on october.in denying the motion,it expressed concern regarding absentee voters who would be absent from their precincts for an extended period of time,due to overseas deployment or otherwise,because they would be unable to appear in person before the panel.the court was also concerned that local election officials might not be prepared to implement the panels.on october,in anticipation of the upcoming election and echoing the concerns expressed by the district court,zessar moved for an emergency injunction prohibiting the defendants from rejecting any absentee ballots under the election code as it then stood.this motion was denied by the district court on october.
on june,the district court entered a final judgment containing four conclusions.first,the district court stated that t he prior version of ilcs is unconstitutional because it failed to provide due process to the absentee voter.second,the court concluded that zessar qualified as a prevailing party based on its earlier partial grant of zessar motion for summary judgment and the illinois general assembly subsequent amendment of the election code.next,the court cited statistics from the election showing the large number of challenges brought by absentee voters whose ballots were rejected and the high rate of success they had in challenging rejection.even though the court still entertained reservations about the sufficiency of the protections afforded to voters absent from their precincts for extended periods,the statistics did not reveal that any such voter attempted to challenge a ballot rejection.accordingly,the court expressly declined to enter judgment that the election code was unconstitutional.finally,the court declined to enter judgment that election officials were required to use every available address,mail,email,and fax to notify voters that their absentee ballot had been rejected,leaving to local election officials the determination of reasonable notification.the defendants filed motions for reconsideration of the court determination that zessar was a prevailing party,but the district court denied those motions.
helander and the state board filed separate appeals which have been consolidated for our review.helander challenges the district court substantive determination that the election code violated the due process clause.the state board argues that zessar challenge to the election code as it stood prior to its amendment in july was mooted by the code amendment.this mootness,the state board argues,left the district court without jurisdiction to enter final judgment on the constitutionality of the provisions.additionally,the state board asserts that zessar is not a prevailing party under,and that the district court erred in declaring him such and awarding him attorney fees.the district court conclusions regarding the election code have not been presented to us for review.
it is fundamental to the exercise of judicial power under article iii of the united states constitution that federal courts may not give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions.protestant mem l med,maram,cir.therefore,we must consider whether zessar due process challenge to the election code was rendered moot by the code amendment before taking up the issue of whether those provisions comported with constitutional due process requirements.id.mootness is one of the concepts that comprise the threshold issue of justiciability.whether a case has been rendered moot is a question of law that we review de novo.fed of adver.indus.representatives,city of chicago,cir.
we have previously held that any dispute over the constitutionality of a statute becomes moot if a new statute is enacted in its place during the pendency of the litigation,and the plaintiff seeks only prospective relief see macdonald city of chicago,cir citing kremens bartley,d t he enactment of the new statute clearly moots the claims of the named appellees.see also rembert sheahan,cir when a challenged statute is repealed or significantly amended pending review,and a plaintiff seeks only prospective relief,a question of mootness arises.emphasis added.thus,absent a lack of genuineness to the amendment as addressed below,the enactment of public act mooted the parties dispute over the election code.in fact,that the dispute was moot seems to have been apparent to the parties and the district court during the proceedings below.once the code was amended in july,the parties motion practice turned to the constitutionality of the code.similarly,the district court denial of the defendants motion to dismiss for mootness was based on its concerns about the constitutionality of the new provisions and whether election officials were actually going to implement them.the parties concern with the election code as it stood when the suit was filed ceased until the district court entered judgment declaring that version of the code unconstitutional.
what was true during the litigation below remains true on appeal.the requirement subsists through all stages of federal proceedings,trial and appellate.lewis cont l bank,d.another way to state the justiciability principles set forth above is that article iii denies federal courts the power to decide questions that can not affect the rights of the litigants in the case before them.id.if we were convinced by helander that the district court erred in concluding that the code was constitutionally infirm,what relief could we afford the defendants it is not as though we could order future elections to be carried out according to procedures the illinois general assembly amended in july.similarly,what benefit would zessar gain by prevailing on his argument that the district court was correct the parties rights and obligations remain governed by the code regardless of our opinion about the constitutionality of provisions that ceased to have effect more than two years ago.
there is an exception to the rule that legislative correction of a challenged statute moots a challenge to the statute as it stood prior to amendment.amendment or repeal of a challenged statute does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice unless it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.buckhannon bd.and care home.dep t of health and human,d quoting friends of earth,laidlaw envtl.serv.toc,d.in other words,when an intervening amendment provides no assurance that the conduct will cease,the case is not moot.rembert,at.usually,however,legislative action will provide the assurance required by buckhannon,because when the defendants are public officials we place greater stock in their acts of,so long as they appear genuine.right to life,schober,cir.
zessar argues that his challenge to the election code is not moot because there is no assurance that illinois will not reenact that version of the code,and because the new provisions retain some of the previous infirmities.however,this case presents neither of the features that normally lead courts to discount the genuineness of an amendment,namely the enactment,or intended enactment,of the same statute,or a statute substantially similar to the one challenged.see.chapter of the contractors of am.city of jacksonville,d concluding that the plaintiffs challenge was not moot because the challenged statute was amended in insignificant ways and still disadvantaged the plaintiffs city of mesquite aladdin castle,d noting that at oral argument the defendant announced its intention to reenact the challenged provision if the district court decision was vacated.there is no evidence in the record that the defendants are lying in wait for vacatur of the district court judgment so that they can reenact the election code as it stood prior to july.
moreover,the amended code is not substantially similar to the challenged provisions of the code.the practice challenged by zessar was the rejection of absentee ballots without notice and a hearing at which voters could challenge that rejection.that practice is remedied under the new version of the code.zessar may disagree with the extent and sufficiency of the remedy,but the district court concluded that there was no ripe basis for challenging the new version of the code,and zessar did not appeal that decision.because the code is not substantially similar to the provisions zessar challenged in bringing suit,and there is no indication that the defendants plan to reenact the code as it stood prior to amendment,zessar argument that his challenge to the code remains live fails.see fed of adver.indus.representatives,at noting that repeal of a contested ordinance moots a plaintiff injunction request,absent evidence that the defendant plans to or already has reenacted the challenged law or one substantially similar.
we are cognizant of the resources that were invested,both by the district court and the parties,in litigating and ruling on zessar challenge to the election code.those efforts,however,can not maintain the challenge as a live controversy where it involves a statute no longer in existence and with no indication that the challenged practice will continue.we conclude that zessar challenge to the election code is moot.the district court final judgment should be vacated to the extent that it passes judgment on the election code,and that portion of the case below should be dismissed as moot.miller benson,cir citing united states munsingwear.
