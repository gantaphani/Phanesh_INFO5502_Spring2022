background 
the political history of the relationship between the virgin islands and the united states was thoroughly discussed by judge moore in his memorandum of october,it will not be reiterated here.see ballentine united states,no,wl,at.the facts underlying this case are clear and not in dispute.plaintiff pro se krim ballentine was born in louis,missouri on october.after working for a number of years as a deputy united states marshal in the continental united states,ballentine was transferred in to the virgin islands,where he has remained ever since.
ballentine brought the present action on july,claiming that he has been denied his constitutional right to vote in presidential elections,and his right to be represented in congress by a regular voting member,because of his status as a united states citizen residing in an unincorporated territory of the united states.ballentine asks the court to strike down as unconstitutional the revised organic act of,wherein congress designated the virgin islands as an unincorporated territory pursuant to its power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory under the territory clause,const.art.iv,cl.he further asks the court to declare that congress territory clause power does not include the authority to grant citizenship to persons born in the virgin islands after it became a united states possession,and that such persons instead are citizens by direct operation of the constitution.the present motion to dismiss followed soon thereafter.
standards of review 
federal rule of civil procedure b provides that a party may bring a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see.b.a motion to dismiss for want of standing is also properly brought pursuant to rule b,because standing is a jurisdictional matter.see.john hotel tourism ass gov t of the virgin islands,cir the issue of standing is jurisdictional.kauffman dreyfus fund,cir w e must not confuse requirements necessary to state a cause of action with the prerequisites of standing.
pursuant to rule b,the court must accept as true all material allegations set forth in the complaint,and must construe those facts in favor of the nonmoving party.see warth seldin,d storino borough of point pleasant beach,cir.on a motion to dismiss for lack of standing,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the elements of standing,and each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.focus allegheny county court of common pleas,cir quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.however,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice.lujan,at.

discussion 
united states citizens residing in the virgin islands have no constitutional right to vote in presidential elections 
defendant first moves to dismiss ballentine claim that he is entitled under the constitution to vote in presidential elections a right,he argues,has been unconstitutionally denied because of his residency in an unincorporated territory.this claim must fail.
the constitution does not grant the right to vote for president and vice president to individual citizens,but to electors appointed by e ach state.const.art.ii,see also const.amend.xii.those electors,in turn,are selected in such manner as the legislature of each state may direct.const.art.ii.that manner need not be by popular vote.indeed,in the country early years,the legislatures of several states selected their electors directly.see bush gore,d citing mcpherson blacker.nonetheless,h istory has now favored the voter,and in each of the several states the citizens themselves vote for presidential electors.id.
the virgin islands is not a state but,as ballentine acknowledges,an unincorporated territory of the united states.see,bluebeard castle,gov t of the virgin islands,cir.as such,it is not entitled to appoint electors.it is also established that citizens choosing to reside within its borders
