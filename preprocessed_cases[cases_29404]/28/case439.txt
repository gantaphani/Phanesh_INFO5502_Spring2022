florida right to life committee,frl appeals from the district court final judgment upholding,florida statutes,a campaign finance provision that precludes political candidates from making financial contributions to certain organizations.the district court ruled that the provision was constitutional on its face under the first and fourteenth amendments because of its susceptibility to a narrowing construction.we reverse.
background 
frl is a florida corporation that has as its primary purpose the dissemination of information concerning fetal development,abortion,alternatives to abortion,euthanasia,and infanticide.to raise funds for its endeavors,frl desired to obtain contributions from candidates for public office in florida.candidates,however,refrained from contributing because of concern over the application of,florida statutes,which provides in part that c andidates may not make contributions to any religious,charitable,civic,or other causes or organizations established primarily for the public good.
this and other problems experienced under state campaign finance laws,chapter,florida statutes,led frl to bring this action.frl facially challenged and several additional florida campaign finance provisions as violative of its first and fourteenth amendment rights of expression and association.frl named as defendants the florida secretary of state,the members of the florida elections commission,and the state attorneys for all twenty of florida judicial circuits collectively florida,all of whom frl sued in their official capacities.
after commencing this suit,frl moved for partial summary judgment.the district court granted frl motion as to some of florida campaign finance provisions the district court,however,denied frl motion as to the ban on contributions from candidates under because the court ruled that the provision was susceptible to a narrowing construction.following a bench trial on other issues not raised here,the district court upheld as constitutional p ursuant to the reasoning set forth in its summary judgment order.upon entry of final judgment,frl timely commenced this appeal to challenge the district court ruling with regard to.
ii.discussion 
justiciability 
prior to determining the constitutionality of,florida statutes,we must address threshold justiciability issues.article iii of the united states constitution fundamentally limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to actual cases and controversies.const.art.iii,cl.georgia state conf.of naacp branches cox,cir.before rendering a decision every federal court operates under an independent obligation to ensure it is presented with the kind of concrete controversy upon which its constitutional grant of authority is based hallandale prof l fire fighters local city of hallandale,cir.to ensure that such a concrete controversy exists in the present case,we must discuss whether threshold standing and ripeness requirements have been met.
perhaps the most important of the article iii doctrines grounded in the requirement is that of standing.wooden bd.of regents of the.of,cir.to prove standing,a plaintiff must show that he has suffered an actual or threatened injury,that the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant,and that the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable ruling.harris evans,cir en banc.
on appeal,florida argues that frl has not proven an actual or threatened injury with regard to.florida contends that forbids candidates from making contributions to organizations like frl,but it does not forbid the organizations themselves from soliciting or receiving such contributions.florida concludes that because places prohibitions on the conduct of candidates,not the organizations,the provision only affects the rights of candidates.therefore,in florida view,frl can not challenge unless it meets the strict requirements for standing,a doctrine that in rare circumstances allows a party to premise its claim for relief on the constitutional rights of another party.edmonson leesville concrete,d.
we disagree.standing is unnecessary here because frl premises its suit on the violation of its own constitutional rights caused by.that is,frl bases its constitutional claims on the infringement of its own rights to expression and association under the first and fourteenth amendments,not on the separate and distinct constitutional rights of political candidates thus,florida argument based on standing is misplaced.
furthermore,frl has demonstrated that it is suffering actual injury caused by.the record contains a letter sent to frl by katherine harris,a candidate for secretary of state of florida at the time in which she explains that she desires to contribute to frl but has refrained because of.this letter shows that frl is losing donations because of the provision and thus is suffering an economic injury.this injury,in turn,will be redressed if is held facially unconstitutional because candidates will no longer fear prosecution and will proceed with their donations.accordingly,frl has overcome the standing hurdle.
in contrast to the doctrine of standing,the doctrine of ripeness has as its primary rationale the avoidance of premature adjudication.abbott labs.gardner,d.the test for ripeness has two components,the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.id.at.at.in first amendment cases,this test is less exacting.digital,city of plantation,cir.
despite the low threshold for proving ripeness in the first amendment context,florida argues that frl claim is not ripe for two reasons.first,florida asserts that frl contention that candidates would make contributions to the organization absent is too speculative.second,florida asserts that because frl conduct is not directly regulated by,frl does not face enforcement action if it chooses to solicit or receive candidate contributions.it follows,according to florida reasoning,that frl will not suffer any hardship if we withhold judicial consideration from its claim.
we disagree with florida crabbed ripeness analysis.frl assertion that candidates would make contributions absent is not speculative because the record substantiates it.as we have explained,the record contains a letter sent to frl from candidate katherine harris in which she states that she desires to contribute to frl but has chosen against it because of.there is no speculation here because the letter establishes that florida electoral candidates would contribute to frl absent the prohibition indeed,the letter shows that frl is suffering actual hardship in the form of economic loss resulting from foregone candidate contributions.
moreover,it is far from obvious whether frl can solicit and receive candidate contributions prohibited under without itself facing the hardship of criminal and civil penalties.the language found in a,which details the penalties for campaign law violations,is unclear on this point in any event,florida focus on whether directly regulates frl is beside the point.frl suffers an immediate injury because,as the harris letter demonstrates,has led candidates to refrain from contributing to frl out of fear of prosecution.this fear has credence because the florida election commission has taken action against several candidates for making donations.see burke,fec waters,fec.thus,irrespective of whether directly regulates frl,the record indicates that frl suffers economic hardship because of the provision.frl has established that its claim is ripe,and its substantive challenge can proceed.
contributions by candidates under 
frl challenges,florida statutes,as facially unconstitutional under the first and fourteenth amendments.frl argues that should be interpreted as precluding political candidates from making any donations to organizations out of personal or campaign funds,save for in the three particular circumstances enunciated in the provision.consequently,frl contends that the district court erred in holding that can be narrowly construed to avoid constitutional difficulties by applying the provision only to candidate contributions made in exchange for political support.extrapolating from the district court construction,florida argues that should be narrowly construed as prohibiting candidates from using funds from their campaign account for personal purposes,as in making personal donations to a charity or other organization.we agree with frl interpretation of because it best accords with the plain language of that provision.
the plain language of 
we review de novo a district court interpretation of a statute.adams florida power,cir.moreover,it is axiomatic that in interpreting a statute,a court must begin with the plain language of the statute.united states prather,cir.accordingly,we turn first to the precise wording of,which states in relevant part that c andidates may not make contributions to any religious,charitable,civic or other causes or organizations established primarily for the public good.in turn,delineates three distinct exceptions to this blanket rule.first,it is not a violation to make gifts of money in lieu of flowers in memory of a deceased person.second,a candidate may continue membership in,or make regular donations from personal or business funds to,religious,political party,civic,or charitable groups of which the candidate is a member or to which the candidate has been a regular donor for more than months.third,a candidate may purchase with campaign funds,tickets,admission to events,or advertisements from religious,civic,political party,or charitable groups.
our reading of the plain language of leads us to conclude that the provision creates a general rule forbidding political candidates from making any donations out of personal or campaign funds to the organizations referenced therein.this blanket restriction on donations is then diluted somewhat by the three distinct exceptions.a wide range of donative options,however,remain forbidden to candidates.section precludes a candidate from placing money in a church offering plate when she visits for the first time.it precludes a candidate from contributing to a charity she has just discovered.indeed,it precludes a candidate from almost all spontaneous acts of charitable giving.thus,sweeps broadly to curtail the donative impulses of candidates and,conversely,to curtail the ability of many organizations to solicit and receive candidate donations.as such,the provision is on a collision course with the first amendment.
the district court narrowing construction of 
to avoid this collision with first amendment values,the district court narrowly construed and thus rejected frl facial challenge to the provision.we will uphold a state statute against a facial challenge if the statute is readily susceptible to a narrowing construction that avoids constitutional infirmities dimmitt city of clearwater,cir.we will not,however,rewrite the clear terms of a statute in order to reject a facial challenge,and,as a federal court,we must be particularly reluctant to rewrite the terms of a state statute.id.mindful of these interpretive principles,we turn to the narrowing construction imposed by the district court upon.
in ruling that passed constitutional muster,the district court incorporated the reasoning contained in its prior order regarding frl motion for partial summary judgment.in that order,the district court had concluded that contribution in is subject to the definition of that term contained in a.section a defines contributions as gifts and other distributions made for the purpose of influencing the results of an election.having determined that can be read in pari materia with a,the district court had held in its prior order that the provision is readily susceptible to a narrowing construction that limits its reach to a contribution made in exchange for political support.based on its prior interpretation of,the court ruled that the provision was constitutional.in contrast,we conclude that the plain language of will not bear the district court narrowing construction 
because the district court relied on the definition of contribution contained in a to conclude that was susceptible to a narrowing construction,we must address the applicability of the former to the latter provision.section a limits the meaning of contribution to gifts made in order to influence election results,but also states that the definitions provided therein apply to chapter unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.we decide that context clearly does indicate that the definition of contribution provided in a can not be applied to the use of that term in without effectively rewriting the latter provision.
we turn first to the interpretive canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius under which the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of another.federal reserve bank of atlanta thomas,cir.under this canon,the three exceptions expressed in for certain gifts of money and donations made by candidates imply the exclusion of other possible types of donations from that list of exceptions.yet,if the definition of contribution contained in a applies to,the latter provision necessarily would contain a blanket exception for all donations that are made for altruistic purposes rather than for the purpose of influencing election results.such a blanket exception would fly in the face of the three explicit exceptions articulated in,which under the expressio unius canon imply the exclusion of all other possible exceptions.
it is also telling that the florida legislature chose the terms gifts of money and donations in articulating the three exceptions to.if the general rule under is that candidates can not make contributions to certain organizations for the purpose of influencing election results,there would be no need to refer generally to gifts of money and donations in the exceptions to that rule.that is,if the definition of contribution in itself does not encompass ordinary gifts of money and donations,it would have been unnecessary to articulate exceptions for types of contributions that already are exempted in the first instance as a matter of definition.otherwise the three exceptions listed in would be entirely superfluous,and we look askance at interpretations that render statutory language devoid of purpose and effect.in re griffith,cir.
conversely,if we read the a definition of contribution in pari materia with but interpret the three exceptions of so as not to render them superfluous,we end up with a worse result still.if contribution in only refers to candidate donations that are meant to influence election results,then,to avoid the superfluousness concern,we would have to construe the three exceptions as carving out a set of transfers in which a candidate can make donations aimed at influencing election results.that is,we would have to construe the three exceptions as creating a safe harbor for certain types of donations made to influence election outcomes.for instance,we would have to read the exceptions as allowing donations made to influence election results if the donations were made to organizations in which the candidate was a member or donor.
such a reading of the three exceptions,however,makes little sense.if florida has an interest in precluding candidates from making donations to influence election results,it would be illogical for the state to exempt donations made for such a purpose just because,for example,the candidate made the donation to an organization in which he is a member.we refuse to interpret in this manner when we can avoid this absurd result by concluding that the definition of contribution contained in a does not apply.see united states,cir noting that a statute should be construed in a manner that avoids an absurd result.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the meaning of contribution in can not be narrowly construed as limited to the definition of that term found in a to do so would rewrite the clear terms of.dimmitt,at.we instead interpret contribute more generally as meaning to give or to donate.see the random house dictionary ed.defining contribute as to give to a common supply,fund,as for charitable purposes.because the district court premised its interpretation on the definition of contribution found in a,we conclude that the court er
