introduction 
this is an appeal from the trial court denial of a petition for writ of mandate seeking to prevent the city and county of san francisco city from diverting tobacco settlement revenues away from the project to replace laguna honda hospital and to require the city to maintain laguna honda as a skilled nursing facility.we affirm.
factual background and procedural history 
laguna honda hospital,founded in,has long been a fixture in the city and county of san francisco the city,providing continuing care services to the city elderly and chronically disabled population without regard to ability to pay.as of,the city operated laguna honda as a skilled nursing facility.by the late,its physical condition was seriously deteriorating,it suffered damage from the earthquake,and its structure was,leaving it at risk to lose federal funding that was critical to its survival.also,in,the city settled litigation it had brought against the tobacco industry.as of,the city was projecting that it would receive more than million in settlement payments over the next years.the proceeds of this settlement gave the city a unique opportunity to address the serious problems at laguna honda.
in november,the voters of the city approved proposition a,a ballot measure authorizing the city to incur million in debt for a health care facility to replace laguna honda hospital,and dedicating certain revenues derived from the settlement with the tobacco industry to help pay for the replacement facility.after passage of proposition a,the city began planning the project.in february,the city authorized sale of bonds pursuant to proposition a.in october,the city received construction bids for the project as originally contemplated that significantly exceeded the project budget.also in october,in response to the escalating cost of the project,the city adopted an ordinance allowing it to negotiate with bidders to try to reduce the project costs.the project was then.
during this same time period,the city was experiencing a severe economic downturn.in fiscal year,the city faced an unprecedented budget deficit.the tobacco settlement,however,was a fiscal bright spot.as of june,projections indicated that the city would receive million more over years than projected at the time proposition a was placed on the ballot.by the beginning of fiscal year,including interest that would be earned during the coming fiscal year,that unexpected windfall already equaled million.on july,still before any bonds were authorized or issued pursuant to proposition a,the city enacted an ordinance authorizing the transfer of million of tobacco settlement payments from the tobacco settlement revenue to its general fund.
petitioner,a resident of the city,brought this writ of mandate action in november in the san francisco superior court seeking an order that the city a return the million and not divert any tobacco settlement funds away from the laguna honda project and b maintain laguna honda as a skilled nursing facility with at least inpatient beds unless the city could satisfy certain conditions.on april,the superior court,having heard oral argument,entered judgment on its order denying the writ of mandate,from which this appeal is taken.
because this case turns on application of settled principles of statutory interpretation as applied to the proposition a bond measure,and not on disputed issues of fact,our review is de novo.in reviewing a trial court judgment on a petition for writ of ordinary mandate,the appellate court applies the substantial evidence test to the trial court factual findings,but exercises its independent judgment on legal issues,such as the interpretation of statutes.abbate county of santa clara th,d.
in associated students of north peralta community college board of trustees d.associated students,division one of this court reviewed the law governing interpretation of bond measures.in that case,as in the second issue addressed here,the petitioner appealed from the superior court denial of a petition for writ of mandate seeking to constrain the public entity use of bond proceeds.id.at.we noted that the relationship between the public entity and its electors had been characterized variously as either contractual or as analogous to contract,but that under either characterization the same elements comprise what we referred to as the contract between the entity and its electors.id.at.the four primary elements from which to derive the terms of the contract are the statutes creating the bonding entity and authorizing bonded indebtedness t he resolution by which the bonding entity resolves to submit the issue to its electors the ballot proposition submitted to the voters and the voters assent or ratification.id.at.extrinsic documents may be added to the primary elements,but courts have generally looked to such extrinsic aids only where the extrinsic documents were themselves specifically referred to in one of the primary documents.id.at.flood control dist.wright cal,the proposition referred to the report of the chief engineer,which was distributed to voters robbins sonoma county flood.dist.d,the ballot question referred to the project as being more particularly described in an extrinsic document.
transfer of tobacco settlement money to the general fund 
petitioner argues that proposition a requires the city to apply all money received from the tobacco settlement to the laguna honda project with the exception of the first million annually that is set aside for tobacco education and that,therefore,the city was not permitted to allocate the million to the general fund.petitioner contends that certain language in the voter pamphlet summary of proposition a should control over conflicting language in the ordinance by which proposition a was placed on the ballot.this argument fails for several reasons.
the primary contract documents are unambiguous.the bond ordinance,which was included in the voter information pamphlet distributed to voters prior to the election,in its title,provid es for the use of available tobacco settlement revenues and,in section,requires that t he first of available tobacco settlement revenues must be used for the laguna honda project.italics added.section of the ordinance,f or purpose of this ordinance and the proposition to be voted upon,defines a vailable tobacco settlement revenues to mean the total payments the city and county receives under the master settlement agreement the agreement over the term of any lease financing,bonded debt other evidences of indebtedness authorized hereby that the city and county may use for the project under applicable law,less of the amount the city and county receives each year under the agreement during the term of any obligations authorized hereby,which amount the city and county will use for tobacco education,prevention and control purposes.italics added.it follows that the ordinance only committed funds received once the bonds were,once the term of the bonds had commenced.because funds received before any bonds issued,including the million at issue in this action,are not received during the term of the bonds,they are not available within the meaning of the ordinance and,therefore,are not pledged to the project.
the same distinction is carried through the other relevant primary element of the bond contract the ballot proposition submitted to the voters.it stated shall the city and county incur bonded debt and reduce the property tax impact by requiring the application of available tobacco settlement revenues to finance the project.italics added.again,the proposition specifically uses the same defined term as the ordinance the use of the adjective available to modify tobacco settlement revenues clearly indicates that some subset of all such revenues is intended,and the page reference to the full text of the ordinance appears at the bottom of the page of course,we must assume that the voters considered the text and thereby familiarized themselves with any omitted subsidiary matter.horneff city county of san francisco th,d.
against all this,petitioner points to the digest by the city ballot simplification committee bsc,which was also included on the first page of the section of the voter information pamphlet devoted to proposition a and which stated,proposition a also provides that all tobacco settlement monies received by the city,after million is set aside each year for smoking education and prevention programs,would be used to pay for the project.italics added.petitioner argues that the use of the word all in this sentence creates an ambiguity that requires the court to interpret the voters intent to require the city to disregard the plain language of the ordinance.petitioner argument on this point also fails for several reasons.
first,following the associated students case,the digest is not the sort of extrinsic document that a court would look to in determining the terms of the contract between the city and the voters.none of the primary documents referred to the digest or suggested to the voters that they should rely on the digest to add detail to the ordinance or the proposition language.nor is that the function of the bsc.in fact,the reverse is true.
two opinions of division one of this court have thoughtfully explained the purpose and function of the bsc.horneff city county of san francisco,supra th,d brennan board of supervisors d.each of these cases involved a preelection challenge asking the superior court to change allegedly inaccurate or incomplete language in the digest the bsc exists pursuant to the city municipal elections code mec as a body of communications and language professionals mec,charged with preparing a summary of no more than words with an level of readability mec,subds.b c.the bsc has no legislative,administrative,or judicial the ministerial duty of preparing a brief,simple summary brennan board of supervisors,supra,d at.its digest is but a simplified summary of the measure,and is not intended to provide a complete catalogue or index of every detail.horneff city county of san francisco,supra,th at,d.neither the mec nor any other source of law gives the bsc the power to alter,amend,or interpret any ordinance,let alone a bond ordinance.
nor is the bsc charged with implementing or administering this or any other ordinance,so its summary can not be entitled to the deference usually given to an interpretation of an ordinance by a body that does have such responsibility.that deference is typically reserved for an agency charged with its enforcement and interpretation.see international business machines state bd.of equalization cal d.it follows that the digest has no independent force of law and should not be treated as an element of the bond contract under the principles of associated students.the lesson of horneff and brennan is that the bsc has significant leeway in deciding what to include in its summary and that the summary need not address auxiliary or subsidiary provisions or be complete so long as it is not misleading.that very leeway makes the bsc digest a less than reliable guide to the courts in deciding what restrictions are placed on the city by the ordinance lawyerly definitional language that is not addressed in the digest.
second,under ordinary rules of statutory interpretation,a court would not look to an extrinsic document for help interpreting an ordinance that is clear on its face.this is the rule of legislature eu cal d,on which petitioner would rely instead,a court looks to indicia of voters intent other than the language of the provision itself only to help resolve ambiguities in the provision itself.ibid.courts may look to extrinsic sources to construe a statute only when the statutory language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation.pacific gas electric public utilities com.th,d.w hen statutory language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,and courts should not indulge in it,quoting solberg superior court cal d.no principle of statutory construction allows petitioner circular extrinsic evidence of voters intent to create an ambiguity,using that ambiguity to allow consideration of extrinsic evidence,and then using the original extrinsic evidence to construe an ambiguity it created itself.where the statute is clear,courts will not interpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.citation.hartford fire ins.macri cal th,d.
third,we reject petitioner argument that the digest language should override the ordinance language in order to avoid subjecting the voters to a bait and switch.this argument sells the voters short by ignoring the presumption that they are familiar with the language of the ordinance,have duly considered it,and have voted intelligently.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization,supra,cal d.the argument also presumes an intent to mislead or advocate that is wholly unsupported by the record and inconsistent with the charter of the bsc.the bsc is set up simply to write a neutral summary.it does not exist to promote the legislation that it summarizes.of course,if petitioner believed that the digest was inaccurate or misleading,he had the right to follow the procedure employed in the brennan and horneff cases to seek correction.indeed,t he purpose of elections code section is to establish a preelection procedure for the timely correction of election materials.horneff city county of san francisco,supra,th at,d.the overriding principle in this case is that extrinsic documents and statements disseminated to the voters can not be allowed to alter the meaning of the unambiguous primary elements of the bond contract without destroying certainty and promoting endless litigation over bond measures.
petitioner argument echoes the public policy argument addressed in associated students.there,having concluded that the evidence did not support an intent to mislead,the court went on to observe that if whenever a group of voters considered that their electoral will had been frustrated,they could argue for implementation of their understanding of the sense of official assurances,preelection statements,publicity and unofficial discussions,an intolerable number of disputes would result.associated students,supra,d at.to the extent any individual voter may have read the digest to mean something different than the ordinance it summarized,that is unfortunate,but it can not alter the plain meaning of the ordinance.
ii.characteristics of replacement project 
petitioner,fearing that the city intends to build a significantly smaller and different new facility also argues that proposition a requires the city to replace laguna honda with another skilled nursing facility and that the city has no discretion to alter these characteristics of the replacement project,at least without satisfying certain evidentiary prerequisites this argument fails for many of the same reasons explained above.
we start again with the language of the primary elements of the contract.the ordinance title states that the bonds will be issued for the acquisition,improvement,construction reconstruction of a health care,assisted living other type of continuing care facility or facilities to replace laguna honda hospital.section of the ordinance authorizes the city to incur debt for the project,and section defines the project to include,without limitation,all works necessary or convenient for the acquisition,improvement,construction reconstruction of a new health care,assisted living other type of continuing care facility or facilities to replace laguna honda hospital.the ballot proposition itself uses the same broad language,stating that the debt will be incurred for the acquisition,improvement,construction reconstruction of a new health care,assisted living other type of continuing care facility or facilities to replace laguna honda hospital.
this language is intentionally broad and.it is drafted to leave the city significant flexibility in designing the replacement facility.there is nothing improper in providing for such flexibility.t he rule is that public bodies may submit bond propositions in broad and general terms.such a body may make its order of submission just as broad,and just as narrow,or just as specific as it is willing to be bound by.sacramento dist.all parties
