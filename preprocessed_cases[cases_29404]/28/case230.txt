the supreme court held in republican party of minnesota white,d white i,that elected judges,and candidates for judicial office,have a right under the first amendment to declare their legal views to the electorate during their campaigns.the decision left open myriad questions of implementation,and litigation has ensued across the country in those states that give the voters some say in choosing judges either through direct election or by retention votes on judges who came to office by appointment.recently we held that wisconsin violated the constitution by forbidding judges to be members of political parties,but that rules restricting partisan activities such as endorsing a candidate for office,and personal solicitation of funds,are valid.siefert alexander,cir.today appeal concerns provisions of indiana code of judicial conduct.some judges in indiana are appointed by the governor but must run in retention elections.others are directly elected.article vii of indiana constitution provides the details.
indiana right to life,sends questionnaires to candidates for election or retention,asking recipients to state,among other things,whether they agree with roe wade,d,which held many forms of abortion legislation unconstitutional,and whether they subscribe to propositions such as i believe that the unborn child is biologically human and alive and that the right to life of human beings should be respected at every stage of their biological development.the district court opinion includes excerpts that convey the gist of all nine questions.most recipients have either ignored this questionnaire or told indiana right to life that they fear giving answers could jeopardize their judicial careers because of provisions in the state code of judicial conduct.
indiana right to life filed suit seeking to have these provisions held invalid,but its suit was dismissed for want of standing,because no person actually or potentially covered by the code was a plaintiff.indiana right to life,shepard,cir.indiana right to life then recruited a candidate for judicial office torrey bauer and a sitting judge david certo as plaintiffs to join it in this new suit.the candidate and the judge both say that they refrain from speaking about abortion,and other controversial topics,because they fear the prospect of sanctions under the code.bauer answered the group questionnaire but says that he will keep silent in the future because of the risk this would pose to his judicial career should he be elected.he expresses concern that his answers may come back to haunt him should he be elected.certo has not answered the group questionnaire in any year.he,too,says that the code has led to silence.
while this suit was pending in the district court,indiana substantially amended its code of judicial conduct,in light of changes to a model code published by the american bar association.the revised code,which took effect on january,is the focus of this appeal though plaintiffs also want an injunction against one provision that has been removed from the code but was in force when bauer answered the questionnaire.
plaintiffs challenge four provisions or associated groups of provisions in the current code and one provision in the version applicable to.the first comprises rules b and a,which forbid judges and candidates in judicial elections to make commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of judicial office.the parties call these rules the commits clauses.canon d of the older code covered similar ground but was broader it is the provision relevant to bauer answers.the second is rule a,which requires recusal when a judge impartiality might reasonably be questioned.this the parties call the recusal clause.plaintiffs direct special fire at subsection a,which requires recusal if the judge has made a public statement that commits or appears to commit the judge to reach a particular result or rule in a particular way in the proceeding or controversy.this specifies a concrete consequence of violating the commits clauses.the third group comprises rule a and,which limits the political activities of indiana judges the parties call these the clauses,and the fourth comprises limits on fundraising set out in rule a and the solicitation clauses.
defendants are the members of two bodies the indiana commission on judicial qualifications and the indiana disciplinary commission.some of the defendants are judges randall shepard,the lead defendant,is the state chief justice,but they are sued in their capacity as members of these commissions rather than as judges.the commission on judicial qualifications receives and investigates complaints against judges and candidates for judicial office.it has some enforcement power over minor offenses and can issue public admonitions if the subject agrees but only the state supreme court can remove a judge from office or impose substantial discipline,and only a judicial body such as a court of appeals can remove a judge from a particular case under the recusal clause.as a practical matter,an injunction forbidding the commission to bring any supposed violation of the contested clauses to the attention of the state supreme court would give plaintiffs the relief they want.the indiana disciplinary commission investigates and prosecutes cases of misconduct by attorneys again only the state judiciary can take any significant disciplinary action.we do not refer to the disciplinary commission again every reference to the commission is to the indiana commission on judicial qualifications.
the district court deemed moot bauer challenge to the pre version of the code.the court concluded that plaintiffs have standing to challenge the version now in force and held that all of the contested provisions are constitutional.d.
defendants contend that plaintiffs lack standing to sue.standing exists when the plaintiff suffers an actual or impending injury,no matter how small the injury is caused by the defendant acts and a judicial decision in the plaintiff favor would redress the injury.see,summers earth island institute,d steel citizens for a better environment,d.bauer and certo have not been injured yet,but the existence of a statute implies a threat to prosecute,so challenges are proper,because a probability of future injury counts as injury for the purpose of standing.see abbott laboratories gardner,d pierce society of sisters.brandt winnetka,cir south michigan avenue associates,devine,cir.we held in buckley illinois judicial inquiry board,cir,another suit by a judge who disagreed with a state limits on campaign speech,that standing had been established.this case is not materially different.because bauer and certo have standing,it is unnecessary to decide whether indiana right to life independently has standing.
the district court thought that bauer challenge to the pre code became moot when the code was amended.to say that a claim is moot is to say that it is too late for the judiciary to affect anyone entitlements.with respect to bauer claim,however,the suit is too early rather than too late.it is unripe,not moot.
if bauer should be elected in or later,the commission might open a proceeding based on his answers in,and the indiana supreme court might remove him from office or discipline him in some other fashion.the amendment of the code in does not eliminate the possibility of prosecuting and punishing earlier violations.nor does the preliminary injunction preventing implementation of former canon d,which was in force when bauer answered the questionnaire but has since been vacated.an expired or vacated injunction does not prevent a unit of government from punishing conduct,committed before the vacatur,that violates its laws.see crane indiana high school athletic association,cir hoskins lumber united states.hampton tree farms,yeutter,cir o nce an injunction in a civil case has been invalidated,rights granted under the injunction no longer exist and can not be enforced.so the dispute is not moot.
but before bauer can face any consequence for his answers in,a series of events must happen a he must be elected to the state judiciary b the commission must decide to prosecute,even though an injunction was outstanding when bauer gave his answers,and even though the commission has never prosecuted any judge who answered the questionnaire as about judges or candidates did in full in about more answered some questions and c the supreme court of indiana must impose discipline.that too many unlikely steps to justify constitutional adjudication.see medimmune,genentech,d brandt winnetka and lawson hill,cir.
because canon d is no longer in force,neither bauer nor anyone else can be chilled by the risk of future punishment.when deciding what to say or avoid today,any judge or judicial candidate looks to the current code,not to provisions that were abrogated at the end of.there is accordingly no need for prospective relief concerning pre rules.if the commission ever hales bauer or anyone else before the supreme court of indiana on a charge of violating the former canon d,a defense based on the first amendment can be raised and adjudicated in the regular course.
siefert disposes of one set of issues in this appeal and strongly influences another.we start with the fundraising question.
rule a of indiana code of judicial conduct provides 
except as permitted by law,or by rules b,c,and,a judge or a judicial candidate shall not 
solicit funds for,pay an assessment to,or make a contribution to a political organization or a candidate for public office 
personally solicit or accept campaign contributions other than through a campaign committee authorized by rule 
the asterisks,which are part of the code,denote defined terms.the definitions say that law includes constitutions,statutes,rules,and decisional law that contribution include both financial and support which,if obtained by the recipient otherwise,would require a financial expenditure and that personally solicit means a direct request made by a judge or a judicial candidate for financial support or services,whether made by letter,telephone,or any other means of communication.
siefert dealt with this provision of wisconsin rules 
a judge,candidate for judicial office,or shall not personally solicit or accept campaign contributions.a candidate may,however,establish a committee to solicit and accept lawful campaign contributions.the committee is not prohibited from soliciting and accepting lawful campaign contributions from lawyers.a judge or candidate for judicial office or may serve on the committee but should avoid direct involvement with the committee fundraising efforts.a judge or candidate for judicial office or may appear at his or her own fundraising events.when the committee solicits or accepts a contribution,a judge or candidate for judicial office should also be mindful of the requirements of scr and.
wisconsin supreme court rule.the language we have quoted is from the version effective when siefert was decided rule has since been amended slightly.the court held that this rule is consistent with the constitution.we invited the parties to file supplemental memoranda discussing siefert effect on this litigation.indiana contends that its solicitation rules match wisconsin in all material respects and that siefert therefore controls.plaintiffs acknowledge that the rules are fundamentally the same but contend that the parties situations differ judge certo wants to raise money from family members and former classmates at college and law school,as well as the general public and lawyers at large.
for the purpose of a rule such as this,the fact that the judge went to law school at the same time as a potential donor can not make a difference.the potential for actual or perceived mutual back scratching,or for retaliation against attorneys who decline to donate,discussed in siefert,is the same whether or not the judge knows the potential donor first name.asking family members for support poses less of this risk unless the judge plans to ask distant as well as immediate relatives.laws need not contain exceptions for every possible situation in which the reasons for their enactment are not present.it is the nature of rules to be broader than necessary in some respects.siefert shows that indiana rules are not facially unconstitutional.indiana may well be willing to make exceptions for close relatives recall that rule a begins e xcept as permitted by law and defines law to include both regulations and decisional law.rule a already contains one exception for solicitations from a judge family.a federal court should not assume that a state will act unreasonably.judge certo should follow indiana procedures for obtaining advice with respect to contributions from family members.
a month after we released our opinion in siefert,the sixth circuit concluded that a rule is unconstitutional.carey wolnitzek,cir.the panel in carey did not question the propriety of limits on solicitation,where the possibility of reward or retaliation is greatest,but concluded that kentucky rule is substantially overbroad because it covers solicitation by mass mailing.a letter with the judge signature is not materially different from a letter with a campaign committee imprimatur,the court concluded.certo has not made anything of the fact that the definition of personally solicit in indiana code includes letters,so it is unnecessary to address the distinction drawn in carey between and written solicitations.a conflict among the circuits preceded siefert.compare republican party of minnesota white,cir en banc white ii holding solicitation rules unconstitutional,and weaver bonner,cir same,with stretton disciplinary board,cir holding valid a rule similar to indiana.nothing we can do here could create harmony among the circuits,so there is no reason to depart from the approach taken so recently in this circuit.
siefert also affects analysis of the rules,subsections and of rule a.we repeat the introductory clause to provide context 
except as permitted by law,or by rules b,c,and,a judge or a judicial candidate shall not 
act as a leader in or hold an office in a political organization 
make speeches on behalf of a political organization 
publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for any public office 
siefert held that wisconsin equivalent of rule a is constitutional.our plaintiffs do not challenge that subsection,but they do challenge subsections and.plaintiff certo contends that he wants to serve as a delegate at the indiana state republican convention,speak at political clubs on behalf of persons running for judicial office as republicans,speak to students on behalf of the republican party in general,and encourage the public at large to donate money to the republican party.the republican party is a political organization,which the code defines as a political party or other group sponsored by or affiliated with a political party or candidate,the principal purpose of which is to further the election or appointment of candidates for political office.
although siefert did not address limits on leadership roles in political parties or making speeches on behalf of political organizations,the way in which it analyzed public endorsements see at establishes that subsections a and are valid.white i permits a candidate for judicial office or retention in office to speak freely in support of his own election siefert concluded that this does not allow a judge to use the prestige of the office to assist other persons.that kind of electoral activity on behalf of third parties is covered,we held,by the balancing approach that pickering board of education,d,adopts for speech by public employees and by two of pickering sequels,civil service commission letter carriers,d,and broadrick oklahoma,d,which hold that the hatch act,and comparable state laws are compatible with the first amendment.
the hatch act and similar state laws limit the ability of public employees to engage in politics.they can join political parties,but they ca distribute political literature at work,hold office in political parties,or make speeches on behalf of candidates for political office.different employees are subject to different restrictions the most stringent ones apply to those,such as agents of the fbi,that congress has thought should be apolitical.siefert holds that similar limitations for judges are valid,for three principal reasons first,judges no less than fbi agents must be seen as impartial if judicial decisions are to be accepted by the public,and participation in politics undermines the appearance of impartiality second,judges are not entitled to lend the prestige of office which after all belongs to the people,not to the temporary occupant to some other goal third,states have a compelling interest in preventing judges from becoming party bosses or at,something that would undermine actual impartiality,as well as its appearance.those considerations support limits on political leadership and speechifying as fully as they support limits on partisan endorsements the subject of siefert.
rule a says that judges can not make speeches on behalf of political organizations.this probably equates to acting as a party representative it is therefore doubtful that this rule forbids all of the activity in which judge certo wishes to engage though rule a assuredly forbids him from attending a political convention as a delegate.kentucky rule,held invalid in carey,is much broader than indiana,forbidding a judge even to reveal his political affiliation.siefert held that such a rule in wisconsin violates the first amendment.to the extent there is uncertainty about what it means to speak on behalf of a political organization,indiana provides means of clarification.judge certo should use them.the commission already has issued several clarifying advisory opinions,which we need not recount.for current purposes it is enough to say that the principal applications of subsections a and are valid,which means that they can not be enjoined across the board.we discuss later how indiana system of resolving marginal or otherwise uncertain matters of application affects plaintiffs contention that all of the rules are unconstitutionally vague.
the desire to prevent judges from using the prestige of office for other ends underlies a great deal of the code of judicial conduct for united states judges.federal judges ca endorse political candidates or participate in fundraising,even for nonpartisan institutions such as law schools.a judge ca serve on the board of a charitable organization if that organization is involved in litigation and the fact that the judge plans to recuse from cases for or against the organization does not permit him to serve on the board.the judge can not accept most positions on governmental panels outside the judicial branch.these rules,and other related ones,are in canons and of the code of judicial conduct for united states judges and are elaborated in many advisory opinions.canon also forbids a judge to act as a leader in a political organization,make speeches for a political organization,and so on.if subsections a and of indiana code are unconstitutional,so are canons and of the federal judges code.we very much doubt that white i licenses federal and state judges to give stump speeches for candidates running for president,senator,governor,or mayor,or act as leaders of political parties.
plaintiffs say that a judge who does not identify himself as a judge when making a political speech,or serving as an officer or delegate in a political party,has not misused the prestige of the office and does not imperil the public belief in the impartiality of the judiciary.yet the audience or at least the reporters covering the speech knows who is on the bench and thus might think that the judiciary is behind the endorsement,or implicitly threatening retaliation against those who do not accept the judge recommendation.the court remarked in letter carriers that one principal justification for the hatch act is the preservation of public confidence in the bureaucracy.at.that is even more true about rules that keep judges out of active politics.see caperton massey coal,d.the judicial system depends on its reputation for impartiality it is public acceptance,rather than the sword or the purse,that leads decisions to be obeyed and averts vigilantism and civil strife.
that judges can recuse when their favored political candidates are litigants is not an answer to this concern.many a case presents political issues without involving a politician.political platforms,and candidates,take strong positions on health care,torts,labor relations,crime,immigration,abortion,taxes,and a hundred more contentious issues.unless a judge who speaks on behalf of a party,or serves as a party officer,recuses in all of these cases which is to say,almost every case that comes before a court the public would have good reason to believe that the judge is deciding according to the party platform rather than the rule of law.allowing judges to participate in politics would poison the reputation of the whole judiciary and seriously impair public confidence,without which the judiciary can not function.preserving that confidence is a compelling interest.no one could contemplate with equanimity the prospect of a state chief justice also being the head of a political party and doling out favors or patronage,or deciding who runs for legislative office.states are entitled to ensure not only that judges behave in office with probity and dignity,but also that their conduct makes it possible for them to serve impartially.but the will be disqualified so often that he will have the equivalent of a paid vacation,while other judges must work extra to protect litigants entitlement to expeditious decisions.
letter carriers said that it is constitutional to curtail bureaucrats political activity to ensure public confidence that civil servants administer the law in accordance with the will of congress,rather than in accordance with their own or the will of a political party.at.exactly the same can be said about judges and the judiciary.when a state requires judges to stand for office,it can not insist that candidates remain silent about why they rather than someone else should be elected.that the holding of white i.but the rationale of letter carriers remains,and is not undercut by white i,for political races other than the judge own.subsections a and are constitutional.
although wersal sexton,cir,recently held that minnesota equivalents of rule a the rule and rule a and the solicitation limits violate the first amendment,it did not discuss or even cite pickering,letter carriers,or any of the supreme court other decisions concerning restrictions on public employees political activities.the majority in wersal concluded that the court en banc decision in white ii requires the application of strict scrutiny to all ethical rules that affect either judicial campaigns or judges participation in campaigns for other offices.we are unpersuaded and shall stick with siefert analysis,which differentiates what judges can do in their own campaigns the subject of white i from how judges can participate in other persons campaigns the subject of letter carriers and similar decisions.
rules b and a are the commits clauses 
rule b a judge shall not,in connection with cases,controversies,or issues that are likely to come before the court,make pledges,promises,or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of judicial office.
rule a except as permitted by law,or by rules b,c,and,a judge or a judicial candidate shall not in connection with cases,controversies,or issues that are likely to come before the court,make pledges,promises,or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of judicial office.
the code defines impartial as absence of bias or prejudice in favor of,or against,particular parties or classes of parties,as well as maintenance of an open mind in considering issues that may come before a judge.plaintiffs bauer and certo say that these rules have discouraged them from answering indiana right to life questionnaire,and the group relates that most judges who have replied have said the same thing only a handful of judges and judicial candidates in indiana have stated their positions on all of the nine questions.
some,perhaps many,of the state judges and judicial candidates
