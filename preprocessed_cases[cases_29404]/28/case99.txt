opinion of the court 
in may of this year,caroline fawkes,the virgin islands supervisor of elections,disqualified appellants soraya diase coffelt and john canegata from appearing on the general election ballot for the offices of governor and lieutenant governor,respectively,of the virgin islands,for ostensible noncompliance with the virgin islands election code.coffelt and canegata,arguing that fawkes misapplied the election code,brought this action to obtain a permanent injunction that would allow them to appear on the november general election ballot.in the alternative,they argued that fawkes interpretation of the code,if correct,violates the first amendment,and sought injunctive relief on that ground as well.the district court initially agreed with coffelt and canegata reading of the election code and granted a temporary restraining order.following additional briefing and oral argument,however,the district court denied a permanent injunction and dismissed the lawsuit.in an order filed august,we granted appellants motion for an injunction pending appeal and stated that an opinion would follow.because we now conclude that coffelt and canegata candidacy is not barred under,we will vacate the district court order of july,and remand for further proceedings.
candidates for governor and lieutenant governor of the virgin islands must run as an inseparable pair on a single ticket.under the election code,which was overhauled in and modeled in large part on pennsylvania election law.stat.ann,a candidate seeking public office has two options to appear on the general election ballot.
subchapter i of chapter describes the traditional process,under which a candidate submits a nomination petition,competes in the party primary election,and,if successful,appears on the general election ballot as that party official candidate.see.in,the virgin islands legislature added to subchapter i,which provides 
any person running for public office must run as a candidate consistent with the political party designation under which the candidate is registered at the time of the filing of the nomination petition,whether the political party designation indicates an affiliation with a political party as defined in section or otherwise.
subchapter ii,by contrast,details a direct nomination path to the general election ballot for candidates lacking the imprimatur of a recognized political party.see id.such candidates declare their interest with submission of a nomination paper,which must have a certain number of signatures from qualified electors.id.if such a candidate represents a political body,the candidate must specify the name of that body.id.a the political body name may not be identical with,or deceptively similar to the name of any political party or competing political body.id.b.if the candidate does not specify a political body,the candidate shall be designated as independent on the general election ballot.id.c.
in early,coffelt,who is not registered with any political party sought a running mate in connection with a direct nomination bid for governor of the virgin islands.canegata,a registered republican and in fact the sitting chair of the virgin islands republican party,expressed interest in being coffelt running mate.notably,the republican party opted not to advance a ticket in the november gubernatorial election,thus leaving canegata with no opportunity to pursue a traditional subchapter i bid for that office as a republican.
on may,coffelt filed a nomination paper with the office of supervisor of elections,signaling her intent to run for governor with canegata as her running mate.on may,canegata filed a nomination paper to run as lieutenant governor on the same ticket as coffelt the same day of their respective filings,coffelt and canegata each received,by email,a notice of defect from fawkes in her capacity as supervisor of elections.the notice of defect addressed to coffelt states,in pertinent part 
pursuant to title section you are hereby notified that your nomination was found to be defective.the reason for the defect 
pursuant to vic title,chapter,prohibition against persons registered to a political party running as a or independent candidate.

on may,appellants filed the instant action in the district court for the virgin islands,seeking to enjoin appellees from disqualifying coffelt and canegata from the november ballot.they also sought a declaratory judgment that the pair had met the requirements of for placement on the general election ballot under subchapter ii.alternatively,they requested a declaration under the remedial provisions of that,if correctly interpreted by fawkes,violated their rights under the revised organic act,and the federal constitution.
together with the complaint,appellants filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.on june,the district court heard oral argument on the motion.on june,the court entered a day temporary restraining order,noting that,by its own terms,applies only to candidates who file a nominating petition,the document associated with a bid for office under subchapter i and not to candidates who file a nominating paper under subchapter ii,such as coffelt and canegata.app.the court thus concluded that the agency interpretation of the law is not supported by the plain language of the applicable statutory provisions.id.
the parties submitted additional briefing on the motion for a permanent injunction,and the court held oral argument on june.on july,the district court entered a memorandum and order reversing course.the court vacated the temporary restraining order,denied the motion for a permanent injunction,and entered judgment in favor of appellees.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal on july.
the district court had original jurisdiction over appellants federal constitutional challenges to under and.see,roger corbett,cir reviewing the constitutionality of a provision of pennsylvania election law.and although the related claim,that fawkes simply misapplied virgin islands election law is not the sort over which federal district courts typically may exercise original jurisdiction we conclude that the district court was entitled to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over that claim because it form s part of the same case or controversy under article iii a.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
we review the district court decision to grant or deny a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.we exercise plenary review,however,over the court underlying legal conclusions.see stolt nielsen,united states,cir.in assessing whether injunctive relief is appropriate,we must consider whether 
the moving party has shown actual success on the merits the moving party will be irreparably injured by the denial of injunctive relief the granting of the permanent injunction will result in even greater harm to the defendant and the injunction would be in the public interest.
shields zuccarini,cir citing aclu black horse pike reg l bd.of,nn.cir.the parties briefing,and our analysis,focuses predominantly on whether appellants have shown success on the merits.
this case turns on whether a candidate registered to a political party may seek direct nomination to the general election ballot under subchapter ii of title of the election code.both parties contend that the code operates unambiguously in their favor in other words,appellants argue that the code expressly permits the candidacy by failing to prohibit it,while appellees believe that the code prohibits the candidacy by necessary implication.in the alternative,appellees contend that insofar
