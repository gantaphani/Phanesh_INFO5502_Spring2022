keith carlson,who is the treasurer of the state republican party,filed this action in orange county superior court on monday,march,requesting a writ of mandate stopping debbie cook,who is a candidate in the upcoming june democratic primary in the congressional district,from using the title of mayor in her ballot designation.she is,in fact,the mayor of huntington beach,but carlson claims that because she was elected by the city council and not the electorate directly,that she can not use the title while most of the congressional district is within orange county,it includes parts of los angeles county as well.on friday,march,the trial court denied a request to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction,and ordered cook to sit for a deposition cook brought this petition on monday,march,for writ of mandate or prohibition,seeking dismissal of the action and a stay of her deposition.this court granted the request for stay of the deposition that monday afternoon.on tuesday afternoon we stayed the trial.
we leave aside the question of whether carlson who,to be sure,lives and votes in the congressional district,is an elector as the term is used in section,in an election in which he presumably can not vote.see generally california democratic party jones,d condemning open primary law,saying proposition forces political parties to associate have their nominees,and hence their positions,determined who,at best,have refused to affiliate with the party,and,at worst,have expressly affiliated with a rival.to be fair to carlson,he would be an elector in the general election if cook won the primary and was still mayor.see elector means any person who is a united states citizen years of age or older and a resident of an election precinct at least days prior to an election.
in any event,the question of carlson standing is academic.the request that the case be dismissed because the orange county superior court lacks to be is about to lack well taken.
let us explain section allows any elector to challenge by writ of mandate an error in regard to ballot designations.the statute,however,is very specific that venue for such a proceeding is exclusively in sacramento when the secretary of state is named as a real party in interest or a respondent.
now,to be sure,the secretary of state has of the named a real party in interest or a respondent.however,if the secretary of state is an indispensible party to the proceedings,then the secretary must be joined to the proceedings.the applicable statute code civ,subd.a uses the word shall.see also weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,joinder will be ordered if feasible wherever plaintiff fails to join some person necessary for a just adjudication,the court shall order that person be made a party to the action.and in this particular case,we need not deal with any issue regarding whether joinder is feasible.it is difficult to imagine circumstances under which the secretary of state,a constitutional office holder,could not be joined.and carlson offers no reason the secretary of state could not be joined,or any explanation for not joining her in the first place.
indeed,carlson,has,in fact,conceded the point that if the secretary of state were an indispensible party,the case would have to be filed in sacramento.in informal opposition papers filed monday march,his counsel wrote here,cook is not running for statewide office.therefore,the only way for this case to be tried in sacramento is if the court finds that the secretary of state is a necessary party.italics in original.
the case thus devolves on the question of whether the secretary of state is an indispensible party.the criteria for indispensible party status is found in section,subdivision a of the code of civil procedure,which we have already quoted in the margin.
in california election code,there is a process for the transmission of nomination documents,including candidate ballot designations.there is a provision,in section,that candidates in primaries deliver their nomination papers to the local elections official.on the other hand,section requires that the nomination papers for certain offices be filed with the secretary of state,and among those offices are the united states house of representatives 
for the moment we may disregard the question of,in a congressional election,where districts often overlap county lines,whether section,requiring initial delivery to the local elections official,even applies.by what standard,for example,would cook have been required to deliver her papers to the orange county registrar of voters as distinct from the los angeles county registrar of voters or secretary of state directly for the moment we will assume,for sake of argument,that cook could have delivered her papers to either the orange county registrar of voters or the los angeles registrar of voters.
even if section were applicable,though,it makes no difference because another statute,section,has contemplated the scenario where papers are delivered to a local elections official in a race where it is the secretary of state who actually files the papers.section requires that in cases where nomination documents must be filed with the secretary of state,the local elections official is to forward we note,the word is forward,not documents to the secretary of state in the largely duplicative section,the word used is transmit again the legislature did not use the word file.
after forwarding,section is clear that the secretary of state is independently precluded from accept ing incorrect ballot designations for candidates for congress.the way section is structured,subdivision a provides the rules governing such designations while subdivision b precludes the secretary of state,nor any other election official,from accepting any improper designation 
the issue of the secretary of state independent duty has been well briefed in cook papers supporting her writ petition.confronted with the problem of this independent duty,carlson response is to posit a paradigm,in which the local elections official is precluded from transmitting or forwarding nomination papers to the secretary of state.in this model,this litigation can supposedly be contained to just the local level,obviating any need for the secretary of state to play a role in the process.
the model must be rejected for no less than three reasons.at the most elementary,carlson theory is at odds with the prayer in his own petition,which directly requests that cook ballot designation as mayor be deleted,as distinct from simply not transmitted by the local registrar.
a second,and more substantive reason,is that there is no statutory authority for a local elections official to act as some sort of screener,protecting the secretary of state from ballot designations which the local registrar of voters thinks might not pass muster under section in those cases where the secretary of state is the person who files the nomination papers.carlson model would,in effect,give a local elections official veto power over ballot designations which the secretary of state might,in the discharge of her office,otherwise accept.in essence,it elevates a party with a ministerial duty to act as a conduit forward and transmit into the party who has the last word.in fact,just the opposite is the case.neither section nor section give a local elections official any discretionary or adjudicatory role to play in regard to papers that they must forward or transmit to the secretary of state.
third,more technically,the key language in section,subdivision b is accept,as the word is used in a context that indicates something greater than a mere ministerial theory of transmittal.a mere forwarder or transmitter does not pass on the substance of a communication to determine whether it might mislead the voter.see,subd.b.
the phrase in section,subdivision b,neither the secretary of state nor any other elections official shall accept a designation must be read together with sections and.read together,these statutes indicate a purely magisterial duty of transmission or forwarding by the local elections official in those cases where the papers must be
