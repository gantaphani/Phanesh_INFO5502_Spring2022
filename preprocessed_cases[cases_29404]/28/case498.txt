this appeal concerns the sufficiency of a petition for writ of mandate filed by what have come to be known as birthers,people who claim president barak obama is not a natural born citizen of the united states of america and,hence,is ineligible to be the president.
plaintiffs alan keyes,wiley drake,and markham robinson appeal from the judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained,without leave to amend,demurrers of defendants president obama,vice president joseph biden,the california presidential electors of the electors,and secretary of state debra bowen.plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred because,they contend,there is a triable issue of material fact concerning whether the secretary of state has the affirmative duty to verify that candidates seeking elective office are eligible for office.they also argue the court erred in determining that it lacked jurisdiction to resolve certain issues raised in the petition.in plaintiffs view,there is a triable issue of material fact as to which branch of government,and what office within that branch,has the duty to ensure that all candidates on a california ballot meet the eligibility requirements to hold office.
plaintiffs contentions lack merit.among other things,we conclude that the secretary of state does not have a duty to investigate and determine whether a presidential candidate meets eligibility requirements of the united state constitution.as we will explain,the presidential nominating process is not subject to each of the states election officials independently deciding whether a presidential nominee is qualified,as this could lead to chaotic results.were the courts of states at liberty to issue injunctions restricting certification of presidential electors,the result could be conflicting rulings and delayed transition of power in derogation of statutory and constitutional deadlines.any investigation of eligibility is best left to each party,which presumably will conduct the appropriate background check or risk that its nominee election will be derailed by an objection in congress,which is authorized to entertain and resolve the validity of objections following the submission of the electoral votes.
plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate against secretary of state bowen,president obama,vice president biden,and the electors on november,and filed an amended petition on february.
in their first amended petition,which is not a model of clarity,plaintiffs observe that the secretary of state is responsible for certifying candidates for inclusion on the ballot and that,h istorically,california secretaries of state have exercised their due diligence by reviewing necessary background documents verifying that the candidates that were submitted by the respective political parties as eligible for the ballot were indeed eligible.according to plaintiffs,the voters have an expectation that compliance with the minimum qualifications for office will be confirmed by the officials overseeing the election process.the gravamen of their action is there is a reasonable doubt president obama is a natural born citizen,as is required to become president of the united states,art.ii,and the secretary of state had a ministerial duty to verify that president obama met the constitutional qualifications for office before certifying him for inclusion on the ballot.
plaintiffs asserted that f ailure to grant the relief sought,demanding that the secretary of state be ordered to verify the constitutionally required qualifications of obama,and any and all future candidates for president,not only allows,but promotes,an overwhelming degree of disrespect for our constitution and for our electoral process,and creates such a lack of confidence of voters in the primary and electoral process itself,that it would confirm a common belief that no politician has to obey the laws of this country,respect our election process,or follow the united states constitution.italics added.
plaintiffs also alleged that the electors had an affirmative duty to discover whether the presidential candidate was a natural born citizen,since they were required to vote for the president in the manner directed by the constitution,and that one of the persons nominated as an elector,ilene huber,died on october,and a woman by the name of ilene haber was permitted to vote in place of huber,without being elected to take her place as required by the election code.
plaintiffs asked the trial court issue a writ of mandate barring the secretary of state from certifying the names of the electors and from transmitting to each elector a certificate of election until documentary proof was produced and verified showing that any future presidential candidate is qualified to serve as president of the united states.plaintiffs also asked the court to bar future california electors from signing the certificate of vote until such documentary proof is produced and verified showing that any future presidential candidate is qualified to serve as president of the united states.in addition,plaintiffs sought to bar the electors from signing the certificate of vote unless they complied with the election code requirements concerning replacing absent electors.
secretary of state bowen demurred on the grounds that the petition failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against her because she did not have a ministerial duty to demand detailed proof of citizenship from presidential candidates,the petition was moot given that the election had been held the controversy was not ripe as to future elections whether a presidential candidate is qualified for office was a matter committed to congress and the federal courts and the alleged substitution of ilene haber for the deceased ilene huber merely represented a typographical error.
president obama,vice president biden,and the electors demurred on the grounds that the petition did not allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action as they had no ministerial duty to provide to the secretary of state,or verify proof of,qualifications to hold office,the petition did not seek any relief against the president or vice president,the state court lacked jurisdiction over the matter,which was governed by federal law and required objections to presidential qualifications to be lodged with congress,the petition was moot,and to the extent that the petition sought relief as to future elections,it suffered from a misjoinder of parties because the court could not know who the candidates or electors would be in the future.
the trial court sustained both demurrers,ruling the secretary of state was required to see that state election laws are enforced,but plaintiffs had not identified a state election law imposing a ministerial duty to demand documentary proof of birthplace from presidential candidates.
the court dispensed with the claim concerning california elector ilene huber by taking judicial notice of a document showing that the name had been a typographical error and that ilene haber was the actual elector,not an improper replacement.
the court sustained the demurrer of the president and vice president,noting the petition did not seek any relief against them and did not identify any ministerial duty on their part that they failed to perform and,thus,failed to state a cause of action as to them.
similarly,the court ruled plaintiffs failed to identify any ministerial duty the electors failed to perform.the requirement they vote in the manner directed by the constitution merely refers to the mechanics of casting votes,found in the twelfth amendment to the united states constitution.the electors did not have an affirmative duty to discover whether the candidate is a natural born citizen and,in fact,were required by statute to vote for their party nominee,further section references are to the elections code unless otherwise specified.
the court also found the petition was moot as to all parties with respect to the general election because the electoral college had voted and obama had been inaugurated as president of the united states.it was not ripe as to future elections because the issues were not framed with sufficient concreteness and immediacy to allow the court to render a conclusive and definitive judgment rather than an advisory opinion based on hypothetical facts or speculative future events.
and the court ruled it lacked jurisdiction over the subject of the action in that federal law establishes election procedures and the exclusive means for challenges to the qualifications of the president and vice president.the appropriate procedure was an action before the united states congress pursuant to the twelfth amendment to the united states congress and section.in the trial court words,plaintiffs belief in the importance of their arguments is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon this court.
plaintiffs appealed from the ensuing judgment of dismissal.

discussion 
with the aforementioned rules in mind,we turn to plaintiffs challenge to the trial court ruling sustaining the demurrer of the president,vice president,and electors on the ground that plaintiffs petition for writ of mandate failed to state a cause of action.
a writ of mandate will lie to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins,as a duty resulting from an office,trust,or station,or to compel the admission of a party to the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which the party is entitled code civ.the two requirements for mandamus thus are a clear,present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the respondent,and a clear,present and beneficial right in the petitioner to performance of that duty.barnes wong th.
the trial court found that plaintiffs did not identify any ministerial duty that the president and vice president failed to perform,and the petition did not seek any relief against them thus,plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action against those defendants.plaintiffs do not present any reasoned argument under an appropriate argument heading challenging this determination.they attack other reasons given by the trial court in support of its order sustaining defendants demurrer,but not this one.accordingly,they have forfeited any claim that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer of the president and vice president.
the trial court also determined that plaintiffs did not identify any ministerial duty the electors failed to perform,nor demonstrate that they had a ministerial duty to determine if their party nominee is a natural born citizen.the electors had to vote for president and vice president,respectively,in the manner directed by the constitution,which refers to the constitutional directive found in the twelfth amendment,which provides in pertinent part the electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for president and vice president,one of whom,at least,shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as president,and in distinct ballots,the person voted for as vice president,and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as president,and of all persons voted for as vice president,and of the number of votes for each,which lists they shall sign and certify,and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the united states,directed to the president of the senate 
there is no obligation that the electors first determine whether the presidential candidate is eligible for office.
similarly,the california elections code does not impose on the electors any obligation to determine a presidential candidate eligibility.the pertinent provisions direct that the electors shall assemble at the state capitol at in the afternoon on the first monday after the second wednesday in december next following their election and shall vote by ballot for that person for president and that person for vice president of the united states,who are,respectively,the candidates of the political party which they represent,one of whom,at least,is not an inhabitant of this state.the electors shall make separate lists of all persons voted for as president and of all persons voted for as vice president,and of the number of votes for each,which lists they shall sign,certify,seal,and transmit by mail to the seat of the government of the united states,directed to the president of the senate.
in other words,the electors have a ministerial duty to convene on a specific date,in a specific place,to cast their ballots for their parties nominees,and then transmit their sealed list of votes to the president of the senate.there is nothing in any state or federal legislation identified by plaintiffs imposing a ministerial duty on the electors to investigate the eligibility of their parties candidate.rather,they are directed that they shall vote by ballot for that person for president and that person for vice president of the united states,who are,respectively,the candidates of the political party which they represent.
acknowledging that the electors have a ministerial duty to vote for their party candidate,plaintiffs present no cognizable argument,supported by analysis and authority,demonstrating the electors had a duty to determine if the candidate is a natural born citizen before casting their ballots.
consequently,plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of demon
