opinion of the court 
carson manufacturing company,and microvote corporation sold an electronic voting system to montgomery county,pennsylvania.pursuant to the sales contract,microvote obtained a performance bond from westchester fire insurance company.the voting system malfunctioned in the november general election and the april primary election.as a result,the county filed a six count diversity action,alleging negligence by microvote and carson,breach of warranty by microvote and carson,breach of contract by microvote,fraud by microvote,wrongful use of civil proceedings by microvote,and breach of the performance bond by westchester.carson settled with montgomery county shortly before trial,and a jury returned a verdict against microvote on the breach of implied warranty cause of action and against westchester on the performance bond claim.microvote and westchester appealed.
on appeal,westchester claims that the district court erred in finding that the statute of limitations did not bar this action.westchester also raises various other challenges to the district court jury charge and its denial of westchester motions.both microvote and westchester contend that the district court erred in its refusal to admit into evidence the videotape deposition of defendants expert witness.they also claim that the district court should have limited montgomery county remedy to repair and replacement of the defective machines and should have the judgment against them by the amount of carson settlement with the county.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm.
facts and procedural history 
on may,the county entered into a written contract with microvote to purchase direct recording electronic voting machines dres,a central computer system,computer software,and support services for a total of.the bid explicitly stated that it was for an integrated voter registration and election system and that microvote is bidding the entire system,as specified,including all requisite hardware and software.microvote manufactured the system software,microvote election management software mems,but it purchased the machines and their internal software from carson.the contract required microvote personnel to operate the system during elections through.
pursuant to the sales agreement,microvote obtained a performance bond from westchester.the performance bond incorporated the sales contract by reference and contained a warranty that all materials,equipment,and labor will be furnished in a complete and workmanlike manner.the performance bond required microvote to provide westchester with notice of any default.it did not require the county to give westchester notice of default.nor,did westchester ever ask the county to provide notice of default.westchester affiliate,universal,obtained a letter of credit as collateral on the performance bond.the letter of credit expired on june.
the dres were phased in to use over the course of three elections the november general election,the april primary election,and the november general election.the november election was the first time the county used all dres and the mems software.in the november general election,dres repeatedly shut down.this resulted in long lines,in voters leaving polling stations before they voted,and in lost votes.the occurred because the dres would randomly turn themselves into mode.apparently,the scroll motors were emitting power surges to the internal computer chips when the brushes in the scroll motors interacted with the casing of the motors to generate electromagnetic interference.the dres microcomputer chip would then shut down in order to protect the circuitry.thus,when a voter pushed a button on a dre to scroll to the next page,the scroll motor would activate,and the machine might randomly shut down in front of the voter.in this situation,the vote would be lost unless the voter.in addition,the mems software malfunctioned when counting the votes,causing microvote employees to report the wrong unofficial results to the press.
the dre malfunctions were haphazard.william carson,the president and ceo of carson,wrote to the county after the november general election that the problem seems to appear and disappear for no particular reason.carson admitted in an internal memorandum,and in his trial testimony,that the dres had problems in the november election.microvote manager in an internal memorandum also noted serious problems with the mems software.the software problems were not detected by testing because microvote was making changes in the software up to the day before the election.under the contract and pennsylvania law,the system,including the software,should have been tested and certified prior to the election.mems,however,was not certified in pennsylvania.
after the november election,county officials met with representatives from microvote.at the meeting,the county expressed its intention to return the defective system and seek a refund.microvote sales director responded that microvote will make certain that in april of nest year we do face any machine down time at all.on march,the solicitor of montgomery county notified microvote that the county considers you in default of your contract.microvote claimed that additional machines would cure the problem and offered to provide the county with additional loaner machines free of charge for the april primary election.the county agreed to give the dpes another chance.on march,the parties entered into an agreement under which the county maintained its position that microvote was in breach of the may,sales contract but would use the dres the county owned,along with the additional dres on loan from microvote,in the april election to determine if the system could function properly with additional dres.microvote made several attempts to cure the problems,including working on the motor brushes and retrofitting the machines with less sensitive computer chips.nevertheless,the system failed again in the april primary election.
on june,the county replaced the dres with machines from another manufacturer that the county purchased for,less a allowance for the microvote machines neither the county,nor microvote,notified westchester of the default and universal letter of credit expired.nor,however,did westchester obtain a release from the county despite the fact that westchester policy required a completion letter from the county before allowing the letter of credit to expire.moreover,westchester twice attempted unsuccessfully to obtain written releases from the county.
on july,microvote filed an action against the county in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the complaint alleged that the county had breached an oral agreement to purchase of the dres that microvote had loaned the county.the district court dismissed the action pursuant to.b on the ground that pennsylvania law requires all contracts with local governments to be in writing.we affirmed that decision in microvote montgomery county,cir.
on october,the county brought this diversity action,alleging breach of contract,of warranty,and of the performance bond,as well as negligence,fraud,and wrongful use of civil process.microvote moved to dismiss on grounds that the county should have raised the claims as compulsory counterclaims in microvote montgomery county,that the complaint was untimely,and there was a lack of personal jurisdiction.alternatively,microvote moved for a transfer of venue.the district court denied the motions.
following discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on the negligence claim,the fraud claims arising prior to the november election,and the wrongful use of civil proceedings claim,but denied defendants motion for summary judgment with respect to the remaining fraud claims,the breach of contract claim,the breach of warranty claim,and the performance bond claim.one week prior to the start of trial,carson entered into a covenant not to sue with the county 
the jury trial commenced against microvote and westchester on october.at the close of the county case,microvote and westchester moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to.a.the district court reserved ruling on the motions.at the close of evidence,microvote and westchester renewed their motions,which the court denied.on november,the jury returned a verdict.the jury found in favor of microvote on the breach of contract,the breach of express warranties,and the fraud counts.however,the jury found that microvote had breached implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and that westchester had violated the performance bond.the jury awarded montgomery county in damages.
in separate motions,microvote and westchester moved to amend the judgment,for relief from final judgment,for judgment as a matter of law,and for a new trial.the county also filed a motion seeking to mold the jury verdict,judgment as a matter of law,and a new trial.the district court denied all the motions in separate orders dated june.microvote and westchester timely appealed.the county did not appeal the denial of its motion.

iii.discussion 
statute of limitations and nullum tempus 
the district court did not err in denying westchester motion for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that the statute of limitations bars this action because the doctrine of nullum tempus occurit regi time does not run against the king applies here.under the doctrine of nullum tempus,the statute of limitations does not bar actions brought by the state or its agencies,unless a statute expressly so provides.see city of philadelphia lead indus.ass n,cir.the rationale of this rule is that the commonwealth,as a plaintiff,seeks the vindication of public rights and the protection of public property.accord broselow fisher,cir.the county,however,is a political subdivision of the commonwealth.the doctrine of nullum tempus is not available to political subdivisions of the state except in limited circumstances of obligations imposed by law 
s tatutes of limitations can not be pleaded against such political subdivisions when they are seeking to enforce strictly public rights,that is,when the cause of action accrues to them in their governmental capacity and the suit is brought to enforce an obligation imposed by law as distinguished from one arising out of an agreement voluntarily entered into by the defendant.
lead indus.ass n,at quoting city of philadelphia holmes protective.
nullum tempus does not apply to a common law contract claim against a political subdivision,arising out of a voluntary agreement,because such a claim does not accrue solely to a governmental entity.however,where a subdivision of the commonwealth is required by the constitution or by statute to engage in an activity,nullum tempus applies to contracts entered into with private parties in order to fulfill this duty.see lead indus.ass n,at holding that nullum tempus does not apply where the city of philadelphia and state housing authorities bring an action against a lead paint manufacturer and trade association to recover the cost of abating lead paint in public housing because the plaintiffs were not required by law to contract for the purchase of paint or to construct the buildings in which that paint was used.lebanon school dist.grace and,holding that the doctrine of nullum tempus applies where a school district brings breach of contract and tort claims against contractors and manufacturers for defects in the construction of school buildings because the school district was required by the constitution and statute to build the schools and the school district contracted with private parties in order to fulfil this duty stroudsburg area school dist.architects,app.denied,same.
the nullum tempus doctrine applies in this case because,as in lebanon school district and stroudsburg area school district,but unlike in lead industries association,the county was required by law to hold elections and to procure electronic voting machines.the county was required t o purchase,preserve,store and maintain primary and election equipment of all kinds,including voting machines.c.further,in november,the citizens of the county voted to replace the county manual voting machines with electronic voting machines.following this vote,the county was required by law to purchase electronic machines.under pennsylvania law,if a majority of the qualified registered electors voting on the question in any county vote in favor of the adoption of an electronic voting system,the county board of elections of that county shall purchase,lease,or otherwise procure the components of an electronic voting system.a.thus,as in lebanon school district,the county is 
unquestionably compelled by law to provide electronic voting machines.the practical implications of such a duty require the county,in its governmental capacity,to enter into contractual relations with private parties who can construct and maintain such suitable facilities.where,as here,a cause of action accrues to a party in its governmental capacity and the suit is brought to enforce strictly public rights and an obligations imposed by statute,such as that herein,the doctrine of nullum tempus applies.
lebanon sch,at.
further,contrary to westchester assertion,the acquisition of the performance bond also was an obligation imposed by law.under pennsylvania law 
the successful bidder,when advertising is required herein,shall be required to furnish a bond with suitable reasonable requirements guaranteeing performance of the contract,with sufficient surety in the amount of fifty per centum of the amount of the contract,within thirty days after the contract has been awarded,unless the commissioners shall waive the bond requirement in the bid specification.
c.in this case,the bond requirement was not waived in the bid specification.
moreover,as the district court held,the performance bond should not be examined apart from the underlying contract in determining whether nullum tempus applies.the purpose of the performance bond was to ensure that the county was able to perform its statutorily mandated duty to obtain electronic voting machines.therefore,in bringing this action to recover under the performance bond,the county was enforcing the obligation to provide electronic voting machines imposed by law.as microvote represented at oral argument,the county most likely would not be able to recover on its judgment absent the performance bond because of microvote limited assets.
expert witness 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony of defendants expert,robert naegele.federal rule of evidence fre was amended in to provide that 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of
