as with the law in general the first amendment is a jealous mistress.it enables the people to exchange ideas popular and unpopular alike,to assemble with the hope of changing minds,and to alter or preserve how we govern ourselves.but in return,it demands that sometimes seemingly reasonable measures enacted by our governments give way.
the state of ohio enacted a provision making it a felony to pay anyone for gathering signatures on petitions on any basis other than the time worked.it did so for the sensible purpose of reducing fraudulent signatures.the provision,however,runs afoul of the first amendment because it creates a significant burden on a core political speech right that is not narrowly tailored.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment against the state.
the district court set forth the background of this case 
ohio revised code the statute states in relevant part as follows 
b no person shall receive compensation on a fee per signature or fee per volume basis for circulating any declaration of candidacy,nominating petition,initiative petition,referendum petition,recall petition,or any other petition that is filed with or transmitted to a board of elections,the office of the secretary of state,or other appropriate public office.
d no person shall pay any other person for collecting signatures on petitions or for registering voters except on the basis of time worked.

prior to the effective date of the statute,ctr had engaged a political consulting firm on the basis of a fixed fee contract to secure the necessary signatures to qualify a proposed constitutional amendment for the november ohio general election.pursuant to the contract,ctr was to pay the firm per signature for a total of approximately signatures.after the statute became effective,ctr was not permitted to pay circulators on a or on any basis.the political consulting firm was no longer willing to collect signatures pursuant to the contract and it estimated that the cost for gathering the signatures would increase by more than.plaintiffs asserted that the statute increased the cost of qualifying their proposed amendment,made it more difficult to raise money necessary to fund the initiative effort,and that they had refrained from attempting to qualify the proposed amendment for the ballot so long as the statute was in force.id.

balancing first amendment rights against the regulation of elections 
in general 
the first amendment to the constitution reads in part,congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,or the right of the people peaceably to assemble,and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.the fourteenth amendment extends these prohibitions against the states.thornhill alabama.one of the main interests embodied in the first amendment is that of a free,sovereign people using the power of persuasion,rather than force,to govern itself.accordingly,the supreme court has held that the first amendment places a high value on the right to engage freely in discussions concerning the need for political change,including change accomplished through petitions and elections.meyer grant,d.
first amendment rights to free speech,to assemble,and to petition the government are not,of course,without boundary.with respect to elections,article i,section of the constitution grants to states the authority to determine the times,places and manner of holding elections.as the supreme court explained in timmons twin cities area new party,d,i t is clear that states may,and inevitably must,enact reasonable regulations of parties,elections,and ballots to reduce election and disorder,id.at.citing burdick takushi,d a s a practical matter,there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order,rather than chaos,is to accompany the democratic process.internal quotation marks omitted.states allowing ballot initiatives have considerable leeway to protect the integrity and reliability of the initiative process,as they have with respect to election processes generally.buckley am.constitutional,d citations omitted.when the boundaries of first amendment rights push up against a state authority to regulate elections,cases like the present one arise.
ctr asserts that ohio requirement that circulators be paid only on the basis of their time worked the requirement places a severe burden on its first amendment rights.the state counters that the burden is not severe and,even if it is,the burden is justified by the need to counter election fraud.in timmons,the supreme court set forth the following framework for resolving these types of competing interests 
when deciding whether a state election law violates first and fourteenth amendment associational rights,we weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the state rule imposes on those rights against the interests the state contends justify that burden,and consider the extent to which the state concerns make the burden necessary.regulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs rights must be narrowly tailored and advance a compelling state interest.lesser burdens,however,trigger less exacting review,and a state important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions.no bright line separates permissible regulation from unconstitutional infringements on first amendment freedoms.

character and magnitude of the burden 
prior decisions 
the state of ohio argues that its requirement imposes,at most,only a moderate burden on ctr rights.it faults ctr for failing to show,in the state words,that the ban would cause a significant,quantitative decrease in the number of circulators available or that it would decrease the number of issues successfully placed on the ballot.appellant br.at.it asserts that we should apply a less exacting review and that,under this review,the requirement meets the standard for a reasonable,nondiscriminatory restriction.timmons,at.ctr argues,on the other hand,that the cumulative effect of the statute on the petition process severely burdens ctr core political speech rights.
the supreme court first addressed the issue of payment to petition circulators in meyer grant.the state of colorado had banned proponents of petitions from paying circulators,among other restrictions.the court subjected colorado payment ban to exacting scrutiny.meyer,at.citations omitted.the court determined that the ban restricted political expression in two fundamental ways it limit ed the number of voices who will convey the petitioner message and the hours they can speak and,therefore,limits the size of the audience they can reach and it makes it less likely that the petitioner will garner the number of signatures necessary to place the matter on the ballot,thus limiting the petitioner ability to make the matter the focus of the statewide discussion.id.at.
the state of colorado defended the measure in part by pointing out all of the other avenues of expression left open to petitioners.the court rejected the argument,explaining that simply because avenues of speech existed did not mean that colorado could simply shut down a one colorado prohibition of paid petition circulators restricts access to the most effective,fundamental,and perhaps economical avenue of political discourse,direct communication.id.at.the court concluded that the burden colorado had to overcome to justify its ban was insurmountable.id.at.
several years later the state of colorado was again before the supreme court to justify several new petition regulations.in buckley american constitutional law foundation,the court looked at three provisions the requirement that circulators be registered voters the requirement that they wear an identification badge and the requirement that proponents of an initiative report the names and addresses of all paid circulators and the amount paid to each circulator.at.using again the exacting scrutiny it applied in meyer,id.at,the court struck down all three as too heavy a burden in comparison to the state purported justifications of deterring fraud and corruption,id.at.
since the meyer and buckley decisions,three circuits have considered whether bans on payments meet constitutional muster.the eighth circuit was the first when it considered north dakota ban in initiative referendum institute jaeger,cir iri.the court found the ban constitutional.it based its holding on the respective strengths of the proofs submitted 
examining the record in this case,we conclude that the state has produced sufficient evidence that the regulation is necessary to insure the integrity of the initiative process.in,the legislature passed in response to problems that occurred with an initiative that had been placed on the ballot in november.state representative linderman stated,in regard to a signature campaign,that students were being paid cents signature.there were reported names out of the phone book,the limited legislative history available shows that the legislators were aware of,and contemplated,the bill effect on the circulation of petitions,but that they were more concerned with the testimony they had heard regarding signature fraud.
furthermore,as mentioned in the previous section on the residency requirement,in approximately petition signatures were invalidated.a subsequent investigation revealed that payment per signature was an issue in the incident.
the appellants have produced no evidence that payment by the hour,rather than on commission,would in any way burden their ability to collect signatures.the appellants have only offered bare assertions on this point.while it may be argued that such assertions may establish an unacceptable burden on where the state can not offer any evidence demonstrating the need to prohibit commission payments,meyer,at,d,when the state introduces evidence justifying the ban on commission payments as a necessary means to prevent fraud and abuse as the state has in this case,initiative sponsors may not rest on bare assertions alone.
the ninth circuit addressed a similar ban passed by oregon voters in prete bradbury,cir.after an abbreviated bench trial,the district court held that oregon ban did not unconstitutionally burden petitioners core political speech rights.id.at.the ninth circuit affirmed.after reviewing the standard set forth by the supreme court in meyer and buckley,the court distinguished oregon ban from the total ban on payments in meyer.id.at.it described oregon ban as simply prohibit ing one method of payment.id.it also read buckley as modifying meyer 
to the extent meyer may be read to indicate that any resulting decrease in the pool of available circulators is sufficient to constitute a severe burden under the first amendment,in buckley the court refined its analysis and made clear that the degree of the decrease resulting from the measure is properly considered in determining the severity of the burden.
id.at citation omitted,emphasis in original.the court found that the district court did not clearly err in rejecting the petitioner evidence of circulators leaving or refusing to work in oregon as unsupported speculation.id.at.the two primary affiants,william arno of arno political consultants apc and tracy taylor of taylor petition management,llc,had little experience in oregon,and thus could not offer a reliable estimate of the ban effect on the cost of signature gathering in the state.id.at.likewise,their assertions regarding the effect the ban had on the validity rate of signatures carried little weight with the court.id.at.
the court recognized that from an economic perspective,eliminating one method of payment but not every method,a la meyer for petition circulators could result in some barriers to entry in the signature procurement market.id.at.paying circulators by the signature can be more productive of signatures than paying an hourly wage.id.the court noted,however,that whether the measure actually created any barriers to entry was a question of historical fact,and it did not find clear error with the district court determination that no such barriers existed.id.even had the petitioners made the requisite showing,the barriers would have established only a lesser burden under the first amendment.id.at.this is because oregon ban was quite limited in its proscription,barring only payment of petition circulators on the basis of the number of signatures gathered.it does not prohibit adjusting salaries or paying bonuses according to validity rates or productivity which could likely counter any barriers to entry.id.thus,concluding that the petitioners had established only a lesser burden on their rights,the court subjected the ban to a less exacting review and ultimately upheld the ban.id.
finally,the second circuit followed the eighth and ninth circuits in rejecting a petitioner claim that a ban violated the constitution.in person new york state board of elections,cir,the court joined its two sister circuits in find ing the record presented to it provides insufficient support for a claim that the ban is akin to the complete prohibition on paying petition circulators as in meyer or that the alternative methods of payment it leaves available are insufficient,id.at citations omitted.the court concluded that the petitioner argument that paying circulators on a basis was the best economic incentive was insufficient to show an unconstitutional burden when balanced against the state interest in preventing fraud in the gathering of signatures.id.
several guide posts can be gleaned from these supreme court and circuit court decisions regarding the character and magnitude of the burden created by ohio requirement.first,the question is,given the sliding scale analysis outlined by the supreme court in meyer,buckley and other decisions.lee keith,cir describing the supreme court flexible approach in similar first amendment cases as a sliding scale.bans on paying circulators,whether outright or partial,can impact political expression in at least three related but distinct ways a ban can reduce the number and hours of voices which will convey the message it can limit the size of the audience of the petition and it can lower the likelihood that a measure will qualify for the statewide ballot.a circulator plays a crucial role in the petition process because the circulator both has to express the petitioner desire for political change and has to discuss the merits of the proposed change.finally,although the availability of other payment methods might reduce the burden,the extent to which the more effective means are foreclosed is an important consideration.
character and magnitude of ohio requirement 
a review of the record evidence shows that ohio requirement would make proposing and qualifying initiatives more expensive,primarily because of the inefficiencies inherent in a system.the evidence also shows that professional circulators would likely not work under a system or at least would choose a system if given the option.the evidence is mixed on how validity rates are affected.moreover,ctr has not pointed to any evidence showing that,outside a relatively small number of professional circulators,there exists a substantial number of people or a demonstrable percentage of ohio population who would participate under a system but not under a system.
there is little dispute that operating under a system will increase the costs of both proposing an initiative and qualifying it for the ballot.first,the ban eliminates the opportunity for a petitioner to enter into a contract with a political consulting firm,signature coordinator,or circulator.under a payment scheme,ctr can contract,for example,for signatures at a fixed price of per signature.the petitioner knows how much money it will need to raise at the outset to qualify its initiative.under ohio provision,however,the petitioner can not enter into a fixed price contract to pay circulators per signature.moreover,does not define the term person.section c of the ohio criminal code states as used in any statute,person includes an individual,corporation,business trust,estate,trust,partnership,and association.thus,a petitioner is prohibited from paying a political consulting firm,signature coordinating firm,or any other business entity to gather a specific number of signatures for a fixed price.in other words,the ban works up and down the chain from petitioner to consulting firm to signature coordinating firm to circulator.thus,the provision adds an element of risk to the petition process which would otherwise be absent.
in addition to the increased risk,petitioners get fewer signatures for their money,according to ctr.circulators are less efficient at gathering signatures than are circulators.the cause for this drop in efficiency is hardly novel basic economic theory instructs that a producer will seek to maximize the output for which she gets paid until the cost to her of producing another marginal unit equals the payment she receives for it.under the provision,the output for which the circulator is to get paid would not be signatures,but rather time worked.thus,the circulator would have an incentive to work as many hours as possible up to the point the wage earned for the marginal unit of time equaled the marginal cost to her of working that unit of time.the circulator primary focus would be on the amount of time worked,not the quality of work product produced.
ctr further asserts that the best,most professional coordinators and circulators are not interested in working under a system.they purportedly can earn more money working on a basis than they can under any other system.tracy taylor testified that his top coordinators that qualified his last two ohio issues refuse to go to ohio on an hourly basis.this reluctance on the part of some professional coordinators and circulators also makes economic sense.if,for example,the professional circulators are more efficient than the average circulator in the sense that they can gather more valid signatures within a given unit of time,they will be financially better off working under a system that rewards them based on their efficiency,rather than a system which pays them based on something for which they do not have a comparative advantage,quantity of time worked.
according to ctr,the cumulative effect of the inefficiencies caused by a system increases the amount of time it takes to collect signatures,further exacerbating the risk of unforeseen costs.as a result,ctr contends that it and other firms are not only less likely to qualify their proposed initiatives for the ballot,but are less likely even to try.the state counters by pointing to the relatively stable numbers of qualifying petitions in oregon before and after it enacted its ban in.the oregon numbers suffer,however,from a similar defect in colorado experience that the supreme court pointed out in meyer the statistic does not reject the possibility that even more petitions would have been successful if paid circulators had been available,or,more narrowly,that petitioners would have had greater success if they had been able to hire extra help.at.
ctr has also presented evidence that circulators paid by the time worked yield lower validity rates than circulators paid by the signature.the evidence is limited,however,and inconclusive.for example,michael arno stated in a declaration that his company validity rates dropped in all three of its petition drives it handled in oregon after the ban went into effect in that state.lee albright,the owner of a petition management company,testified that his firm collected signatures for an initiative in oregon after the ban.his firm ended up collecting twice the number of signatures needed to get the initiative on the ballot because he was afraid that the amateur petition circulators would collect too many invalid signatures.however,ohio has submitted evidence from oregon secretary of state that the average validity rate on petitions actually increased from in to in.at best,ctr has raised a question of fact whether validity rates are lower under a scheme.
finally,the
