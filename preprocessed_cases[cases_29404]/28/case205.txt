in this appeal,we conclude that article i,section,clause of the united states constitution is mandatory,imposing upon a state executive the duty to issue a writ of election when one of her state seats in the united states house of representatives house becomes vacant during a congressional term.because robert taft,governor of ohio governor taft,refused to issue a writ of election when one of ohio seats in the house became vacant due to the expulsion of james traficant,traficant and more than five months remained before the next congress would convene,we hold that governor taft violated article i,section,clause and denied the voters in ohio seventeenth congressional district,including members of the american civil liberties union aclu,their rights to vote and to equal representation in violation of the fourteenth amendment.accordingly,we reverse the district court decision and remand so that the district court may award appropriate declaratory relief and attorney fees to the aclu.
background 
traficant represented the seventeenth ohio congressional district the district from january through july,during the through congresses.on july,the house passed house resolution,expelling traficant from the house.subsequently,governor taft publicly announced that he would not call a special election to fill the house vacancy left by traficant expulsion.governor taft decided,after consulting with local elected officials,not to hold a special election,citing the cost of an election,the difficulty presented by redistricting that was to take effect for the regularly scheduled election in the small length of time an elected replacement could be expected to serve,and the uninterrupted continuation of constituent services by the clerk of the house.the congress was scheduled to adjourn on october,however,it did not adjourn sine die until november.tim ryan was elected to the house by the new seventeenth district at a general election held on november,but did not take office until january.therefore,the old seventeenth district was without representation in the house and had diminished constituent services from july until january.
on august,the aclu filed a verified complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,asserting a claim and pendent claims against governor taft.the aclu prayed for injunctive and declaratory relief,requiring governor taft to call a special election to fill the house vacancy in the district,and for reasonable attorney fees pursuant to.on august,the district court issued oral and written orders denying injunctive relief.on august,the district court issued an opinion and order denying the aclu motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction and dismissing the case,thereby denying a permanent injunction as well.on august,the aclu filed a motion in the sixth circuit requesting emergency injunctive relief pending appeal,which a panel of this court denied on september.

standing and mootness 
jurisdiction,including standing,is assessed under the facts existing when the complaint is filed.cleveland branch,city of parma,cir quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d,cert.denied,d.in order to meet the standing requirements derived from article iii,
a plaintiff must show it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.

the aclu filed the complaint in this action on behalf of its members who reside in and who are electors in the seventeenth ohio congressional district.at compl.in this case,the aclu has demonstrated that its members would have had standing to sue in their own right.cleveland branch,at.the aclu submitted affidavits from louise lefkort,robert sacherman,and carol sacherman,who were all members of the aclu,resided in the old seventeenth district,were registered to vote in that district,and desired to vote in a special election to fill the house seat left vacant by the expulsion of traficant.these members had suffered an actual injury,as they were without representation in the house and had been threatened with the imminent denial of their right to vote.this injury was fairly traceable to governor taft actions because governor taft announced that he was not going to issue a writ of election calling for a special election.this injury would have been redressable by injunctive and declaratory relief,in that an injunction requiring governor taft to issue a writ of election would have allowed residents of the district to exercise their right to vote and to regain representation in the house.
the aclu has also shown that the interests at stake in this case are germane to the organization purpose.the aclu submitted an affidavit from its executive director,christine link,explaining the organization purpose as follows the object of this organization is to aid in maintaining and extending constitutional and other fundamental rights,liberties,privileges,and immunities,and to take all legitimate actions in furtherance of that object without political partisanship.at link aff.emphasis in original.this case addresses citizens right to vote and right to equal representation,which falls squarely within the aclu purpose of guaranteeing constitutional and fundamental rights.finally,this action does not require the participation of individual members of the organization.
while standing is assessed at the outset of the litigation,a case may become moot during the course of litigation,depriving the court of jurisdiction.cleveland branch,at.the doctrines of standing and mootness serve different purposes in essence,standing concerns only whether a plaintiff has a viable claim that a defendant unlawful conduct was occurring at the time the complaint was filed while mootness addresses whether that plaintiff continues to have an interest in the outcome of the litigation.id.at citations omitted.these different purposes are reflected in exceptions to the mootness doctrine,including the doctrine that a case will not become moot if the injury is capable of repetition,while evading review.friends of the earth,at.
at this time,the congress has convened therefore,we can no longer provide appropriate injunctive relief.we can,however,still award declaratory relief and attorney fees,provided the case has not become moot.vacancies in the house can happen near the end of a congressional term,making it difficult for litigation to provide an effective remedy.see jackson ogilvie,cir.noting,while treating an identical situation,that the case would not be mooted by the inappropriateness of an injunction,that plaintiffs would be entitled to declaratory judgment,and that cases of this type in the election field are peculiarly capable of repetition,yet evading review.quoting moore ogilvie,d,cert.denied,d.in fact,since this case was filed,another house vacancy occurred in ohio third congressional district due to the resignation of tony hall to take a position in the bush administration.we conclude that the injury involved in this case is capable of repetition,while evading review,and thus is not moot.
we agree with the district court conclusion that the aclu action is not barred by the doctrine of laches.where a plaintiff seeks solely equitable relief,his action may be barred by the equitable defense of laches if the plaintiff delayed unreasonably in asserting his rights and the defendant was prejudiced by this delay.central states,southeast and southwest areas pension fund,cir.in this case,governor taft announced on july,that he was not going to call a special election to fill the vacancy in the district.the aclu filed on august,eleven days later,its complaint,its motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,and its supporting memorandum.it is true that in kay austin,cir,we held that a plaintiff seeking to be named on a presidential primary ballot was barred from obtaining injunctive relief because he delayed bringing suit until days after he knew the choice of candidates had been made.in kay,however,the defendant secretary of state introduced evidence specifically demonstrating how this short delay had prejudiced the defendant,in that the secretary provided evidence that most of the costs associated with the elections preparations had been expended during this delay.id.
in this case,each day that passed may have made it more difficult to hold a special election however,there is no evidence in the record indicating specifically how this short delay prejudiced governor taft.likewise,there is no evidence that governor taft had expended money or made alternate preparations during the delay.we conclude that the passage of eleven days was not unreasonable delay.moreover,we conclude that governor taft has not sufficiently demonstrated that he was prejudiced by this delay.
article i,section,clause 
article i,section,clause of the united states constitution addresses the mechanism for filling vacancies in the house that occur during a congressional term,providing when vacancies happen in the representation from any state,the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of elections to fill such vacancies.article i,section,clause gives primary control over the election of senators and representatives to the states,providing the times,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations,except as to the place of chusing senators.congress,in turn,has enacted,indicating that states have the authority to determine the time of elections,providing the time for holding elections in any state,district,or territory for a representative or delegate to fill a vacancy,whether such vacancy is caused by a failure to elect at the time prescribed by law,or by the death,resignation,or incapacity of a person elected,may be prescribed by the laws of the several states and territories respectively.the district court concluded that the considerable discretion given to state government officials to determine election procedures,particularly the discretion to set a time for a special election to replace a representative,applied to the decision of whether to hold such a special election at all.the aclu argues that article i,section,clause is mandatory therefore the government must call for a special election.
given the infrequency of house vacancies,and the even greater infrequency of governors refusing to call special elections to fill them,only one case,jackson ogilvie,deals with such a situation.jackson arose when the governor of illinois refused to call a special election after the death of a representative on august.at.voters brought suit on december,and the district court dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction on march,finding the rights asserted too insubstantial to support jurisdiction,as the relatively short period in which the sixth district will remain unrepresented was not enough to raise constitutional questions.id.at.the seventh circuit reversed in an opinion issued on may,concluding that the district court had erred by dismissing the action due to the limited time that a representative would serve,stating,except in those instances where the period of possible service could truly be deemed de minimis the delegation to the state legislature of this power over procedure does not,in our opinion,alter the character of the governor duty to issue a writ of election.id.at.in so holding,the court found that a special election could still be held on november,the date of the next general election,and concluded that it was not prepared to say as a matter of law that representation from the time the results of the november election will be determined to january,is de minimis.id.at.
in comparing jackson to the instant case,both parties agree that the time periods involved are important they merely disagree on which time periods are important.under illinois law at that time,days had to elapse between the issuance of the writ of election and the election itself.id.at.the seventh circuit held that the governor had a duty to issue a writ at the time of the representative death,which would have allowed an election to be held on january,with eleven months left on the term.id.at.when the district court dismissed the case,an election could have been held on august,with four months left on the term.finally,the seventh circuit refused to hold as a matter of law that the amount of time between the certification of an election held on the next general election date,november,and the beginning of the next term,on january,is de minimis.the aclu emphasizes jackson indication that the time of possible service in the house in this case,november,to january,was not de minimis.conversely,governor taft emphasizes that jackson only conclusively held that an enforceable duty existed when eleven months remained on the term at the time the vacancy occurred.
the parties and the district court cite three other cases that influence our decision in this case.in valenti rockefeller,district court,aff,d,a senate vacancy occurred in june upon the assassination of senator robert kennedy,and state statutory law mandated that the vacancy would be filled in november,as sixty days were required prior to the primary election,and replacement senate elections were to be held in years.the plaintiffs in valenti argued that the operation of state law unconstitutionally denied them their rights to vote and to representation.id.the district court determined that the delay was constitutional when balanced against the state interests of voter turnout and interest of preserving local elections from the more political currents generated by statewide or national contests and of avoiding the economic hardship on senate candidates of financing a campaign in the id.at.in mason casey,wl,at,a house vacancy occurred on september,and state statutory law mandated that the special election would be held at least sixty days after the governor issued a writ of election.like in valenti,the plaintiffs argued that the operation of state law created an unconstitutional delay beyond the plaintiffs proposed date of november,and the district court held the delay which likely was five additional months to be constitutional.id.at.finally,in state ex rel.armstrong davey,ohio,the ohio supreme court ratified the governor decision to set a replacement date at a later date than the plaintiff felt was proper.
like the seventh circuit,we conclude that article i,section,clause is mandatory,requiring the state executive to issue a writ to fill a vacancy in the house we recognize that there may be instances where the time remaining in the congressional term is truly de minimis,thereby excusing the executive from issuing the writ,but the time involved in this case can not be considered de minimis 
we also recognize that article i,section,clause gives states the discretion to determine the times,places,and manner of holding such elections,and that the states have valid interests in ensuring fair and reliable elections.as valenti and mason indicate,legislative balancing between a state interests in ensuring fair and reliable elections,and its citizens rights to vote and to equal representation,is entitled to considerable deference.ohio has exercised its discretion to determine the time,place,and manner of elections by enacting a comprehensive election code.governor taft complains of the expense,inconvenience,and possible inaccuracies that would have accompanied a special election held on november.we point out that the ohio legislature,through its election code,has determined the length of time it considers necessary for conducting such a special election.if the ohio legislature determines that more time is needed to hold such an election,it may amend its election code,and should a need to review such provisions arise,we will accord them appropriate deference.
had ohio election code imposed requirements that made a special election an impossibility in this case,the aclu would have been faced with the burden of proving those enacted requirements were unconstitutional.as governor taft concedes,however,it would have been possible to hold a special election that complied with the requirements imposed by the legislature in the election code to fill the vacancy in the seventeenth district 
in summation,we conclude that article i,section,clause imposed a mandatory duty upon governor taft to hold a special election to fill the vacancy in the district created by the expulsion of traficant.although there may be situations where an executive duty is excused because the time remaining on the congressional term is truly de minimis,this was not such a situation.while legislative balancing of the state and its voters interests is entitled to deference,a special election that complied with ohio election code could have been held in this case.therefore,we hold that governor taft violated his duty to call a special election under article i,section,clause and denied aclu members the rights to vote and to equal protection in violation of the fourteenth amendment.these constitutional violations entitle the aclu to declaratory relief pursuant to and and to reasonable attorney fees pursuant to.
iii.conclusion 
we conclude that the district court committed errors of law,and thus abused its discretion by failing to award the aclu appropriate equitable and declaratory relief.accordingly,we reverse the district court decision and remand this case so the district court may award appropriate declaratory relief and attorney fees to the aclu.
the majority holds that governor taft was required by article i,cl.of the constitution to hold a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the expulsion of congressman james traficant from the house of representatives.i do not believe the united states constitution required governor taft to hold a special election in the circumstances of this case and so i must dissent.
our constitution grants limited,enumerated powers to the federal government,while reserving the remainder of the governing authority to the states.beyond the unenumerated powers retained by the states,the constitution delegates to them certain tasks necessary for the proper administration and functioning of the federal government.one such task is the duty imposed by article i,cl,which provides that w hen vacancies happen in the representation from any state,the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies,art.i,cl.
although clause uses the imperative shall,that should not be understood as a universal and absolute command to act without regard to the facts and circumstances that bear directly upon the purpose of section.that is so,not only as a matter of common sense,but also because,under our constitution,t he states retain a residuary and inviolable sovereignty.they are not relegated to the role of mere provinces or political corporations,but retain the dignity,though not the full authority,of sovereignty.alden maine,d quoting the federalist,at james madison clinton rossiter.in interpreting clause and similar provisions of the federal constitution,we are obligated to take cognizance of the principles of federalism and comity that inhere in our unique system of dual sovereignty.implicit in these principles is the obvious proposition that the constitution does not impose upon the states the obligation to take action,which,in the circumstances at hand,would be wasteful,imprudent,and manifestly ineffective to carry into effect the purpose of the constitutional mandate.
the authors of clause were not theoreticians given to creating mindless formalisms that,if applied literally,woodenly,or mechanistically,would require the states to take action in obedience to the verb shall,which,under the circumstances,is foolish,wasteful,and probably ineffective.
neither constitutional textualism,originalism,nor any other interpretive ism requires that,in carrying out the mandate of clause,a governor abandon all common sense and reasonableness and become,instead,a mere issuing clerk when a vacanc y happen s in a state congressional representation.
as justice oliver wendell holmes,speaking for the supreme court,stated,albeit with regard to a different constitutional provision 
the interpretation of constitutional principles must not be too literal.we must remember that the machinery of government would not work if it were not allowed a little play in its joints.
bain peanut of pinson.that play in its joints must certainly include a governor discretion to respond to the mandatory language of clause in a reasonably sensible manner.
with these principles in mind,i conclude that,given the circumstances governor taft faced when former congressman traficant was expelled from congress,he was not required under clause to call a special election.the vacancy in the district happen ed on july,slightly more than three months before the general election and less than six months before the end of the congressional term.
after taking into account the public notice requirements of ohio election laws and the need for a primary election and a general election,governor taft concluded,and the plaintiff has conceded,that the earliest practical date on which a special election could have been held was november,the date of the general election.in order to have held a special election on the date of the general election,the financially strapped counties that comprised the district would have been required to expend significant amounts of money and effort to give notice of the vacancy to potential candidates,print primary as well as general election ballots,pay additional election workers to staff the polling stations,certify the results,and allow for possible challenges.
in addition to these demands on the resources of the affected ohio counties,the governor was faced with a unique circumstance that could only have added further confusion to the already confusing necessity of conducting a special election together with the regular general election.as the majority points out,the district was redrawn in.the old district represented by traficant comprised mahoning and columbiana counties and parts of trumbull county.but the decennial census required reapportionment and resulted in a new district comprising parts of mahoning,trumbull,portage,and summit counties.consequently,on election day,some voters in the affected counties would have had the option of voting for two congressional candidates,neither of whom was an incumbent district congressman one to fill the vacancy in the old district and another to represent the new district in the next session of congress.adding to the confusion,voters whose precincts were recently added to the district would have been eligible to vote for only one candidate and could not have participated at all in the special election.with this confusing array of possibilities,candidates and election workers would have faced
