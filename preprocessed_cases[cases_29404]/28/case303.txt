since,montana has selected its judges through nonpartisan popular elections.ann.further to this end,montana makes it a criminal offense for any political party to endorse,contribute to,or make an expenditure to support or oppose a judicial candidate,ann,and individuals who facilitate such activities may also be held criminally liable,ann.the voters of montana are thus deprived of the full and robust exchange of views to which,under our constitution,they are entitled.
appellant sanders county republican central committee the committee seeks to endorse judicial candidates and to enable the expenditures that would make those views publicly known.the committee argues that montana ban on political party endorsements is an unconstitutional restriction of its first amendment rights of free speech and association on may,the committee filed suit against montana commissioner of political practices james murry and against montana attorney general steven bullock seeking injunctive relief and a declaration that the statute is unconstitutional.on june,the district court denied the committee motion for a preliminary injunction.the committee appeals that decision and seeks immediate injunctive relief to prevent montana from enforcing the statute against the committee and its members.we have jurisdiction under a.for the following reasons,we reverse the district court and grant immediate injunctive relief.
a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.thalheimer city of san diego,cir quoting winter nrdc,d.a denial of a preliminary injunction is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion.alliance for the wild rockies cottrell,cir.however,where a district court denial of a preliminary injunction motion rests solely on a premise of law and the facts are either established or undisputed,our review is de novo.sammartano first judicial dist,cir.in the instant case,where the essential issues are matters of law,we review the district court conclusions de novo.
likelihood of success on the merits 
protected speech 
when seeking a preliminary injunction in the first amendment context,the moving party bears the initial burden of making a colorable claim that its first amendment rights have been infringed,or are threatened with infringement,at which point the burden shifts to the government to justify the restriction.thalheimer,at.here,there can be no question that the committee has carried its initial burden.
as the supreme court has found,t he first amendment has its fullest and most urgent application to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.citizens united fed.election comm n,d quoting eu cnty.democratic cent,d see also buckley valeo,d advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates for federal office is no less entitled to protection under the first amendment than the discussion of political policy generally or advocacy of the passage or defeat of legislation.thus,political speech including the endorsement of candidates for office is at the core of speech protected by the first amendment.
this protection extends as much to political parties exercising their right of association as to individuals.as this court stated in geary renne,because the exercise of these basic first amendment freedoms traditionally has been through the media of political associations,political parties as well as party adherents enjoy rights of political expression and association,cir en banc,rev on other grounds,renne geary,d.more recently,the supreme court,in extending first amendment protection of political speech to corporations,reaffirmed that t he court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of corporations or other associations should be treated differently under the first amendment simply because such associations are not natural persons.citizens united.at 
the threat to infringement of such first amendment rights is at its greatest when,as here,the state employs its criminalizing powers.as the supreme court further found in citizens united,i f the first amendment has any force,it prohibits congress from fining or jailing citizens,or associations of citizens,for simply engaging in political speech.at.thus,the committee has clearly shown that section,on its face,restricts the committee exercise of its first amendment rights.
strict scrutiny 
the burden therefore shifts to montana to attempt to justify the restriction.see thalheimer,at.as a preliminary matter,the court must determine what standard it must apply to the assessment of such alleged justifications strict scrutiny or balancing.while the district court applied strict scrutiny,montana argues that this court should apply a balancing test that weighs against the committee first amendment rights the state tenth amendment right to structure its judicial institutions as it deems fit.
but while the tenth amendment preserves to the states the power to regulate the roles that political parties may play in the design of judicial and other institutions,that does not imply that the states have similar leeway in placing restrictions upon a political association right to speak.see eu,at a state broad power to regulate the time,place,and manner of elections does not extinguish the state responsibility to observe the limits established by the first amendment rights of the state citizens.quoting tashjian republican party of,d geary,at reinhardt,j,concurring t here is all the difference in the world between refusing to delegate to political parties the decision as to which candidates appear on the ballot and prohibiting political party organizations from announcing their views on the merits of candidates seeking public office.
thus,we find that because the statute here at issue is,on its face,a restriction on political speech and association,and thereby threatens to abridge a fundamental right,it is subject to strict scrutiny,which requires the government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.citizens united.at quoting fed.election comm.right to life,d see also geary,at applying strict scrutiny in striking down california ban on political party endorsements of candidates for nonpartisan office 
compelling interest and narrow tailoring 
the district court found,and the parties do not here dispute,that montana has a compelling interest in maintaining a fair and independent judiciary.where montana and the district court err,however,is in supposing that preventing political parties from endorsing judicial candidates is a necessary prerequisite to maintaining a fair and independent judiciary.see united states alvarez,d the first amendment requires that the government chosen restriction on the speech at issue be actually necessary to achieve its interest.city of paul,d t he danger of censorship presented by a facially statute requires that that weapon be employed only where it is necessary to serve the asserted compelling interest.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.montana offers no evidence to support this facially doubtful proposition,and it flies in the face of the fact that many of the other states that elect their judges not only allow party endorsements but require party nominations nor does montana suggest that,as a result,the judiciaries of these other states lack fairness or integrity.see republican party of white,d kennedy,concurring many elected state judges,despite the difficulties imposed by the election system,have discovered in the law the enlightenment,instruction,and inspiration that make them and faithful jurists of real integrity.it may be,of course,that montana reasonably believes that restricting political endorsements of judicial candidates enhances the independence of its judiciary but such supposed best practices are not remotely sufficient to survive strict scrutiny.
under a strict scrutiny standard,therefore,montana lacks a compelling interest in forbidding political parties fr
