alaska right to life committee akrtl challenges certain aspects of alaska campaign finance law,alaska stat.et.prior to the alaska gubernatorial election,akrtl was informed by the alaska public offices commission that if it wished to engage in electioneering communications as a nongroup entity,it would have to comply with registration,reporting,notification,and requirements.akrtl brought suit in federal district court based on the first amendment,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against these requirements.on for summary judgment,the district court upheld the alaska law.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
akrtl is a nonprofit corporation headquartered in anchorage,alaska.it describes itself as a association that seeks to promote its perspective to the alaska public.it describes its major purpose as promoting a consensus in alaska public through the presentation of its pro life message.it seeks to accomplish its goals through various forms of communication to the public,including a newsletter,telemarketing,and the internet.akrtl states that it is not affiliated with any political party,political candidate,or campaign committee.
akrtl is affiliated with the alaska right to life political action committee and alaska right to life,akrtl.is an advocacy organization,and akrtl is a educational organization.the three entities share the same director and the same board of directors.the degree of financial separation among the three entities is unclear from the record.is registered as a group with the alaska public offices commission apoc,which interprets and enforces alaska campaign finance disclosure law.akrtl is not registered.
fundraising by akrtl is primarily accomplished through telemarketing campaigns.in,akrtl developed a proposed telemarketing campaign costing more than the monetary threshold under alaska law that would mention candidates names discuss political issues that were relevant to the gubernatorial election on november,and state the candidates position on those issues.specific language that akrtl planned to use in the campaign was as follows 
alaska right to life is always on the forefront of implementing legislation within our state,such as banning partial birth abortion,establishing parental consent and stopping state funding.we believe these are important issues affecting all alaskans.frank murkowski supports alaska right to life vision by supporting a ban on partial birth abortion,establishing parental consent and stopping state funding.but fran ulmer stands in opposition to these measures.please be sure to vote.
frank murkowski and fran ulmer were,respectively,the republican and democratic candidates for governor in.
in late september,the lawyer now representing akrtl made general telephone inquiries to apoc concerning alaska campaign finance law without revealing the identity of his client.the same lawyer made two later inquiries,again without identifying his client.finally,on november,local alaska counsel provided a draft complaint,signed by akrtl,to the alaska attorney general office.the local counsel indicated that he planned to file the complaint the next day.the draft complaint asked for a temporary restraining order allowing akrtl to engage in a telemarketing campaign prior to the november,election using the language.
apoc responded by telephone and letter.the letter,dated november,noted that akrtl by which it appears to have meant had already registered under the alaska statute.the letter also noted that the fundraising was intended to benefit the committee by which it appears to have meant akrtl.apoc approved the proposed communication on the assumption that,which had previously registered with apoc as a group,would be the entity making the telephone calls.apoc specified that because the script includes an electioneering communication,the costs must be paid for with funds.
akrtl did not file its proposed complaint on november.instead,on november,akrtl or suit in federal district court,naming as defendants brook miles,andrea jacobson,larry wood,mark handley,john dapcevich,and sheila gallagher in their official capacities as director and members of apoc collectively apoc.as noted above,akrtl unlike has not registered under alaska campaign finance law.
akrtl challenged five provisions of the alaska law the definition of electioneering communication the requirement that it register before making campaign finance expenditures the requirement that it make reports the requirement that it notify contributors and potential contributors that their contributions may be used to influence an election and the requirement that it disclose in its communications who is paying for the communication.akrtl contended that these provisions violate the first amendment both facially and as applied.
the district court granted summary judgment to apoc.akrtl appealed everything except the district court approval of the notification requirement for contributors issue,above.we have jurisdiction under and.we affirm.
ii.statutory background 
alaska has a long history of regulating political influence and campaign finance,beginning in when the alaska legislature passed a statute requiring lobbyists to register.alaska sess.law ch.in,alaska adopted a law limiting individual contributions to candidates,limiting the amount of money candidates could spend,and requiring that written receipts for all expenditures promoting candidates that exceeded be filed with the state election commission.alaska sess.law ch.
a report commissioned by the alaska state senate revealed that public confidence and trust in the integrity of the legislature was disturbingly low and that this was attributable in part to calculated evasions of the purpose and spirit of campaign laws.alaska alaska civil liberties union akclu,alaska quoting the report.a former member of the state house of representatives stated that t he constant refrain i heard from citizens was that the legislature was owned by special interests and that nothing was going to change the corruption caused by big money.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in,alaska passed a comprehensive campaign reform statute,commonly referred to as sb.sb contained a finding that the purpose of this act is to substantially revise alaska election campaign finance laws in order to restore the public trust in the electoral process and to foster good government.alaska sess.law ch.under sb,independent expenditures by an entity supporting or opposing a candidate for state office were banned unless the entity qualified as a group.akclu,at.a group was defined as any combination of two or more individuals acting jointly who organize for the principal purpose of influencing the outcome of one or more elections and who take action the major purpose of which is to influence the outcome of an election.id.at.all entities not qualifying as groups were banned from making such independent expenditures.
in,the supreme court of alaska upheld most of sb in akclu.the court upheld the ban on expenditures by what it called nongroup entities,but only after defining that term narrowly.guided by the united states supreme court decisions in federal election commission massachusetts citizens for life,d,and austin michigan chamber of commerce,d,the alaska court defined nongroup entities as organizations potentially able to amass great wealth through advantages.akclu,at.included in the court definition of nongroup entities were corporations and labor unions.at.excluded from its definition were entities that can not participate in business activities,have no shareholders who have a claim on corporate earnings,and are independent from the influence of business corporations.the court held that entities,so defined,could constitutionally be banned from making independent expenditures to support or oppose candidates.id.at.entities excluded from the court definition of nongroup entities were not banned by the statute from making such expenditures.id.at.
a separate challenge to sb was brought in federal district court.the district court stayed proceedings until the alaska supreme court decided akclu.after that decision became final,the district court ruled on the constitutionality of two provisions of sb that had not been addressed in akclu.jacobus state of alaska,d.the district court struck down a per year limitation on contributions by individuals to political parties,as well as a limitation on professional services volunteered by individuals on behalf of a candidate or ballot proposition when the services were those for which that individual would ordinarily be paid a fee or wage.id.at.on appeal,we upheld the statutory limitation on soft money contributions,but struck down the limitation on individual volunteer services.jacobus state of alaska,cir.
partly in response to the decisions by the alaska supreme court in akclu and the federal district court in jacobus,the alaska legislature significantly amended alaska campaign finance law in and.preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption,as well as providing information to voters,were cited by various members of the state legislature as compelling interests supporting the amendments.as representative jeanette james stated during debates on the amendments,the primary focus of campaign finance laws is to inform the public,and that wherever there is money involved in affecting policy in the state,either by law or by choice,the public has a right to know.
among other things,the and amendments extended various disclosure requirements to nongroup entities.as a result,nongroup entities became subject to the same disclosure rules as groups.
the amendments also provided a broad definition of electioneering communication,thereby closing a loophole that had allowed evasion of disclosure requirements if the use of certain,specified words was avoided in advertisements.this new broad definition was influenced by our description of the magic words requirement,and its associated problems,in federal election commission furgatch,cir 
a test requiring the magic words elect,support,or their nearly perfect synonyms for a finding of express advocacy would preserve the first amendment right of unfettered expression only at the expense of eviscerating the federal election campaign act.independent campaign spenders working on behalf of candidates could remain just beyond the reach of the act by avoiding certain key words while conveying a message that is unmistakably directed to the election or defeat of a named candidate.
finally,and somewhat confusingly,the amendments essentially adopted as their definition of nongroup entities the alaska supreme court description in akclu of entities that had been excluded from that court definition of nongroup entities in sb.under akclu,nongroup entities were defined to include only organizations,such as business corporations and labor unions,that were capable of amassing great wealth through advantages.nongroup entities,so defined,were banned by sb from making independent expenditures.other groups nor nongroup entities were permitted to make independent expenditures under sb.now,under the new amendments,those other entities were called nongroup entities.under the newly adopted alaska stat,
nongroup entity means a person,other than an individual,that takes action the major purpose of which is to influence the outcome of an election,and that 
a can not participate in business activities 
b does not have shareholders who have a claim on corporate earnings and 
c is independent from the influence of business corporations.
a nongroup entity under the newly adopted amendments is not banned from making expenditures.nongroup entities are merely required to make various forms of disclosure in connection with their expenditures.
akrtl first amendment challenge is addressed to disclosures now required of nongroup entities that make expenditures.
iii.mootness 
akrtl suit is not moot simply because the election has come and gone.we have held that election cases often fall within the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to the mootness doctrine,because the inherently brief duration of an election is almost invariably too short to enable full litigation on the merits.cal.council,getman,cir quoting porter jones,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the provisions of alaska law challenged by akrtl remain in place,and there is sufficient likelihood that akrtl will again be required to comply with them that its appeal is not moot.
iv.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see buono norton,cir.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.
discussion 
on appeal to this court,akrtl argues that it can not be required to make disclosures as a condition of making expenditures for electioneering communications as those terms are defined under alaska stat,and.the centerpiece of akrtl first amendment challenge is its argument that the definition of electioneering communications is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.in addition,akrtl challenges three specific disclosure requirements.first,it challenges the requirement that a entity register under alaska stat.a before it can make an expenditure under alaska stat.second,it challenges the requirement that a entity report expenditures under alaska stat.d,e,and j,i,b,and a.third,it challenges the requirement that a nongroup entity disclose under alaska stat.and b that it is paying for a communication.
none of the challenged provisions limits the amount of money a nongroup entity such as akrtl may spend.rather,the provisions require only that certain forms of disclosure be made.with that in mind,we consider akrtl challenges.
definition of electioneering communications 
as a result of the and amendments,nongroup entities are required to make disclosures in connection with their expenditures.for example,a nongroup entity making an expenditure must register with apoc as required by a nongroup entity making an expenditure is required to make a full report of that expenditure under d a nongroup entity is prohibited by from making an expenditure in an election for candidates for elective office unless it has registered with apoc a nongroup entity may not make an expenditure unless the source of the expenditure has been disclosed as required by b and a nongroup entity making an independent expenditure supporting or opposing a candidate for election to public office is required by b to disclose the source of the expenditure.
an expenditure is defined as the transfer of anything of value for the purpose of making an express communication or an electioneering communication.alaska stat.a and c.an expenditure does not include the transfer of something of value for making an issues communication.id.at c 
the various forms of communication referred to in the section defining expenditure are defined as follows 
c ommunication means an announcement or advertisement disseminated through print or broadcast media,including radio,television,cable,and satellite,the internet,or through a mass mailing,excluding those placed by an individual or nongroup entity and costing or less and those that do not directly or indirectly identify a candidate or proposition,as that term is defined in as c.
e xpress communication means a communication that,when read as a whole and with limited reference to outside events,is susceptible of no other reasonable interpretation but as an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.
e lectioneering communication means a communication that 
a directly or indirectly identifies a candidate 
b addresses an issue of national,state,or local political importance and attributes a position on that issue to the candidate identified and 
c occurs within the days preceding a general or municipal election.
i ssues communication means a communication that 
a directly or indirectly identifies a candidate and 
b addresses an issue of national,state,or local political importance and does not support or oppose a candidate for election to public office.
akrtl argues that the definition of electioneering communication is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad,both on its face and as applied.the alaska definition of electioneering communication is comparable to the definition of the same term in the federal bipartisan campaign reform act of bcra.electioneering communication is defined under bcra as any broadcast,cable,or satellite communication that 
i refers to a clearly identified candidate for federal office 
ii is made within 
aa days before a general,special,or runoff election for the office sought by the candidate or 
bb days before a primary or preference election,or a convention or caucus of a political party that has authority to nominate a candidate,for the office sought by the candidate and 
iii in the case of a communication which refers to a candidate for an office other than president or vice president,is targeted to the relevant electorate.
f a i.a communication is targeted to the relevant electorate if it can be received by or more persons in the congressional district or state.id.at f c.
the definition of electioneering communication under alaska law is different from the federal definition of that same term in the following respects.first,under alaska law,the communication must identify a candidate for office directly or indirectly.under the federal law,the communication must identify a candidate clearly.second,under alaska law,the communication must address an issue of national,state or local political importance,and must attribute a position on that issue to the candidate.under federal law,the content of the communication is not specified however,with the exception of communications referring to candidates for the presidency and the,the communication must be targeted to the relevant electorate.third,under alaska law,the communication must occur within days of any general or municipal election.under federal law,the communication must occur within days of a general or comparable election,or within days of a primary or comparable election.
we have little trouble concluding that the definition of electioneering communication contained in is not unconstitutionally vague,either facially or as applied.in mcconnell federal election commission,d,the supreme court upheld the federal definition of electioneering communication in bcra against a facial vagueness challenge.the court did not merely uphold the definition as constitutionally permissible indeed,because the definition was so obviously constitutional,the court also did not narrow the definition by judicial construction in order to avoid a constitutional question.the court wrote 
w e observe that the definition of electioneering communication raises none of the vagueness concerns that drove our analysis in buckley valeo,d.the term electioneering communication applies only to a broadcast clearly identifying a candidate for federal office,aired within a specific time period,and targeted to an identified audience of at least viewers or listeners.these components are both easily understood and objectively determinable.thus,the constitutional objection that persuaded the court in buckley to limit feca reach to express advocacy is simply inapposite here.
at.internal citations omitted.
from the standpoint of vagueness,there are only two possibly significant differences between the federal and the alaska definition of electioneering communication.first,under the federal definition,the candidate must be identified clearly.by contrast,under the alaska definition,the candidate must be identified directly or indirectly.second,under the federal definition,the content of the communication is not described beyond what might be implicit in the requirement that the communication be targeted to the relevant electorate.by contrast,under the alaska definition,the communication must address an issue of national,state,or local political importance and attribute a position on that issue to the candidate identified.we take these two differences in turn.
facial challenge to candidate identification 
akrtl argues that the definition of electioneering communication is unconstitutionally vague on its face because the candidate must be identified directly or indirectly rather than clearly,as in the federal definition.specifically,akrtl argues that the use of the word indirectly is constitutionally fatal.we disagree.
the federal and the alaska definitions operate in the same way.under both definitions,if the candidate is identified by the communication,it is an electioneering communication.under both definitions,it does not matter how the identification of the candidate takes place.the federal definition specifies no method of identification.the alaska definition specifies that the method may be direct or indirect however,since the words direct and indirect together describe the complete universe of possible methods of identification,the alaska statute has the actual effect of requiring no specific method of identification,just like the federal definition.
if the alaska definition had only used the word directly,omitting the word indirectly,it would have left open the possibility that a communication identifying a candidate would have escaped regulation.as we stated in rejecting the magic words approach in our opinion in furgatch,
a proper understanding of the speaker message can best be obtained by considering speech as a whole.comprehension often requires inferences from the relation of one part of speech to another.the entirety may give a clear impression that is never succinctly stated in a single phrase or sentence.
the alaska legislature chose two words directly and indirectly that in combination were well suited to its purpose of regulating campaign communications identifying particular candidates.indirectly is an easily understood word in common english usage.in the context in which it is used,it is neither vague nor difficult to understand.we therefore reject akrtl facial vagueness challenge to the definition of electioneering communication.
facial challenge to requirement that the 
communication address an issue of national,state,or local political importance 
the alaska definition of electioneering communication requires that the communication address an issue of national,state,or local political importance.akrtl argues that this provision of the alaska definition is unconstitutionally vague on its face.we disagree.
the challenged provision restricts the scope of the definition so that it covers only certain kinds of communication.by comparison,the only restriction in the federal definition is that the communication be targeted to the relevant electorate.the supreme court in mcconnell upheld the federal definition against a vagueness challenge,despite the failure to describe the content of an electioneering communication except for whatever description might be implicit in the phrase relevant electorate.in our view,relevant,as used in the federal definition,is at least as vague a term as the phrase addresses an issue of national,state,or local political importance,as used in the alaska definition.in context,the requirement in the federal definition that the communication be targeted to the relevant electorate pretty clearly means that the communication must concern some issue of political importance to that electorate.but,of course,issue and political importance are precisely the words used in the alaska statute.those words are accompanied by the words national,state,or local,but,if anything,those words make the provision less rather than more vague.
vagueness challenge 
we also reject akrtl vagueness challenge.an electioneering communication as defined under alaska law,clearly applies to akrtl proposed telephone message.that proposed message specifically identifies,by name,the republican and democratic gubernatorial candidates,frank murkowski and fran ulmer.akrtl proposed communication also clearly addresses an issue of national,state,or local political importance.indeed,the proposed communication itself refers to the issues of banning partial birth abortion,establishing parental consent and stopping state funding,and then states,we believe these are important issues affecting all alaskans.
overbreadth 
we also have little trouble concluding that the definition of electioneering communication is not unconstitutionally overbroad.akrtl argues that the definition of electioneering communication is not restricted to express advocacy or its functional equivalent,and that electioneering communication under alaska law can be interpreted to include issue advocacy.akrtl further argues that if the definition of electioneering communication includes issue advocacy,the definition is unconstitutionally overbroad.we disagree.
facial overbreadth 
akrtl argument is based on the supreme court analysis of the federal election campaign act of in buckley valeo,d.in buckley,the court construed a provision of the act that limited expenditures relative to a clearly identified candidate to per year.e,supp.iv.influenced by the first amendment,the court construed that provision to apply only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.at.employing what have later been called magic words,the court noted that the limitation on expenditures applied only to expenditures for communications containing express words of advocacy of election or defeat,such as vote for,elect,support,cast your ballot for,smith for congress,vote against,defeat,reject.id.at.
in mcconnell,the supreme court retreated from its statements in buckley.plaintiffs in mcconnell challenged the federal definition of electioneering communication in bcra,arguing that buckley drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy and issue advocacy,and that speakers possess an invaluable first amendment right to engage in the latter category of speech.at.the court in mcconnell emphasized that the distinction drawn in buckley between express advocacy and issue advocacy was not constitutionally compelled,but was rather the product of statutory interpretation rather than a constitutional command.id.at.in short,the concept of express advocacy and the concomitant class of magic words were born of an effort to avoid constitutional infirmities.id.
despite the court retreat from buckley in mcconnell,akrtl argues that alaska definition of electioneering communications is overbroad because it includes issue advocacy.we disagree for two reasons.
first,akrtl is incorrect in arguing that issue advocacy is included in the alaska definition of electioneering communications.under alaska law,electioneering communications have a distinct and definition from issues communications.the disclosure requirements to which akrtl objects are triggered only by an expenditure that supports an express communication or an electioneering communication.alaska stat.c.the disclosure requirement is not triggered by an expenditure that supports an issues communication.id.the statute states explicitly,e xpenditure includes an express communication and an electioneering communication,but does not include an issues communication.id.emphasis added.
under the alaska law,an issues communication is defined as a communication that a directly or indirectly identifies a candidate and b addresses an issue of national,state,or local political importance and does not support or oppose a candidate for election to public office.id.at emphasis added.this definition of issues communication is fully consistent with buckley definition of issues advocacy.even if we were to agree with akrtl argument that issue advocacy can not constitutionally come within the definition of electioneering communication,we would be compelled by the plain words of the alaska statute to conclude that issue advocacy is not included within that definition.
second,as the supreme court noted in mcconnell,the line between express and issues advocacy is,in any event,not constitutionally compelled.in construing the federal definition of electioneering communication under bcra,the court upheld the constitutionality of the definition without applying the buckley distinction between the two kinds of advocacy.the court wrote 
nor are we persuaded that the first amendment erects a rigid barrier between express advocacy and issue advocacy.that notion can not be squared with our longstanding recognition that the presence or absence of magic words can not meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech from a true issue ad not only can advertisers easily evade the line by eschewing the use of magic words,but they would seldom choose to use such words even if permitted.and although the resulting advertisements do not urge the viewer to vote for or against a candidate in so many words,they are no less clearly intended to influence the election.buckley express advocacy line,in short,has not aided the legislative effort to combat real or apparent corruption,and congress enacted bcra to correct the flaws in the existing system.
at.footnote omitted see also aclu of heller,cir after mcconnell,the line between express and all other speech is not constitutionally material.
overbreadth as applied 
alaska definition of electioneering communications as applied to akrtl proposed telephone message is not unconstitutionally overbroad as applied to akrtl proposed telephone message.that proposed message refers to several issues concerning abortion,ascribes positions on those issues to the two gubernatorial candidates,and urges the listener to vote.under any reasonable understanding of that message,the listener is being urged to vote for or against these two candidates based on the positions described in the message.such a message is clearly regulable under both buckley and mcconnell.
disclosure requirements 
akrtl challenges three different kind of disclosures that a nongroup entity must make if it wishes to make an electioneering communication.first,the entity must register with apoc.second,the entity must report expenditures.
third,the entity must disclose that it is paying for its communications.
akrtl argues that these disclosure requirements violate its first amendment rights.in part its argument depends on its we have just the definition of electioneering communication is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.but in part its argument depends on a contention that because it is an mcfl organization,as described in federal election commission massachusetts citizens for life,d mcfl,it is protected by the first amendment from having to make such disclosures.
we agree with akrtl that it is a nongroup entity under alaska law,and that such an entity is an mcfl organization.we also agree that mcfl organizations have greater protections under the first amendment than traditional business corporations.however,we disagree with akrtl contention that alaska disclosure requirements violate the first amendment rights of an mcfl organization.
mcfl organizations 
we begin our analysis with a description of the supreme court holding in mcfl.massachusetts citizens for life,mcfl,a nonprofit,nonstock corporation,brought a first amendment challenge to a provision of the federal election campaign act of.section imposed certain requirements on all corporations making expenditures in connection with any federal election.among other things,required that campaign expenditures not come from money in the corporation general fund.instead,such expenditures had to come from a separate,segregated fund.the money in that fund could come only from voluntary contributions earmarked for that purpose by the donors.id.at.
in its majority opinion,the court distinguished between a traditional corporatio n organized for economic gain and a corporation like mcfl.id.at.in the court view,a traditional organization that amass es great wealth in the marketplace,id.at.be regulated to a greater extent.the court defined a corporation like mcfl as having three critical features first,it was formed for the express purpose of promoting political ideas,and can not engage in business activities.second,it has no shareholders or other affiliated persons with a claim on assets or earnings.third,it was not established as a business corporation or labor union,and it is its policy not to accept contributions from such organizations.id.at.
the court majority in mcfl construed to apply only to expenditures and contributions for express advocacy.id.at.it then held that an organization meeting the above criteria could not constitutionally be required to maintain a separate,segregated fund containing money specifically solicited for campaign contributions.it wrote,the limitation on solicitation in this case means that nonmember corporations can hardly raise any funds at all to engage in political speech warranting the highest constitutional protection.id.at.the court held that the limitation contained in could not be constitutionally applied to corporations meeting the mcfl criteria because it was too broad a prophylactic rule.id.
the federal election commission fec had advanced two primary justifications for applying to mcfl.first,the fec had argued that organizations might use an individual money for purposes not supported by that individual.it contended that even if contributors may be aware that a contribution to appellee will be used for political purposes in general,they may not wish such money to be used for electoral campaigns in particular.id.at.the court majority responded by noting that this concern could be met by means far more narrowly tailored and less burdensome,simply by requiring that contributors be informed that their money may be used for such a purpose.id.second,the fec had argued that if the requirements of were not applicable to mcfl,this would open the door to massive undisclosed political spending by similar entities,and to their use as conduits for undisclosed spending by business corporations and unions.id.at.the majority responded by noting that whatever interest the government had in disclosure was satisfied by another,unchallenged provision of the statute under which mcfl was required to report information about independent expenditures of as little as.id.the court therefore concluded that the fec had not advanced a compelling state interest sufficient to justify the application of to mcfl.id.at.emphasis in original.
degree of scrutiny 
the degree of scrutiny that we must apply to alaska disclosure requirements for nongroup entities is somewhat unclear.in buckley,the court applied exacting scrutiny to various disclosure requirements in the federal election campaign act,including disclosures of contributions as small as or to and independent candidates,and disclosures by those who make independent contributions and expenditures.buckley,at.see also id.at.t he constitutionality of e turns on whether the governmental interests advanced in its support satisfy the exacting scrutiny applicable to limitations on core first amendment rights of political expression.emphasis added.exacting scrutiny,in the words of buckley,required that a substantial relation be shown between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed.id.at.this exacting scrutiny standard in buckley was later characterized by the court as requiring that a restriction on corporate political expenditures be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.austin,at.citing buckley,at.
in mcconnell,the court appears to have relaxed the degree of scrutiny.it explicitly applied a less exacting scrutiny to campaign contributions.it wrote 
because the electoral process is the very means through which a free society democratically translates political speech into concrete governmental action,contribution limits,like other measures aimed at protecting the integrity of the process,tangibly benefit public participation in political debate.for that reason,when reviewing congress decision to enact contribution limits,there is no place for a strong presumption against constitutionality,of the sort often thought to accompany the words strict scrutiny.
at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the court was not as explicit about the appropriate standard of scrutiny with respect to disclosure requirements.however,in addressing extensive reporting requirements applicable to money gathered and disbursed to finance electioneering communications as that term is defined in bcra,the court did not apply strict scrutiny or require a compelling state interest.see id.at.describing disclosure requirements.rather,the court upheld the disclosure requirements as supported merely by important state interests.id.at.we agree with the district court that the important state interests that prompted the buckley court to uphold feca disclosure requirements apply in full to bcra.emphasis added.in the court view,those important state interests amply support ed application of the disclosure requirements to the entire range of electioneering communications.id.
in our recent opinion in heller,relying on mcintyre ohio elections commission,d,we applied strict scrutiny in deciding a facial challenge to a state law requiring persons paying for or responsible for paying for the publication of any material or information relating to an election candidate or any question on a ballot to identify their names and addresses on any published printed or written matter or any photograph.at.we noted that mcconnell casts new light on some aspects of first amendment protections of speech,but we concluded that nothing in mcconnell undermines mcintyre understanding that proscribing the content of an election communication is a form of regulation of campaign activity subject to traditional strict scrutiny.id.at.
in some respects,the disclosure requirements in the case now before us resemble the disclosure requirements at issue in mcconnell.in other particular the requirements of alaska stat.and b that the identity of a person paying for a communication be resemble those at issue in heller.for purposes of this opinion we will assume without deciding that strict scrutiny applies to all of the challenged disclosure requirements,and that alaska must advance a compelling state interest to justify them.even under this standard,we hold that alaska disclosure requirements are justified.
three forms of required disclosure 
the three forms of challenged disclosure are registration,reporting,and disclosure of who is paying for a communication.we first address akrtl facial challenge.we then address its challenge.
facial challenge to disclosure requirements 
registration 
a nongroup entity must comply with the registration requirements of alaska stat.a and before it can make an expenditure in support of or in opposition to a political candidate.section a provides 
before making an expenditure in support of or in opposition to a candidate each person other than an individual shall register,on forms provided by the commission,with the commission.
the registration form provided by apoc in connection with a is two pages long.it asks for basic information,such as a nongroup entity name,its purpose,the names and contact information of its officers,its campaign plans,and banking information if it plans to raise more than.
section provides 
only the following may make an expenditure in an election for candidates for elective office 
the candidate 
an individual 
a group that has registered under as and 
a nongroup entity that has registered under as.
the provision of this section covering a nongroup entity was added to the alaska campaign finance law as part of the and amendments.
the registration requirements of alaska stat.a and are not significantly burdensome in themselves.they are only burdensome to the extent that they trigger the reporting and requirements applicable once a nongroup entity has registered.we therefore postpone our consideration of burdens,and the state justification for imposing them,to our consideration of these requirements.
ii.reporting 
akrtl challenges the following reporting requirements with which a nongroup entity must comply once it has registered.
first,akrtl challenges alaska stat.d,e,and j which require a nongroup entity making an expenditure to make a full report of that expenditure on a form provided by apoc no later than ten days after the expenditure is made.the report must contain the name,address,principal occupation,and employer of the individual filing the report,and an itemized list of expenditures c and d.further,a nongroup entity must m
