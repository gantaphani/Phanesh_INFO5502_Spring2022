this is a suit to enjoin the enforcement of.and,which limit the amount of cash and contributions that political parties may give to a candidate for public office,and provide penalties for violating the limitations that the statutes set.the plaintiffs a political party,candidate committees,and candidates for public office asserted that the statutes at issue violated their rights of free speech under the first amendment.the district court refused to issue an injunction and this appeal ensued.we reverse and remand with directions to the district court to enter an injunction that is not inconsistent with this opinion.
the complaint in this case set out a series of cash contributions that the missouri republican party made to the other plaintiffs in this case,described the actions that the defendants the members of the missouri ethics commission and the missouri attorney general intended to take against the plaintiffs because the contributions exceeded those that missouri law allows,and asked for an injunction against the enforcement of the statutes under which the defendants intended to proceed.
the plaintiffs argued to the district court that the monetary expenditures at issue here were not really contributions,as that term is regularly used in cases of this kind,but rather were coordinated expenditures made in conjunction and cooperation with the candidates and their committees.the district court rejected that construction of the facts,and held that there was no genuine factual dispute about the nature of the monetary expenditures involved,because the candidates retained control over how the money was to be spent.we agree with the district court.
we recognize that there will be cases in which the line between a contribution and a coordinated expenditure will be hard to draw,and we concede that that line may frequently be particularly difficult to discern when the case involves money that passes from a party to one of its candidates.that is partly because,for reasons that will presently appear,we believe that it is often difficult to distinguish a party from its candidates at all.but here,as the district court noted,the candidates admitted that,although they discussed the use of the money with the party before it passed to them,they were nevertheless free to spend it as they saw fit.it is this freedom on the part of the candidates that provides them with the kind of independence that requires us to characterize the money that passed to them as contributions as a matter of law.
this characterization,as the parties recognize,is important to the case because,although the supreme court has not decided the precise issue before us,it has decided that contributions by individuals are subject to limitation,despite the first amendment interests at stake,see buckley valeo,d per curiam,while independent expenditures by political parties are not,see colorado republican federal campaign committee federal election commission,d.although these cases do not directly rule this one,since it falls somewhere between them,we nevertheless think that they provide guidance on the proper resolution of the questions raised.we believe that the recent case of nixon shrink missouri government pac,d,however,on which the defendants heavily rely,is of limited value in this respect,because,as we explain later,the fact that one of the plaintiffs in this case is a political party serves to distinguish it from shrink missouri government pac in a crucial way.
the most important case for present purposes is buckley,at,which held that a limitation on individuals contributions to candidates for public office was constitutional because such a limitation imposed only a marginal restriction upon the contributor ability to engage in free communication.that was because,as the supreme court saw it,a contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views,but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support,id.at.a limitation on contributions,the court therefore concluded,involves little direct restraint on political communication,for it permits the symbolic expression evidenced by a contribution,id.
we think that these considerations simply do not carry the same force when the contributor is a political party.the main object of a political party is to elect its candidates to office,and,in large measure,the speech of its candidates is its own speech.while political parties employ various methods to speak,a principal way in which they express themselves is through the speech of their candidates.in fact,parties and their candidates are often virtual alter egos.
we are not suggesting that there is always an exact correspondence between candidates and their parties.candidates and parties have their observable differences,and there is truth in the old adage that a platform is something to stand on,not to run on candidates are not mere agents or mouthpieces.but parties seek to field a team and support it.candidates are frequently,moreover,and with excellent reason,called their party,and they make frequent appeal to party principle and in their interactions,candidates and parties influence each other and become more alike,so as to present a coordinated and common front.they are often,in other words,virtually indistinguishable from each other,and their identities are merged in a way that makes dealings between them more than merely transient symbiotic ones between separate and distinct entities.
because of their unity of purpose,and the virtual identity of parties and their candidates,it is not easy to say,in the words of buckley,at,that a political party contribution does not communicate the underlying basis for the support.to the contrary,a party contribution provides an ideological endorsement and carries a philosophical imprimatur that an individual contribution does not,and thus it can not properly be called a contribution in the same sense that the individual contributions at stake in buckley were.nor is a party contribution to its candidate,again in the words of buckley,merely a symbolic expression of support it is more like a substantive political statement than others contributions are.as we see it,all of this indicates that the first amendment rights at stake here are different from,and weightier than,those that were involved in buckley.federal election commission colorado republican federal campaign committee,cir.
the nature and character of political parties are relevant to another important aspect of our consideration of this case,namely,the kind of reason that the government must advance in order to justify an intrusion on first amendment rights.in shrink missouri government pac.at,the supreme court held that preventing the corruption of candidates served as a sufficiently compelling reason to limit the size of contributions from individuals and political action committees.but,as justice thomas has observed,it is not easy to see how a party could corrupt one of its own candidates,since,on account of their general unity of purpose,they are committed,in the main,to the same aims and principles.see colorado republican federal campaign committee,at.opinion of thomas.as we see it,the threat that a political party will corrupt a candidate is not a very realistic one.
the defendants suggest alternatively that preventing the circumvention of the limits on individual contributions can serve to justify regulating the size of party contributions.see buckley,at.see also id.at.buckley,however,upheld a limitation on the total amount that any one person could contribute on the ground that it would keep individuals from circumventing the limits on giving to any one candidate.see id.at.but here the challenged restriction is on the party giving,and the defendants seek to justify it on the ground that it would keep individuals from doing an end run around limits on their own giving.this scheme burdens the free speech rights of political parties in order to control the activities of someone else.this is something quite different from what buckley approved.
besides,the defendants admitted in their brief in this case that it would be illegal under missouri law fo
