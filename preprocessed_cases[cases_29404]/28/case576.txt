beginning in may,a group of huntington beach residents began circulating petitions supporting a proposed initiative which would amend the city charter to change the city council from seven members elected by the city at large to five members elected from separate districts.the initiative will,if passed,also put absolute lifetime term limits on each council member council members could have no more than two terms in a lifetime.present council members can not serve more than two consecutive terms.the supporters call their initiative the fair apportionment and individual representation charter initiative,or fair.
the changes proposed by the fair initiative would be effective with the november general municipal election.by,the proponents of the initiative had turned over signatures to the city clerk.there is no question the supporters had obtained enough signatures to put the fair initiative on the ballot.
the question is,which year or one in the current huntington beach city council has not attempted to conceal its opposition to the initiative,and has decided not to put the initiative on the ballot for the upcoming november election.rather,the council has put the initiative on the march ballot.the council makes no bones about its motive it wants time to defeat the initiative,either in court or by mounting its own campaign against it.
understandably,the supporters of the initiative promptly filed a petition in the superior court asking it to order the initiative placed on this november ballot.the trial judge concluded that the council had the legal authority to delay the election on the initiative until march,and the supporters have now filed a petition in this court seeking to overturn the trial court decision.
let begin at the beginning,which is elections code section the statute allows amendments or repeals of a city charter to be proposed by a petition signed by percent of the registered voters of the city.the key language is in subdivision a,which spells out one of three possibilities for submitting such a proposal to the voters.note that it enumerates minimum time limits,but no maximum time limits the following city or city and county charter proposals shall be submitted to the voters at either a special election called for that purpose,at any established municipal election date,or at any established election date pursuant to section,provided that there are at least days before the election.emphasis added.
section was added to the elections code in,but there is a newer statute,section,enacted in,which contains substantially the same provisions as subdivision a of section.like section,it sets forth three choices with minimum time limits but no maximum time limits city or city and county charter proposals that qualify pursuant to section shall be submitted to the voters at either the next regular general municipal election occurring not less than days after the date of the order of election,or at a special election called for that purpose or on any established election date pursuant to section occurring not less than days after the date of the order of election.emphasis added.
we are immediately confronted with a mootness problem based on the minimum time frames spelled out in both section subdivision a and section.as we write in september,it is less than days until the november,election.would it even be possible for this court to give the petitioner the relief he asks for 
assuming that it were physically possible for the city clerk to prepare ballots for the november election and the city has not presented evidence in this writ proceeding that even at this late date that would be impossible to do,the answer is yes.the language at the end of section makes it clear that the days are dated from the order of election.it is the relevant legislative body,here the city council,and not the court,which orders municipal elections when voters submit initiatives.see giving legislative body specific choices when presented by an initiative petition has been signed by not less than percent of the city voters,including immediately ordering a special election,or ordering a report and then ordering a special election moore city council d.requiring city council to order a recall election in wake of recall petitions baroldi denni d.after city clerk examined petitions and filed them with city council,council had ministerial duty to order at once special election within specified time frame.
in the case before us,the city council made its order of election on august,which was some days before the november election.it thus had the power,consistent with the time frames of sections,subdivision a and,to have set the fair initiative on the november ballot.its supporters having gotten their initiative to the city clerk and council in time for the council to make an order of election consistent with the day deadline,that should be enough to prevent mootness by operation of the two statutes.any other result would be nonsensical,for two reasons.
one,it would invest city councils with absolute veto power in cases where they wanted to keep an initiative off the ballot in an upcoming election.all they would have to do is simply delay making any order of election until the deadline had passed or until the was so close that no court challenge could be mounted in time.city councils could then insulate themselves from any challenge to a decision not to put an initiative on the ballot in the next election.
two,such a reading contravenes the evident purpose of the two statutes,which is to authorize procedures allowing initiative measures to be on the ballot.if the legislature wanted to give city councils veto power over initiatives to repeal or amend city charters,why not just say that if a city council does like an initiative,it can just reject it and leave it at that the statutes should obviously be construed to avoid such a reductio ad absurdum.
while the city has indicated that putting the fair initiative on the ballot at this late date might be difficult,particularly in light of the petitioner failure to name the county registrar of voters in this action,it has not argued that it would be physically impossible we will therefore consider the merits of the case and not deny the petition as moot.
as noted above,the two statutes governing initiatives to repeal or amend city charters have no maximum time limits.nothing in them requires a city council to order the election at the next available opportunity.indeed,the very fact that each statute allows options in election dates refutes that idea 
significantly the legislature knew how to require an initiative be placed on the ballot in the very next election if it had wanted to.section governs local initiatives that do not involve charter repeals or amendments.it does institute maximum time limits on the required election.the first sentence of subdivision a of section provides except as provided below,the election for a county,municipal,or district initiative that qualifies pursuant to section,or all of which deal with noncharter initiatives shall be held not less than nor more than days after the date of the order of election.emphasis added.
the presence of maximum time provisions for noncharter elections but not charter elections suggests that the lack of outside time limits might not have been an oversight.in fact,section,which is one of the noncharter provisions cited in section it involves ordinances,not charters has a provision for the initiative itself to contain a request that the ordinance be submitted immediately to a vote of the people at a special election.if it does,section then requires the local legislative body to either a adopt the ordinance within days after it is presented or b i mmediately order a special election once again,all the signs point to the inescapable conclusion that the legislature did not intend to force city councils to put initiatives to repeal or amend city charters on the ballot in the very next election.
the proponents of the fair initiative would appear to recognize that inconvenient fact.their argument is not built because it could be built on the operation of sections and.rather,they
