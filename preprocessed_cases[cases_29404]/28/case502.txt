background 
proposition 
proposition,passed by the voters in the november general election,generally provides that those convicted of drug possession offenses are initially to receive probation with drug treatment,rather than incarceration,subd.a.drug treatment is defined to exclude drug treatment programs in a prison or jail facility,subd.b.
proponents of proposition argued in the voter information guide to the election the war on drugs has failed.nonviolent drug users are overcrowding our jails.violent criminals are being released early.drug treatment programs are rarely available.we pay annually for prisoners when treatment costs only.expanded treatment programs will reduce crime,save lives,and save taxpayers hundreds of millions.voter information guide,summary of,guide.opponents argued among other things that the proposition would tie the hands of judges and cripple legitimate treatment.guide,supra,rebuttal to argument in favor of.
in proposition,the electorate found and declared a substance abuse treatment is a proven public safety and health measure.nonviolent,criminal offenders who receive drug treatment are much less likely to abuse drugs and commit future crimes,and are likelier to live healthier,more stable and more productive lives.b community safety and health are promoted,and taxpayer dollars are saved,when nonviolent persons convicted of drug possession or drug use are provided appropriate treatment instead of incarceration.guide,supra,text of proposed law.
proposition express purposes were a to divert from incarceration into substance abuse treatment programs nonviolent defendants,probationers and parolees charged with simple drug possession or drug use offenses b to halt the wasteful expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars each year on the nonviolent drug users who would be better served by treatment and c to enhance public safety by reducing crime and preserving jails and prison cells for serious and violent offenders,and to improve public health by reducing drug abuse and drug dependence through proven and effective drug treatment strategies.guide,supra,text of proposed law.
proposition further provided this act may be amended only by a roll call vote of two thirds of the membership of both houses of the legislature.all amendments to this act shall be to further the act and shall be consistent with its purposes.guide,supra,text of proposed law.
senate bill 
senate bill was passed by the legislature on june,as an urgency measure bill,and signed by the governor on july.it was entitled an act to amend sections,and of the health and safety code,and to amend sections,and of the penal code,relating to drug treatment,and declaring the urgency thereof,to take effect immediately.the provisions of senate bill alleged to be inconsistent with the purposes of proposition,detailed below,permit incarceration of defendants who violate probation in circumstances where incarceration is prohibited by proposition,and narrow eligibility for proposition diversion.
senate bill was derived from senate bill reg.sess.senate bill,which was introduced in february.an april senate committee on public safety analysis of senate bill stated that t he most important source of conflict over sacpa substance abuse and crime prevention act of is the prohibition on any jail sanctions until probation is revoked.com.on public safety,analysis of bill reg.sess.t he most contentious the overriding the use of incarceration flash incarceration sanctions for probation violations while a person participates in the act.id.at.at this same time,the legislative counsel opined that l egislation that would authorize a sentence of incarceration for a first,second,or third probation violation,if enacted,would constitute an amendment of proposition that would not both further that initiative statute and be consistent with its purposes.therefore,the legislation could not take effect without voter approval pursuant to subdivision c of section of article ii of the california constitution.ops.cal.legis.counsel,substance abuse and crime prevention act of proposition permissible amendments incarceration funding for nontreatment costs.senate bill had not cleared the assembly public safety committee when its substance was added to senate bill on june,the day before senate bill passage prior to that time,senate bill had been a budget trailer bill.
senate bill included the following findings and declarations 
c each year following the implementation of the act the department of alcohol and drug programs hereinafter the department was required and did in fact conduct a study to evaluate the effectiveness and financial impact of the programs which were funded pursuant to the act.the studies have focused on the implementation process,participant demographics and treatment completion rates as well as other impacts and issues the department identified.reports were submitted to the legislature by the department.
d in addition,the department contracted,as required by the act,with a public university,the university of california at los angeles hereinafter ucla to evaluate the effectiveness and financial impact of the programs which were funded pursuant to the requirements of this act and to report findings that were in fact forwarded to the legislature by the department.
e the ucla evaluations have found that approximately percent of referred sacpa offenders do not enter treatment 
f the ucla evaluations have found that percent of those who do in fact enter treatment complete that treatment.this completion rate,as well as retention rates,can be improved through the enhancement of compliance with treatment 
g sacpa does not specifically address the use of short periods of jail time as a motivational tool to hold sacpa offenders accountable to enter and stay in treatment.studies have reported that drug court clients were more likely to enter treatment,remained in treatment significantly longer,and engaged in significantly less drug use when they received swift and sure sanctions and rewards,including the possibility of brief periods of jail time during the course of treatment.therefore,sanctions including short periods of jail time for relapsing,problematic,or recalcitrant offenders,on a showing of need after consideration of important treatment and other factors,should be available,not as a substitute for treatment but as a tool to motivate and hold offenders accountable 
i the ucla evaluations also speak to the high cost in terms of arrests and convictions of violent crimes,property crimes,and sex crimes of those presently eligible defendants who have five or more convictions in the period prior to their sacpa eligible arrests in comparison to the typical sacpa offender,and recommend that the legislature may wish to consider possible changes as to the eligibility of these offenders who ucla found comprise percent of the total number of offenders eligible for sacpa,yet had postconviction crime costs that were times higher than the costs for the typical or median sacpa offender during the followup study period.
the legislature further found and declared in section of senate bill that the provisions of this act are consistent with the purposes of the substance abuse and crime prevention act of.section of senate bill directed if any provision of this bill is found to be invalid,the entire legislative measure shall be submitted to the voters at the next statewide election.
procedural history of the case 
this suit was filed on july,the day the governor signed senate bill the court issued a temporary restraining order the next day against enforcement of senate bill,followed by a preliminary injunction in september.plaintiffs first amended complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief,and petition for writ of mandate alleged that senate bill amendments detailed below to proposition violated article ii,section,subdivision c of the california constitution because they did not further the proposition and were inconsistent with its purposes.plaintiffs alleged that senate bill provision for a popular vote on the bill,if any part of it was found to be invalid,was also unconstitutional on multiple grounds.cal,art.ii,subd.c restriction on amendment of initiative,art.ii,requirements for referendums,art.iv,single subject rule,subject must be expressed in statute title.
the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,finding that t he incarceration provisions of senate bill are flatly inconsistent with the purposes approved by the voters,as are the changes to those eligible for diversion under the initiative.the court found the popular vote provision of section of senate bill invalid under the terms of that section,which ma de clear that the legislature intended that the provisions of the legislation not be severable,so that invalidation of one part invalidates the entire legislation.the court entered judgment declaring senate bill invalid in its entirety,and enjoining its enforcement.
ii.discussion 
constitutionality of the challenged amendments to proposition scope of review 
the standards governing our analysis are set forth in cases that have considered attempted legislative amendments to proposition,the insurance rate initiative,which,like proposition,permitted amendment by the legislature only to further its purposes.see amwest surety ins.wilson cal th,d,amwest.
in amwest,supra,cal th at page,d,the proponent of the legislation argued that the court should adopt a deferential standard of review in determining whether the enactment furthers the purposes of proposition.the court rejected that argument,and held that the proposition limitation on legislative authority must be given the effect the voters intended it to have.adoption of the standard of review proposed by amwest might well have the ironic and unfortunate consequence of causing the drafters of future initiatives to hesitate to grant even a limited authority to the legislature to amend those initiatives a result that would diminish both the initiative process and the legislative process.id.at,d.the court must exercise effective judicial review,and determine whether,by any reasonable construction,it can be said that the statute furthers the purposes of the initiative.id.at,d.because this determination is a question of law foundation for taxpayer consumer rights garamendi th,d foundation,the trial court decision on the matter is subject to our independent review.
in identifying the purposes of an initiative,we examine the initiative as a whole,and are guided by,but not limited to,its general statements of purpose.amwest,supra,cal th at,d.we must give effect to an initiative specific language,as well as its major and fundamental purposes.id.at,d,identifying initiative major purposes argument that initiative had a narrower scope than would follow from its broad language rejected in view of the particular language used foundation,supra,th at,d citing initiative fundamental purpose amendment must not violate a specific primary mandate or do violence to specific provisions of the initiative.although legislative findings are given great weight amwest,cal th at,d,the issue is not whether the legislation furthers the public good,but rather whether it furthers the purposes of the initiative id.at,d.
amendments at issue 
a incarceration for probation violations 
proposition provides that a defendant on proposition probation may be incarcerated upon revocation of probation,subd.e,but that the defendant can not have his or her probation revoked for a first or second violation of probation unless the court finds that the defendant poses a danger to the safety of others or is unamenable to drug treatment without such a finding,the only consequence is modification of the probationer drug treatment plan,subd.e a upon a first violation,probation may be revoked if defendant is a danger to others if probation is not revoked,the court may intensify or alter the drug treatment plan,subd.e b upon a second violation,probation may be revoked if defendant is a danger to others or unamenable to treatment if probation is not revoked,treatment plan may be intensified or altered.senate bill adds language to section permitting the court,upon a first probation violation that does not involve the recent use of drugs,such as failure to comply with treatment or to report for drug testing,to impose up to hours of custody in jail as a tool to enhance treatment compliance.amended,subd.f a.if the violation involves recent drug use,and no bed is immediately available at a licensed detoxification or residential treatment facility,senate bill permits the court to order the defendant confined in county jail for detoxification for up to days.ibid.upon a second probation violation that does not involve the recent use of drugs,the court may sanction the defendant with up to hours in jail if recent drug use is involved,the court may order up to days of confinement in jail for detoxification.amended,subd.f b.
b incarceration for probation violations 
proposition permits the court to revoke a defendant probation if a probation violation is proved,subd.e.under senate bill,the court may remand the defendant for up to days if the state moves to revoke probation for a probation violation.amended,subd.f.if the court reinstates the defendant on probation,it may impose up to more days in jail as a tool to enhance treatment compliance.ibid.
c eligibility for proposition diversion 
proposition excludes certain defendants who had previously been convicted of serious or violent felonies,subd.b.senate bill retained that exclusion,and added provisions that permit a court,upon making certain findings,also to exclude any defendant who had served three prior prison terms for related felonies,or had been convicted of five misdemeanors or felonies within the preceding months 
proposition excludes defendants who unlawfully possess or are under the influence of specified controlled substances while using a firearm,subd.b.senate bill expands the exclusion to encompass defendants who unlawfully possess or are under the influence of specified controlled substances while armed with a deadly weapon,with the intent to use the same as a deadly weapon.amended,subd.b 
we agree with the trial court and the legislative counsel that provisions of senate bill allowing incarceration for probation violations,when that sanction would be prohibited by proposition,can not be deemed to be consistent with the purposes of the proposition.according to the proposition expressed purposes,its findings and declarations,and the voter information guide arguments for its passage,proposition diversion was intended to promote public health by expanding treatment for drug addiction and abuse enhance public safety by freeing jail cells for violent criminals and save money by affording treatment in lieu of incarceration.senate bill expansion of authority to jail proposition probationers for probation violations clearly contravenes the second and third of these purposes because the amendment would reduce the jail space available for violent criminals,and increase the costs incurred in connection with nonviolent drug possession offenders.
defendants contend that increased jail sanctions under senate bill are necessary to insure that drug treatment is effective the bill author faulted proposition for being all carrot and no stick.com.on public safety,analysis of bill reg.sess.defendants submit that
