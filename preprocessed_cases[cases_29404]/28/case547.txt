just prior to the special election of november,petitioners californians for fair on hereafter on and theresa faye collectively,petitioners petitioned this court for a peremptory writ of mandate,prohibition or other extraordinary relief.they sought to compel respondent the superior court of sacramento county to vacate its order denying a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to require real parties in interest,governor arnold schwarzenegger,governor schwarzenegger california recovery team hereafter crt,redistrict on hereafter on and steve poizner collectively,real parties in interest,to comply with disclosure requirements for contributions and independent expenditures imposed by the political reform act of pra,et 
after real parties in interest voluntarily complied with the disclosure requirements,this court issued an alternative writ of mandate on november,but denied the request for immediate relief as moot.petitioners contend real parties in interest initial refusal to report as contributions or independent expenditures the million of dollars spent on radio and television advertising in support of propositions,and violated the pra.real parties in interest contend the case is moot because the reports have been filed and the issue is not one likely to evade review.further,they contend there was no basis for a preliminary injunction as there was no irreparable injury and petitioners had no likelihood of prevailing on the merits.
we conclude that although the issue is technically moot,we shall exercise our discretion to decide it because it is an important issue of public interest,likely to recur and evade appellate review.we further conclude that the expenditures admittedly made by crt meet the statutory definition of independent expenditures and should have been reported on a basis during the days before the election.
factual and procedural background 
many of the parties in this case are committees as defined by the pra,so we begin by identifying the various types of committees.a committee is one or more persons who directly or indirectly receives contributions of or more in a calendar year,makes independent expenditures of or more in a calendar year,or makes contributions of or more in a calendar year to or at the behest of candidates or committees.a controlled committee is a committee controlled directly or indirectly by a candidate or state measure proponent,subd.a.a candidate or state measure proponent controls a committee if he or she has a significant influence on the actions or decisions of the committee.ibid.
committees are divided into two groups based on the purpose for which the committee is formed.a primarily formed committee is formed or exists to support or oppose one or more candidates or one or more measures being voted upon in the same election.a general purpose committee generally is formed or exists to support or oppose candidates or measures in several different elections,subd.a.
petitioner on is a committee primarily formed to oppose proposition in the november special election petitioner theresa faye is a registered california voter.
real party in interest arnold schwarzenegger is the governor of california and a candidate for reelection to that office he controls real party in interest crt,a general purpose committee.real party in interest on is a committee primarily formed to support proposition and is controlled by real party in interest steve poizner,a candidate for state insurance commissioner.
on october,petitioners filed a complaint for temporary and permanent injunction against real parties in interest,challenging the legality of contributions totaling made by governor schwarzenegger and crt to on.they also filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order.
in a preliminary opposition,real parties in interest argued there was no harm justifying an injunction because the contributions had been returned.they further argued that any limitation on the amount an individual could contribute to a ballot measure committee was unconstitutional.
at a hearing on the application for a temporary restraining order,real parties in interest provided documentation that the contributions at issue had been refunded.in response to petitioners argument that crt had made contributions to on,the treasurer of crt declared that crt made expenditures in support of proposition,but that these expenditures were not at the behest of on or poizner.the trial court denied the application for a temporary restraining order.
petitioners then turned their sights on the millions of dollars crt had spent on radio and television advertising in support of propositions,and.they asserted these expenditures were at the behest of on and therefore should have been reported as contributions to on.in support of their argument,petitioners pointed to the connections between on and the governor.the full legal name of on included with major funding provided by arnold schwarzenegger and steve poizner for insurance commissioner.governor schwarzenegger publicly announced that poizner would head the yes on proposition campaign.governor schwarzenegger and poizner engaged in joint fundraising for on.
petitioners argued the expenditures for advertising were either contributions to on or,if not made at the behest of on,independent expenditures.in either case,the sums had to be publicly reported on a basis in the final weeks before the election.neither crt nor on had reported the sums and were therefore in violation of the pra.
real parties in interest argued petitioners had no evidence that the expenditures for advertising in support of proposition were made at the behest of on,so there were no illegal contributions and the motion for a preliminary injunction had to be denied.
petitioners then filed a first amended complaint for temporary and permanent injunction.they alleged crt had made expenditures in excess of in support of proposition and that these expenditures were contributions to on.they sought to enjoin these excessive and illegal contributions and to require on to report these contributions on a basis as required by the pra.alternatively,if the expenditures were not contributions to on,they were independent expenditures by crt,and crt was required to report them on a basis under the pra.
once again,petitioners sought a temporary restraining order.they sought to enjoin real parties in interest from refusing and failing to comply with the disclosure requirements of the pra.
the trial court denied the second application for a temporary restraining order.by stipulation of the parties,the ruling also resulted in denial of the request for a preliminary injunction.the issue remaining before the court was whether crt was required to report expenditures on a basis pursuant to the pra.the trial court found the law less than clear as to the precise reporting requirements that apply to the expenditures at issue.however,even if petitioners were correct as to the reporting requirements,there was no irreparable harm.the public had abundant information about the source and amount of money being used to support the propositions and knew the governor was the major proponent of and the major donor to proposition.
just days before the november,special election,petitioners petitioned this court for extraordinary relief to compel real parties in interest to comply with the disclosure requirements of the pra.a few days later,real parties in interest submitted an opposition,reporting that crt had begun voluntarily filing electronic reporting of its expenditures in support of propositions,and,and would continue to do so on a daily basis until the election.this court denied the request for immediate relief as moot,but issued an alternative writ of mandate.
discussion 
in their petition,petitioners urge that even if their request for immediate relief is denied,this court should issue an alternative writ and schedule the matter for hearing so the disclosure issues can be resolved before the next election.
real parties in interest contend this case is now moot because they voluntarily made the disclosures that petitioners sought.they further contend tha
