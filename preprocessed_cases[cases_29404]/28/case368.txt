any person who receives a contribution in excess of for a political committee must forward the contribution and the donor information to the committee treasurer no later than days after receiving the contribution.b b.we plumb the deep mysteries of this language to figure out what it could possibly mean.
james toledano,a lawyer admitted to practice in california,was chairman of the orange county democratic party during the primary election.about three weeks before the primary,he received a contribution check at his law office.the check was made out to the democratic party of orange county by debra and paul laprade,sister and of james prince,one of four candidates seeking the party nomination for california congressional district.unbeknownst to the party treasurer or anyone else,toledano took the check to a bank,opened a new account in the name of democratic party of orange county ii federal and deposited the money.at some point after the check was written,the roman numeral ii was mysteriously added to the payee line to match the name of the account.instead of providing the party contact information for the new account,toledano listed his law office address and telephone number,and gave himself sole signatory authority.
that evening,toledano attended the party executive committee meeting,where the treasurer and other board members were present.toledano said nothing about the contribution,even though he reported various other matters to the board,and even though the check was hardly routine.it was,in fact,times the donation to the party that year.days and weeks say nothing of the statutory the treasurer remained in the dark.toledano failure to forward the check and the donors information to the treasurer was no oversight.toledano later admitted that he intentionally kept the contribution secret because he knew that,if he told anyone,his plan for the money would be thwarted.
and a plan he did have.money in hand,he secretly arranged with james prince campaign for print and mail pamphlets,complete with prince photograph,notifying voters of prince endorsement by the democratic party the pamphlets consumed all the funds in the undisclosed account,plus from toledano own pocket.
prince lost the primary,but with publicity comes scrutiny.when the other members of the party executive committee found out about the mailings,they reported toledano manipulations to the press.the federal election commission fec began an investigation.it discovered that sister debra and paul laprade had already contributed the maximum allowable amount to prince election campaign before they made their latest donation.the laprades admitted to the fec that the check,although ostensibly made to the orange county democratic party,was actually earmarked for prince election pamphlets and designed to evade campaign contribution limits,in violation of a a no person shall make contributions to any candidate and his authorized political committees with respect to any election for federal office which,in the aggregate,exceed.see h providing that a contributor may not evade limits on how much he can donate to a candidate campaign by giving money to a political committee with the knowledge that a substantial portion will be contributed to,or expended on behalf of,that candidate for the same election.the laprades and prince for congress soon conceded wrongdoing and paid a hefty fine.but not toledano.
the fec brought this enforcement action in federal district court seeking civil penalties and other relief against toledano for violating the federal election campaign act feca.representing himself below and on appeal,toledano admits that he spoke to debra laprade about the contribution and told her to send the check to his law office rather than to that of the democratic party that he did tell anyone from the party about the contribution and that he spent all the money on prince campaign.he agrees that he neglected to send the contribution or the donors information to the treasurer within ten ever.see b.still,toledano insists that he did violate the law and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against him.
toledano maintains that b,despite its mandatory and straightforward language,can not mean what it says.he contends that there are disputed issues of material fact that,if decided in his favor,would excuse his failure to comply with the statutory requirement.toledano also marshals a pastiche of other estoppel,statute of limitations,and the district court abuse of its broad remedial challenge the district court decision.
toledano stated under oath i received the check.i took it to marine national bank,and opened a new account with it.i listed myself as the signatory i used my office address on the account he did all these things without consulting the executive committee or the treasurer and kept his actions under wraps past the statutory deadline because i had formed the habit of doing everything without notifying the executive committee because i knew that whatever i wanted would be voted down for no other reason than spite and vindictiveness.
it is undisputed,therefore,that toledano received a contribution,whose amount exceeded,and failed to present the contribution or the donors names and addresses to the treasurer within ten days.the relevant statutory provision states as follows 
every person who receives a contribution for a political committee which is not an authorized committee shall if the amount of the contribution is in excess of,forward to the treasurer such contribution,the name and address of the person making the contribution,and the date of receipt of the contribution,no later than days after receiving the contribution.
b b emphasis added.on its face,toledano conduct appears to be a clear violation of the statutory requirement.but toledano denies he did anything wrong because congress did not and could not have intended such a mechanistic view of the statute.
toledano derisively calls the fec interpretation of the statute the fingerprint rule.it simply can not be,he asserts,that literally hundreds of thousands of campaign contribution checks,representing literally millions of dollars,must pass through the treasurer own hands and be impressed with the treasurer fingerprints.the treasurer must be permitted to have agents who assist him,and he,toledano,was one such agent.as chair of the party,he was entitled to accept and deposit contribution checks.
toledano does not claim that the treasurer actually authorized him to act on the treasurer behalf,or that the party bylaws gave the chair such authority toledano readily admits that his actions violated the bylaws.see supplemental declaration of james toledano at.toledano nevertheless maintains he had de facto authority to act as treasurer because he was convinced that the real treasurer was incompetent and failed to discharge his duties responsibly.
according to toledano sworn declaration and deposition,the painful reality was that the treasurer of the orange county democratic party was unreachable for days on end,getting harder and harder to find,and becoming less and less responsible.as a result,the last thing that i would ever have done would be to give the treasurer a check the proceeds of which needed to be spent in a hurry.the executive committee,moreover,was paralyzed by continuing hostilities the members were virulent and vicious.therefore,toledano explains,i t became totally obvious to me that i would get nothing done if i tried to work with the committee.i could have proposed god,motherhood and apple pie,and it would have been voted down as a result of that,i never even thought about telling the committee.
we agree with toledano that the statute does not impose a mechanistic fingerprint rule.the treasurer is authorized to employ designated agents to assist him.see a requiring the authorization of the treasurer or his or her designated agent emphasis added the treasurer of a political committee or an agent authorized by the treasurer to receive contributions and make expenditures shall fulfill the listed record keeping duties emphasis added.but,as noted,toledano did not have actual authority to act for the treasurer,and the party bylaws gave him no authority to receive and spend money without the approval of the executive committee.toledano was therefore not a designated agent of the treasurer and could not exercise the treasurer authority under the statute or the regulations.
toledano de facto treasurer argument fares no better.the statute makes no provision for agents who lack proper delegation of authority,even if the treasurer goes awol.quite the contrary,n o contribution or expenditure shall be accepted or made by or on behalf of a political committee during any period in which the office of treasurer is vacant.a.a fortiori,when there is a treasurer,no contribution or expenditure may bypass him or his designated agents.we can not undo the plain language of the statute to achieve what toledano views as the better result,even if we were inclined to do so,which we are not.
assuming,as toledano alleges,that the party executive committee was plagued by paralysis,it makes not an iota of difference under feca.the statute contains no exception for internal breakdown.either the members work out their differences and follow the statutory requirements,or the committee can not accept contributions or make campaign expenditures at all.see a.
toledano resists this obvious conclusion by pointing to his own experience and the world of orange county political campaigning in acting on my own,toledano explains,i had plenty of history on my side.toledano claims that it was not uncommon nor wrong for the chair of the party to act independently of the executive committee and the central committee and without the knowledge of the members of those committees although that violated the express language of the.in fact,it was customary for the central committee and its officers to disregard bylaw requirements without even thinking about it when doing so suited them.toledano also alleges that he has personally seen contribution check envelopes being opened and the checks tabulated,booked and taken directly into the bank by persons who were not the designated campaign treasurer.toledano claims he discussed this fact with several individuals employed by the fec.not one has ever denied that checks are indeed routinely deposited directly into the bank by persons other than the designated campaign treasurer without the treasurer ever having seen them,and that the fec has never prosecuted any person for such a hypertechnical alleged violation.
that several unidentified individuals employed by the fec have failed to contradict toledano claims proves nothing.the individuals in question may simply have recognized that campaign treasurers often act through duly authorized agents.in any event,that others may have violated the campaign laws in the past has no bearing on the lawfulness of toledano conduct.the only question before us is whether toledano violated the law.if he did,he gets no free pass because others may have been better at escaping detection 
toledano next argues that section b requirements are so mechanistic and irrational that we can not possibly hold anyone to them.but he is in his premise and in his conclusion.it is axiomatic that disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity.buckley valeo,d per curiam.in addition,recordkeeping,reporting,and disclosure requirements are an essential means of gathering the data necessary to detect violations of the contribution limitations.id.at.precisely because of the difficulty in keeping track of literally hundreds of thousands of campaign contribution checks,representing literally millions of dollars,there is nothing irrational about congress decision to insist that all funds coming into,and going out of,a committee pass through a single treasurer.
the treasurer thus plays a pivotal role in the statutory scheme.the act requires every political committee to have a treasurer,a,and holds him personally responsible for the committee recordkeeping and reporting duties,id.c d,a.every political committee must designate accounts at one or more official campaign depository or depositories,into which a ll receipts received by the committee shall be deposited and from which all disbursements other than petty cash disbursements must be drawn.id.h.the treasurer stands guard over these accounts and file s reports of receipts and disbursements in accordance with the provisions of a.id.a.the treasurer is also responsible for examining all contributions received for evidence of illegality and for ascertaining whether contributions received,when aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor,exceed the contribution limitations.b.congress deems the treasurer so important that the financial machinery of the campaign grinds to a halt when the office becomes vacant.a.
to recognize unauthorized de facto agents of the treasurer and thus open up multiple points of entry and exit through which campaign funds may flow is to create predictable confusion and unravel the whole statutory scheme.the facts of this case demonstrate the very evil congress sought to prevent and deter.by circumventing the process,toledano guaranteed that the laprades contribution escaped the kind of skeptical scrutiny the statute and regulations provide for.had toledano followed the statutorily mandated procedure and handed the check and the donors information to the treasurer,questions would certainly have been raised about the legality of such a large and highly unusual contribution this,in turn,could easily have led to the discovery of the laprades relationship to prince and their effort to circumvent campaign contribution limits.federal law makes the treasurer responsible for detecting precisely such illegalities,b,and holds him personally liable if he fails to fulfill his responsibilities,see d fec gus savage for congress,it is the treasurer,and not the candidate,who becomes the named defendant in federal court,and subjected to the imposition of penalties ranging from substantial fines to imprisonment.as toledano admits,had he reported the contribution,the money would not have been spent for the illegal purpose.by cutting the treasurer out of the process,toledano prevented the kind of scrutiny of the laprades contribution that congress contemplated.
finally,toledano maintains that n o purpose of the act was violated by his failure to hand the check to the treasurer.when the treasurer discovered his malfeasance,toledano explains,the treasurer still had plenty of time to file the required monthly and quarterly reports.therefore,toledano concludes,the party violation of its reporting obligation was not due to his transgression,but to the treasurer delay in doing his job.his own action was an absolute ly innocent decision,and even if there was a violation,it was in the most definite sense a no harm no foul kind of an injury.in toledano view,the district court erred in adhering to a mechanistic and purely literal interpretation of the statute.
as already explained,however,we do not believe that failure to report the contribution to the treasurer before the money was spent was harmless.to the contrary,toledano failure to turn the funds over to the treasurer as the law requires made the illegal expenditure possible.congress enacts statutes,not purposes,and courts may not depart from the statutory text because they believe some other arrangement would better serve the legislative goals.cavanaugh dist.court in re cavanaugh,cir.toledano concedes that he violated the explicit requirements of the statute.because none of his and complaining creates a genuine issue of fact material to the application of the law,that should have been the end of the story long ago.
we have even less trouble rejecting toledano remaining arguments.
a.the district court found that toledano did not timely raise the judicial estoppel,the fec has alleged facts in this litigation inconsistent with those set out in the conciliation agreements with the therefore concluded that toledano waived the argument.because toledano does not challenge the district court conclusion that the argument was waived,we need not address his judicial estoppel argument on the merits.see paracor fin.capital,cir.
toledano argument that the statute of limitations applicable to criminal prosecutions also applies to civil suits is risible.the statute to which toledano points reads 
no person shall be prosecuted,tried,or punished for any violation of subchapter i of this chapter,unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted within years after the date of the violation.
a emphasis added.
once again,toledano would have us ignore the language of the statute,which refers unmistakably to criminal prosecutions.what more,he asks us to disregard fec williams,cir,which rejected precisely this argument in holding that the general statute of limitations,applies to fec actions for the assessment or imposition of civil penalties under the federal election campaign act.williams,at.toledano urges us to overturn williams because the opinion is,in his view,poorly reasoned.but it has long been the rule that only a panel sitting en banc may overturn existing ninth circuit precedent.united states camper,cir.williams,moreover,is plainly right.because the fec action was brought within the statute of limitations,it was timely.
toledano also claims that the district court abused its discretion in setting the amount of the penalty at.he bases his attack on two grounds.first,although he never suggested to the district court that he was unable to pay,toledano now argues that the court erred in failing to consider his financial circumstances before imposing the fine.we can quickly reject this argument.it is settled that the sanctioned party has the burden to produce evidence of inability to pay.see,gaskell weir,cir.simple logic compels this result t he sanctioned party knows best his financial situation.id.because toledano failed to adduce any evidence of his inability to pay and did not even raise the issue below,the argument is waived 
toledano second ground of attack requires a bit more discussion.in arriving at the penalty,the district court relied on two factors we have identified as relevant in determining the amount of faith and injury to the public.fec furgatch,cir.toledano claims that the district court improperly weigh ed and judg ed toledano reasons and motive,intent and purpose in finding bad faith.b y word and phrase,the district court order incorrectly implied that toledano was intentionally devious and deceptive and that he was a prince supporter and conspired with prince to produce the mailer.further,according to toledano,the district court erred in concluding that toledano trivial violation harmed the public.
we first address toledano bad faith argument.toledano insists that he had no idea that the laprades were related to prince and no suspicion that they were trying to evade campaign laws by funneling money to prince through him and the democratic party.although toledano admits in his affidavit that he had earlier endorsed prince candidacy,he says he had forgotten.furthermore,he claims,i have no recollection of ever being in the jim prince for congress headquarters,although it is likely that i was.even though toledano worked with the prince campaign and the campaign printer to produce the pamphlets,he insists,i do not recall who i talked to i do recall recognizing to whom i was speaking.i vaguely recall working with the printer on the format and colors for the design,but i do really recall the jim prince colors issue i had no idea that the mailing house was working with the prince campaign on this and i had no idea that proofs were sent to the prince campaign 
toledano answers at his deposition are equally opaque 
q did anybody suggest the idea of a slate mailer to you 
a i have no recollection.it entirely possible 
q what general discussions did you have with prince 
a at one point,prince contacted me or spoke to me at some do in telephone or in person,in which he said something to the effect of wanting possibly where i got the wanting to fund something from the party related to the party endorsements.
q did you say anything back to him 
a i have no specific recollection.i sure i said something friendly and noncommital 
q would you have given prince any reason to believe that if cash was in the hand that you would be amenable to producing some sort of mailing that trumpeted prince endorsement by the california democratic party 
a i sure i said nothing to discourage him.
q is that a yes 
a i ca give you a yes.i do recall what i may have said.
in his declarations and those portions of his deposition that are part of the district court record,toledano invokes phrases such as i do recall,i forgot,i not entirely sure,and i have no independent recollection over five dozen times.
in order to survive a motion for summary judgment,the responding party must present competent evidence that creates a genuine issue of material fact.see anderson liberty lobby,d.it is no longer enough to deny the moving party allegations in a general way,or to demand that the moving party be put to its proof.see id.at.rather,the party against whom a summary judgment motion is brought must present evidence that,if presented at trial,would support a judgment in its favor.see id.at.toledano repeated failures of recollection,and his steadfast denials that he collaborated with the laprades to circumvent federal campaign laws,fall far short of satisfying this standard.
the fec presented competent evidence that toledano knew prince and had given him an endorsement that prince and toledano discussed the possibility of having the party create a publication relating to the endorsement,if only the prince campaign could come up with the money to fund it that sometime afterwards the lived in arizona and had no obvious connections with orange toledano a contribution that toledano instructed debra laprade to send the check to his law office rather than to the party headquarters that he concealed the contribution from fellow members on the party executive committee,including the treasurer,and proceeded to spend every cent of it on a mailer featuring prince and that,in doing so,he used the same printer as the prince campaign,produced a pamphlet using prince campaign colors,and sent it to people on the prince campaign mailing list.toledano admits some of these facts as to others,he claims he had no recollection or that he was unaware of them.but failure to remember and lack of knowledge are not sufficient to create a genuine dispute.the district court was entitled to treat these facts as established for purposes of summary judgment.
what toledano really disputes is his complicity in the laprades scheme to circumvent the campaign other words,the state of mind animating his actions.toledano claims in essence it was just a big coincidence that he used the contributed by prince sister and to produce a mailer endorsing prince and have it sent to people on prince campaign mailing as the laprades intended that the money be used but state of mind is not subject to proof through the normal means used to establish facts in the physical world,such as eyewitness testimony.state of mind is something the trier of fact must infer from the surrounding circumstances.the individual whose state of mind is at issue can give an eyewitness account of sorts,but the trier of fact is not bound to believe it.toledano protestations that he lacked bad faith are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact to defeat summary judgment the district court was entitled to draw negative inferences about his state of mind based on toledano suspicious memory lapses and the undisputed evidence presented by the government 
the district judge here had before him all the facts and circumstances surrounding toledano actions,plus toledano repeated claims of failure of memory and protestations of innocence.toledano asks for a hearing,but suggests absolutely no additional evidence that he could or would have presented at such a hearing the record was complete.based on the evidence presented,the district court was entitled to determine that any rational trier of fact would disbelieve toledano repetit
