secretary of state dawn roberts appealed a judgment of the second circuit court to the first district court of appeal,which certified to this court that the judgment is of great public importance and requires immediate resolution by this court.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.because we agree with the trial court determination that the ballot title and summary for amendment are clearly and conclusively defective,we affirm.
on july,the trial court ordered that amendment be removed from the november general election ballot,finding that the ballot title and summary fail to fairly inform the voter,in clear and unambiguous language,of the chief purpose of the amendment.specifically,the court found the ballot title and summary for amendment misleading in two material respects,both involving the additional homestead exemption,a chief aspect of the amendment.
first,the court found that n either the title nor the summary provide notice that the additional exemption is only available for properties purchased on or after january.second,the court found that the language new homestead owners in the title,coupled with homestead in the summary,convey the message that to be eligible for the additional homestead exemption,the owner must have never before declared the property homestead.the court further found it misleading that the summary limits the exemption to persons not having owned a principal residence during the preceding eight years because florida law does not define principal residence as the equivalent of homestead for tax purposes.
for the reasons expressed in detail below,we agree with the court that the ballot title and summary are confusing to the average voter.the lack of an effective date renders it impossible for a voter to know which homeowners would qualify for the exemption.further,the ballot title and summary fail to mention that a married person could fail to qualify for the exemption because his or her spouse previously owned a residence.finally,we agree that a voter reading the title and summary could easily conclude that in order to be eligible for the additional homestead,a property owner would have to meet two conditions have not owned a principal residence during the preceding eight years and have never previously declared the property homestead.

under our system of constitutional government regulated by law,a determination of whether an amendment to the constitution has been validly proposed and agreed to by the legislature depends upon the fact of substantial compliance or noncompliance with the mandatory provisions of the existing constitution as to how such amendments shall be proposed and agreed to,and such determination is necessarily required to be in a judicial forum where the constitution provides no other means of authoritatively determining such questions.
