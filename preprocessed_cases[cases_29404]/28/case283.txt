pursuant to a law passed by the guam legislature,eligible native inhabitants of guam may register to vote in a plebiscite concerning guam future political relationship with the united states.guam will conduct the plebiscite if and when percent of eligible native inhabitants register.plaintiff arnold davis is a guam resident who is eligible to register because he is not a native inhabitant.he alleges that guam native inhabitant classification is an unlawful proxy for race.at this stage,we must determine only whether davis has standing to challenge the classification and whether his claims are ripe.
background 
guam law directs the territory commission on decolonization to ascertain the intent of the native inhabitants of guam as to their future political relationship with the united states of america.guam code ann.the same law also provides for a political status plebiscite.id.the plebiscite would ask eligible native inhabitants to choose among three options independence,free association with the united states of america or statehood.id.it would be conducted by guam election commission on the same day as a general election.id.the commission on decolonization would then be required to transmit the plebiscite results to the president,congress and the united nations as reflecting the intent of the native inhabitants of guam as to their future political relationship with the united states.id.
guam will hold the plebiscite if and when percent of all eligible native register with the guam decolonization registry.guam code ann.guam code ann.native inhabitants are required to register,although some will be registered automatically unless they submit a written request not to be registered.guam code ann.guam reports that the percent threshold is close to being met.thus,guam has set a date for the plebiscite and perhaps never will.
davis tried to register with the decolonization registry,but the application was rejected because davis is a native inhabitant.davis agrees he not a native inhabitant but claims that the native inhabitant classification violates the fifth,fourteenth and fifteenth amendments,as well as the voting rights act and the guam organic because it is a proxy for race.davis seeks a declaration that limiting registration to native inhabitants is unlawful,and an injunction against using any registry other than guam general voter registry in determining who eligible to register for,and vote in,the plebiscite.
the district court held that davis lacks standing and his claims are unripe.according to the district court,davis has been injured because there is no discernible future election in sight.to suffer a real discernible injury,the district court held,guam restriction on voter registration to native inhabitants would have to be,by necessity,related to an election that is actually scheduled.we have jurisdiction pursuant to u.and review de novo.bova city of medford,cir.
ii.standing and ripeness 
to satisfy the standing requirements imposed by the case or controversy provision of article iii,davis must show that he has suffered,or will imminently suffer,a concrete and particularized injury to a judicially cognizable interest.bennett spear,see also lujan defenders of wildlife.that injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant s,and it must appear likely that the injury would be prevented or redressed by a favorable decision.bennett,at see also allen wright.when determining article iii standing we accept as true all material allegations of the complaint and construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.maya centex,cir quoting warth seldin.
guam law gives some of its voters the right to participate in a registration process that will determine whether a plebiscite will be held.davis alleges that the law forbids him from participating on the basis of his race.davis allegation that guam law provides a benefit to a class of persons that it denies him is a type of personal injury the supreme court has long recognized as judicially cognizable.heckler mathews.the plaintiff in mathews challenged a provision of the social security act that required certain male workers but not female workers to make a showing of dependency as a condition for receiving full spousal benefits.id.at.the statute,however,prevent ed a court from redressing this inequality by increasing the benefits payable to the male workers.id.at.thus,the lawsuit could have resulted in any tangible benefit to mathews.the supreme court nevertheless held that mathews had standing to challenge the provision because he sought to vindicate the right to equal treatment,which is necessarily coextensive with any substantive rights to the benefits denied the party discriminated against.see also allen,at charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure at,at ed.we read mathews as holding that equal treatment under law is a judicially cognizable interest that satisfies the case or controversy requirement of article iii,even if it brings no tangible benefit to the party asserting it.guam alleged denial of equal treatment to davis is thus a judicially cognizable injury.
guam concedes that its law excludes davis from the registration process because he not a native inhabitant.it argues,however,that the native inhabitant classification ca injure davis because the plebiscite is not self executing and effects no change in political status,right,benefit or privilege for any individual.but this contradicts mathews,which held that unequal treatment is an injury even if curing the inequality has no tangible consequences.at.moreover,guam understates the effect of any plebiscite that would be held if the registration threshold were triggered.after the plebiscite,the commission on decolonization would be required to transmit the results to the president,congress and the united nations,guam code ann,thereby taking a public stance in favor of whatever outcome is favored by those voting in the plebiscite if the plebiscite is held,this would make it more likely that guam relationship to the united states would be altered to conform to that preferred outcome,rather than one of the other options presented in the plebiscite,or remaining a territory.this change will affect davis,who doubtless has views as to whether a change is appropriate and,if so,what that change should be.guam law thus does provide a tangible benefit to native inhabitants that davis alleges he is unlawfully denied the right to help determine whether a plebiscite is held.this is not unlike the right to participate in jury service,which may not be denied on a constitutionally unequal basis.see batson kentucky,citing carter jury comm of greene,
davis challenge to the native inhabitant classification is also ripe because he alleges he currently being denied equal treatment under guam law.the registration process is ongoing and guam must hold the plebiscite if percent of eligible native inhabitants register.by being excluded from the registration process,davis claims he is unlawfully denied a right currently enjoyed by others to help determine whether a plebiscite will be held.the ripeness question thus coincides squarely with standing injury in fact prong.bova,at quoting thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc see also federal practice procedure at.
guam maintains that its plebiscite law does not,in fact,violate equal protection,the fifteenth amendment or the voting rights act.but we need not resolve these issues to determine whether davis claims satisfy the case or controversy requirement of article iii.these are merits questions,and standing does depend on the merits of the plaintiff contention that particular conduct is illegal.warth,at.
conclusion 
davis challenge to guam registration restriction asserts a judicially cognizable injury that would be prevented or redressed if the district court were to grant his requested relief.davis therefore has article iii standing to pursue his challenge to guam alleged registration classification.the claim is ripe because davis alleges he is currently subject to unlawful unequal treatment in the ongoing registration process.therefore,we
