the district court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting the state of washington from enforcing its limitation on contributions to political committees supporting the recall of a state or county official.we conclude that the plaintiffs satisfied their burden under winter natural resources defense council,to demonstrate that the contribution limit is likely an unconstitutional and harmful burden on the plaintiffs rights of free speech under the first amendment.accordingly,the district court did not err in granting the injunction,and we affirm.
background 
washington recall procedure 
washington provides its electorate with an elaborate procedure for recalling elected officials.according to washington constitution,elected officials may be recalled for malfeasance,misfeasance or a violation of their oaths of office.see.const.art.i.a voter who wishes to recall an elected official must prepare a typewritten charge naming the official and providing a detailed description of the grounds for recall.see.recall charges are filed with the county auditor,and the county prosecuting attorney then prepares a ballot synopsis,which sets forth the name of the person charged,the title of the office and the elements of the charge.see id.within days thereafter,the superior court conducts a hearing to decide whether or not the acts stated in the charge satisfy the criteria for which a recall petition may be filed,the sufficiency of the charges,and the adequacy of the ballot synopsis.id.the person demanding recall and the person subject to the recall may appear before the court with counsel and may appeal an adverse decision to the washington supreme court.see id.
if the charges are held to be sufficient,the recall proponents begin to collect signatures from registered voters who support the petition.to recall a county official whose county has a population of or more,proponents must collect a number of signatures equal to percent of the total number of votes cast for all candidates for the office to which the officer whose recall is demanded was elected at the preceding election.id.they have days to collect these signatures following court approval of the ballot synopsis.see id.if proponents collect the required number of signatures,the auditor must fix a date for a special election to determine whether or not the officer charged shall be recalled and discharged from office.id.the election must be held not less than nor more than sixty days from the time that the signatures are verified.id.if the recall is successful,the recalled official must vacate his or her office and the appropriate state legislative body will appoint a successor to fill the position until the next general election.see id.
the statutory provision challenged here prohibits contributions of more than to a political committee making expenditures in a recall campaign.see id.this limit applies to monetary and contributions alike.see id.c contributions other than money or its equivalent are deemed to have a monetary value equivalent to the fair market value of the contribution and count towards any applicable contribution limit of the provider.
plaintiffs efforts to recall dale washam 
plaintiff robin farris began an effort to recall pierce county assessor treasurer dale washam in,after becoming aware of allegations that washam had engaged in malfeasance while in office.farris formed a political committee,recall dale washam the recall committee,which she registered with the washington public disclosure commission pdc,and filed charges against washam under.
after proceedings in the superior court and an appeal,the washington supreme court found several of farris charges sufficient and approved a ballot synopsis.see in re recall of washam.the recall proponents then had until august,to collect signatures from registered pierce county voters to qualify the approved synopsis for the november ballot.
meanwhile,shortly before the washington supreme court issued its decision,the pdc issued the recall committee a notice of administrative charges,alleging that the committee violated washington revised code by accepting more than in contributions from oldfield helsdon,a law firm that had represented the committee in the state superior court and supreme court proceedings on a pro bono basis.the pdc ultimately withdrew the charges,but stated 
the fact that pdc staff does not intend to allege a violation of should not be construed to mean that the contribution limits of are not applicable to the recall election.the statute,as written,is to be followed during the recall campaign.
proceedings before the district court 
in june,farris,the recall committee and oldfield helsdon filed a complaint challenging the constitutionality of contribution limit.two weeks later,the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining the state from enforcing the contribution limit,arguing that the limit violated their first amendment rights.in july,the district court granted the motion,preliminarily enjoining the state from enforcing against the plaintiffs during the recall campaign.
ii.jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to review a district court order granting a preliminary injunction under a.before we can exercise our jurisdiction under a,however,we must ensure that this appeal continues to present a live controversy.
while this appeal was pending,the plaintiffs august,deadline to collect signatures passed.the plaintiffs did not collect the required number of signatures to qualify the recall question for the november ballot.because the district court injunction applied only to the plaintiffs campaign for the november ballot,we must consider whether this appeal is now moot.we hold that it is not moot,because this situation is capable of repetition,yet evading review.
this exception to mootness applies when the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.enyart conference of bar exam rs,cir quoting fec.right to life,internal quotation marks omitted.t he exception frequently arises in election cases because the inherently brief duration of an election is almost invariably too short to enable full litigation on the merits.human life of.brumsickle,cir quoting porter jones,cir.
both elements are present here.the district court issued the injunction on july.given its limited scope,the injunction was fully and irrevocably carried out as of august,when the plaintiffs failed to obtain enough signatures to qualify for the november ballot.enyart,at.the parties could not practically obtain appellate review of the district court order within this time.id.furthermore,if the plaintiffs attempt another recall,they will be subject to the same contribution limit.see citizens for clean gov t city of san diego,cir holding that a challenge to a contribution limit applicable to the phase of a recall election was not rendered moot by the recall effort failure to obtain sufficient signatures to place the recall question on the ballot because the controversy was capable of repetition,yet evading review enyart,at holding that the appeal of a fully and irrevocably carried out preliminary injunction was not moot because there was a reasonable expectation that the defendant would be subject to a preliminary injunction again in the future 
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review an order granting a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.see katie ex rel.ludin,cir.under this standard,a s long as the district court got the law right,it will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would have arrived at a different result if it had applied the law to the facts of the case.thalheimer city of san diego,cir alteration in original quoting dominguez schwarzenegger,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this review is limited and deferential,and it does not extend to the underlying merits of the case.id.quoting johnson couturier,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the district court,however,necessarily abuses its discretion when it bases its decision on an e
