at issue is the constitutionality of section of the election code ilcs west,which sets a deadline by which an elected judge who wishes to be retained in office must file a declaration of candidacy to succeed himself or herself.
background 
plaintiff joan margaret was elected judge of the circuit court of cook county in november.wishing to run for retention in the november general election,filed with the secretary of state a declaration of candidacy to succeed herself.she filed the declaration on december,which was one day after the deadline set by section of the election code.that section provides that the declaration must be filed on or before the first monday in december before the general election preceding the expiration of the judge term of office.ilcs west.the secretary refused to accept the declaration and,on december,certified to the state board of elections that had not timely filed a retention declaration.the state board then certified that position would become vacant in december.
then filed in the circuit court of cook county a verified complaint for mandamus and other relief against defendants jesse white,in his official capacity as secretary of state the state board of elections and all of its members in their official capacities david orr,in his official capacity as cook county clerk and the chicago board of election commissioners.the complaint alleged that the deadline set by section is unconstitutional because it conflicts with a provision of the illinois constitution that allows a judge to file a declaration of candidacy to succeed himself or herself n ot less than six months before the general election preceding the expiration of his term of office.const,art.vi,d.because filed her declaration of candidacy within this time frame,she asserted that the secretary of state was required to accept it.count i sought writs of mandamus requiring the secretary of state to accept declaration of candidacy and to amend his certification to show as eligible to run for retention the state board of elections and its members to accept the amended certification nunc pro tunc and not to accept petitions from candidates seeking to fill a putative vacancy and commanding the cook county clerk and the chicago board of election commissioners to place the question of retention on the november,general election ballot.counts ii and iii sought similar relief through declaratory judgments and injunctions.
then moved for a temporary restraining order tro.her tro motion incorporated the allegations of her complaint.in the motion,argued that she had established a clearly ascertainable right upon which relief could be granted that she would suffer irreparable injury if the relief was not granted that she had no adequate remedy at law and that she was likely to succeed on the merits.she gave three reasons why she was likely to succeed on the merits the statute expressly conflicted with a constitutional provision addressing the same subject the statute violated separation of powers principles and the statute was directory,not mandatory.
the circuit court allowed two other judges to intervene in the action.intervening plaintiff carole kamin bellows was appointed to serve as a cook county circuit court judge in november.she was elected in and thereafter retained on two occasions.she was eligible to seek retention again in november,and she filed her declaration of candidacy to succeed herself on december.the secretary of state refused to accept the declaration,and the state board certified the position as open and subject to nomination at the march primary election.intervening plaintiff james varga was elected as a cook county circuit court judge in november.he was retained in november and was eligible to run for retention again in november.on december,he verbally notified the secretary of state that he intended to seek retention and also sent a copy of the declaration via facsimile machine.he sent his declaration by federal express to the secretary of state that day,but it was not received until december.the secretary of state refused to accept the declaration,and the state board certified varga position as becoming vacant in december.
on december,the circuit court granted plaintiffs motion for a temporary restraining order.the defendants did not dispute that plaintiffs had ascertainable rights in need of protection,lacked an adequate remedy at law,and would suffer irreparable harm if no relief was granted.the court thus confined its analysis to whether plaintiffs had established a likelihood of success on the merits.the court concluded that plaintiffs had established a likelihood of success on their claim that section was unconstitutional under article vi,section d,of the illinois constitution.accordingly,the court granted a tro enjoining the secretary of state from certifying to the state board of elections that vacancies existed in the offices of circuit court judge currently occupied by plaintiffs.the court also enjoined the state board of elections from accepting nominating petitions from any candidate seeking to be placed on the march primary election ballot to succeed to the offices of circuit court judge currently held by plaintiffs.
defendants petitioned for review of the tro under supreme court rule d d.the appellate court reversed.white.the appellate court noted that the purpose of a temporary restraining order is to maintain the status quo until the case is disposed of on the merits.here,the circuit court order had altered,rather than maintained,the status quo because the secretary had already refused to accept the declarations of candidacy and had certified the vacancies to the state board of elections.the appellate court also held that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm if the state board accepted nominating petitions from other candidates,reasoning that,if plaintiffs ultimately prevailed in this suit,the effect would be that no vacancies had ever existed and that no one could be elected to their positions.
plaintiffs then moved for summary judgment,incorporating by reference all of the arguments they made in previous filings.the trial court granted the motion.the trial court disagreed with plaintiffs arguments that section was merely directory and that it violated separation of powers principles.the trial court agreed with plaintiffs,however,that section was unconstitutional under article vi,section d.the circuit court noted that the constitution created two schemes for electing judges.the first involves the initial election process,and the constitution gives the general assembly the authority to determine the content of nominating petitions and whether judges will be elected at general or judicial elections.see.const,art.vi,a.the constitution further allows the general assembly to determine how vacancies in the offices of supreme,appellate,or circuit court judge shall be filled.if the general assembly does not do so,vacancies are filled by the supreme court.const,art.vi,c.
the second election scheme is a nonpartisan retention scheme for elected judges.here,the constitution is specific in its requirements for how the retention process should be carried out.const,art.vi,d.one of the provisions of section d is that the judge may file for retention n ot less than six months before the general election preceding the expiration of his term of office.const,art.vi,d.the circuit court concluded that section d limited the general assembly role in the retention process,and no authority was given to the general assembly to alter the time limits set forth in the constitution.thus,the general assembly had exceeded its authority in setting a deadline different from the one established by the constitution.the circuit court rejected defendants argument that section d could be interpreted to mean that the general assembly can set a different deadline by which judges must file for retention,as long as that deadline is not less than six months before the general election.the circuit court entered an order declaring section unconstitutional issuing a writ of mandamus commanding the secretary of state to accept plaintiffs declarations of candidacy to succeed themselves and to certify to the state board of elections that they are candidates for retention in the general election and permanently enjoining the state board of elections from certifying any candidates to fill the offices of judge held by plaintiffs.pursuant to supreme court rule a a,the secretary of state,the state board of elections,and the members of the state board of elections appealed directly to this court.
article vi,section d,of the illinois constitution addresses the procedure for judicial retention elections 
not less than six months before the general election preceding the expiration of his term of office,a supreme,appellate or circuit judge who has been elected to that office may file in the office of the secretary of state a declaration of candidacy to succeed himself.the secretary of state,not less than days before the election,shall certify the judge candidacy to the proper election officials.the names of judges seeking retention shall be submitted to the electors,separately and without party designation,on the sole question whether each judge shall be retained in office for another term.the retention elections shall be conducted at general elections in the appropriate judicial district,for supreme and appellate judges,and in the circuit for circuit judges.the affirmative vote of of the electors voting on the question shall elect the judge to the office for a term commencing on the first monday in december following his election.const,art.vi,d.
in,the legislature enacted its own provision addressing the same subject.section of the election code provides as follows 
any supreme,appellate or circuit judge who has been elected to that office and who seeks to be retained in that office under subsection d of section of article vi of the constitution shall file a declaration of candidacy to succeed himself in the office of the secretary of state on or before the first monday in december before the general election preceding the expiration of his term of office.within business days thereafter,the secretary of state shall certify to the state board of elections the names of all incumbent judges who were eligible to stand for retention at the next general election but failed to timely file a declaration of candidacy to succeed themselves in office or,having timely filed such a declaration,withdrew it.the state board of elections may rely upon the certification from the secretary of state a to determine when vacancies in judicial office exist and b to determine the judicial positions for which elections will be held.the secretary of state,not less than days before the election,shall certify the judge candidacy to the proper election officials.the names of judges seeking retention shall be submitted to the electors,separately and without party designation,on the sole question whether each judge shall be retained in office for another term.the retention elections shall be conducted at general elections in the appropriate judicial district,for supreme and appellate judges,and in the circuit for circuit judges.the affirmative vote of of the electors voting on the question shall elect the judge to the office for a term commencing on the first monday in december following his election.ilcs west.
section was added by public act pub.act,eff.november.public act began as house bill.during the senate debates on house bill,the bill senate sponsor,senator knuppel,explained that the bill was designed to address the problem of judges who waited until after the primary election was over to decide that they were not running for retention,senate proceedings,june,at statements of senator knuppel.in that situation,the supreme court would appoint someone to fill the vacancy,and that person would hold the seat until the next election,two years later.when another senator raised the language of article vi,section d,of the constitution,senator knuppel responded 
this is the language as you pointed out,of the constitution.however,in commenting on that judge roy gully says this language seems to indicate that a judge has until the first tuesday in may.however,the practice is a bad one as is now exercised and since it only seems to be constitutionally prohibited,i think this is good legislation and we should attempt it,senate proceedings,june,at statements of senator knuppel.
after the bill was passed,senator berning stated for the record that the senate had established an interesting precedent.violating absolutely the word of the constitution,senate proceedings,june,at statements of senator berning.
james thompson vetoed the bill and sent a letter to the general assembly explaining his vote.governor thompson explained that a statute setting a deadline for judges to file for retention by the first monday in december preceding the election would be in express conflict with article vi,section d,of the constitution,which gives judges until six months before the election to decide whether to run for retention.governor thompson recognized the legislature intent in enacting section,but found it irrelevant in light of the express language of the constitution 
clearly,the sponsor intent is to ensure that where an incumbent does not file for retention,persons who may wish to become candidates for the seat may file for nomination in the primary election.however,a judge who did not,according to the provision of this bill,file for retention by the first monday in december,but decided at some later point to stand for retention while still within the time frame enunciated in the constitution,would be totally within his right.a statute can not attempt to take away a right so unequivocally mandated by the constitution.
the senate overrode the governor veto and enacted section.senator knuppel acknowledged that the legislation might create a court case to determine its validity,senate proceedings,november,at statements of senator knuppel.years later,that day has arrived.
before reaching the constitutional issue,this court must address plaintiffs argument that the deadline set forth in section is directory rather than mandatory.courts consider the constitutionality of statutes only when necessary to decide the case.vuagniaux department of professional regulation.plaintiffs contend that,if this court properly construes the time limit in section as merely directory,then it can affirm the circuit court decision without reaching the constitutional questions.according to plaintiffs,the deadline set forth in section must be read as directory because that section does not specify a penalty for a judge failure to comply.moreover,plaintiffs note that,as their declarations were filed shortly after the deadline and before the time for other candidates to file for the vacancies,no one would have been prejudiced if the secretary of state had certified their candidacies.
this court recently noted that the dichotomy concerns the consequences of a failure to fulfill an obligation.people robinson.in other words,the question is whether the failure to comply with a particular procedural step will or will not have the effect of invalidating the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates.robinson,at,quoting morris county of marin,cal d.a strong indication that the legislature intended a provision to be mandatory is if the statute prescribes a consequence for failing to obey the statutory provision.robinson,at.in the election context this court has stated that w hether a statute is mandatory or directory does not depend upon its form but upon the legislative intention to be ascertained from a consideration of the entire act,its nature,its object,and the consequences which would result from construing it one way or the other.people ex rel.meyer kerner,quoting people ex rel.agnew graham.whether a statute is mandatory or directory is an issue of law that is reviewed de novo.robinson,at.
the circuit court correctly determined that the filing deadline in section is mandatory.that section clearly prescribes a consequence for a judge failure to meet the deadline 
within business days of the deadline,the secretary of state shall certify to the state board of elec
