in,sequoyah county commissioner cleon harrell appointed bill poindexter to serve as road foreman for his district.after harrell retirement and the election of mike huff as district commissioner in,huff demoted poindexter and replaced him as road foreman with one of huff political supporters.this occurred after poindexter declined to support huff,briefly ran against huff for the commission seat,and then worked for opponents of huff in the primary and general elections.poindexter filed suit in district court,claiming that this demotion violated his first amendment rights of speech and political association 
the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on several grounds,including that the road foreman job is one for which political loyalty may appropriately be required.see branti finkel,d barker city of del city,cir.we affirm.
background 
poindexter was originally hired as road foreman by county commissioner cleon harrell after his election to that position in.poindexter was a political supporter of commissioner harrell.in,amidst rumors that commissioner harrell might resign,mike huff began to test the waters.in july,huff called poindexter and asked him if he wanted to keep his job if huff was ultimately elected.if so,huff suggested that the two get together to go over some things.in response,poindexter expressed his full support for the incumbent harrell and refused to campaign or speak out against him.huff then assured poindexter that he was not asking him to oppose commissioner harrell,but that if he were elected to the position he wanted poindexter to continue to serve as road foreman.poindexter responded,that will work.
after this conversation,rumor and gossip led poindexter to believe that huff actually intended to make another man,ed watts,his road foreman if elected.in october,commissioner harrell announced his resignation,and a special election for the position was scheduled in february.concerned that he would lose his job,poindexter ran an advertisement in the local newspaper on november,indicating that he intended to run for commissioner himself.his campaign was.poindexter decided not to run for commissioner due to various personal problems,though he never made a formal announcement that he was no longer running.
upon the announcement of poindexter candidacy,huff called poindexter and told him,i thought you were going to be my foreman.poindexter responded that he had heard that ed watts was going to be huff foreman.huff then stated,well,i talked to him first.i find someone else to help me.what happened at this point is disputed.the defendants point to evidence that huff asked poindexter repeatedly to be his road foreman if he was elected,and poindexter refused.the plaintiff denies that he told huff he did not want to be retained in the position if huff were elected.
a few weeks later,on november,huff announced his candidacy for county commissioner,stating as part of that announcement that ed watts would be his road foreman.watts endorsed huff candidacy and gave him political support.huff won the election.the day he was sworn into office,he hired watts as his road foreman.that same day,he told poindexter that he would give him a job paying less than his old road foreman position.commissioner huff gave poindexter two weeks of paid vacation to decide whether to take the job,and he ultimately declined the offer.
ii.analysis 
the supreme court has held that many public employees have the right,with certain limitations,to engage in political activities opposed to their elected superiors without penalty to their jobs.see elrod burns,d.recognizing,however,that democratic governance requires that the voters be able to influence the conduct and the selection of and politically significant throw the rascals out the court has held that political loyalty is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of some government positions.branti finkel,d.the test laid out in elrod and further refined in branti determines whether a government employee demotion violates his right to free political association.to survive summary judgment,an employee needs to show a genuine dispute of fact that political affiliation beliefs were substantial or motivating factors in his demotion,and his position did not require political allegiance.barker city of del city,cir.
the parties dispute whether the evidence establishes that commissioner huff decision to demote poindexter and hire watts was motivated by poindexter perceived political affiliation we need not resolve that dispute,because,as the district court held,the road foreman position appropriately requires political loyalty and commissioner huff was therefore entitled to give the job to a political supporter.to defend against a first amendment claim on this ground,a public employer has the burden of proving that political loyalty is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.barker,at quoting branti,at.the question is not whether any particular political superior in this case,commissioner huff actually takes political loyalty into account,but whether the nature of the position would appropriately permit him to do so.this court has held that this determination is a question of fact.snyder city of moab,cir citing barker,at see also mccollum stahl,cir holding that the nature of the relationship between the sheriff and deputy was a question of fact to be determined by a jury,cert.denied,d.in determining whether a position appropriately requires political allegiance,we focus on the inherent powers of the position and the actual duties performed.jantzen hawkins,cir.thus,if a significant factual dispute regarding the employee job duties exists,summary judgment is inappropriate.of course,if the job description and duties performed are undisputed,then the district court may resolve the issue as a matter of law.
the district court found that the road foreman powers and duties included supervising the district employees as well as supervising inmates working within the district addressing all safety issues and running safety training delegating and supervising project assignments terminating employees for cause working as county commissioner if he is absent but still under the other two commissioners supervision spending county money to purchase materials and supplies and acting as an ambassador to the community on behalf of the commissioner.dist.or.commissioner harrell testified in his deposition that the foreman acts as pretty much the assistant commissioner,doing whatever the commissioner would do when the commissioner is absent.he further testified that it was vital to him that his foreman be someone that could enforce and would enforce his policies.commissioner huff testified to similar effect.poindexter himself testified that he was responsible for everything in district and that is hours a day,seven days a week.he stated that he was responsible for kind of setting some guidelines as to how the road crew members do their work and how projects are completed.he said that he would make modest expenditures on his own authority was the example he that before making big expenditures was the would talk with the commissioner.when asked if he had responsibilities relating to citizens of the county,poindexter responded,you responsible for being an ambassador for your commissioner,which includes answering what seems like calls a year.poindexter also affirmed that i f the commissioner was unavailable,whether it was because he was off,or he was in meetings,or out of town for something,the road foreman would step into somewhat his shoes with respect to running the county.it is undisputed that the road foreman reports directly to the commissioner and there is no intermediary supervisory authority over him.
we believe that,on this record,a reasonable jury would be forced to conclude that the office of road foreman has a significant political dimension and sufficient discretionary authority that the county commissioner,for whom the foreman works,may properly take political loyalty into account.courts in other parts of the country have reached similar conclusions,though the precise job positions are vested with different responsibilities in different jurisdictions,making firm generalizations impossible.in gentry lowndes county,cir,the fifth circuit found that political allegiance is an appropriate requirement of a county road manager under mississippi law.in mississippi,the road manager runs the county road department,supervises bridge and road construction,helps prepare a budget,purchases and leases equipment,hires assistants and employees,and carries out the general policies of the county board of supervisors.id.at.similarly,in hoard sizemore,cir,the sixth circuit found that political allegiance is an appropriate requirement of the position of county road department foreman and garbage coordinator.this position involved maintaining all of the roads in the county,supervising the county road and garbage departments,reporting directly to the executive,serving as a liaison to the public regarding road problems,and answering and addressing complaints from the public.id.at see also langley hot spring county,cir holding that political allegiance is an appropriate requirement of a road foreman where the road foreman reports directly to the chief executive and has significant contact with the public.we believe that the positions involved in these cases are sufficiently similar to that of district road foreman in oklahoma to lend support to our conclusion in this case.
although not cited by either party,the best case for the plaintiff is another fifth circuit decision,wiggins lowndes county,cir,which held that the position of district road foreman in mississippi,unlike that of county road manager,is sufficiently nondiscretionary that it is not appropriate to require political allegiance.in mississippi,road foremen implement the projects determined by the road manager,supervise and assign work to the road crew,inspect equipment,maintain records and inventories,inspect roads and bridges,advise the road manager of repairs,and perform other duties assigned by the road manager.id.at.the court held that these duties,unlike those of road managers,do not involve policymaking or require confidentiality.id.at.this decision might seem especially pertinent to this case because poindexter position was that of district road foreman,and not that of county road manager.on reflection,however,we think the wiggins case is distinguishable.in oklahoma at the time of the events in this case,there were no road managers the road foremen were the highest officials in the road departments,subject only to the supervision and control of the commissioners.in most respects,including its discretionary authority over supervising employees,determining work priorities,making spending decisions,and serving as the communications link between constituents and the commissioner,the position of district road foreman in oklahoma more closely resembles that of road manager than road foreman under mississippi law.
poindexter cites to the district court unpublished decision in lunsford board of county commissioners,which refused to hold as a matter of law that the road foreman position in oklahoma requires political allegiance.wl at dist.lexis,at lexisnexis.with all respect to the district judge in that case,who sits in the state and is familiar with its practices,we do not agree with the court reasoning.according to the court,political loyalty is,as a matter of law,an inappropriate requirement because there is no political or partisan way to fix roads.lunsford,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.we think this understates the role of road construction and maintenance in rural counties.the decisions involved in road construction and repairs are often of utmost importance to constituents and many times are motivated by political goals.as the fifth circuit observed in gentry,at,roads in rural mississippi are the political lifeblood of elected officials,and the public view of the elected supervisors depends greatly on the road manager performance and supervision of employees.we believe the record in this case unequivocally shows that the same is true in sequoyah county,oklahoma.
poindexter maintains that summary judgment was improper because the following disputed issues of material fact remained whether poindexter was an ambassador for the commissioner whether the road foreman performs the duties of the commissioner if he is absent and whether the road foreman had to consult with the commissioner before making large expenditures.we do not agree.poindexter himself,in his deposition,described the position of road foreman as ambassador for your commissioner,and explained that the foreman would,in the commissioner absence,step into somewhat his shoes with respect to running the county.poindexter statement may not imply that the road foreman performs all of the duties of the commissioner when he is absent,but that is not necessary to establish that the position has a significant political dimension.
the dissent makes much of the fact that commissioner huff testified in his deposition that he did not in fact take poindexter political loyalty into account when he demoted him and hired watts to take his place.see i did care if poindexter run sic for county commissioner.he could run for it and if i won the election,he could still be the road foreman.id.at when huff was asked whether he considered the political support of persons he might hire as road foreman,he responded,no,i did mind if they supported somebody else,no sir.both quoted at diss.these statements,if believed,mean only that huff himself did not choose to hire on the basis of political loyalty.the statements have no bearing on whether,objectively speaking,the road foreman position is one for which a commissioner could appropriately insist on political loyalty.politicians are always free to appoint or claim to appoint government officials on the basis of merit or experience rather than politics.huff remarks are like a president claiming his choice of a particular cabinet secretary was nonpartisan.a sentiment,to be sure,but irrelevant to the constitutional character of the office.
we recognize that there is evidence that poindexter discretion as road foreman was limited in some ways.the road foreman could only fire employees for just cause,and the only employee whom poindexter dismissed was ultimately rehired several weeks later by commissioner harrell.poindexter testified in his deposition that he did have the authority to make great big decisions,including making large expenditures,without consulting the commissioner.moreover,his authority to commit county funds was constrained by a budget.finally,two commissioners from other districts supervised poindexter in the month period after commissioner harrell resigned and before huff was elected.poindexter was not acting as commissioner during this time,and did not attend county commission meetings in commissioner harrell stead.
viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,as we must,we still do not think it is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the road foreman position was so lacking in discretionary authority as to make political allegiance an inappropriate requirement.that poindexter employment decisions were subject to review by commissioner harrell does not mean that the road foreman position lacked discretionary authority,any more than the fact that the president can override a cabinet secretary decisions renders the latter a ministerial office.and it is not atypical that the authority of an official,even an important one,to expend public money is capped,or constrained by a budget.nor is it significant that poindexter was subject to the supervision of other commissioners after harrell departure from office no one contends that road foremen are independent agents not subject to commissioner supervision.in sum,the undisputed evidence,including poindexter own testimony,shows that the position of road foreman involves substantial even if not unlimited discretion and has a significant political dimension as a communications link between constituents and their commissioner.
poindexter briefs in this court point to almost no evidence contrary to the conclusion that his position had a significant political dimension.to challenge the claim that poindexter had authority to commit county funds,the brief cites a span of three pages in the record,which come from commissioner harrell deposition testimony.aplt.br.in these pages,harrell explained that,as a requesting officer,the road foreman had authority to commit county funds to purchase materials,within the limits of a budget.poindexter himself testified elsewhere that he could spend county funds on his own authority,but that for a big expenditure on the order of he would consult with the commissioner first.see also explaining that i could have spent the larger sum without contacting a commissioner,but i did not because i wanted to be on the same page.
to challenge the claim that poindexter had authority to fire road crew employees,the reply brief cites three pages in the record.aplt.br.two of those pages are from commissioner harrell testimony.on the first of these pages,harrell testified that the road foreman had authority to fire employees,but only for just cause,and that poindexter fired only one employee,for disobeying orders.on the second cited page,harrell stated that some two,three,four weeks after poindexter fired this employee,harrell brought him back.he does not explain why,or state that the discharge was improper or invalid.the third page is the introduction to the county employee handbook,which includes the statement,each employee is responsible to the elected official who hires appoints that employee.
the fact that a government official authority to spend public funds is capped,or limited by a budget,or that his employment decisions may be overruled by a elected official,does not render his position nondiscretionary or ministerial.appellant briefs do not question the fact that the road foreman regularly communicates with the public on behalf of the commissioner,which is the most important single fact in support of the conclusion that the job has a component of political loyalty.
the plaintiff also raised,in the alternative,a free speech claim based on the theory that his demotion was in retaliation for poindexter july averment of loyalty to harrell.we agree with the district court that there was insufficient evidence to go to the jury on this claim.at that time,huff had not decided to run against commissioner harrell.indeed,he told poindexter that he probably would not run if harrell ran for.in the conversation,huff gave no indication whatsoever that he was offended by poindexter statement of support for the incumbent.in fact,he offered poindexter the job even after that statement.in response,poindexter agreed to serve if huff won election as commissioner.the conversation thus does not reveal hostility on either man part toward the other.moreover,at the time of the conversation,huff had little or no reason to be offended even if poindexter had declined.huff did not run for commissioner until months later,when harrell had resigned and there was a special election.the evidence is undisputed that,as of july,huff was reluctant to challenge harrell and did not run in a race against him in other words,they were not political opponents.there is no evidence that poindexter expression of loyalty to harrell in july offended huff or was to his political disadvantage at that time,and therefore no reason to infer that this was a motivating factor in the subsequent demotion.
because we have affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on both the political association claim and the free speech claim,there is no need to address the sequoyah county board of commissioners contention that it is immune from suit under monell city of social,d.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
the majority opinion affirms the district court grant of summary judgment for defendants on the association claim,finding that the road foreman position in sequoyah county,oklahoma,is politically sensitive and county commissioners may,therefore,demand political loyalty from their road foremen.the majority opinion also affirms summary judgment for defendants on the speech claim,finding that there was no evidence that poindexter expression of loyalty to harrell in july offended huff or was to his political disadvantage at that time,and therefore no reason to infer that this was a motivating factor in the subsequent demotion.op.at.i disagree with the majority conclusions on both these claims,and write separately to explain my position.because i find that the position of road foreman may not require political loyalty and that this issue should be submitted to the jury,i address two issues the majority was able to avoid whether plaintiff has adequately alleged facts that could support a finding that he was fired because of his protected association and whether huff is entitled to qualified immunity.
political association 
to determine whether a public employee was wrongfully demoted for his political affiliations,a court must address two issues whether the employee political affiliations caused his demotion and whether the employee held a position which legitimately required his political allegiance.see barker city of del city,cir stating that public employees receive first amendment protection from discrimination based upon their political beliefs,affiliation,or unless their work requires political allegiance quoting mason.turnpike,cir.the supreme court decisions in elrod burns,d and branti finkel,d provide that an employer may fire his employees because of their political affiliation if party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.dickeson quarberg,cir quoting branti,at.
when deciding a motion for summary judgment,we view the evidence and draw any inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmovant.gff associated wholesale grocers,cir citing adickes kress,d.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,i conclude that poindexter presented enough evidence that he was demoted because of his political affiliation to overcome a motion for summary judgment.
the plaintiff has alleged both contested and uncontested facts in support of his claim that he was demoted because of his political affiliation.the uncontested facts are that until cleon harrell dropped out of the race,the plaintiff supported cleon harrell against mike huff in the election for county commissioner the defendant knew that plaintiff was supporting his rival and as soon as defendant became the commissioner,he demoted the plaintiff.
the parties disagree over the precise timing of huff decision to hire watts as his road foreman.huff claims that,during his november conversation with poindexter,poindexter stated that he no longer wanted to be road foreman.huff claims that he decided to hire watts only after poindexter informed him that he no longer wanted the job.poindexter contests huff version of their conversation,and claims huff informed him during their conversation in november that he had already decided to hire watts.
poindexter version of his november conversation with huff supports his claim that he was fired in retaliation for his political association in two ways.first,if the jury finds that huff had decided to hire watts as his road foreman sometime before his november conversation with poindexter,the proximity between poindexter declaration of support for harrell and huff decision to hire watts could support an inference that poindexter affiliation with harrell caused his demotion see maestas segura,cir an employer knowledge of the protected speech,together with close temporal proximity between the speech and challenged action,may be sufficiently probative of causation to withstand summary judgment.
second,if the jury believes poindexter version of his november conversation with huff,the jury could also find that huff fabricated his version of their conversation to provide a pretext for poindexter demotion.this entirely permissible finding would provide substantial support to poindexter claim.see ware unified school dist,butler county,state of kansas,cir modified in part,cir a plaintiff may create a reasonable inference of improper motivation by presenting evidence tending to show that the reasons proffered for the adverse action are without factual support.thus,the plaintiff has presented more than enough evidence that his constitutionally protected affiliation caused his demotion to withstand a motion for summary judgment.
political loyalty of the road foreman 
as the majority concede,a determination of w hether political association is an appropriate requirement for a position has been held to be a question of fact.however that question may be resolved as a matter of law if the facts as to the nature of the duties of the position are undisputed.snyder city of moab,cir affirming jury verdict for defendant because there was some evidence that plaintiff position required political loyalty emphasis added.critically,the nature of the duties of the road foreman position in this case are contested,and so the jury should decide whether the effective implementation of the road foreman responsibilities necessitated his political loyalty to the commissioner.it is beyond our competence as judges to determine whether the road foreman position requires political loyalty 
as the defendant in this case,huff must bear the burden of proof on the issue whether political affiliation was an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.dickeson,at see also branti,at stating that when determining whether political affiliation is an appropriate basis for demotion,the question is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved emphasis added.in this case,however,the most important evidence supporting the plaintiff position that the road foreman does not need to be politically loyal is huff own insistence that he did not care if poindexter supported a different candidate or ran against him in the elections.at,huff stated at his deposition,i did care if poindexter run sic for county commissioner.he could run for it and if i won the election,he could still be the road foreman.at similarly,huff was asked,when you were thinking about who you were going to hire as your road foreman,did you consider their political affiliation or association huff responded,no,i did mind if they supported somebody else,no sir.at these statements strongly suggest that huff did not think the job necessitated political loyalty,and huff is in a far better position than the members of this court to evaluate the necessity of the road foreman political allegiance to the county commissioner 
the majority concludes that based on the record in this case,a reasonable jury would be forced to conclude that the office of road foreman has a significant political dimension.op.at.i disagree with the majority assessment of the record and find that material questions of fact remain regarding whether this position legitimately necessitated political allegiance.the strongest evidence supporting poindexter position is huff insistence that based on his understanding of the nature of the road foreman position,political allegiance was not necessary.however,other evidence also supports poindexter argument that factual questions remain.for example,the majority rejects poindexter assertion that material questions of fact remain with regards to whether the road foreman performs the duties of the commissioner if he is absent.op.at.for that conclusion,the majority relies heavily on poindexter affirmation of the defense counsel statement that poindexter would step into somewhat the commissioner shoes with respect to running the county when the commissioner was absent.see op.at.unlike the majority,however,i find that poindexter affirmation of the defense counsel statement is inadequate to dispose of this factual issue.first,poindexter never explained what stepping somewhat into the commissioner shoes entailed.at emphasis added the commissioner was responsible for a wide range of highly sensitive political matters with no further elaboration from poindexter,or other evidence suggesting that poindexter was ever involved in anything beyond issues related to road repair and maintenance,his affirmation of defense counsel statement that he stepped somewhat into the commissioner shoes is far too ambiguous to support the majority conclusion that no disputed issue of material fact remained on this issue.second,other evidence in the record supports a far narrower view of poindexter responsibilities in harrell absence.for example,former commissioner harrell submitted an affidavit supporting poindexter opposition to the defendants motion for summary judgment in which he stated,i n my absence,i did not believe poindexter was empowered or otherwise authorized to perform my duties as elected commissioner for district,such as setting policy,attending board meetings,entering into contracts on behalf of the county,hiring,or voting.at similarly,in a different portion of his affidavit,poindexter testified that the other two county commissioners supervised his work after harrell stepped down,and the only difference in his job was that instead of having one boss,he had two bosses.at these differing and incomplete factual accounts are insufficient to establish the nature of the road foreman position as a matter of law,and highlight the reasons that this inquiry should remain the sole province of the jury.
ii.speech claim 
in determining whether an employee was wrongfully demoted because of his political speech,this court applies the balancing test.see twin peaks charter academy,cir after the supreme court recent decision in garcetti ceballos,d,it is apparent that the pickering analysis of freedom of speech retaliation claims is a five step inquiry which we now refer to as the analysis.internal citations and quotations omitted.however,the district court in this case applied the older,pickering test.see.order at.the main substantive change engendered by the new test is a preliminary determination of whether the employee spoke pursuant to his official duties,garcetti,at,which no one alleges was the case here.therefore,for ease of review,i will refer to the pickering test.under the pickering test,
first,we must determine whether the employee speech involves a matter of public concern.if so,we then balance the employee interest in commenting upon matters of public concern against the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.third,if the balance tips in favor of the employee,the employee then must show that the speech was a substantial factor or a motivating factor in the detrimental employment decision.fourth,if the plaintiff establishes that speech was such a factor,the employer may demonstrate that it would have taken the same action against the employee even in the absence of the protected speech.
finn new mexico,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.
the district court in this case determined that poindexter had adequately demonstrated the first two prongs of the pickering test that poindexter speech in support of harrell involved a matter of public concern and that poindexter interest in the speech outweighed huff interest in promoting the efficiency of the public services he performs through his employees.id.i agree with the district court decision on these prongs,and would only note one additional factor strongly supporting the district court determination on the second prong in jantzen,at,we held that a deputy sheriff interest in stating that he would run against his boss for sheriff was outweighed by the sheriff need to prevent disruption in effective law enforcement.we relied heavily on the sheriff testimony that,in his experience,having two people running for office would disrupt them from properly doing their job,and noted that we will defer to a public employer reasonable predictions of disruptions.id.at quoting cragg city of osawatomie,cir see also worrell henry,cir relying on employer p
