alaska requires political parties to nominate candidates for the state general election ballot in a primary,in which any registered member of a political party may seek the party nomination.nominees are then chosen by the vote of voters and any other voters whom the parties choose to let participate.the alaskan independence party aip and the alaska libertarian party alp contend that these laws burden their associational rights in violation of the first amendment because they force them to associate with candidates who,they claim,are not members of their party or are not ideologically compatible with the party.we hold that alaska primary system is justified by compelling state interests and is therefore facially constitutional.
factual and procedural background 
alaska has a mandatory direct primary system,in which all candidates for elective state and national office who appear on the state general election ballot are nominated in a primary election by direct vote of the people.alaska stat.alaska allows each political party to choose who among the electorate may vote in its primary.under alaska default rule,a party nominee is selected by voters affiliated with that political party,as well as voters who are not affiliated with any party.id.such a primary is conventionally referred to as a limited open primary or partially closed primary.see state green party of alaska,alaska.a party may opt out of these default provisions,however,by restricting its ballot to affiliated voters only,thereby holding a closed primary,or expanding its ballot to even those voters who are registered with other political parties,an open primary.see alaska stat,a see also green party,at explaining the operation of alaska mandatory direct primary system.parties that have opted to hold an open primary may choose to combine their candidates on a single ballot.see green party,at.in recent elections,both the aip and alp elected to hold open primaries and have their candidates appear on a combined ballot,which listed aip and alp candidates together with candidates from the democratic and green parties.
given the considerable freedom that alaska law provides to political parties to determine who may vote to select their nominee,the aip and alp unsurprisingly do not argue here that the alaska primary forces them to associate with any unaffiliated or undesired voters.rather,they argue that alaska laws run afoul of the first amendment because they force parties to associate with undesired candidates who appear on the primary ballot and seek their parties nominations.alaska allows a member of a political party who seeks to become a candidate of the party in the primary election to appear on the party primary ballot,provided the candidate swears a declaration of candidacy with the state and meets the state qualifications for office.alaska stat.a.as is relevant here,one of those qualifications is that the candidate must be registered to vote as a member of the political party whose nomination is being sought.id.a.such party affiliation occurs when a candidate registers as a voter with alaska voter registration agency,id,but the parties themselves do not exercise control over who may affiliate with the party in this way.if the state receives a complaint concerning any candidate eligibility for a particular office,the state director of elections must verify and make a determination of the candidate eligibility within days.id.
both the aip and alp are governed by party constitutions and internal bylaws that define party membership,specify criteria for a party candidate eligibility for public office and define various means by which the parties endorse or nominate party candidates,some of which they suggest significantly conflict with state law.aip bylaws state that party membership is limited to all residents of alaska who have registered to vote with the state department of elections and selected the alaskan independence party as their political affiliation of preference.aip bylaws also state that those who file for public office as a candidate of the aip shall be registered members of the aip at the time of filing.alp bylaws do not appear to define party membership,but they do state that a ll candidates for nomination,election or endorsement shall be alp members.both the aip and alp have provisions in their bylaws that allow them to endorse candidates for office at their conventions and decline to endorse candidates with whom they do not agree.both aip and alp bylaws acknowledge that the state has imposed a mandatory primary as the means for selecting nominees,although both parties bylaws also provide,in the alternative,for nominations by convention to the extent permitted by state law 
the aip and alp appellants brought this suit under,alleging that alaska primary system violates their right to free speech and association and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the first amendment and the alaska constitution appellants requested a declaratory judgment that political parties themselves,and not the state of alaska,have the right to determine how their candidates to appear on alaska election ballots are to be selected,and that the state of alaska must allow a political party to select its candidates for the general election ballot in a manner acceptable to the political party,and sought a permanent injunction against alaska election laws.alaska moved to dismiss and appellants for summary judgment.the district court construed the state motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment,which,after adducing evidence and obtaining further briefing,it granted for the state.we review the district court decision on for summary judgment de novo.pocatello educ.ass heideman,cir,cert.granted sub,ysursa pocatello educ.ass n,d.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
ii.analysis 
a political party has a first amendment right to limit its membership as it wishes,and to choose a process that will in its view produce the nominee who best represents its political platform.bd.of elections lopez torres,d.as the supreme court has noted,however,t hese rights are circumscribed when the state gives the party a role in the election process,such as by giving certain parties the right to have their candidates appear with party endorsement on the ballot.id.at.where,as here,the state assumes this role,then also the state acquires a legitimate governmental interest in assuring the fairness of the party nominating process,enabling it to prescribe what that process must be.id.at.the validity of such an election law depends on the severity of the burden it imposes on the exercise of constitutional rights and the strength of the state interests it serves.nader brewer,cir.the question before us is whether alaska has a sufficiently compelling interest in its mandatory primary justifying the burden on appellants associational rights.we hold that it does.
i n considering a constitutional challenge to an election law,a court must weigh the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments against the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.id.quoting anderson celebrezze,d.the supreme court has held that the severity of the burden the election law imposes on the plaintiff rights dictates the level of scrutiny applied by the court.id.specifically,an election regulation that imposes a severe burden is subject to strict scrutiny and will be upheld only if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest,whereas regulations that impose lesser burdens will be upheld as long as they are justified by a state important regulatory interests.id.at quoting and citing burdick takushi,d see also clingman beaver,d n ot every electoral law that burdens associational rights is subject to strict scrutiny i nstead,strict scrutiny is appropriate only if the burden is severe.
we need not decide in this case which level of scrutiny is appropriate,however,because we hold that alaska mandatory primary election law withstands even the more rigorous scrutiny.
