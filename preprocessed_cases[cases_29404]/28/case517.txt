jeff furchtenicht,an attorney who resides in ojai,submits two ballot initiative measures that direct the city council to exercise its informed judgment to craft and adopt laws relating to chain stores and affordable housing.monte widders,ojai city attorney,informs furchtenicht that the measures are an improper exercise of the initiative power conferred by the california constitution because they do not propose actual legislation.after furchtenicht declines to withdraw the measures,widders seeks a judicial declaration relieving him of his statutory duty to prepare ballot titles and summaries the trial court sustains furchtenicht demurrer on the ground that the action was not filed within the period for widders compliance with the applicable law,yet also finds that widders had no duty to comply with that law.
we conclude that the action was timely filed.while we recognize the strong public policy in favor of putting initiative measures before the electorate,that policy is not advanced where,as here,the proposed measures are plainly unconstitutional on their face.we further conclude that the action does not qualify as a slapp suit because widders demonstrated that he is entitled to judgment in his favor as a matter of law.accordingly,we shall reverse the sustaining of the demurrer,affirm denial of furchtenicht motion,and direct the trial court to enter judgment in favor of widders.
facts and procedural history 
on august,furchtenicht submitted two ballot initiative measures to the city clerk along with notices of intent to circulate petitions and requests for ballot titles and summaries one of the proposed measures directs the city council to urgently consider and take measures to,among other things,prohibit or deter,to the extent possible,further encroachment of national chains and franchise operations within the city limits the other essentially orders the council to urgently consider and take measures to address affordability of housing within the city of ojai.instead of proposing actual legislation,the measures merely direct the council to exercise its informed judgment to enact laws that will accomplish the stated goals.both measures provide that i f this ordinance is not adopted by the city council,the undersigned request that this ordinance be submitted immediately to a vote of the people at the general election scheduled for november,or,failing that,at a special election.the measures,however,were submitted too late to qualify for the general election 
in accordance with section,the materials were forwarded to widders on september,widders informed furchtenicht by letter that he would not be preparing ballot titles and summaries because the measures constitute an invalid attempt to exercise the initiative power pursuant to california constitution,article,section because they do not directly enact an ordinance or a statute.widders explained that the measures were an invalid attempt to enact indirect legislation,as contemplated by marblehead city of san clemente d.marblehead.widders suggested that furchtenicht withdraw the measures and resubmit them in proper substantive form.widders also stated that he would be forced to seek declaratory relief from his duty to comply with section if the measures were not withdrawn by september.
on september,furchtenicht sent an email asking widders to provide some authority supporting a city attorney refusing to timely prepare a ballot title and summary on the basis widders ha s asserted on september,widders responded by letter and attached a copy of the opinion in jahr casebeer th,d jahr.in a september email,furchtenicht rejected widders proffered authority and suggested instead of litigating,why do we have the affordability and chains independents issues put on successive city council agendas,with a presentation by city manager kersnar outlining options and making recommendations in a subsequent email,furchtenicht stated that he would withdraw the measures only if the city council complied with this demand.
there was no further correspondence between the parties,and the measures were never withdrawn.on september,widders filed an action for declaratory relief under code of civil procedure section,seeking declarations that the proposed initiative measures are facially unconstitutional that ballot titles and summaries would be misleading to the electorate that no additional public funds should be expended to process the proposed measures and that he be relieved of any duty to comply with section.widders also moved for a temporary stay of his duty to comply with the statute,and asserted that the period for his compliance had passed due to his attempts to avoid involving judicial resources by attempting to meet and confer with defendant 
furchtenicht was served with a copy of the first amended complaint and the motion for a temporary stay on october.on october,he filed a combined demurrer,motion,and opposition to the stay.the demurrer contended that the complaint failed to state a cause of action as a matter of law because furchtenicht did not bring or threaten to bring an action to compel widders to comply with section the relief sought was not necessary or proper the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the requested relief because widders failed to file his action within the period for his compliance with section and courts have not recognized any right to review of ballot initiatives.the motion argued that the grounds for sustaining the demurrer precluded widders from establishing a probability of succeeding on the merits of his claim.furchtenicht opposed the motion for a temporary stay of widders duty to comply with section solely on the ground that plaintiff has already completed all the acts constituting a breach of his duty under the elections code.the fifteen day period has passed.this court can not retroactively through the alchemy of a stay resurrect it.
the trial court granted widders motion for a temporary stay on october.on november,the court issued its order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend and denying the motion.the court sustained the demurrer on the ground that widders did not file suit within days of his receipt of the request for ballot titles and summaries and furchtenicht had not brought an action to compel widders compliance with the request.the court also found,however,that widders was well within his official duties to deny furchtenicht request to title and summarize the two initiatives.in denying the motion,the court reasoned in part that if widders had brought this action within days the court might be compelled under jahr to deny the demurrer and proceed with the lawsuit the narrowness of this ruling is that the action was not brought within the days and widders has no legal action pending asking him to do anything else.
discussion 
for judicial notice mootness 
while the appeal and were pending,widders requested judicial notice of documents purporting to reflect that the city has enacted measures to implement the matters addressed in furchtenicht proposed initiative measures.widders asserts that this information might render the case moot.we conclude otherwise.as we shall explain,widders has an ongoing duty to comply with section until either furchtenicht withdraws the initiative measures or the court issues a declaration relieving widders of his duty.accordingly,widders requests for judicial notice filed on september,and december,are denied.
the sustaining of a demurrer on a claim for declaratory relief is generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion.filarsky superior court cal th,d,filarsky.our review is de novo where the relevant facts are essentially undisputed and the issue involves statutory interpretation.aicco,insurance of north america th,d.in ruling on a demurrer to a complaint for declaratory relief,doubts regarding the propriety of a declaratory judgment are generally resolved in favor of the plaintiff.filarsky,supra,at,d.
section provides that a city attorney must prepare a ballot title and summary for an initiative measure within days of receipt.in undertaking to prepare ballot titles and summaries for furchtenicht proposed measures,widders concluded that they were beyond the scope of the initiative power conferred by article ii,subdivision of the california constitution because they do not propose legislation.accordingly,he filed an action seeking declarations that the measures were unconstitutional and relieving him of his duty to prepare ballot titles and summaries pursuant to section.he also moved for a temporary stay of his duty to comply with the statute.the same procedure was employed in jahr,although the plaintiff in that case apparently filed her action within days of receiving the request to prepare a ballot title and summary.jahr,supra,th at,d.while widders filed suit days after the statutory time for his compliance had passed,he explained that the delay was attributed to his efforts to avoid litigation.
the trial court nevertheless sustained furchtenicht demurrer on the ground that widders had filed suit too late.we agree with widders that this ruling was erroneous.there is simply no authority for the proposition that the time period referred to in section was intended to act as a statute of limitations on a city attorney right to seek judicial relief from his or her duty to comply with the statute.
furchtenicht argument to the contrary is based on a misreading of schmitz younger cal d,schmitz.in schmitz,the proponent of a ballot initiative petitioned for a writ of mandate compelling the attorney general to prepare a ballot title and summary in accordance with his duties under former sections and now section.the attorney general had refused to act on the ground that the proposed measure violated the one subject rule of the california constitution the court held that t he duty of the attorney general to prepare title and summary for a proposed initiative measure is a ministerial one and mandate will lie to compel him to act when the proposal is in proper form and complies with statutory and constitutional procedural requirements.citation.schmitz,supra,at.the court reasoned the single subject requirement of article ii,section,subdivision b,involves difficult legal questions that only a court may resolve.citation.we are satisfied that a claim for violation of subdivision d is not merely a formal one,but is based on the effects of the contents of the proposed measure.absent judicial authorization,the attorney general may not urge violation of the single subject requirement to justify refusal to title and prepare summary of a proposed measure.this does not mean that the attorney general may not challenge the validity of the proposed measure by timely and appropriate legal action.we hold only that without prior judicial authorization he may not delay or impede the initiative process while claims of the measure invalidity are determined.petitioner is entitled to have his proposal titled and summarized so that he may commence seeking signatures to qualify it for the ballot.id.at,italics added.in so holding,the court express ed no view as to the merits of the claim that the proposed measure concerns more than one subject.ibid.
according to furchtenicht,the reference in schmitz to prior judicial authorization and the court refusal to consider the merits of the attorney general constitutional claim compels the conclusion that any action seeking relief from the duty to prepare ballot titles and summaries can not be brought after the statutory time period to comply with the duty has passed.in other words,furchtenicht essentially asserts that widders claim would have been justiciable only if,instead of attempting to explain the invalidity of the proposed initiatives and giving furchtenicht the opportunity to withdraw them,widders had simply gone to court and filed suit immediately.
nothing in schmitz can be construed to compel such a result.furchtenicht overlooks the line of cases recognizing that government entities and officials charged with failing to perform ministerial duties under the elections code may assert invalidity of the initiative measure as a defense in actions brought to compel performance of the duty after the statutory period for compliance has passed.see farley healey cal d,save stanislaus area farm economy bd.of supervisors th,d citizens for responsible behavior superior court th,d debottari city council d.citizens against a new jail bd.of supervisors d.gayle hamm d.in those circumstances,the refusal to act may be retroactively validated by a judicial declaration that the measure should not be submitted to the voters.citizens for responsible behavior,supra,at,d.e ven if the local entity usurps the judicial power in this respect,it remains appropriate for the courts to determine whether the result was correct.ibid.there is no legal distinction where,as here,the official charged with the ministerial duty comes to court of his own accord seeking judicial authorization for his decision,and the claim is brought within a reasonable period of time after it became clear that attempts to avoid litigation had failed.see city of san diego dunkl th,d dunkl city statutory period preceding process was not a deadline for filing declaratory relief action plaintiffs acted with reasonable promptness in filing suit six weeks after process of collecting signatures began.
widders also sought prior judicial authorization for his decision,as contemplated by schmitz.notwithstanding furchtenicht repeated insistence that widders unilaterally refused to comply with section,widders never purported to have the authority to refuse to act without judicial authorization.rather,he made it clear from the outset that he would have no choice but to seek such authorization if furchtenicht did not withdraw his request for ballot titles and summaries.widders also sought and was granted a stay of his duty to comply with the statute after furchtenicht essentially failed to oppose the request.accordingly,schmitz offers no support for furchtenicht assertion that widders waited too long to file suit.
in sustaining the demurrer,the trial court also concluded that the declaratory relief widders sought was not necessary or proper as contemplated by code of civil procedure section,because his claim was not ripe for adjudication.the court reasoned that the period for widders compliance with section had passed and furchtenicht brought no action requesting widders do anything more.widders contends that his claim was ripe notwithstanding these circumstances.we agree.
for obvious reasons,the obligation to perform a ministerial duty under the elections code remains even where performance is beyond the statutory time frame mhc financing.partnership two city of santee th,d mhc financing native american sacred site and environmental protection city of san juan capistrano th,d.widders therefore has an ongoing duty to address furchtenicht request for ballot titles and summaries.
moreover,widders did not have to wait for furchtenicht to sue him in order to obtain judicial relief from that duty.furchtenicht argument to the contrary is based on two cases involving the special statutory procedures for judicial review of requests for the disclosure of documents under the california public records act cpra.filarsky,supra,cal th at,d,city of santa rosa press democrat d.unlike the cpra,there is no special statutory review procedure at issue here.widders can not forego his duty to comply with section without judicial authorization schmitz,supra,cal d at,and that duty remains until the court declares otherwise or furchtenicht withdraws his request.
moreover,furchtenicht as the proponent of the initiative is properly named as a defendant in the action.see dunkl,supra,th at,d.because the case for declaratory relief was plainly made,the court erred in sustaining the demurrer on the ground that furchtenicht did not file his own lawsuit.
prepetition review 
furchtenicht,joined by amicus curiae initiative referendum institute,also challenges the propriety of allowing judicial review at what he labels the prepetition stage of the initiative process,before an initiative petition has been circulated for signatures.because the trial court did not address this argument in its order sustaining the demurrer,and emphasized that its ruling was based on the narrow time grounds that widders filed his action too late,the court implicitly considered and rejected the claim that the action was filed too soon.
in any event,furchtenicht fails to establish that prepetition review of his initiative measures is constitutionally proscribed.as he acknowledges,our supreme court has recognized that the governmental official responsible for the duty of preparing ballot titles and summaries may seek judicial relief from that duty.schmitz,supra,cal d at.we are bound by that decision.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.moreover,furchtenicht had no constitutionally protected right to place his initiatives on the ballot if they were invalid.see,dunkl,supra,th at,d.while he asserts that he had a constitutionally protected right to circulate petitions for those initiatives,our supreme court has recognized there is no value in putting before the people a measure which they have no power to enact.american federation of labor eu cal d at.an initiative is put before the people ibid.when they are asked to sign a petition to place it on the ballot,and the people who sign the petition reasonably presume that the measure will be on the ballot if enough signatures are gathered.w hile the right of free speech is one of the most precious rights to citizens of a free and open society,it is not without limit when the state constitution provides it with a special forum for an initiative process in which voters are asked to sign a petition which ultimately may impact the community.san francisco nishioka th,d see also city of riverside stansbury th,d rejecting initiative proponent contention that he had an unfettered right to circulate a petition and to present it to the sovereign because there is no constitutional right to place an invalid initiative on the ballot 
furchtenicht also complains that widders suit was filed at the very beginning of the initiative process,when the possibility of the initiative qualifying and being filed with the city was speculative at best,and long before the city would even possibly face any affirmative duty to take anything more than de minimis action.he also asserts that t he only fiscal cost at the early stages of the statutory framework is the de minimis cost associated with the actual preparation of a ballot title and summary.we are not persuaded.fiscal costs are not the only relevant consideration.frequently,the heated rhetoric of an election campaign may open permanent rifts in a community.that the people right to directly legislate through the initiative process is to be respected and cherished does not require the useless expenditure of money and creation of emotional community divisions concerning a measure which is for any reason legally invalid.citizens for responsible behavior superior court,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted.the circulation of a petition,particularly in a small town,can invoke the same level of heated rhetoric capable of creating permanent rifts in a community that a election campaign can.ibid.
the presentation of invalid ballot measures for circulation and collection of signatures may also serve to undermine public confidence in the process.one of the fundamental purposes of the ballot title and summary is to reduce the risk that voters were misled when they signed the petition mhc financing,supra,th at,d.the ballot title and summary must reasonably inform the voter of the character and real purpose of the proposed measure.citations.lungren superior court th,d.in moving for a temporary stay of his duty to comply with section,widders asserted that g iven the defective nature of these two proposed initiatives,there exists a genuine concern that the mere availability of a ballot title and summary for the petition bearing the imprimatur of the city effectively conceal the fatal flaws of the proposed measures,thus misleading the electors.this statement illustrates the reality that the duty to prepare ballot titles and summaries,although characterized as merely ministerial,requires the exercise of professional skills and judgment.widders asserted that he could not conceive of a ballot title and summary that would not be misleading to the voters.in light of this concern,it was appropriate for him to seek judicial guidance on how to proceed.
while furchtenicht acknowledges that his measures were submitted too late to qualify for the general election held on november,he argued that if widders had prepared the ballot titles and summaries in a timely fashion the initiatives would have been presented to the city council for adoption or rejection prior to the november election,and the voters of the city of ojai could have had the opportunity to consider their elected representatives votes on adoption or rejection in the upcoming election.furchtenicht fails to identify any constitutionally protected right to exploit the initiative process for such a purpose.the statutory and constitutional right to petition contemplates the direct enactment of laws.it is not designed to compel candidates to take a position on a particular matter so that the electorate may determine whom it wishes to favor with its vote.as our supreme court has observed,an initiative which seeks to do something other than enact a seeks to render an administrative decision,adjudicate a dispute,or declare by resolution the views of the resolving not within the initiative power reserved by the people.american federation of labor eu,supra,cal d at.the initiative process is not a public opinion poll.it is a method of enacting legislation,and if the proposed measure does not enact legislation,or if it seeks to compel legislative action which the electorate has no power to compel,it should not be on the ballot.id.at.
furchtenicht also complains that widders refusal to prepare ballot titles and summaries prevented him from engaging in the good faith bargaining process contemplated by section,subdivision a nothing in that section,however,identifies any right to utilize the initiative process for a ballot measure that the voters can not enact.moreover,furchtenicht made no meaningful effort to oppose widders request for a stay of his duty to comply with section.had he done so,the court may have denied the stay and ordered widders to comply with the statute while the underlying issues were being litigated.instead,furchtenicht simply argued that t here is nothing to be stayed because t his court can not retroactively through the alchemy of a stay resurrect the period within which widders was supposed to have complied with the statute.furchtenicht therefore can not be heard to complain that widders prevented him from proceeding.
furchtenicht also laments that even the mere threat of costly litigation resulting from the act of filing a request for the city to prepare ballot title and summary will deter people from engaging in their protected right to initiative.bringing lawsuits against petitioners at such an early stage,when they are testing the waters of public support,would certainly cause the average person significant concern,and discourage them from exercising their constitutional rights.he then refers us to declarations from three ojai residents who claim that,as a result of this lawsuit,they and others are afraid to speak out for fear of being sued.
these arguments and assertions fail to acknowledge the particular context in which this case arose.widders gave an objective assessment of furchtenicht initiatives pursuant to his role as city attorney.he did not express any views regarding the subject matter,and gave no indication whether he personally or professionally disagreed with the stated objectives.he merely conveyed his informed conclusion that the measures were invalid.instead of accepting widders suggestion that he attempt to correct the deficiencies,furchtenicht chose to view widders as an adversary and challenged his legal conclusions.when given the option of withdrawing the initiatives or facing litigation,furchtenicht effectively chose the latter.nothing about this scenario conveys the impression that citizens will be sued for merely speaking out on an issue or otherwise participating in the local pol
