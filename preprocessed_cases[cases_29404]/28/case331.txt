factual and procedural history 
voters in the city of san jose,california,passed an amendment to the city charter that required the mayor and city council to adopt limitations on campaign contributions for certain elected city positions.pursuant to that directive,the city council enacted,among other laws,san jose municipal code section 
contribution limitations to independent committees.
no person shall make nor shall any person accept any contribution to or on behalf of an independent committee expending funds or making contributions in aid of opposition to the nomination or election of a candidate for city council or mayor which will cause the total amount contributed by such person to such independent committee to exceed two hundred fifty dollars per election.
independent committees contributing to election campaigns in addition to city of san josé council or mayoral campaigns shall segregate contributions received and contributions or expenditures made for the purpose of influencing such san josé elections from all other contributions or expenditures.where an independent committee has segregated such contributions and expenditures for such city elections,contributors to that committee may contribute more than two hundred fifty dollars so long as no portion of the contribution in excess of two hundred fifty dollars is used to influence san josé council or elections.
c.this section is not intended to prohibit or regulate contributions to independent committees to the extent such contributions are used on behalf of or in opposition to candidates for offices other than mayoral or council offices of the city of san josé.
beginning on may,plaintiffs mailed informational flyers and placed automated telephone calls to voters in san jose.the flyers and telephone messages referred to a specific candidate for mayor in the upcoming june,primary election.
in response to a citizen complaint filed on may,the commission began an investigation into whether the flyers and telephone messages violated the contribution limits in san jose municipal code section an independent evaluator conducted an investigation and presented its written report to the commission commission report.on may,the commission adopted the commission report and concluded that plaintiffs had violated the contribution limits in section.
the commission decided to assess two penalties at a future date a statement of public reprimand and a fine to be calculated based on the amount of contributions plaintiffs received in excess of the contributions limit.on june,the commission issued a statement of public reprimand.to date,the commission has not assessed the fine against plaintiffs,because it has been unable to calculate the amount of the fine.the commission asserts that plaintiffs have refused to provide the necessary financial information.
on july,plaintiffs filed a complaint in federal district court,alleging that defendants actions violated.plaintiffs bring both a facial challenge and an challenge to san jose municipal code section.plaintiffs claim that,on its face,the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad,in violation of the fourteenth amendment,and that it impermissibly restricts plaintiffs right to free speech,in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments.plaintiffs also assert that,as applied to their mailers and telephone messages,the commission decision and section violate the first and fourteenth amendments.
the complaint concludes with the following prayers for relief 
for declaratory judgment of this court,declaring sjmc san jose municipal code section unconstitutionally vague and overbroad,and therefore invalid,as set forth above 
for declaratory judgment of this court,declaring sjmc section is unconstitutional and invalid under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,as set forth above

discussion 
younger abstention is a jurisprudential doctrine rooted in overlapping principles of equity,comity,and federalism.see steffel thompson,d explaining the history and purposes of the doctrine younger,at discussing the jurisprudential background of abstention gilbertson albright,cir en banc tracing the supreme court application of the doctrine.we must abstain under younger if four requirements are met a proceeding is ongoing the proceeding implicates important state interests the federal plaintiff is not barred from litigating federal constitutional issues in the state proceeding and the federal court action would enjoin the proceeding or have the practical effect of doing so,would interfere with the state proceeding in a way that younger disapproves.gilbertson,at amerisourcebergen roden abc,cir see also green city of tucson,cir en banc i n addressing younger abstention issues,district courts must exercise jurisdiction except when specific legal standards are met,and may not exercise jurisdiction when those standards are met there is no discretion vested in the district courts to do otherwise,overruled in other part by gilbertson.an exception to that general rule exists if there is a showing of bad faith,harassment,or some other extraordinary circumstance that would make abstention inappropriate.middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d.although younger itself involved potential interference with a state criminal case,the supreme court has extended the doctrine to federal cases that would interfere with state civil cases and state administrative proceedings.ohio civil rights comm dayton christian,d.as virtually all cases discussing younger abstention emphasize,the limited circumstances in which abstention by federal courts is appropriate remain the exception rather than the rule.abc,at internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.
ongoing state proceeding 
the proceeding in this elections commission investigation of plaintiffs ongoing.after concluding that plaintiffs had violated san jose municipal code section,the commission decided to impose two sanctions a public reprimand and a fine.a month later,it issued the public reprimand.but,apparently because plaintiffs have failed to provide the necessary financial information,the commission has not yet assessed any fine.
plaintiffs argue that,because the commission has decided that a violation occurred,the proceeding is no longer ongoing.we disagree.the transcript of the commission hearing makes clear that the proceeding has not concluded 
mertens so my understanding is that we covered the finding of a violation,and we also covered the action we going to take,which is going to be imposing a penalty,as well as issuing a public reprimand.and will determine at a future date the number of violations and the penalty that will be imposed by the commission.
sato chair,clarification.are you also directing the commission evaluator to proceed with an investigation as to the number of potential violations 
mertens if that is the recommended course of action.
commission then moves for a vote,and votes in favor of that course of action.
emphases added.
the status of the commission proceeding is analogous to the status of a civil case in which the district court has resolved liability but has not finalized relief.see riley kennedy,d we have long held that an order resolving liability without addressing a plaintiff requests for relief is not final.the procedure here is also analogous to a criminal case in which the trier of fact has determined guilt,but the court has not imposed a sentence.in that circumstance,no final judgment has been entered,and the proceeding is plainly ongoing see corey united states,d final judgment in a criminal case means sentence.the sentence is the judgment.internal quotation marks omitted.there is no principled distinction between finality of judgments for purposes of appellate review and finality of proceedings for purposes of younger abstention.we therefore hold that the administrative proceeding is ongoing for purposes of younger abstention.
at oral argument,plaintiffs lawyer observed that a state administrative agency could intentionally delay completion of a proceeding so as to thwart and review.as we have noted,an exception to younger abstention applies upon a showing of bad faith,harassment,or some other extraordinary circumstance.middlesex,at.plaintiffs hypothetical example would fall under that exception but,here,plaintiffs have not argued that defendants have acted in bad faith and the record does not support such a finding.indeed,it appears that any delay has been caused by plaintiffs,first by refusing to provide the necessary financial information and then by filing this federal action,only six weeks after the elections commission decision to impose a fine.
we pause to note an important legal issue that we need not and do not reach.under california law,an aggrieved party may challenge a final administrative action in state court by petitioning for a writ of mandate.if a state administrative proceeding is final,and judicial review is available but has not been invoked,is the state proceeding nevertheless ongoing for purposes of younger abstention in other words,must federal courts view the administrative proceeding and the possibility for review as one unitary proceeding the supreme court has stated that this is an open question.new orleans pub,council of new orleans nopsi,d see also id.at.rehnquist,concurring in the judgment stating that he would hold that the proceedings are unitary id.at.blackmun,concurring in the judgment stating that he is not entirely persuaded that the question is open.
seven circuits have addressed this question.four have held that the administrative proceeding and the possibility for state court review are to be viewed as one unitary proceeding,and three have held the opposite.compare,cir younger now has to be read as treating the state process the administrative proceeding and the possibility for review as a continuum from start to finish,majors engelbrecht,cir holding that the state proceeding is ongoing,even assuming that the administrative proceeding is final and review had not begun,city of philadelphia,cir joining the majority rule and observing that w e have been given no reason why a litigant in a state administrative proceeding should be permitted to forego judicial review of the agency decision in order to apply for relief in federal court,and alleghany pomeroy,cir noting that the supreme court left the question open and deciding that the proceedings are unitary,with norfolk ry.pub.utils.comm n,cir agreeing that a state administrative enforcement proceeding is no longer pending when the agency proceeding has been completed,notwithstanding the availability of state appellate review,cecos int l,jorling,cir holding that an aggrieved party may choose between petitioning the state court for review and filing a federal claim,and thomas.state bd.of med.exam rs,cir the mere availability of state judicial review of state administrative proceedings does not amount to the pendency of state judicial proceedings within the meaning of huffman pursue,d.
although we briefly joined the majority rule in,that opinion was withdrawn,and we have not addressed the question since then.see.entm t,city of henderson,cir per curiam joining majority rule,withdrawn by cir,on reh g cir unpublished disposition holding that the younger abstention question was moot see also kleenwell biohazard waste ecology consultants,nelson,cir noting that the question is open in this circuit,but declining to reach it.because,here,the administrative proceeding itself is ongoing,we do not reach the issue.
important state interest 
younger abstention is required only if the state proceeding implicates important state interests.gilbertson,at.the importance of the interest is measured by considering its significance broadly,rather than by focusing on the state interest in the resolution of an individual case.baffert cal.horse racing,cir.for example,we have held that a state interest in p reserving the integrity of horse racing is a significant interest.see also middlesex,at.holding that a state interest in regulating the ethical standards of lawyers is an important state interest.the state interest its local likewise an important state interest.
whether the state proceedings are judicial in nature also plays a role in assessing the significance of the state interest.baffert,at.j udicial proceedings or disciplinary proceedings which are judicial in nature are the type of proceeding that does implicate an important state interest.however,a state proceeding which is nonjudicial or involves the interpretation of completed legislative or executive action is not of that character.gilbertson,at citations omitted.the elections commission proceeding involved the investigation of the facts of plaintiffs mailing and telephoning campaign and the application of the law to those proceeding plainly judicial in nature.see nopsi,at.discus
