convinced that the absence of limits on contributions to ballot measure committees controlled by candidates permitted candidates to circumvent statutory restrictions on campaign contributions,the california fair political practices commission fppc promulgated a regulation limiting contributions to such committees,tit,hereafter regulation.in a legal challenge to the regulation brought by a campaign committee and a candidate,the trial court concluded plaintiffs would likely prevail on their claims that the regulation is unconstitutional and exceeded the fppc statutory authority.because it believed plaintiffs would otherwise suffer irreparable harm by virtue of the regulation chilling effect on the exercise of first amendment rights,the trial court granted plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction pending trial.
whatever the wisdom of the fppc effort to plug loopholes in california campaign contribution regulatory scheme,we agree with the trial court determination that the regulation conflicts with multiple provisions of the political reform act of pra,et and thereby exceeds the fppc authority.our conclusion that the fppc overstepped its authority renders a consideration of plaintiffs constitutional claims unnecessary.accordingly,we shall affirm the order granting a preliminary injunction.
background 
the pra regulates various aspects of the political process,including campaign contributions,the disclosure of financial information relating to public officials and their campaigns,and the activities of lobbyists.the fppc administers the pra and has authority to promulgate regulations that are consistent with and further the purposes of the pra.violations of the pra are punishable by criminal and civil penalties.
the pra may be amended only by a statute furthering its purposes and passed by a vote of the legislature,or by a statute approved by the electorate.in the electorate passed proposition,the campaign contribution and voluntary expenditure limits without taxpayer financing amendments to the political reform act of,which approved various amendments to the pra.see stats,ch.bill,eff.july,as approved by voters.
section imposes specified limits upon the amount of money individuals may contribute to candidates for elective state office,candidates for statewide elective office,and candidates for governor section similarly imposes specified limits upon contributions made by small contributor committees these statutes encompass contributions to the candidate controlled election or reelection committee,which contributions are required to be deposited in one campaign contribution account.
section limits the amount of contributions made by individuals to political party committees,and to any committees other than political party committees,for the purpose of making contributions to candidates for elective state office.however,except as provided in section concerning payments for communications that clearly identify a candidate for elective state office but do not expressly advocate the election or defeat of the candidate,there are no limitations upon a person contributions to a committee or political party committee provided the contributions are used for purposes other than making contributions to candidates for elective state office,subd.c.
in eschewing limits on contributions to ballot measure committees,section,subdivision c comports with citizens against rent control berkeley,d carc.there,the united states supreme court held that although it is constitutional to limit contributions to candidates and their committees,an ordinance limiting contributions to ballot measure committees unconstitutionally interfered with first amendment freedoms of speech and association and was not justified by the governmental interest in preventing special interest groups from corrupting the initiative process.id.at.carc observed,referenda are held on issues,not candidates for public office.the risk of corruption perceived in cases involving candidate elections citations omitted simply is not present in a popular vote on a public issue citation.id.at.to place a spartan indeed any individuals wishing to band together to advance their views on a ballot measure,while placing none on individuals acting alone,is clearly a restraint on the right of association.id.at.
carc did not expressly address whether contributions to ballot measure committees could be construed as contributions to the candidates who controlled the committees and hence be limited without violating the constitution.
initially,the fppc interpreted carc,supra.as precluding limits on contributions to ballot measure committees and opined that the candidate contribution limits of the pra did not apply to such committees because the funds are used for purposes other than making contributions to candidates for elective state office.it changed its position in,however,following the recall of governor gray davis.based on concerns that candidates were using ballot measure committees to promote their candidacies and evade the campaign contribution limits of the pra,the fppc adopted regulation,which limits contributions to ballot measure committees.
fppc regulation provides,in relevant part b notwithstanding government code sections sic,subdivision c,the contribution limits of government code sections and apply to any committee controlled by a candidate for elective state office that is established for the purpose of supporting or opposing state or local ballot measures.the applicable limit is that which applied to the controlling candidate at the time the ballot measure committee was formed or became controlled by that candidate.
a committee,within the meaning of the regulation,is any person or combination of persons who directly or indirectly does any of the following a receives contributions totaling one thousand dollars or more in a calendar year.b makes independent expenditures totaling one thousand dollars or more in a calendar year or c makes contributions totaling ten thousand dollars or more in a calendar year to or at the behest of candidates or committees.
controlled committee means a committee that is controlled directly or indirectly by a candidate or that acts jointly with a candidate,or controlled committee in connection with the making of expenditures.a candidate controls a committee if he or she,his or her agent,or any other committee he or she controls has a significant influence on the actions or decisions of the committee,subd.a.according to the fppc,a significant influence includes being a voting member of a committee leadership body or formulating campaign strategy.
candidate means an individual who is listed on the ballot or who has qualified to have votes on his or her behalf counted by election officials,for nomination for or election to any elective office,or who receives a contribution or makes an expenditure or gives his or her consent for any other person to receive a contribution or make an expenditure with a view to bringing about his or her nomination or election to any elective office,whether or not the specific elective office for which he or she will seek nomination or election is known at the time the contribution is received or the expenditure is made and whether or not he or she has announced his or her candidacy or filed a declaration of candidacy at such time.according to the fppc,officeholders are considered candidates,regardless of whether they are or have candidate committees open.
under the regulation,a ballot measure committee controlled by a candidate for governor may receive larger contributions than one controlled by a candidate for any other statewide elective office,which in turn can receive larger contributions than one controlled by a candidate for elective state office delineated by district,see fns,ante.ballot measure committees that are not controlled by candidates are not subject to these contribution limits.reg,subd.a,subd.c.
subsequent to the fppc promulgation of regulation,the legislature considered,but failed to pass,two bills that would have enacted a statute expressly limiting contributions to ballot measure committees.assem.bill reg.sess.assem.bill reg.sess.
on february,plaintiffs citizens to save california and keith richman,who are a ballot measure committee and a member of the california assembly,filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief against the fppc concerning regulation.thereafter,the governor and governor schwarzenegger california recovery team,a ballot measure committee controlled by him,intervened as plaintiffs in the action.senator john campbell and two ballot measure committees,rescue california from budget deficits and taxpayers for responsible pensions,also intervened as plaintiffs by separate complaint.plaintiffs alleged the regulation was invalid as it conflicted with various provisions of the pra and unconstitutionally infringed upon their first amendment freedoms of speech and association.they sought a preliminary injunction precluding enforcement of the regulation pending trial.
the trial court found plaintiffs had established a probability of success on the merits in that the fppc regulation conflicted with various provisions of the pra,and the fppc may not promulgate regulations that conflict with the pra.however,the court found that the statutory conflicts did not warrant a preliminary injunction because the only harm occasioned by the bare statutory infirmities is the existence of the invalid regulation until the action is finally resolved.
the court also found that plaintiffs had demonstrated a reasonable probability that regulation violated the first amendment and that they would suffer imminent irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction did not issue enjoining the fppc from enforcing the regulation pending trial.the court noted that a complaint had been filed with the fppc alleging one of the plaintiffs had violated the regulation,and that all of the plaintiffs were chilled in their ability to associate with candidates or ballot measure committees because of the contribution limits imposed by regulation.the court observed,plaintiffs may associate and champion their political causes,but severely limit their ability to amass resources essential to effectively advance their political ideas or,they may maintain their full financial potential in parity with their opponents,but must surrender their ability to meaningfully associate and collaborate in the free exchange of political ideas.accordingly,the court granted plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction.
discussion 
the fppc contends the trial court erred in finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits with respect to their claim that the regulation is unconstitutional.
plaintiffs disagree but maintain we need not and should not reach the constitutional issue because the trial court found that the regulation exceeded the fppc statutory authority to promulgate regulations as it conflicted with portions of the pra.the fppc did not dispute this ruling in any meaningful way in its opening brief on appeal.although the court found that a preliminary injunction was not warranted on this ground because the statutory violation would not result in irreparable harm pending trial,this is of no moment because where a pure question of law is presented,the reviewing court may address the issue on the merits,rendering a subsequent trial on the issue unnecessary.moreover,according to plaintiffs,the court erred in finding that enforcement of the invalid regulation would not result in irreparable harm.
in its reply brief,the fppc alleges it did not address the statutory issue because the court did not grant the preliminary injunction on this basis.it invites us to address the matter for the benefit of the further proceedings in the superior court.however,it does not provide any analysis or authority refuting plaintiffs claim that we can address the issue as a matter of law,which would render unnecessary any further proceedings on the statutory question.
courts generally should avoid resolving constitutional issues if a case can be decided on statutory grounds.de lancie superior court cal d,fn,terhune superior court th,d.hence,we should address the statutory claim first if it is dispositive and thereby renders litigation of the constitutional claim unnecessary.it does.
ordinarily an appeal from the granting of a preliminary injunction involves a very limited review of the trial court exercise of discretion concerning two factors the likelihood that plaintiffs will ultimately prevail and the interim harm plaintiffs will sustain if the preliminary injunction is denied compared to the interim harm defendant will suffer if the injunction is granted pending a final determination of the merits.citations.occasionally,however,the likelihood of prevailing on the merits depends upon a question of pure law rather than upon evidence to be introduced at a subsequent full trial if such a question of pure law is presented,it can sometimes be determinative over the other factor hunter city of whittier d.
in other words,if the trial court ruling regarding the invalidity of the regulation is correct,plaintiffs will be entitled to the requested relief as a matter of law.no purpose would be served in remanding the matter for trial based solely on the absence of irreparable harm,as t he issue of the validity of the challenged regulation is solely one of law,and this court is in as good a position to resolve the issue now as the trial court would be after determination of this appeal.north coast coalition woods d.north coast see also jimenez honig d.palos verdes shores mobile estates,city of los angeles d.
we are cognizant of the rule that except in a clear case we should not anticipate the final judgment of the trial court by disposition of an appeal from the order granting the preliminary injunction.north coast,supra,d at.however,where a case is clear and no fact questions are presented,a determination on the merits is appropriate and becomes law of the case.ibid.
accordingly,we turn to the question of whether the regulation indeed is invalid as a matter of law.
the fppc authority to promulgate regulations is governed by section,which provides,in relevant part the commission may adopt,amend and rescind rules and regulations to carry out the purposes and provisions of this title,and to govern procedures of the commission.these rules and regulations shall be adopted in accordance with the administrative procedure act and shall be consistent with this title and other applicable law.
section expressly incorporates the dictates of the administrative procedure act et,which provides that to be effective,regulations shall be within the scope of authority conferred and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law and that no regulation adopted is valid or effective unless consistent and not in conflict with the statute and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.
because the fppc is charged with administering the pra,its view of the regulations enforcing and the statutes comprising the pra is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous or unauthorized.californians for political reform foundation fair political practices com.th,d.w here the regulation at issue is one deemed necessary to effectuate the purposes of the statute,we apply a more deferential standard of review,requiring only that the regulation be reasonable.ibid.however,we do not defer to an agency view when deciding whether a regulation lies within the scope of the authority delegated by the legislature.the court,not the agency,has final responsibility for the interpretation of the law under which the regulation was issued.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,fn,d.

proposition contains an express declaration of its purpose and intent.section a of the proposition declares,in relevant part monetary contributions to political campaigns are a legitimate form of participation in the american political process,but large contributions may corrupt or appear to corrupt candidates for elective office.increasing costs of political campaigns have forced many candidates to devote a substantial portion of their time to raising campaign contributions and less time to public policy.voter information guide,text of.proposition purpose,as stated in section b,is t o ensure that individuals and interest groups in our society have a fair and equitable opportunity to participate in the elective and governmental processes,and t o minimize the potentially corrupting influence and appearance of corruption caused by large contributions by providing reasonable contribution and voluntary expenditure limits.ibid.
this legislative purpose is implemented through precise limits on contributions for the support or defeat of candidates for elective state offices,and in some cases payments for communications that merely mention a candidate,as set forth in chapter of the pra section et.limits on contributions by individuals are imposed by section.contributions by small contributor committees are limited by section.payments for communications that clearly identify a candidate for elective state office without advocating the candidate election or defeat are limited by section.otherwise,n othing in this chapter shall limit a person contributions to a committee or political party committee provided the contributions are used for purposes other than making contributions to candidates for elective state office,subd.c.
to reiterate,the pra dictates that sections and do not apply to contributions to any committees,which would include ballot measure committees,as long as the money is used for purposes other than making contributions to candidates for elective state office.into this clear and comprehensive regulatory scheme,the fppc injects regulation,which states that sections and apply to contributions to ballot measure committees that are established for the purpose of supporting or opposing state or local ballot measures.reg,subd.b.the conflict is manifest.
regulation also conflicts with the portion of section,subdivision c that provides that section applies to contributions to committees.section states,in relevant part a any person who makes a payment or a promise of payment totaling fifty thousand dollars or more for a communication that clearly identifies a candidate for elective state office,but does not expressly advocate the election or defeat of the candidate,and that is disseminated,broadcast,or otherwise published within days of an election,shall file online or electronically with the secretary of state a report disclosing the name of the person,address,occupation,and employer,and amount of the payment c any payment received by a person who makes a communication described in subdivision a is subject to the limits specified in subdivision b of section if the communication is made at the behest of the clearly identified candidate.
section,subdivision b provides a person may not make to any political party committee,and a political party committee may not accept,any contribution totaling more than thousand dollars per calendar year for the purpose of making contributions for the support or defeat of candidates for elective state office.notwithstanding section,this limit applies to contributions made to a political party used for the purpose of making expenditures at the behest of a candidate for elective state office for communications to party members related to the candidate candidacy for elective state office.
this means that if a ballot measure committee makes a communication referred to in section and the communication is made at the behest of a candidate,the contribution limit referred to in section,subdivision b applies to the committee.but regulation limits ballot measure committees to significantly less than the contribution permitted by sections and because the regulation incorporates the contribution limits of sections and,n otwithstanding government code sections sic,subdivision c reg,subd.b.the fppc proffers no authority that permits it to decrease contribution limits below those statutorily dictated by the pra.
the fppc contends there is no conflict between regulation and section because,in its view,contributions to ballot measure committees are presumed to be contributions to candidates for elective state office.however,this presumption is contrary to the language of the regulation,which recognizes that such committees are formed for the purpose of supporting or opposing state or local ballot measures,which means that contributions to the committee are contributions to oppose or support the ballot measure in question,not the controlling candidate.
furthermore,treating contributions to a ballot measure committee as contributions to a candidate for elective office conflicts with the one bank account rule set forth in section,which provides,in relevant part a upon the filing of the statement of intention to be a candidate for an elective state office pursuant to section,the individual shall establish one campaign contribution account at an office of a financial institution located in the state.c all contributions or loans made to the candidate,to a person on behalf of the candidate,or to the candidate controlled committee shall be deposited in the account.d any personal funds which will be utilized to promote the election of the candidate shall be deposited in the account prior to expenditure.e all campaign expenditures shall be made from the account.italics added.
thus,if contributions to ballot measure committees are treated as contributions to candidates for elective state office,then these contributions must be deposited in the candidate campaign account pursuant to section.but the fppc maintains that section does not require that contributions to ballot measure committees be deposited in the election account of the candidate.it does not believe this undermines its position,however,arguing ballot measure committees have always had their own bank accounts,regardless of whether the committee is controlled by a candidate.of course,this overlooks that previously these committees were not subject to sections and and were not treated as extensions of the candidate.
although a candidate may maintain separate campaign contribution accounts for the primary and general elections or for each office for which a statement of intention is filed,tit,subd.a we could find nothing in the pra regarding noncampaign committees indicating that where the money funding these committees is subject to the limitations in sections and,it need not be deposited first in the candidate election account before being disbursed to fund the candidate noncampaign committees.
the fppc is attempting to limit contributions to ballot measure committees to the amount allowed for election campaign contributions without subjecting these contributions to the other
