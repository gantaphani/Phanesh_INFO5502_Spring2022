the census showed an enormous increase in texas population,with over four million new residents.that growth required the state to redraw its electoral districts for the united states congress,the state senate,and the state house of representatives,in order to comply with the constitution,rule.see georgia ashcroft.the state also had to create new districts for the four additional congressional seats it received.
texas is a covered jurisdiction under section of the voting rights act of.see stat,a cfr pt,app.section suspends all changes to a covered jurisdiction election procedures,including district lines,until those changes are submitted to and approved by a united states district court for the district of columbia,or the attorney general.see northwest austin municipal util.dist.no.one holder.this process,known as preclearance,requires the covered jurisdiction to demonstrate that its proposed change neither has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.a.this court has been emphatic that a new electoral map can not be used to conduct an election until it has been precleared.see,clark roemer.
the day after completing its new electoral plans,texas submitted them to the united states district court for the district of columbia for preclearance.the preclearance process remains ongoing.texas was unsuccessful in its bid for summary judgment,and a trial is scheduled in the coming weeks.meanwhile,various plaintiffs appellees here brought suit in texas,claiming that the state newly enacted plans violate the united states constitution and of the voting rights act appellees alleged,inter alia,that texas enacted plans discriminate against latinos and and dilute their voting strength,notwithstanding the fact that latinos and accounted for of texas population growth since.a panel of the united states district court for the western district of texas was convened.see.that court heard argument and held a trial with respect to the plaintiffs claims,but withheld judgment pending resolution of the preclearance process in the court.branch smith,kennedy,concurring.
as texas primaries approached,it became increasingly likely that the state newly enacted plans would not receive preclearance in time for the elections.and the state old district lines could not be used,because population growth had rendered them inconsistent with the constitution,requirement.it thus fell to the district court in texas to devise interim plans for the state primaries and elections.see connor finch.after receiving proposals from the parties and holding extensive hearings,that court issued its interim plans.the court unanimously agreed on an interim state senate plan,but judge smith dissented with respect to the congressional and state house plans.texas asked this court to stay the interim plans pending an appeal,arguing that they were unnecessarily inconsistent with the state enacted plans.this court granted the stay and noted probable jurisdiction.
redistricting is primarily the duty and responsibility of the state.chapman meier.the failure of a state newly enacted plan to gain preclearance prior to an upcoming election does not,by itself,require a court to take up the state legislature task.that is because,in most circumstances,the state last enacted plan simply remains in effect until the new plan receives preclearance.but if an intervening event most commonly,as here,a census renders the current plan unusable,a court must undertake the unwelcome obligation of creating an interim plan.connor,supra,at.even then,the plan already in effect may give sufficient structure to the court endeavor.where shifts in a state population have been relatively small,a court may need to make only minor or obvious adjustments to the state existing districts in order to devise an interim plan.
but here the scale of texas population growth appears to require sweeping changes to the state current districts.in areas where population shifts are so large that no semblance of the existing plan district lines can be used,that plan offers little guidance to a court drawing an interim map.the problem is perhaps most obvious in adding new congressional districts the old plan gives no suggestion as to where those new districts should be placed.in addition,experience has shown the difficulty of defining neutral legal principles in this area,for redistricting ordinarily involves criteria and standards that have been weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the exercise of their political judgment.see,miller johnson,white weiser.thus,if the old state districts were the only source to which a district court could look,it would be forced to make the sort of policy judgments for which courts are,at best,ill suited.
to avoid being compelled to make such otherwise standardless decisions,a district court should take guidance from the state recently enacted plan in drafting an interim plan.that plan reflects the state policy judgments on where to place new districts and how to shift existing ones in response to massive population growth.this court has observed before that faced with the necessity of drawing district lines by judicial order,a court,as a general rule,should be guided by the legislative policies underlying a state plan even one that was itself unenforceable to the extent those policies do not lead to violations of the constitution or the voting rights act.abrams johnson,holding that the district court properly declined to defer to a precleared plan that used race as a predominant factor.for example,in white,supra,an equal population challenge,this court reversed a district court choice of interim plan,and required the district court to choose a plan more closely resembling an enacted state plan,even though the state plan itself had been held to violate the,principle.similarly,in upham seamon,although the state plan as a whole had been denied preclearance,this court directed a district court to defer to the legislative judgments the state plans reflect,insofar as they involved districts found to meet the preclearance standard,per curiam.see also whitcomb chavis,equal protection challenge.
section prevents a state plan from being implemented if it has not been precleared.but that does not mean that the plan is of no account or that the policy judgments it reflects can be disregarded by a district court drawing an interim plan.on the contrary,the state plan serves as a starting point for the district court.it provides important guidance that helps ensure that the district court appropriately confines itself to drawing interim maps that comply with the constitution and the voting rights act,without displacing legitimate state policy judgments with the court own preferences.
a district court making such use of a state plan must,of course,take care not to incorporate into the interim plan any legal defects in the state plan.see abrams,supra,at white,supra,at.where a state plan faces challenges under the constitution or of the voting rights act,a district court should still be guided by that plan,except to the extent those legal challenges are shown to have a likelihood of success on the merits.plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction of a statute must normally demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to that law.see winter natural resources defense council.there is no reason that plaintiffs seeking to defeat the policies behind a state redistricting legislation should not also have to meet that standard.and because the local district court here,the district court for the western district of texas will ultimately decide the merits of claims under and the constitution,it is well equipped to apply that familiar standard.
the calculus with respect to challenges is somewhat different.where a state has sought preclearance in the district court for the district of columbia,allows only that court to determine whether the state plan complies with.consistent with that design,we have made clear that other district courts may not address the merits of challenges.see,perkins matthews.the local district co
