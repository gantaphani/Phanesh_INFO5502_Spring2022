defendant and appellant town of apple valley town and real party in interest and appellant stores,walmart appeal the grant of the motion for summary judgment adjudication motion in favor of plaintiff and respondent gabriel hernandez.this case involves a measure passed by the town electorate on november,in a special election initiative that amended the general plan to allow for a commercial development,which would include a walmart supercenter.walmart provided a gift to town to pay for the election and town accepted the payment by adopting a memorandum of understanding mou at a regular council meeting held on august.
hernandez filed a first amended complaint against town and walmart alleging violations of the ralph brown act,government code section et brown act for actions taken at the town council meeting on august,and that the initiative violated the california constitution,article ii,section article ii,section.specifically,hernandez argued the agenda for the town council meeting failed to provide the proper notice of the actions to be taken at the meeting,that the town council would vote to send the initiative to the voters and approving the mou that accepted the gift from walmart to pay for the special election.further,hernandez alleged that although walmart was not specifically named in the initiative,it was clear from the other ballot materials that walmart was identified within the meaning of article ii,section rendering the initiative unconstitutional.the trial court granted the motion finding the mou and initiative were void and invalid.the trial court awarded hernandez in costs and in attorney fees.
town and walmart raise the following issues on appeal 
the motion failed to demonstrate that town violated the brown act.
the motion failed to demonstrate that the initiative violated article ii,section.
the trial court improperly awarded hernandez his costs because his memorandum of costs was filed late and included items that were not recoverable.
the trial court should have denied or reduced hernandez request for attorney fees because he failed to meet his burden of establishing local market rates for attorneys in san bernardino county.
the motion was properly granted on the violation of the brown act,which invalidates the special election on the initiative.since it is likely that the matter will again be placed on the ballot or voted on by the town council,we also find that the initiative as written did not violate article ii,section.the award of costs is reversed as the memorandum of costs was filed late without a showing by counsel that such late filing was due to mistake of law,inadvertence,or surprise.the attorney fee award is affirmed.
factual and procedural history 
statement of facts 
the following facts are taken from the undisputed material facts agreed to by hernandez,and town and walmart and the additional disputed facts presented by hernandez,and by town and walmart.
hernandez was a resident of apple valley and was a registered voter.town was a local agency and legislative body within the meaning of government code sections and.walmart was a private corporation.item on the town council meeting agenda to be held on august,read initiative measure and the recommendation for action was provide direction to staff.hernandez alleged there was no further information on the agenda regarding this matter.
the town adopted three resolutions at the meeting resolution was to call a special election on the initiative to be held on november,and the initiative would be titled dale evans parkways commercial specific plan the specific plan resolution provided for filing rebuttal arguments for and against the initiative and resolution for filing rebuttal arguments for and against the initiative.town also adopted the mou that authorized accepting a gift from walmart to pay for the special election.these resolutions and the specific plan were not on the agenda.the agenda did not provide a description of the walmart initiative measure and the resolutions adopted did not mention the walmart initiative measure in their text.
in there was an initiative measure circulated that the town council referred to as the initiative measure.the matter appeared on the agendas for meetings in march,april and october as the supercenter ballot initiative.when hernandez viewed the agenda for the august meeting,he understood that it was to discuss the action to be taken on the ballot initiative,which had been declared null and void.further,hernandez believed the only action to be taken at the meeting was to give staff direction as to what to do next.if he had known about the actions to be taken at the meeting,he would have attended the meeting and submitted comments.
hernandez was concerned that walmart paid to circumvent the normal administrative vetting process by paying for the special election.he would have requested a report be prepared before the town adopted the resolutions and called the special election so that the council and voters would be better informed.
on september,hernandez sent a request,pursuant to the brown act,to town to cure the brown act violation.on october,town declined to cure the alleged violations of the brown act.
the ballot materials with the initiative included language that voting yes on measure d will approve an upgraded new walmart store and other businesses at the corner of dale evans parkway and thunderbird road.the ballot argument in favor of the initiative included language that walmart proposed a new,upgraded store offering more affordable,fresh groceries and expanded retail choices for apple valley hardworking families.prior to the vote,several articles appeared in the victor valley daily press that the initiative was to bring a walmart to apple valley.
walmart donated to apple valley consumers for choice.they were a proponent of the initiative.the initiative referred to the fee title holder.walmart was the fee title holder.the initiative also included language that the owner of the parcel would contact the fire district to verify current fire protection requirements.also the owner developer was responsible for all new fire hydrants.the initiative measure defined developer as any individual or other entity proposing any development within the specific plan area.the initiative used language such as developer is responsible for,developer is responsible to ensure,developer shall,developer will be required to,and developer must.developer was responsible for any fees associated with environmental standards,permit applications,utilities,landscaping or any other unforeseen reasons.
the initiative and the ballot materials stated that the general plan would be amended to add to the town of apple valley development code the enactment of the specific plan in order to allow a proposed commercial development of approximately acres near the happy trails highway at the intersection of dale evans parkway and thunderbird road.
hernandez believed the initiative for the specific plan was for the benefit of walmart.he read in the victor valley daily press that walmart asked town for the ballot measure.he read the ballot argument in favor of the initiative that stated a yes vote would approve a new upgraded walmart store at the corner of dale evans parkway and thunderbird road.he believed the specific plan was for the benefit of walmart so it could build its new store.
town and walmart disputed many of the above facts and insisted an agenda packet was available with the agenda,which included information as to the options the town council had to pursue development,the text of resolutions that were adopted,a summary of the initiative and the possibility of calling a special election.the specific plan was in the agenda packet that was part of the agenda.further,the walmart initiative measure was fully described in the agenda packet.
walmart and town contended that all of the information regarding the actions to be taken at the august meeting were in the agenda packet that was available online and in the clerk office.they also disputed that hernandez looked at the agenda prior to the meeting and that he would have attended the meeting.town and walmart noted that several other citizens were at the meeting and objected to the resolutions and other action taken by the town council.
town and walmart objected to the ballot materials being relevant.they also disputed that apple valley consumers for choice was a major proponent of the initiative.
town and walmart submitted additional facts.on may,dennis patrick orr filed a notice of intent to circulate the initiative to amend the town general plan in order to establish the specific plan.the initiative would provide for a retail development,which would have multiple retailers.it received enough signatures to be considered by the town council.
the agenda for the town council meeting was posted on the town web site,at the town library and the town clerk office with the agenda packet being available.the agenda packet included information that the town council could act at the meeting by submitting the initiative to the voters in a special election.the special election would be held on its own and conducted by town.at the meeting on august,comment cards were received from the members of the public who were present to comment on agenda item.of those cards,objected to the initiative.further,eight of them requested further review of the initiative.four persons spoke at the meeting objecting to agenda item.
the terms owner and fee title holder were not defined in the initiative.
procedural background 
on october,hernandez filed his first complaint for declaratory relief and injunctive relief and petition for writ of mandate against town only.he alleged one cause of action of a violation of the brown act for the actions taken by the town council without the items appearing on the agenda.he attached the letter he sent to the town on september,requesting that the town cure the violation within the directives of government code section.
town filed a demurrer.town noted defects in the complaint,hernandez failed to allege he was a california citizen to show standing and the statutory basis for a writ of mandate.the trial court granted the demurrer on january,and gave hernandez leave to amend.
first amended complaint 
hernandez filed his first amended complaint fac on february,against town and walmart.he alleged he resided in town and was a registered voter.he alleged a brown act violation in his first cause of action.he maintained that agenda item for the town council meeting read initiative measure and provide information to staff.no other information appeared on the agenda.hernandez alleged that none of the actions taken appeared on the agenda,including the three resolutions and the mou.hernandez alleged that all of the actions taken were not regarding the walmart initiative but rather on what would be the specific plan.
hernandez noted that government code section,subdivision a,requires posting of an agenda hours before a city council meeting with a brief description of each item of business to be discussed at the meeting,not to exceed words.the city council could only discuss and take action on those items on the agenda.since the specific plan,or the new initiative,did not appear on the agenda,no action could be taken.hernandez insisted he was harmed because he was denied the benefits and protections provided by compliance with government code section.he would have attended the meeting or submitted comments if he knew the initiative was going to be discussed.
in his second cause of action,he alleged a violation of article ii,section.according to that section,no amendment to the constitution,and no statute proposed by the electors by the legislature or by initiative,that names any individual to hold any office,or names or identifies any private corporation to perform any function or to have any power or duty,may be submitted to the electors or have any effect.hernandez conceded the initiative did not name walmart,but it was clear to the electorate that the beneficiary of the initiative was walmart.
hernandez sought an injunction on any development because the violation of the brown act rendered the actions taken by the town council null and void.moreover,the initiative should be declared unconstitutional.
town and walmart brought motions to strike the second cause of action and joined in each other motions.town also filed a demurrer to the fac.town sought judicial notice of the initiative,the voter information guide and sample ballot for the november,special election.walmart also filed a demurrer.hernandez opposed the motions to strike and demurrers.
on june,the trial court overruled the demurrers and denied the motions to strike.in a written order,the trial court found hernandez was a registered voter in town.it stated the initiative was known as measure d.it was known colloquially as the initiative measure.if upheld,it would allow for the development of a walmart supercenter on property owned by walmart.the trial court found a violation of article ii,section.it found,while is not named in the measure,it is nevertheless identified,because the measure confers special privileges on the owner of the property,which is.the initiative referenced the developer and owner.while the trial court noted that reference to developer did not necessarily mean walmart,owner was clearly walmart.town and walmart filed answers to the fac raising affirmative defenses.
motion for summary filed by hernandez 
hernandez filed his motion on november.hernandez stated there were no disputed material facts as to both of his causes of action.
hernandez alleged that town violated california open meeting law,the brown act,by failing to properly list in the agenda for the town council meeting the actions to be taken at the august,meeting.hernandez explained that there previously had been a walmart initiative proposed but had been dismissed by another trial court because it named walmart.when hernandez got the agenda for the august,meeting,he believed it was merely to advise staff what to do on the prior initiative.however,the town adopted the three new resolutions,including approving a special election on the specific plan.hernandez had no notice of the specific plan or that there would be action taken to set up a special election.had he been aware of the initiative,he would have attended the meeting or submitted comments.he was concerned about walmart circumventing the normal process by paying for the special election.
as for the violation of the article ii,section,hernandez admitted the initiative did not use the name walmart but rather identifies walmart.the terms site owner and developer clearly referred to walmart.walmart clearly was the beneficiary because it had spent over to get the initiative passed.there was not a possibility of severing parts of the initiative to save it.moreover,the ballot materials referenced walmart.
hernandez submitted a declaration that he was a resident of apple valley and saw the agenda prior to the meeting.he was not sure if the reference to the walmart initiative was to the first initiative or some other initiative.regardless,he did not anticipate that any action was going to be taken at the meeting.had he known,he would have attended the meeting and submitted comments.he would have asked for an additional report.there was no doubt in his mind that the initiative benefitted walmart.
hernandez attached numerous exhibits to the motion,including an article in the daily press about the development that named walmart a contribution by walmart in the amount of to apple valley consumers for choice the ballot argument in favor of the initiative that named walmart the meeting agenda that included item,which only stated initiative measure and advise staff the meeting minutes that outlined the resolutions that were passed and that comments were submitted agenda item the text of the initiative and the resolutions mentioned at the meeting the original walmart initiative from the meeting minutes from the original initiative,which was ordinance town response to request to cure,which included that the agenda packet be available to all persons at the town clerk office or online which included the initiative and the resolutions,and there were other people there to talk about the initiative,and that it simply chose to put the initiative on the ballot an article from the san bernardino county sentinel about the initiative and naming walmart documents showing walmart was the owner of the property a draft report for the shopping center that showed the eventual plan would have five retail spaces,one of which would be occupied by walmart.
town and walmart joint opposition to the motion 
on january,town and walmart filed their opposition to the motion opposition.both contended the agenda fully complied with the mandates of the brown act and that the initiative neither named nor identified walmart in violation of article ii,section.they alleged that the agenda gave more information than required by the brown act.further,hernandez had not shown prejudice as several other persons who were present at the august,meeting opposed the resolutions and special election,and requested further review.
town and walmart alleged the agenda for the meeting was posted on the town web site,clerk office and library.the agenda packet prepared for the meeting included a summary of the initiative,the procedure that would be followed for a special election,and the resolutions that would be passed.a hyperlink on the web site directed a person to the packet.at the meeting,comment cards were received in regards to agenda item.eight of the cards asked for further review of the matter.four persons spoke in opposition at the meeting.
there was no brown act violation when there was substantial compliance.further,substantial compliance is a factual question.town did nothing to thwart the objective of the brown act.hernandez had to show meaningful prejudice to void a public agency action.there was substantial participation in the meeting in opposition to agenda item.
the initiative did not violate article ii,section.town and walmart agreed that some town residents and others knew the commercial development included a walmart store.however,this was not the question for summary judgment rather,the question was whether walmart was named in the four corners of the initiative,which it was not.
town and walmart argued that the initiative should be approved unless there was a clear and unmistakable constitutional violation.they argued the identification of walmart in extraneous materials was not a violation of the california constitution as a matter of law.further,even though the initiative used the term developer,it was not just walmart it applied to anyone who was going to put in a store in the development.further,the fact that outside articles discussed walmart,or the fact that walmart helped fund the initiative,did not establish a constitutional violation.many persons in addition to walmart would benefit,including the public and other stores who developed in the area.
finally,if the trial court were to find that certain provisions of the initiative were invalid,it could sever those offending provisions while leaving most of the initiative intact.
the town clerk submitted a declaration that she posted the agenda for the august,meeting on august.on the town web site,a hyperlink directed the person to the agenda packet that was also available at the town library and clerk office.the agenda packet included a summary of the initiative,description of the procedure to conduct a special election,and the three resolutions.
the agenda packet or staff report for the meeting was included as an exhibit to the motion.it was lengthy,but labeled with the agenda item.agenda item included a summary of how the initiative had been submitted to the town council in the appropriate manner.it gave three options for proceeding,which included adopting the initiative,submitting the initiative to voters at a special election,or conducting more review.the three resolutions were included.the report for agenda item was pages.
the comment cards were included as an exhibit.several of those comment cards included requests that the town council send agenda item for further review.
the minutes from the meeting were included.at the meeting,the town manager advised the town council that there was an option to accept an offer from walmart gifting sufficient funds to cover the expense of the election.the town manager sought to have town council authorize,if it chose a special election,a mou,so that the money could be accepted.the offer to pay for the election was made by walmart on august,which was after the agenda was posted.the motion to approve the mou was passed by the town council.
hernandez reply to the opposition 
hernandez filed his reply to the opposition on january.hernandez again argued that despite the dale evan specific plan being adopted at the meeting,the agenda called it the walmart initiative measure.further,he was not required to review the agenda packet to find the information regarding agenda item hidden in over pages of materials.hernandez suffered prejudice because there was no evidence that other persons raised the issues he wanted to raise at the meeting.for example,he had serious concerns about walmart making a mockery of the normal administrative process by trying to pay money to circumvent the process.further,based on extrinsic evidence,such as press releases and the initiative in,it was clear the initiative referred to the walmart development and that walmart was the beneficiary.walmart,as the owner of the property,was given special duties and powers.
the matter was heard on january.the trial court stated its tentative ruling was to grant the motion.the trial court noted first that just stating walmart initiative on the agenda could have been confusing because of the prior initiative.further,the agenda did not have the resolutions listed and the actions to be taken.even though there was an agenda packet,it was long and difficult for a member of the public to interpret.the other problem was the mou was not mentioned in either the agenda or the agenda packet.the trial court then noted that as to the resolutions,since other members of the public commented on them,prejudice had not been shown.however,there were no comments on the mou and it was not surprising because it did not appear in the agenda or agenda packet.the trial court believed that hernandez had shown prejudice as to the mou.therefore,the trial court would summarily adjudicate the brown act violations in hernandez favor.
the trial court then found that the initiative did not name walmart.the trial court noted the initiative referred to the owner of the property,which was walmart.the court noted,now,of course,could sell the property to someone,but that a matter that is exclusively within ability.based on the newspaper articles,everyone in the community knew that the initiative would bring a walmart to the development.the trial court concluded,everybody knows who is and knows what going on with these properties.
town argued that the motion could not be granted because there were disputed facts.town argued the brown act did not require that every single tiny little piece of the project be included.the trial court interrupted and stated it was important because walmart was offering to pay for the special election.town complained none of hernandez documents specifically raised an issue as to the mou.town argued that it was suspect hernandez read the agenda,and claims now to be interested in the project,but did not attend the meeting.
hernandez responded he had alleged that he was concerned that walmart was paying to circumvent the normal administrative process.the public should have had an opportunity to address how it felt about walmart paying for the special election as it affected the democratic process.further,there was nothing in the record of the meeting that someone had objected to walmart paying for the election.
town and walmart also argued there was no violation of article ii,section.walmart was not named in the initiative.it was also clear the public was aware the development would include a walmart.article ii,section did not prohibit the public from knowing the beneficiary of an initiative.the court was required to give substantial deference to the will of the electorate.town and walmart argued that the initiative identified different roles,such as developer and owner,but never specifically identified walmart.to prohibit such action in an initiative,as the owner and developer could always be identified,would overrule almost every law.further,the role here identified in this initiative does not identify a specific entity that is not capable of being changed.further,the initiative did not require that walmart be the developer or owner.
hernandez argued that walmart,as the owner of the property,had a special privilege bestowed upon it by the initiative.walmart had a monopoly on what occurred on the property.the trial court took the matter under submission.
hernandez motion for summary judgment was granted by written order.according to the written order,town approval of the mou at the august,meeting was declared invalid,void,and unenforceable.a peremptory writ of mandate was issued to command town to set aside the approval of the mou further,the initiative was declared to be invalid,void,and unenforceable under the california constitution.it was ordered that hernandez would receive attorney fees and costs,jointly and severally,from town and walmart at a later date to be determined.notice of entry of judgment was filed on march.discussion of the costs and attorney fees awarded will be discussed in detail,post.

brown act violation 
the trial court granted the motion finding that the agenda posted by town for the august,council meeting did not properly include notice that it was considering approving the mou accepting a gift from walmart to pay for the special election.further,it found that hernandez was prejudiced by the lack of notice as no other community member discussed the fact that walmart was paying for the special election at the town council meeting.town and walmart concede the mou was not in the agenda or agenda packet.nonetheless,they argue town substantially complied with the brown act.further,hernandez failed to show prejudice in the motion.
the brown act,also known as the california open meeting law,is designed to encourage public participation in government decision making.bell vista unified school dist.th.t he keystone of the brown act is the requirement that a ll meetings of the legislative body of a local agency shall be open and public.roberts city of palmdale cal th.the brown act begins with a forceful declaration of the legislature purpose in enacting this chapter,the legislature finds and declares that the public commissions,boards and councils and the other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people business.it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.the people,in delegating authority,do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.the people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.san joaquin raptor rescue center county of merced th,san joaquin.
at least hours before a regular meeting,the legislative body of the local agency,or its designee,shall post an agenda containing a brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at the meeting,including items to be discussed in closed session.a brief general description of an item generally need not exceed words.no action or discussion shall be undertaken on any item not appearing on the posted agenda,except exceptions that are inapplicable here.moreno city of king th.
government code section provides d an action taken that is alleged to have been taken in violation of section,or shall not be determined to be null and void if any of the following conditions exist the action taken was in substantial compliance with sections,and.
here,town and walmart argued below that the posted agenda included an attached agenda packet however,hernandez maintained that he should be able to identify from the posted agenda alone the items to be discussed at the meeting.we need not resolve whether the brown act allows for the submission of an agenda packet with the agenda in order to conform with the brown act,as here,while it is true the agenda and agenda packet included the resolutions to be adopted and the initiative language,it did not include any information regarding the mou,which was adopted by town.the mou allowed the town to accept a gift from walmart in order to pay for the special election and is the only claim found by the trial court to have prejudiced hernandez.no one at the meeting discussed the matter or commented on the mou.in fact,it was first proposed at the meeting as walmart offered the gift to the town the day after the agenda was posted.this is troublesome as it is conceivable this was a major factor in the decision to send the matter to the electorate.
in san joaquin,supra,th,the merced county planning commission posted an agenda that set forth one item of business for its upcoming meeting,which was the potential approval of a subdivision application to divide acres into nine parcels.the agenda,however,failed to mention that the commission would also be considering whether or not to adopt a ceqa document known as a mitigated negative declaration mnd concerning the environmental impact of the project.id.at,fn.omitted.at the meeting,the commission approved the project and adopted the mnd.ibid.the appellate court found there was a violation of the brown act.first,it emphasized the language in government code section that each item of business must be on the agenda.san joaquin,at.it also noted that the mnd was plainly a distinct item of business,and not a mere component of project approval,since it involved a separate action or determination by the commission and concerned discrete,significant issues of ceqa compliance and the project environmental impact.id.at,fns.omitted.
in this case,agenda item only listed that the walmart initiative measure and the direction to be given to staff would be discussed at the meeting.in the agenda packet,town included a summary of the resolutions that it passed and the initiative.in none of the documents was the item of business that town council was going to accept a gift from walmart in order to pay for a special election to pass the initiative.hernandez was given no notice that this important item of business was going to be voted on at the town council meeting.
here,town action of putting the initiative on the ballot was properly found null and void by the trial court as the town council decision to put the initiative on the ballot was done so in violation of the brown act.we do not end our review here.it is clear that this matter will again be considered by the town council and another initiative will be possibly adopted at a later date after appropriate public comment.we therefore address whether the initiative as written violated article ii,section.
constitutional violation 
the trial court also concluded that the initiative violated article ii,section and declared the initiative null and void.walmart and town contend that the initiative did not name walmart in the four corners of the initiative.they insist the trial court erred by looking outside the initiative to the ballot materials to identify walmart as the beneficiary of the initiative.we conclude that the initiative as written does not violate article ii,section.
as previously stated,article ii,section provides that no amendment to the constitution,and no statute proposed to the electors by the legislature or by initiative,that names any individual or any office,or names or identifies any private corporation to perform any function or to have any power or duty,may be submitted to the electors or have any effect.the legislature chosen language is the most reliable indicator of its intent because it is the language of the statute itself that has successfully braved the legislative gauntlet.citations.we give the words of the statute a plain and commonsense meaning unless the statute specifically defines the words to give them a special meaning.citations.if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,our task is at an end,for there is no need for judicial construction.macisaac waste management collection recycling,th.
the parties do not dispute that the initiative did not specifically name walmart.however,the trial court accepted hernandez argument that everyone knew that walmart would benefit from the initiative.further,the trial court found the initiative granted powers to the owner and developer of the property,who was clearly walmart,as evidenced by the ballot materials.
the initiative provided,as used herein,the term developer shall mean any individual or other entity proposing any development within the specific plan area.the initiative provided that the developer would pay for the costs of any code enforcement and attorney fees for any action taken concerning the approval of the specific plan.the initiative was being proposed so that a commercial development with a combination of retail and service establishments would be added to the town.the initiative also provided for strict rules as to the development of the area and specific rules for parking,signage,and landscaping.there was reference to the fact that before any construction could occur on the parcel,the owner was to contact the local fire department to ensure compliance with any relevant fire protection requirement.the developer was to obtain water for the property.the developer was also responsible for the drainage systems.the diagrams submitted with the initiative referred to major tenant.however,the initiative never named walmart,and it was the sole corporation entitled to develop or own the property.
only a few cases have addressed article ii,section.pala band of mission indians board of supervisors th pala,involved the following in,san diego county voters approved proposition c,an initiative entitled the gregory canyon landfill and recycling collection center ordinance.proposition c amended the san diego county general plan general plan and the san diego county zoning ordinance zoning ordinance to designate an area known as gregory canyon for use as a privately owned solid waste facility.the initiative conditioned the development of the facility on approval from various state and federal agencies.the initiative placed the responsibility for obtaining the state and federal permits on the applicant,defined as servcon san marcos,or its assignee or authorized representatives.id.at.
the pala court first noted that our review of this appeal is strictly circumscribed by the rule of according extraordinarily broad deference to the electorate power to enact laws by initiative.the state constitutional right of initiative or referendum is one of the most precious rights of our democratic process.pala,supra,th at,citing to mervynne acker d.
in assessing whether the initiative violated article ii,section,the appellate court noted that most of the initiative referred to construction of the waste facility and the necessary permits.the facility would be based on a detailed plan submitted by the applicant.the pala court concluded,thus,the proposition provides the applicant defined as servcon with the sole responsibility of preparing and submitting the site plan that will ultimately define the precise nature of the project created by the proposition.this imposes functions,powers,and duties on servcon within the meaning of article ii,section.pala,supra,th at.
the court found that the initiative granted powers to servcon that it did not have prior to the voters approving the initiative.the court emphasized that although servcon as the owner of the property had rights prior to the proposition to develop the property,it had new rights after the proposition.the court noted,in practical terms,it means that the current owner of the property is now bound by local law to follow through with that contract and,should a third party attempt to claim a superior right,servcon would have the ability to rely on the terms of proposition c to establish its exclusive right.pala,supra,th at,fn.omitted.
the pala court then discussed whether severing the definition of the applicant as servcon would change the proposition.it noted that servcon was not mentioned in the ballot materials.it found the definition severable,because the proposition specifically imposes functions,powers,and duties on the applicant,not servcon.pala,supra,th at.it would leave the proposed operator of the facility or the operator of the facility would have the powers and duties.ibid.the pala court noted in a footnote,we note that in practical terms,our conclusion will not necessarily change the fact that servcon will be responsible for performing the functions of the applicant.this result derives from the fact that a private property owner ultimately has the right to select the entity that may apply to operate,and operate,a business on its property.ibid.fn.
here,the initiative uses words including developer and owner.the initiative does not name or identify walmart.as a practical matter,as in pala,walmart as the owner and developer of the property would be responsible for the acts under the initiative.however,since walmart could sell the property,it would have no superior right over the subsequent owner or developer of the property.just as in pala,just striking the definition of applicant did not change that it would be the entity responsible.walmart as an entity has no superior right under the initiative.if it sold the property,or decided that it did not want to develop the property,it would have no rights under the initiative superior to any other corporation or person.
the only other significant case addressing article ii,section is calfarm ins.deukmejian cal d calfarm,a challenge to proposition.proposition was an initiative measure adopted by the voters on november,making numerous fundamental changes in the regulation of automobile and other types of insurance.id.at.it was enacted to ensure that insurance is fair,available,and affordable for all californians.id.at.some of the changes included reducing current rates and putting restrictions on raising rates.ibid.one of the provisions stated,insurers are required to mail notices to policy holders informing them they may join a nonprofit corporation to be formed to represent their interests by persons appointed for this purpose by the insurance commissioner.on appeal,the petitioners maintained that the provision requiring notification of the formation of a nonprofit corporation violated the prohibition of article ii,section of the california constitution against naming or identifying a private corporation in an initiative to perform any function or duty.id.at.
