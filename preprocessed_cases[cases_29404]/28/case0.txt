in alabama redrew the boundaries of the state house districts and senate districts.in doing so,while alabama sought to achieve numerous traditional districting objectives,compactness,not splitting counties or precincts,minimizing change,and protecting incumbents it placed yet greater importance on two goals minimizing a district deviation from precisely equal population,by keeping any deviation less than of the theoretical ideal and seeking to avoid retrogression with respect to racial minorities ability to elect their preferred candidates of choice under of the voting rights act of,b,by maintaining roughly the same black population percentage in existing districts.
appellants alabama legislative black caucus caucus,alabama democratic conference conference,and others claim that alabama new district boundaries create a racial gerrymander in violation of the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause.after a bench trial,the district court ruled to for the state.it recognized that electoral districting violates the equal protection clause when race is the predominant consideration in deciding to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district,miller johnson,and the use of race is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest,shaw hunt,shaw ii.
in ruling against appellants,it made four critical determinations that both appellants had argued that the acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders,and that the conference had also argued that the state had racially gerrymandered senate districts,and that the conference lacked standing to make its racial gerrymandering claims that,in any event,appellants claims must fail because race was not the predominant motivating factor in making the redistricting decisions and that,even were it wrong about standing and predominance,these claims must fail because any predominant use of race was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest in avoiding retrogression under.
the district court analysis of the racial gerrymandering claim as referring to the state as a whole,rather than,was legally erroneous.
a this court has consistently described a claim of racial gerrymandering as a claim that race was improperly used in the drawing of the boundaries of one or more specific electoral districts,see,shaw reno,shaw i,and has described the plaintiff evidentiary burden similarly,see miller,supra,at.the court language makes sense in light of the personal nature of the harms that underlie a racial gerrymandering claim,see bush vera,shaw i,supra,at.
b the district court found the fact that racial criteria had not predominated in the drawing of some alabama districts sufficient to defeat a claim of racial gerrymandering with respect to the state as an undifferentiated whole.but a showing that criteria did not significantly affect the drawing of some alabama districts would have done little to defeat a claim that criteria predominantly affected the drawing of other alabama districts.thus,the district court undifferentiated statewide analysis is insufficient,and the district court must on remand consider racial gerrymandering with respect to the individual districts challenged by appellants.
c the caucus and the conference did not waive the right to further consideration of a analysis.the record indicates that plaintiffs evidence and arguments embody the claim that individual districts were racially gerrymandered,and those are the districts that the district court must reconsider.although plaintiffs relied heavily upon statewide evidence to prove that race predominated in the drawing of individual district lines,neither the use of statewide evidence nor the effort to show widespread effect can transform a racial gerrymandering claim about a set of individual districts into a separate,general claim that the legislature racially gerrymandered the state as an undifferentiated whole.
the district court also erred in deciding,sua sponte,that the conference lacked standing.it believed that the record did not clearly identify the districts in which the individual members of the conference reside.but the conference brief and the testimony of a conference representative support an inference that the organization has members in all of the districts,which is sufficient to meet the conference burden of establishing standing.at the very least,the conference reasonably believed that,in the absence of a state challenge or a court request for more detailed information,it need not provide additional information such as a specific membership list.while the district court had an independent obligation to confirm its jurisdiction,in these circumstances elementary principles of procedural fairness required the district court,rather than acting sua sponte,to give the conference an opportunity to provide evidence of member residence.on remand,the district court should permit the conference to file its membership list and the state to respond,as appropriate.
the district court also did not properly calculate predominance in its alternative holding that r ace was not the predominant motivating factor in the creation of any of the challenged districts.it reached its conclusion in part because it placed in the balance,among other nonracial factors,legislative efforts to create districts of approximately equal population.an equal population goal,however,is not one of the traditional factors to be weighed against the use of race to determine whether race predominates,see miller,supra,at.rather,it is part of the redistricting background,taken as a given,when determining whether race,or other factors,predominate in a legislator determination as to how equal population objectives will be met.had the district court not taken a contrary view of the law,its predominance conclusions,including those concerning the four districts that the conference specifically challenged,might well have been different.for example,there is strong,perhaps overwhelming,evidence that race did predominate as a factor when the legislature drew the boundaries of senate district.
the district court final alternative holding that the challenged districts would satisfy strict scrutiny rests upon a misperception of the law.section does not require a covered jurisdiction to maintain a particular numerical minority percentage.it requires the jurisdiction to maintain a minority ability to elect a preferred candidate of choice.
a the statute language,b,d,and department of justice guidelines make clear that is satisfied if minority voters retain the ability to elect their preferred candidates.the history of further supports this view,as congress adopted the language in to reject this court decision in georgia ashcroft,and to accept the views of justice souter dissent that,in a retrogression case,courts should ask whether a new voting provision would likely deprive minority voters of their ability to elect a candidate of their choice,and that courts should not mechanically rely upon numerical percentages but should take account of all significant circumstances,at.here,both the district court and the legislature relied heavily upon a mechanically numerical view as to what counts as forbidden retrogression.
b in saying this,this court does not insist that a state legislature,when redistricting,determine precisely what percent minority population demands.a court analysis of the narrow tailoring requirement insists only that the legislature have a strong basis in evidence in support of the choice that it has made.brief for united states as amicus curiae.here,however,the district court and the legislature both asked the wrong question with respect to narrow tailoring.they asked how to maintain the present minority percentages in districts,instead of asking the extent to which they must preserve existing minority percentages in order to maintain the minority present ability to elect the candidate of its choice.because asking the wrong question may well have led to the wrong answer,the court can not accept the district court conclusion.

on appeals from the united states district court for the middle district of alabama 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the alabama legislative black caucus and the alabama democratic conference appeal a federal district court decision rejecting their challenges to the lawfulness of alabama redistricting of its state house of representatives and state senate.the appeals focus upon the appellants claims that new district boundaries create racial gerrymanders in violation of the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause.see,shaw hunt,shaw ii fourteenth amendment forbids use of race as predominant district factor unless boundaries are narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest citations omitted.we find that the district court applied incorrect legal standards in evaluating the claims.we consequently vacate its decision and remand the cases for further proceedings.
the alabama constitution requires the legislature to reapportion its state house and senate electoral districts following each decennial census,art.ix.in alabama redrew the boundaries of the state house districts and senate districts.acts house plan,at senate plan acts.in doing so,alabama sought to achieve numerous traditional districting objectives,such as compactness,not splitting counties or precincts,minimizing change,and protecting incumbents.but it placed yet greater importance on achieving two other goals.see alabama legislature reapportionment committee guidelines in,doc,committee guidelines.
first,it sought to minimize the extent to which a district might deviate from the theoretical ideal of precisely equal population.in particular,it set as a goal creating a set of districts in which no district would deviate from the theoretical,precisely equal ideal by more than,a more rigorous deviation standard than our precedents have found necessary under the constitution.see brown thomson,deviation from ideal generally permissible.no one here doubts the desirability of a state efforts generally to come close to a,ideal.
second,it sought to ensure compliance with federal law,and,in particular,the voting rights act of.stat,as amended,et.at the time of the redistricting alabama was a covered jurisdiction under that act.accordingly of the act required alabama to demonstrate that an electoral change,such as redistricting,would not bring about retrogression in respect to racial minorities ability to elect their preferred candidates of choice.b.specifically,alabama believed that,to avoid retrogression under,it was required to maintain roughly the same black population percentage in existing districts.see appendix b,infra.
compliance with these two goals posed particular difficulties with respect to many of the state districts in the senate,in the house.that is because many of these districts were compared with the average district underpopulated.in order for senate district,for example,to meet the state objective,the state would have to add about individuals to the district.and,prior to redistricting,of district population was black.accordingly,alabama plan added new individuals,and only of those newly added individuals were white.
this suit,as it appears before us,focuses in large part upon alabama efforts to achieve these two goals.the caucus and the conference basically claim that the state,in adding so many new minority voters to districts and to others,went too far.they allege the state created a constitutionally forbidden racial gerrymander a gerrymander that,when the state adds more minority voters than needed for a minority group to elect a candidate of its choice might,among other things,harm the very minority voters that acts such as the voting rights act sought to help.
after a bench trial,the federal district court held in favor of the state,against the caucus and the conference,with respect to their racial gerrymandering claims as well as with respect to several other legal claims that the caucus and the conference had made.with respect to racial gerrymandering,the district court recognized that electoral districting violates the equal protection clause when race is the dominant and controlling or predominant consideration in deciding to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district,miller johnson,and the use of race is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest,shaw ii,at see also shaw reno,shaw i constitution forbids separat ion of voters into different districts on the basis of race when the separation lacks sufficient justification bush vera,principal opinion of,same.but,after trial the district court held to that the caucus and the conference had failed to prove their racial gerrymandering claims.the caucus along with the conference and several other plaintiffs appealed.we noted probable jurisdiction with respect to the racial gerrymandering claims.
we shall focus upon four critical district court determinations underlying its ultimate no violation conclusion.they concern 
the geographical nature of the racial gerrymandering claims.the district court characterized the appellants claims as falling into two categories.in the district court view,both appellants had argued that the acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders,supp,md emphasis added,and one of the appellants the conference had also argued that the state had racially gerrymandered four specific electoral districts,senate districts,and,at.
standing.the district court held that the caucus had standing to argue its racial gerrymandering claim with respect to the state as a whole.but the conference lacked standing to make any of its racial gerrymandering claims the claim requiring consideration of the state as a whole,and the claims requiring consideration of four individual senate districts,at.
racial predominance.the district court held that,in any event,the appellants claims must fail because race was not the predominant motivating factor either a for the acts as a whole or b with respect to senate districts,or.at.
narrow state interest.the district court also held that,even were it wrong about standing and predominance,the appellants racial gerrymandering claims must fail.that is because any predominant use of race in the drawing of electoral boundaries was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest,at,namely the interest in avoiding retrogression with respect to racial minorities ability to elect their preferred candidates of choice.b.
in our view,each of these determinations reflects an error about relevant law.and each error likely affected the district court conclusions to the point where we must vacate the lower court judgment and remand the cases to allow appellants to reargue their racial gerrymandering claims.in light of our opinion,all parties remain free to introduce such further evidence as the district court shall reasonably find appropriate.
we begin by considering the geographical nature of the racial gerrymandering claims.the district court repeatedly referred to the racial gerrymandering claims as claims that race improperly motivated the drawing of boundary lines of the state considered as a whole.see,supp,at race was not the predominant motivating factor for the acts as a whole at construing plaintiffs challenge as arguing that the acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders at describing the plaintiffs challenge as a claim of racial gerrymandering to the acts as a whole supra,at noting four exceptions.
a racial gerrymandering claim,however,applies to the boundaries of individual districts.it applies.it does not apply to a state considered as an undifferentiated whole.we have consistently described a claim of racial gerrymandering as a claim that race was improperly used in the drawing of the boundaries of one or more specific electoral districts.see,shaw i,at violation consists of separat ing voters into different districts on the basis of race emphasis added vera,at principal opinion courts must scrutinize each challenged district emphasis added.we have described the plaintiff evidentiary burden similarly.see miller,supra,at plaintiff must show that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district emphasis added.
our language makes sense in light of the nature of the harms that underlie a racial gerrymandering claim.those harms are personal.they include being personally subjected to a racial classification,vera,supra,at principal opinion,as well as being represented by a legislator who believes his primary obligation is to represent only the members of a particular racial group,shaw i,supra,at.they directly threaten a voter who lives in the district attacked.but they do not so keenly threaten a voter who lives elsewhere in the state.indeed,the latter voter normally lacks standing to pursue a racial gerrymandering claim.united states hays.
voters,of course,can present statewide evidence in order to prove racial gerrymandering in a particular district.see miller,supra,at.and voters might make the claim that every individual district in a state suffers from racial gerrymandering.but this latter claim is not the claim that the district court,when using the phrase as a whole,considered here.rather,the concept as used here suggests the existence of a legal unicorn,an animal that exists only in the legal imagination.
this is not a technical,linguistic point.nor does it criticize what might seem,in effect,a slip of the pen.rather,here the district court terminology mattered.that is because the district court found that racial criteria had not predominated in the drawing of some alabama districts.and it found that fact the fact that race did not predominate in the drawing of some,or many districts sufficient to defeat what it saw as the basic claim before it,namely a claim of racial gerrymandering with respect to the state as an undifferentiated whole.see,supp,at rejecting plaintiffs challenge because the legislature followed no rule with respect to every district,at,citing examples of districts in which black population percentages were reduced and examples of districts in which precincts were split.
a showing that criteria did not significantly affect the drawing of some alabama districts,however,would have done little to defeat a claim that criteria predominantly affected the drawing of other alabama districts,such as alabama districts primarily at issue here.see,at thompson,dissenting t he drafters fail ure to achieve their percentage in one district does not detract one iota from the fact that they did achieve it in another thus,the district court undifferentiated statewide analysis is insufficient.and we must remand for consideration of racial gerrymandering with respect to the individual districts subject to the appellants racial gerrymandering challenges.
the state and principal dissent argue that but for four specifically mentioned districts there were in effect no such districts.the caucus and the conference,the state and principal dissent say,did not seek a analysis.and,the state and principal dissent conclude that the caucus and the conference have consequently waived the right to any further consideration.brief for appellees,post,at opinion of scalia.
we do not agree.we concede that the district court opinion suggests that it was the caucus and the conference that led the court to consider racial gerrymandering of the state as a whole.supp,at.at least the district court interpreted their filings to allege only that kind of claim.ibid.but our review of the record indicates that the plaintiffs did not claim only that the legislature had racially gerrymandered the state as an undifferentiated whole.rather,their evidence and their arguments embody the claim that individual districts were racially gerrymandered.and those are the districts that we believe the district court must reconsider.
there are districts,in the house and in the senate.the district court opinion itself refers to evidence that the legislature redistricting committee,in order to satisfy what it believed the voting rights act required,deliberately chose additional black voters to move into underpopulated districts,a specific set of individual districts.see,supp,at referring to senator dial testimony that the committee could have used,but did not use,white population within jefferson county to repopulate the districts because doing so would have resulted in the retrogression of the districts and potentially created a problem for justice department preclearance at stating that representative jim mcclendon,also committee cochair,testified consistently with senator dial at noting that the committee expert,randolph hinaman,testified that he needed to add population to districts without significantly lowering the percentage of the population in each district that was 
the caucus and the conference presented much evidence at trial to show that that the legislature had deliberately moved black voters into these districts again,a specific set of districts in order to prevent the percentage of minority voters in each district from declining.see,committee guidelines tr,testimony of senator dial deposition of gerald dial in may,doc,dial deposition tr.testimony of representative mcclendon,at,testimony of hinaman deposition of randolph hinaman in june,doc,hinaman deposition.
in their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,the plaintiffs stated that the evidence showed a racial gerrymander with respect to the majority of the districts they referred to the specific splitting of precinct and county lines in the drawing of many districts and they pointed to much evidence,alabama legislative black caucus plaintiffs notice of filing proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in,doc,caucus brief newton plaintiffs notice of filing proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in,doc,conference brief see also appendix a,infra organizing these citations by district.
we recognize that the plaintiffs relied heavily upon statewide evidence to prove that race predominated in the drawing of individual district lines.see generally caucus brief,conference brief.and they also sought to prove that the use of race to draw the boundaries of the districts affected the boundaries of other districts as well.see,tr,testimony of dial tr,testimony of hinaman see generally caucus brief.such evidence is perfectly relevant.we have said that the plaintiff burden in a racial gerrymandering case is to show,either through circumstantial evidence of a district shape and demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative purpose,that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.miller,at.easley cromartie,explaining the plaintiff burden in cases,unlike these,in which the state argues that politics,not race,was its predominant motive.that alabama expressly adopted and applied a policy of prioritizing mechanical racial targets above all other districting criteria save,provides evidence that race motivated the drawing of particular lines in multiple districts in the state.and neither the use of statewide evidence nor the effort to show widespread effect can transform a racial gerrymandering claim about a set of individual districts into a separate,general claim that the legislature racially gerrymandered the state as an undifferentiated whole.
we,like the principal dissent,recognize that the plaintiffs could have presented their claims more clearly,post,at,opinion of scalia,but the dissent properly concedes that its objection would weaken had the conference developed such a claim in the course of discovery and trial.post,at.and that is just what happened.
in the past few pages and in appendix a,we set forth the many record references that establish this fact.the caucus helps to explain the complaint omissions when it tells us that the plaintiffs unearthed the factual basis for their racial gerrymandering claims when they deposed the committee redistricting expert.see brief for appellants in.the state neither disputes this procedural history nor objects that plaintiffs pleadings failed to conform with the proof.indeed,throughout,the plaintiffs litigated these claims not as if they were wholly separate entities but as if they were a team.see,caucus brief we support the additional claims made by the conference plaintiffs but post,at scalia,dissenting treating separately conference claims from caucus claims.thus we,like the dissenting judge below who also lived with these cases through trial,conclude that the record as a whole shows that the plaintiffs brought,and their argument rested significantly upon,claims.see supp,at thompson,dissenting construing plaintiffs as also challenging each house and senate district 
the principal dissent adds that the conference waived its claims on appeal.post,at.but that is not so.when asked specifically about its position at oral argument,the conference stated that it was relying on statewide evidence to prove its challenges.tr.of oral arg.its counsel said that the exact same policy was applied in every district,at,and b y statewide,we simply mean a common policy applied to every district in the state,at.we accept the conference clarification,which is consistent with how it presented these claims below.
we consequently conclude that the district court analysis of racial gerrymandering of the state as a whole was legally erroneous.we find that the appellants did not waive their right to consideration of their claims as applied to particular districts.accordingly,we remand the cases.see swint,remand is required when the district court failed to make a finding because of an erroneous view of the law rapanos united states,same.
we next consider the district court holding with respect to standing.the district court,sua sponte,held that the conference lacked standing either to bring racial gerrymandering claims with respect to the four individual districts that the court specifically considered,senate districts,and or to bring a racial gerrymandering claim with respect to the state as a whole.supp,at.
the district court recognized that ordinarily 
a n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would have standing to sue in their own right,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires individuals members participation in the lawsuit.at quoting friends of the earth,laidlaw environmental services toc,emphasis added.
it also recognized that a member of an association would have standing to sue in his or her own right when that member resides in the district that he alleges was the product of a racial gerrymander.supp,at citing hays,at.but,the district court nonetheless denied standing because it believed that the record did not clearly identify the districts in which the individual members of the conference reside,and the conference had not proved that it has members who have standing to pursue any claims of racial gerrymandering.supp,at.
the district court conceded that joe reed,a representative of the conference,testified that the conference has members in almost every county in alabama.ibid.but,the district court went on to say that the counties in alabama are split into many districts.ibid.and the conference offered no testimony or evidence that it has members in all of the districts in alabama or in any of the four specific districts that it challenged.ibid.
the record,however,lacks adequate support for the district court conclusion.reed testimony supports,and nothing in that record undermines,the conference own statement,in its brief,that it is a statewide political caucus founded in.conference brief.it has the purpose of endors ing candidates for political office who will be responsible to the needs of the blacks and other minorities and poor people.at.these two statements the second of which the principal dissent ignores,taken together with reed testimony,support an inference that the organization has members in all of the state districts,other things being equal,which is sufficient to meet the conference burden of establishing standing.that is to say,it seems highly likely that a statewide organization with members in almost every county,the purpose of which is to help blacks and other minorities and poor people,will have members in each district.but post,at scalia,dissenting.
at the very least,the common sense inference is strong enough to lead the conference reasonably to believe that,in the absence of a state challenge or a court request for more detailed information,it need not provide additional information such as a specific membership list.we have found nothing in the record,nor has the state referred us to anything in the record,that suggests the contrary.app,state arguing lack of standing,not because of inadequate member residency but because an association lives nowhere and that the conference should join individual members.the most the state argued was that n one of the individual p laintiffs who brought the case with the conference claims to live in senate district,at emphasis added,but the conference would likely not have understood that argument as a request that it provide a membership list.in fact,the conference might have understood the argument as an indication that the state did not contest its membership in every district.
to be sure,the district court had an independent obligation to confirm its jurisdiction,even in the absence of a state challenge.see post,at scalia,dissenting.but,in these circumstances,elementary principles of procedural fairness required that the district court,rather than acting sua sponte,give the conference an opportunity to provide evidence of member residence.warth seldin,explaining that a court may allow or r equire a plaintiff to supplement the record to show standing and that i f,after this opportu nity,the plaintiff standing does not adequately appear from all materials of record,the complaint must be dismissed emphasis added.moreover,we have no reason to believe that the conference would have been unable to provide a list of members,at least with respect to the districts,had it been asked.it has filed just such a list in this court.see affidavit of joe reed pursuant to this court rule lodging of conference affidavit listing members residing in each district in the state see also parents involved in community schools seattle school dist,accepting a lodged affidavit in similar circumstances.thus,the district court on remand should reconsider the conference standing by permitting the conference to file its list of members and permitting the state to respond,as appropriate.
the district court held in the alternative that the claims of racial gerrymandering must fail because r ace was not the predominant motivating factor in the creation of any of the challenged districts.supp,at.in our view,however,the district court did not properly calculate predominance.in particular,it judged race to lack predominance in part because it placed in the balance,among other nonracial factors,legislative efforts to create districts of approximately equal population.see,at the need to bring the neighboring districts into compliance with the requirement of one person,one vote served as the primary motivating factor for the changes to senate district emphasis added,at the constitutional requirement of one person,one vote trumped every other districting principle at the record establishes that the drafters of the new districts,above all,had to correct for severe malapportionment at the inclusion of additional precincts in senate district is a reasonable response to the underpopulation of the district 
in our view,however,an equal population goal is not one factor among others to be weighed against the use of race to determine whether race predominates.rather,it is part of the redistricting background,taken as a given,when determining whether race,or other factors,predominate in a legislator determination as to how equal population objectives will be met.
to understand this conclusion,recall what predominance is about a plaintiff pursuing a racial gerrymandering claim must show that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.miller,at.to do so,the plaintiff must prove that the legislature subordinated traditional districting principles to racial considerations.ibid.emphasis added.
now consider the nature of those offsetting traditional districting principles.we have listed several,including compactness,contiguity,respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests,incumbency protection,and political affiliation,vera,at,principal opinion.
but we have not listed equal population objectives.and there is a reason for that omission.the reason that equal population objectives do not appear on this list of traditional criteria is that equal population objectives play a different role in a state redistricting process.that role is not a minor one.indeed,in light of the constitution demands,that role may often prove predominant in the ordinary sense of that word.but,as the united states points out,predominance in the context of a racial gerrymandering claim is special.it is not about whether a legislature believes that the need for equal population takes ultimate priority.rather,it is,as we said,whether the legislature placed race above traditional districting considerations in determining which persons were placed in appropriately apportioned districts.brief for united states as amicus curiae some emphasis added.in other words,if the legislature must place or so additional voters in a particular district in order to achieve an equal population goal,the predominance question concerns which voters the legislature decides to choose,and specifically whether the legislature predominately uses race as opposed to other,traditional factors when doing so.
consequently,we agree with the united states that the requirement that districts have approximately equal populations is a background rule against which redistricting takes place,at.it is not a factor to be treated like other nonracial factors when a court determines whether race predominated over other,traditional factors in the drawing of district boundaries.
had the district court not taken a contrary view of the law,its predominance conclusions,including those concerning the four districts that the conference specifically challenged,might well have been different.for example,once the legislature equal population objectives are put to the side,seen as a background principle then there is strong,perhaps overwhelming,evidence that race did predominate as a factor when the legislature drew the boundaries of senate district,the one district that the parties have discussed here in depth.
the legislators in charge of creating the redistricting plan believed,and told their technical adviser,that a primary redistricting goal was to maintain existing racial percentages in each district,insofar as feasible.see supra,at compiling extensive record testimony in support of this point.there is considerable evidence that this goal had a direct and significant impact on the drawing of at least some of district boundaries.see tr.testimony of hinaman appendix c,infra change of district shape from rectangular to irregular.of the individuals that the new redistricting laws added to the population of district,just were white a remarkable feat given the local demographics.see,tr.testimony of senator quinton ross tr.testimony of hinaman.transgressing their own redistricting guidelines,committee guidelines,the drafters split seven precincts between the district and the district,with the population in those precincts clearly divided on racial lines.see exh.v in support of newton plaintiffs opposition to summary judgment in,doc.and the district court conceded that race was a factor in the drawing of district,and that the legislature preserved the percentage of the population that was black.supp,at.
we recognize that the district court also found,with respect to district,that preservi ng the core of the existing d istrict,following county lines,and following highway lines played an important role.ibid.but the first of these core preservation is not directly relevant to the origin of the new district inhabitants the second county lines seems of marginal importance since virtually all senate district boundaries departed from county lines and the third highways was not mentioned in the legislative redistricting guidelines.committee guidelines.
all this is to say that,with respect to district and likely others as well,had the district court treated equal population goals as background factors,it might have concluded that race was the predominant consideration.thus,on remand,the district court should reconsider its no predominance conclusions with respect to senate district and others to which our analysis is applicable.
finally,we note that our discussion in this section is limited to correcting the district court misapplication of the predominance test for strict scrutiny discussed in miller,at.it does not express a view on the question of whether the intentional use of race in redistricting,even in the absence of proof that traditional districting principles were subordinated to race,triggers strict scrutiny.see vera,at kennedy,concurring.
the district court,in a yet further alternative holding,found that e ven if the state subordinated traditional districting principles to racial considerations,the racial gerrymandering claims failed because,in any event,the districts would satisfy strict scrutiny.supp,at.in the district court view,the acts are narrowly tailored to comply with section of the voting rights act,at.that provision required the legislature to maintain,where feasible,the existing number of districts and not substantially reduce the relative percentages of black voters in those districts.ibid.emphasis added.and,insofar as the state redistricting embodied racial considerations,it did so in order to meet this requirement.
in our view,however,this alternative holding rests upon a misperception of the law.section,which covered particular states and certain other jurisdictions,does not require a covered jurisdiction to maintain a particular numerical minority percentage.it requires the jurisdiction to maintain a minority ability to elect a preferred candidate of choice.that is precisely what the language of the statute says.it prohibits a covered jurisdiction from adopting any change that has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminishing the ability of the minority group to elect their preferred candidates of choice.b see also d the purpose of subsection b is to protect the ability of such citizens to elect their preferred candidates of choice 
that is also just what department of justice guidelines say.the guidelines state specifically that the department preclearance determinations are not based 
on any predetermined or fixed demographic percentages.rather,in the department view,this determination requires a functional analysis of the electoral behavior within the particular jurisdiction or election district c ensus data alone may not provide sufficient indicia of electoral behavior to make the requisite determination.guidance concerning redistricting under section of the voting rights act,fed.reg.
consistent with this view,the united states tells us that section does not requir e the state to maintain the same percentage of black voters in each of the districts as had existed in the prior districting plans.brief for united states as amicus curiae.rather,it prohibits only those diminutions of a minority group proportionate strength that strip the group within a district of its existing ability to elect its candidates of choice.at.we agree.section does not require maintaining the same population percentages in districts as in the prior plan.rather,is satisfied if minority voters retain the ability to elect their preferred candidates.
the history of further supports this view.in adopting the statutory language to which we referred above,congress rejected this court decision in georgia ashcroft,holding that it is not necessarily retrogressive for a state to replace safe districts with crossover or influence districts,and it adopted the views of the dissent,and.while the thrust of justice souter dissent was that,in a retrogression case,courts should ask whether a new voting provision would likely deprive minority voters of their ability to elect a candidate of their choice language that congress adopted in revising his dissent also made clear that courts should not mechanically rely upon numerical percentages but should take account of all significant circumstances.georgia ashcroft,supra,at.and while the revised language of may raise some interpretive questions,its application to coalition,crossover,and influence districts it is clear that congress did not mandate that a reduction in a black population district would be necessarily retrogressive.see persily,the promises and pitfalls of the new voting rights act,yale.indeed,alabama mechanical interpretation of can raise serious constitutional concerns.see miller,supra,at.
the record makes clear that both the district court and the legislature relied heavily upon a mechanically numerical view as to what counts as forbidden retrogression.see appendix b,infra.and the difference between that view and the more view reflected in the statute language can matter.imagine a district with a black population.assume also that voting in that district,like that in the state itself,is racially polarized.and assume that the district has long elected to office black voters preferred candidate.other things being equal,it would seem highly unlikely that a redistricting plan that,while increasing the numerical size of the district,reduced the percentage of the black population from,say,to would have a significant impact on the black voters ability to elect their preferred candidate.and,for that reason,it would be difficult to explain just why a plan that uses racial criteria predominately to maintain the black population at is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest,namely the interest in preventing retrogression.the circumstances of this hypothetical example,we add,are close to those characterizing senate district,as set forth in the district court opinion and throughout the record.see,tr.testimony of dial tr.testimony of hinaman.
in saying this,we do not insist that a legislature guess precisely what percentage reduction a court or the justice department might eventually find to be retrogressive.the law can not insist that a state legislature,when redistricting,determine precisely what percent minority population demands.the standards of are complex they often require evaluation of controverted claims about voting behavior the evidence may be unclear and,with respect to any particular district,judges may disagree about the proper outcome.the law can not lay a trap for an unwary legislature,condemning its redistricting plan as either unconstitutional racial gerrymandering should the legislature place a few too many minority voters in a district or retrogressive under should the legislature place a few too few.see vera,at principal opinion.thus,we agree with the united states that a court analysis of the narrow tailoring requirement insists only that the legislature have a strong basis in evidence in support of the choice that it has made.brief for united states as amicus curiae citing ricci destefano.this standard,as the united states points out,does not demand that a state actions actually be necessary to achieve a compelling state interest in order to be constitutionally valid.brief for united states as amicus curiae.and legislators may have a strong basis in evidence to use racial classifications in order to comply with a statute when they have good reasons to believe such use is required,even if a court does not find that the actions were necessary for statutory compliance.ibid.emphasis added.
here the district court enunciated a narrow tailoring standard close to the one we have just mentioned.it said that a plan is narrowly tailored when the action taken was reasonably necessary to achieve a compelling interest.supp,at emphasis added.and it held that preventing retrogression is a compelling interest,at.while we do not here decide whether,given shelby county holder,continued compliance with remains a compelling interest,we conclude that the district court and the legislature asked the wrong question with respect to narrow tailoring.they asked how can we maintain present minority percentages in districts but given language,its purpose,the justice department guidelines,and the relevant precedent,they should have asked to what extent must we preserve existing minority percentages in order to maintain the minority present ability to elect the candidate of its choice asking the wrong question may well have led to the wrong answer.hence,we can not accept the district court compelling tailoring conclusion.
for these reasons,the judgment of the district court is vacated.we note that appellants have also raised additional questions in their jurisdictional statements,relating to their,claims caucus and vote dilution claims conference,which were also rejected by the district court.we do not pass upon these claims.the district court remains free to reconsider the claims should it find reconsideration appropriate.and the parties are free to raise them,including as modified by the district court,on any further appeal.
the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

scalia,dissenting 
on appeals from the united states district court for the middle district of alabama 
justice scalia,with whom the chief justice,justice thomas,and justice alito join,dissenting.
today,the court issues a sweeping holding that will have profound implications for the constitutional ideal of one person,one vote,for the future of the voting rights act of,and for the primacy of the state in managing its own elections.if the court destination seems fantastical,just wait until you see the journey.
two groups of plaintiffs,the alabama democratic conference and the alabama legislative black caucus,brought separate challenges to the way in which alabama drew its state legislative districts following the census.these cases were consolidated before a district court.even after a full trial,the district court lamented that t he filings and arguments made by the plaintiffs on these claims were mystifying at best.supp,md.nevertheless,the district court understood both groups of plaintiffs to argue,as relevant here,only that the acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders.at.it also understood the democratic conference to argue that senate districts,and constitute racial gerrymanders,at,but held that the democratic conference lacked standing to bring any claims of racial gerrymandering,at emphasis added.it then found for alabama on the merits.
the court rightly concludes that our racial gerrymandering jurisprudence does not allow for statewide claims.ante,at.however,rather than holding appellants to the misguided legal theory they presented to the district court,it allows them to take a mulligan,remanding the case with orders that the district court consider whether some all of alabama districts result from impermissible racial gerrymandering.in doing this,the court disregards the detailed findings and thoroughly reasoned conclusions of the district court in particular its determination,reached after watching the development of the case from complaint to trial,that no appellant proved or even pleaded claims with respect to the districts.worse still,the court ignores the democratic conference express waiver of these claims before this court.it does this on the basis of a few stray comments,from filings that are more rorschach brief than brandeis brief,in which the vague outline of what could be claims begins to take shape only with the careful,nudging of appellate counsel.
racial gerrymandering strikes at the heart of our democratic process,undermining the electorate confidence in its government as representative of a cohesive body politic in which all citizens are equal before the law.it is therefore understandable,if not excusable,that the court balks at denying merits review simply because appellants pursued a flawed litigation strategy.but allowing appellants a second bite at the apple invites lower courts similarly to depart from the premise that ours is an adversarial system whenever they deem the stakes sufficiently high.because i do not believe that article iii empowers this court to act as standby counsel for sympathetic litigants,i dissent.
i.the alabama democratic conference 
the district court concluded that the democratic conference lacked standing to bring claims.it did so on the basis of the conference failure to present any evidence that it had members who voted in the challenged districts,and because the individual conference plaintiffs did not claim to vote in them.supp,at.
a voter has standing to bring a claim only if he votes in a gerrymandered district,or if specific evidence demonstrates that he has suffered the special harms that attend racial gerrymandering.united states hays.however,the democratic conference only claimed to have chapters and members in almost all counties in the state.newton plaintiffs proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in,doc,democratic conference brief emphasis added.yet the court concludes that this fact,combined with the conference as a statewide political caucus that endorses candidates for political office,supports an inference that the organization has members in all of the state districts,other things being equal.ante,at.the court provides no support for this theory of jurisdiction by illogical inference,perhaps because this court has rejected other attempts to peddle standing.see summers earth island institute,rejecting a test for organizational standing that asks whether,accepting an organization of the activities of its members,there is a statistical probability that some of those members are threatened with concrete injury 
the inference to be drawn from the conference statements cuts in precisely the opposite direction.what is at issue here is not just counties but voting districts within counties.if the conference has members in almost every county,then there must be counties in which it does not have members and we have no basis for concluding or inferring that those counties do not contain all of the voting districts.morever,even in those counties in which the conference does have members,we have no basis for concluding or inferring that those members vote in districts.the conference had plenty of opportunities,including at trial,to demonstrate that this was the case,and failed to do so.this failure lies with the democratic conference,and the consequences should be borne by it,not by the people of alabama,who must now shoulder the expense of further litigation and the uncertainty that attends a resuscitated constitutional challenge to their legislative districts.
incredibly,the court thinks that elementary principles of procedural fairness require giving the democratic conference the opportunity to prove on appeal what it neglected to prove at trial.ante,at.it observes that the conference had no reason to believe it should provide such information because the state did not contest its membership in every district,and the opinion cites an affidavit lodged with this court providing a list of the conference members in each district in alabama.ibid.i can not imagine why the absence of a state challenge would matter.whether or not there was such a challenge,it was the conference responsibility,as t he party invoking federal jurisdiction,to establish standing.see lujan defenders of wildlife.that responsibility was enforceable,challenge or no,by the court the federal courts are under an independent obligation to examine their own jurisdiction,and standing is perhaps the most important of the jurisdictional doctrines.dallas,citations omitted.and because standing is not a mere pleading requiremen t but rather an indispensable part of the plaintiff case,each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.defenders of wildlife,supra,at.
the court points to parents involved in community schools seattle school dist,as support for its decision to sandbag alabama with the democratic conference indeed,lodging in this court.the circumstances in that case,however,are far afield.the organization of parents in that case had established organizational standing in the lower court by showing that it had members with children who would be subject to the school district integration tiebreaker,which was applied at ninth grade.brief for respondents.by the time the case reached this court,however,the youngest of these children had entered high school,and so would no longer be subject to the challenged policy.ibid.accordingly,we accepted a lodging that provided names of additional,younger children in order to show that the organization had not lost standing as a result of the long delay that often accompanies federal litigation.here,by contrast,the democratic conference lodging in the supreme court is its first attempt to show that it has members in the districts.this is too little,too late.
but that is just the start.even if the democratic conference had standing to bring claims,there remains the question whether it did bring them.its complaint alleged three counts violation of of the voting rights act,racial gerrymandering in violation of the equal protection clause,and violations of the voting rights act and the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.complaint in,doc.the racial gerrymandering count alleged that alabama acts and were drawn for the purpose and effect of minimizing the opportunity of minority voters to participate effectively in the political process,and that this racial gerrymandering by alabama acts and violates the rights of plaintiffs.at.it made no reference to specific districts that were racially gerrymandered indeed,the only particular jurisdictions mentioned anywhere in the complaint were senate district,senate district,madison county senate districts,house district,and jefferson and montgomery county house districts.none of the senate districts is.nor is house district.jefferson county does,admittedly,contain of the house districts in alabama,and montgomery county contains another,making a total of.but they also contain house districts between them.in light of this,it is difficult to understand the court statement that appellants evidence and arguments embody the claim that individual districts were racially gerrymandered.ante,at.
that observation would,of course,make sense if the democratic conference had developed such a claim in the course of discovery and trial.but in its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,the conference hewed to its original charge of statewide racial gerrymandering or,rather,it did so as much as it reasonably could without actually proposing that the court find any racial gerrymandering,statewide or otherwise.instead,the conference chose only to pursue claims that alabama violated of the voting rights act under two theories.see democratic conference brief alleging a violation of the results prong of voting rights act and alleging a violation of the purpose prong of voting rights act.
to be sure,the conference employed language and presented factual claims at various points in its brief that are evocative of a claim of racial gerrymandering.but in clinging to these stray comments to support its conclusion that the conference made claims,ante,at,the court ignores the context in which these comments appear the context of a clear voting rights act claim.voting rights act claims and claims share some of the same elements.see league of united latin american citizens perry,scalia,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part.thus,allegations made in the course of arguing a claim will often be indistinguishable from allegations that would be made in support of a claim.the appearance of such allegations in one of the conference briefs might support reversal if this case came to us on appeal from the district court grant of a motion to dismiss.see johnson city of shelby,per curiam slip,at noting that the federal rules of civil procedure do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted but here the district court held a full trial before concluding that the conference failed to make or prove any claims with respect to the districts.in this posture,and on this record,i can not agree with the court that the conference evidence,clearly made in the course of arguing a theory,should be read to give rise to claims of racial gerrymandering with respect to alabama districts.
the court attempts to shift responsibility for the democratic conference statewide theory from the conference to the district court,implying that it was the legally erroneous analysis of the district court,ante,at,rather than the arguments made by the conference,that conjured this legal unicorn,ante,at,so that the conference did not forfeit the claims that the court now attributes to it,ante,at.i suspect this will come as a great surprise to the conference.whatever may have been presented to the district court,the conference unequivocally stated in its opening brief appellants challenge alabama statewide redistricting policy,not the design of any one particular election district.brief for appellants in,emphasis added.it drove the point home in its reply brief i f the court were to apply a and analysis,that analysis should be applied to the state policy,not to the design of each particular district.reply brief in.how could anything be clearer as the court observes,the conference attempted to walk back this unqualified description of its case at oral argument.ante,at.its assertion that what it really meant to challenge was the policy as applied to every district not every district,mind you is not clarification,ante,at,but an entirely new argument indeed,the same argument it expressly disclaimed in its briefing.we will not revive a forfeited argument simply because the petitioner gestures toward it in its reply brief.republic of argentina nml capital,slip,at,we certainly should not do so when the issue is first presented at oral argument.
ii.the alabama legislative black caucus 
the court does not bother to disentangle the independent claims brought by the black caucus from those of the democratic conference,but it strongly implies that both parties asserted claims with respect to alabama districts.as we have described,the democratic conference brought no such claims and the black caucus filings provide even weaker support for the court conclusion.
the black caucus complaint contained three counts violation of one person,one vote,see reynolds sims,dilution and isolation of black voting strength in violation of of the voting rights act and partisan gerrymandering.complaint in,doc.the failure to raise any claim was not a mere oversight or the consequence of inartful pleading.indeed,in its amended complaint the black caucus specifically cited this court leading case for the proposition that traditional or neutral districting principles may not be subordinated in a dominant fashion by either racial or partisan interests absent a compelling state interest for doing so.amended complaint in,doc,citing shaw reno,emphasis added.this quote appears in the first paragraph under the partisan gerrymandering heading,and claims of subordination to racial interests are notably absent from the black caucus complaint.
racial gerrymandering was not completely ignored,however.in a brief introductory paragraph to the amended complaint,before addressing jurisdiction and venue,the black caucus alleged that acts and are racial gerrymanders that unnecessarily minimize population deviations and violate the provisions of the alabama constitution with both the purpose and effect of minimizing black voting strength and isolating from influence in the alabama legislature legislators chosen by african americans.amended complaint,at.this was the first and last mention of racial gerrymandering,and like the democratic conference complaint,it focused exclusively on the districting maps as a whole rather than individual districts.moreover,even this allegation appears primarily concerned with the use of racially motivated districting as a means of violating one person,one vote by splitting counties,and of the voting rights act by minimizing and isolating black voters and legislators.
to the extent the black caucus cited particular districts in the body of its complaint,it did so only with respect to its enumerated,voting rights act,and counts.see,at alleging that the deviation restriction and disregard of the whole county requirements facilitated the republican majority efforts to gerrymander the district boundaries in acts and for partisan purposes.by packing the house and senate districts,the plans remove reliable democratic voters from adjacent districts at the partisan purpose of one gerrymander was to remove predominately black madison county precincts to sd,avoiding a potential crossover district at asserting that splitting jefferson county among house and senate districts and increasing the size of its local legislative delegation and the number of other counties whose residents elect members of the delegation dilut es the votes of jefferson county residents by diminishing their ability to control legislation in the state legislature.and even these claims were made with a statewide scope in mind,at viewed in their entirety,the plans in acts and have the purpose and effect of minimizing the opportunities for black and white voters who support the democratic party to elect candidates of their choice 
here again,discovery and trial failed to produce any clear claims with respect to the districts.in a curious inversion of the democratic conference practice of pleading racial gerrymandering and then effectively abandoning the claims,the black caucus,which failed to plead racial gerrymandering,did clearly advance the theory after the trial.see alabama legislative black caucus plaintiffs proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in,doc,black caucus brief.the black caucus asserted claims in its brief,but they all had a clear statewide scope.it charged that alabama started their line drawing with the districts so as to maximize the size of their black majorities,which impacted the drawing of districts in nearly every part of the state.at.r ace was the predominant factor in drafting both plans,at,which drove nearly every districting decision,dilut ing the influence of black voters in the districts,at.
the black caucus did present evidence in the course of developing its other legal theories.although this included evidence that alabama manipulated the racial composition of certain districts,it also included evidence that alabama manipulated racial distributions with respect to the districting maps as a whole,at maintaining the same high black percentages had a predominant impact on the entire plan and with respect to districts,at asked why sd was drawn in a that splits clair,talladega,and shelby counties,dial blamed that also on the need to preserve the black majorities in jefferson county senate districts and irons quick,primative sic analysis of the new sd convinced her that it was designed to shed the minority population of sanford sd to sd in order to crack a minority influence district the black caucus was attacking the legislative districts from every angle.nothing gives rise to an inference that it ever homed in on districts or,for that matter,any particular set of districts.indeed,the fair reading of the black caucus filings is that it was presenting illustrative evidence in particular districts,and in an effort to make out a claim of statewide racial gerrymandering.the fact that the court now concludes that this is not a valid legal theory does not justify its repackaging the claims for a second round of litigation.
iii.conclusion 
frankly,i do not know what to make of appellants arguments.they are pleaded with such opacity that,squinting hard enough,one can find them to contain just about anything.this,the court believes,justifies demanding that the district court go back and squint harder,so that it may divine some new means of construing the filings.this disposition is based,it seems,on the implicit premise that plaintiffs only plead legally correct theories.that is a silly premise.we should not reward the practice of litigation by obfuscation,especially when we are dealing with a legal claim that numerous plaintiffs have successfully brought in the past.see,amended complaint and motion for preliminary and permanent injunction in cromartie hunt,ednc,doc,under the march redistricting plan,the twelfth district and first district have boundaries which were drawn pursuant to a predominantly racial motivation,which were the fruit of earlier racially gerrymandered plans even the complaint in shaw,which established a cause of action for racial gerrymandering,displayed greater lucidity than appellants,alleging that defendants creat ed two amorphous districts which embody a scheme for segregation of voters by race in order to meet a racial quota totally unrelated to considerations of compactness,contiguous,and geographic or jurisdictional communities of interest.complaint and motion for preliminary and permanent injunction and for temporary restraining order in shaw barr,ednc,doc.
the court seems to acknowledge that appellants never focused their claims on alabama districts.while remanding to consider whether the districts were racially gerrymandered,it admits that plaintiffs basically claim that the state,in adding so many new minority voters to districts and to others,went too far.ante,at emphasis added.it further concedes that appellants relied heavily upon statewide evidence,and that they also sought to prove that the use of race to draw the boundaries of the districts affected the boundaries of other districts as well.ante,at.
the only reason i see for the court selection of the districts as the relevant set of districts for the district court to consider on remand is that this was the set chosen by appellants after losing on the claim they actually presented in the district court.by playing along with appellants style of litigation,willingly turning back the page every time a strategic decision leads to a,the court discourages careful litigation and punishes defendants who are denied both notice and repose.the consequences of this unprincipled decision will reverberate far beyond the narrow circumstances presented in this case.
accordingly,i dissent.

justice thomas,dissenting.
f ew devices could be better designed to exacerbate racial tensions than the consciously segregated districting system currently being constructed in the name of the voting rights act.holder hall,thomas,concurring in judgment.these consolidated cases are yet another installment in the disastrous misadventure of this court voting rights jurisprudence,at.we have somehow arrived at a place where the parties agree that alabama legislative districts should be to achieve some optimal result with respect to black voting power the only is about what percentage of blacks should be placed in those optimized districts.this is nothing more than a fight over the best racial quota.
i join justice scalia dissent.i write only to point out that,as this case painfully illustrates,our jurisprudence in this area continues to be infected with error.
the alabama legislature faced a difficult situation in its redistricting efforts.it began with racially segregated district maps that were inherited from previous decades.the maps produced by the redistricting contained house districts and senate districts both at the time they were drawn,app.to juris.statement,and at the time of the census,app.many of these districts were over black when they were drawn in,and even more were over black.app.to juris.statement.even after the census,the population remained above black in the majority of districts.app.
under the amendments to of the voting rights act of,alabama was also under a federal command to avoid drawing new districts that would have the effect of diminishing the ability of black voters to elect their preferred candidates of choice.b.to comply with,the legislature adopted a policy of maintaining the same percentage of black voters within each of those districts as existed in the plans.see ante,at.this,the districting committee thought,would preserve the ability of black voters to elect the same number of preferred candidates.app.to juris.statement.the department of justice doj apparently agreed.acting under its authority to administer of the voting rights act,the doj precleared alabama plans,at.
appellants including the alabama legislative black caucus and the alabama democratic conference saw matters differently.they sued alabama,and on appeal they argue that the state redistricting plans are racially gerrymandered because many districts are highly packed with black voters.according to appellants,black voters would have more voting power if they were spread over more districts rather than concentrated in the same number of districts as in previous decades.the doj has entered the fray in support of appellants,arguing that the state redistricting maps fail strict scrutiny because the state focused too heavily on a single racial characteristic the number of black voters in districts which potentially resulted in impermissible packing of black voters.
like the doj,today majority sides with appellants,faulting alabama for choosing the wrong percentage of blacks in the state districts,or at least for arriving at that percentage using the wrong reasoning.in doing so,the court along with appellants and the doj exacerbates a problem many years in the making.it seems fitting,then,to trace that history here.the practice of creating highly packed safe districts is the product of our erroneous jurisprudence,which created a system that forces states to segregate voters into districts based on the color of their skin.alabama current legislative districts have their genesis in the policy that the doj itself applied to throughout the and early.the amendments to then effectively locked in place alabama districts that were established during the and.these three problems a jurisprudence requiring segregated districts,the distortion created by the doj policy,and the ossifying effects of the amendments are the primary culprits in this case,not alabama redistricting policy.nor does this court have clean hands.
this court created the current system of redistricting by adopting expansive readings of and of the voting rights act.both and prohibit states from implementing voting laws that den y or abridg e the right to vote on account of race or color.a,a.but both provisions extend to only certain types of voting laws any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting,or standard,practice,or procedure.ibid.as i have previously explained,the terms standard,practice,o
