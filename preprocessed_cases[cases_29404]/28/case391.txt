background 
article xxviii of the colorado constitution 
in november,colorado voters,seeking to limit the influence of money on state elections,passed amendment amendment amended article xxviii of the colorado constitution to prohibit corporations from using their general funds to make contributions,expenditures,and electioneering communications.section a of article xxviii reads 
it shall be unlawful for a corporation or labor organization to make contributions to a candidate committee or a political party,and to make expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate except that a corporation or labor organization may establish a political committee or small donor committee which may accept contributions or dues from employees,officeholders,shareholders,or members 
section further reads 
notwithstanding any section to the contrary,it shall be unlawful for a corporation or labor organization to provide funding for an electioneering communication except that any political committee or small donor committee established by such corporation or labor organization may provide funding for an electioneering communication 
however,following the united states supreme court teachings in mcfl,article xxviii and secretary of state rule created an exception to the prohibition for corporations that meet three requirements.section b provides 
the prohibition contained in paragraph a of this subsection shall not apply to a corporation that 
i is formed for the purpose of promoting political ideas and can not engage in business activities and 
ii has no shareholders or other persons with a claim on its assets or income and 
iii was not established by and does not accept contributions from business corporations or labor organizations.
const.art.xxviii,b.similarly,rule,the secretary of state rules exception to reads 
article xxviii,concerning the prohibition against funding by corporations and labor organizations for electioneering communications,shall not apply to any corporation that 
was formed for the purpose of promoting political ideas and can not engage in business activities 
has no shareholders with a claim on its assets or other income and 
was not established by,and does not accept contributions from business corporations or labor organizations.
sec.of state,rules concerning campaign and political finance,rule.we have labeled the exception established by b and rule the mcfl exemption.
a corporation that meets these criteria may use its general corporate treasuries to make expenditures,contributions,and electioneering communications.however,the secretary maintains that whether or not a corporation meets the mcfl exemption,it must still register as a political committee if it makes or accepts contributions or expenditures in excess of to support or oppose the nomination or election of candidates.const.art.xxviii,a defining political committee as any person,other than a natural person,or any group of two or more persons,including natural persons that have accepted or made contributions or expenditures in excess of to support or oppose the nomination or election of one or more candidates see id.referring to disclosure requirements relevant to political committees and other groups,set forth in.or any successor section.
furthermore,if a nonprofit ideological corporation or any person funds electioneering communications exceeding per year from its general corporate treasuries,it too must file applicable reports.section of article xxviii details these requirements,while prohibits corporate funding of electioneering communications 
any person who expends one thousand dollars or more per calendar year on electioneering communications shall submit reports to the secretary of state in accordance with the schedule currently set forth in,or any successor section.such reports shall include spending on such electioneering communications,and the name,and address,of any person that contributes more than two hundred and fifty dollars per year to such person described in this section for an electioneering communication.in the case where the person is a natural person,such reports shall also include the occupation and employer of such natural person.the last such report shall be filed thirty days after the applicable election.
notwithstanding any section to the contrary,it shall be unlawful for a corporation or labor organization to provide funding for an electioneering communication except that any political committee or small donor committee established by such corporation or labor organization may provide funding for an electioneering communication.
const.art.xxviii.
at issue here is whether crlc is subject to article xxviii reporting requirements and whether banning corporations from making expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate,banning corporations from funding electioneering communications,and defining political committee of article xxviii are unconstitutional as applied to crlc.we also discuss crlc contention that these provisions,along with,are facially vague and overbroad.
colorado right to life committee 
we first summarize the undisputed facts regarding crlc,drawn largely from the district court order.see.right to life,davidson,d.crlc is a organization under c and has a policy of not contributing to,accepting contributions from,or engaging in express advocacy regarding,political parties or candidates.likewise,it is not associated with any political candidate,political party,or campaign committee,and is not aware of ever receiving any donations at the request of,or solicited by,a political candidate,a political party or elected official.it has several chapters throughout the state of colorado.crlc policy is not to engage in express advocacy or make direct contributions.
crlc corporate organizational documents indicate that its purposes are to promote reverence and respect for human life without regard to condition,quality,age,race,religion,creed,or color,whether born or unborn and educate the community regarding the dangers of abortion,euthanasia,infanticide,and compulsory sterilization as well as any legislation that would allow the debasement of or destroy the community moral fiber and encourage a favorable,spiritual,physical,and cultural environment that would improve the quality of life consistent with these purposes.crlc seeks to achieve these purposes by communicating with the public regarding such issues,providing information about elected officials,and encouraging colorado citizens to communicate with their representatives on these issues.
crlc was not established by a business corporation or labor union,and has no shareholders or otherwise affiliated persons who would have a claim on its assets and earnings.crlc has two types of members supporting members,who include anyone who donates money to the organization,unless that person asks not to be a member and voting members,who include anyone who supports crlc objectives,indicates a desire to join crlc,and pays the prescribed dues,unless crlc board has waived those dues.
individual donors nearly exclusively fund crlc through their paying of dues.in,crlc had donors,including who gave or more.in,crlc had donors,including who gave or more.in,crlc had donors,including who gave or more.
crlc does not have a policy against accepting contributions from business corporations,and it received in corporate contributions in each of,and.its gross revenues and receipts from membership dues for the same years were,and.additionally,crlc at one point participated in a long distance telephone service carrier program in which subscribers could designate it as the recipient of a portion of their bills in,crlc received from its participation in this program.
crlc also engages in activities including the sale via suggested donations of baby feet pins and bumper stickers at various public events like the colorado state fair.although there is a suggested donation for the items,they are often given away.crlc treasurer estimated that crlc received approximately per year from these combined activities.additionally,about a decade ago,crlc received income when it rented its mailing list to a political candidate for a state house seat.
crlc has not had a political committee or other segregated account since.it has no record of ever receiving donations earmarked for the type of communications at issue in this case.
crlc publishes a periodic newsletter,titled the colorado lifelight,which often mentions the names of candidates and their positions on various life issues.crlc distributes the colorado lifelight,including within days before the primary election and days before the general election.the newsletter is sent to members,and sometimes to prospective members.in total,the mailing is sent to approximately to recipients.
crlc also maintains a website that contains a section on politics and law.some articles in that section mention candidates and are available to the public year round,including immediately preceding elections.additionally,crlc admits that it might have placed voter guides on its website in the past.
in recent election cycles,crlc has made communications that unambiguously referred to candidates within days before primary elections and days before general elections to inform voters of the candidates views on abortion.crlc spent over per year on these communications,which have included voter guides,articles on its website,radio ads,phone messages,and email.some examples include 
in july,crlc sent rapid response cards,which provided the responses of primary candidates in five districts to a crlc survey regarding issues,to individuals from those five districts in its mailing list database.in its september newsletter,crlc noted that all five candidates had won and expressed confidence that the cards had an impact on the election results.crlc spent on this effort.
before the primaries and general elections in,crlc circulated the results of its candidate questionnaire,which provided the responses of some candidates to a variety of abortion and related issues.
in august,before the state primary election,crlc arranged for a phone call to be made to identified supporters in morgan county before a primary election in which jack darnell and greg brophy were running.the message compared the views of the two candidates on abortion,and asked the recipients to urge darnell to abandon his views and to thank brophy for defending unborn children.crlc spent on this activity.
in august,crlc,in partnership with the christian coalition,sent a form letter to registered voters in house district comparing the two candidates views on abortion.this letter asked recipients,when voting in the election,to help stop gayle berry extreme agenda,as well as urging recipients to thank shari bjorglund for being solidly.crlc spent on this letter.
in august,crlc published the colorado lifelight,with a subtitle special voter guide.although the front page was devoted to general information,the remainder of the publication reported the responses of candidates for state or federal office to a crlc questionnaire.in the colorado lifelight,crlc urged recipients to vote no on three ballot measures and published a list of colorado candidates who had been endorsed by the national abortion rights action league.
in the general election,crlc ran radio ads on denver and longmont stations comparing the abortion views of fourth congressional district candidates state senator stan matsunaka and marilyn musgrave.around that same time,crlc also ran other radio ads encouraging people in matsunaka district to call him and ask him to pass the born alive infant protection act out of his senate committee.
procedural background 
because of article xxviii prohibitions and regulations,crlc determined it would no longer engage in some of the above activities.crlc sought declaratory and injunctive relief.the district court reviewed the following five claims 
whether a ban on corporate contributions and expenditures is unconstitutional as applied to crlc because it is a ideological corporation that does not engage in business activities and receives only insubstantial or de minimis contributions from business corporations 
whether ban on direct corporate funding for electioneering and communications is unconstitutional as applied to crlc,for the same reason that a ban is unconstitutional as applied to crlc 
whether definition of political committee is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to organizations such as crlc that do not have a major purpose of electing candidates 
whether and,dealing with electioneering communications are impermissibly vague and overbroad and can not be constitutionally applied to crlc communications not directly or indirectly advocating the election or defeat of any candidate and 
whether a ban on corporate expenditures is unconstitutional because it is vague and overbroad.
both parties sought summary judgment.the district court ruled as narrowly as possible,and addressed crlc challenges first.d at.the district court granted each motion in part,determining that article xxviii banning corporations from making expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate and banning corporations from funding an electioneering communication were unconstitutional as applied to crlc because it is exempt from such restrictions under the principles of mcfl.the district court also found that s definition of political committee was unconstitutional as applied to crlc because it failed to include buckley major purpose test.
the district court rejected,or declined to reach,crlc remaining facial challenges.specifically,it rejected crlc vagueness and overbreadth challenges to outlining reporting requirements for any person who expends more than per calendar year on electioneering communications,noting that a statute may not be invalidated simply because some persons arguably protected conduct may or may not be caught or chilled by the statute.id.internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,it rejected crlc vagueness challenge to definition of electioneering communications because crlc has not demonstrated that is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.id.at.
the district court declined to reach crlc facial challenges to banning corporations from making expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate,banning corporations from funding an electioneering communication,and defining political committee because it had already granted crlc a narrower remedy when it found these sections unconstitutional as applied to crlc.
ii.discussion 
the secretary challenges the district court grant of summary judgment to crlc and enjoinment of his enforcement of certain provisions of article xxviii against crlc.specifically,the secretary disputes the district court rulings that which bans corporations from making expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate is unconstitutional as applied to crlc because crlc engaged only in de minimis business activities and received only de minimis contributions from business corporations which bans corporations from providing funding for electioneering communications is unconstitutional as applied to crlc for the same reason and defining political committee is unconstitutional as applied to crlc for employing a trigger of without consideration of whether the organization major purpose is the nomination or election of candidates as required by buckley.we must reject the secretary challenges.
in its,crlc challenges the facial validity of three sections banning corporations from funding electioneering communications,defining electioneering communications,and defining political committee because we agree with the district court determination that crlc is an exempt mcfl entity,we need not address crlc challenges to and.as to its facial challenge to,we agree with the district court that we need not reach this contention 
a.the secretary appeal 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards used by the district court.homans city of albuquerque,cir.we also review the district court findings of constitutional fact in a first amendment claim and conclusions of law de novo.because this decision implicates first amendment freedoms,we perform an independent examination of the whole record in order to ensure that the judgment protects the rights of free expression.faustin city county of denver,cir internal citation omitted.
plaintiffs may bring two types of first amendment challenges to a government policy,facial and.a facial challenge considers the restriction application to all conceivable parties,while an challenge tests the application of that restriction to the facts of a plaintiff concrete case.like the district court,we consider the disposition of crlc challenges first,and then turn to its facial challenges below,in section.
in an challenge in the context of campaign finance laws,limits on political expenditures deserve closer scrutiny than restrictions on political contributions.fec.republican fed l campaign,d see fec.right to life,d wrtl because the statute burdens political speech,it is subject to strict scrutiny.buckley american const l law,d when a state election law directly regulates core political speech,we have always subjected the challenged restriction to strict scrutiny and required that the legislation be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.the parties do not dispute that this case involves article xxviii restrictions on political expenditures and that political expenditures are subject to strict scrutiny.homans,at concluding the standard for expenditure limits operates identically to strict scrutiny review.hence,to be upheld,the restrictions must be both narrowly tailored and necessary to serve a compelling state interest.id.internal citations omitted see wrtl.at.
challenge to article xxviii banning corporations from making expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate and banning corporations from funding an electioneering communication 
the district court concluded that crlc is exempt from both ban on corporate expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate and ban on a corporation funding of electioneering communication because crlc receives only de minimis contributions from business corporations.the secretary argues that any business contribution forecloses exemption from and.
mcfl exemption 
in mcfl,the federal election commission fec charged mcfl,a nonprofit membership corporation created to oppose abortion rights,with violating the federal election campaign act of feca,stat,as amended,by distributing a voter guide in the congressional election.at.when mcfl refused to pay a fine,the fec sued.mcfl claimed feca abridged its first amendment rights,and the supreme court agreed.the court first reiterated that independent expenditures could not be regulated as strictly as contributions.id.at.independent expenditures are similar to pure issue discussion and therefore remain far removed from the valid state interest of preventing election corruption.id.
the court also held that feca could be applied to business corporations and other entities that presented some danger of unfair deployment of wealth for political purposes.id.at.direct corporate spending on political activity raises the prospect that resources amassed in the economic marketplace may be used to provide an unfair advantage in the political marketplace.id.at.the court observed that the concerns motivating prohibition of corporate political spending were absent in regard to mcfl,however,because v oluntary political associations do not suddenly present the specter of corruption merely by assuming the corporate form.id.at.in delineating this exemption,the court cited three essential features of mcfl 
the entity was formed for the purpose of promoting political ideas,and did not engage in business activities 
it had no shareholders or others with a claim to its assets or earnings and 
it was not formed by a corporation,and had a policy against accepting corporate contributions.
as noted above,colorado campaign finance amendment includes an exemption for such corporations.see.const.art.xxviii,b.although the prohibition on corporate funding of electioneering communications does not explicitly contain the same exemption,the secretary promulgated rule,which construes to exclude mcfl corporations.
the parties do not dispute that crlc satisfies the second prong.although the secretary does not concede that crlc has satisfied the first prong he focuses his arguments on appeal on the third mcfl prong.it is the third prong that poses the rub crlc admits that it does not have a policy against accepting contributions,and that it has accepted the amount of about per year.in response,the secretary argues that because the mcfl court deemed the characteristics essential,the court created a bright line allowing the government to regulate the political expenditures of any corporation as long as it does not share the precise mcfl characteristics.at.the district court refused to adopt the secretary unbending argument that colorado may prohibit direct political expenditures by an advocacy corporation such as crlc if it accepts de minimis corporate contributions.id.
the secretary acknowledges that b and rule comport with mcfl.but,he argues that by allowing an exception for de minimis corporations,the district court diverts the analysis to a review of a corporation actions.as a practical matter,t he courts and the public do not have the resources to conduct such reviews.aplt br.at.because e ven minimal expenditures can have a significant impact,the secretary argues that the district court approach is impractical and invites corruption.id.
we disagree with the secretary analysis for substantially the same reasons as the district court.the district court relied in part on the reasoning of every other circuit to have addressed this issue,noting that if corporate contributions made up a minimal part of an organization revenue,the mcfl exemption applies.see fec rifle ass n,holding that sponsorship of activities,provision of goods and services such as magazines and accident insurance to members,lack of policy against corporate contributions,and actual receipt of up to in corporate contributions did not turn an incorporated advocacy group into a potential conduit for corporate funding of political activity right to life,bartlett,cir lack of policy against corporate donations and receipt of up to a modest percentage of revenue from corporations did not prevent corporation from claiming mcfl exemption fec survival educ.fund,cir stating that a nonprofit political advocacy corporation,which in fact receives no significant funding from unions or business corporations,does not surrender its first amendment freedoms for the want of such a policy and holding that lack of policy against corporate contributions and actual receipt of up to of funds from corporations did not place group outside scope of mcfl exemption day holahan,cir holding that the lack of policy against corporate donations and engaging in incidental business activities did not put group outside mcfl exemption.
we agree with these courts that mcfl does not establish an immobile set of parameters.see,day,at the state goes too far in concluding that the factual findings of mcfl translate into absolutes in legal application.instead,they are really factors to determine whether a corporation is more like the type of traditional corporatio n organized for economic gain,or the voluntary political association of mcfl.mcfl,at.internal quotation marks omitted see id.at.some corporations have features more akin to voluntary political associations than business firms,and therefore should not have to bear burdens on independent spending solely because of their incorporated status.
as previously noted,crlc receives approximately of corporate funding per year.this figure,b oth as a percentage of its gross income significantly less than and an absolute number,could not have turned crlc into a potential conduit for corporate funding of political activity.at quoting rifle ass n,at.
supreme court decisions 
in response to the district court analysis,the secretary suggests that the four circuits that have applied the mcfl exemption have misconstrued the court decision.recognizing that every circuit that has addressed the issue has allowed for incidental or de minimis corporate contributions,the secretary argues that supreme court precedent dictates we should apply the mcfl exemption only sparingly,citing austin michigan chamber of commerce,d,fec beaumont,d,and mcconnell fec,d.after reviewing these cases,we conclude that the secretary arguments are unpersuasive.
i austin michigan chamber of commerce 
in austin michigan chamber of commerce,d,the supreme court revisited the mcfl exemption when it addressed the michigan chamber of commerce the chamber challenge to michigan campaign finance act.id.at.initially,the supreme court rejected a facial overbreadth challenge to the law on the grounds that it regulated closely held corporations that do not possess vast reservoirs of capital.id.at.the court determined that although some closely held corporations may not have accumulated significant amounts of wealth,they receive from the state the special benefits conferred by the corporate structure and present the potential for distorting the political process,which justified the law general applicability.id.
additionally,the court held that although the chamber was a ideological corporation,it did not qualify as an mcfl corporation under the three factors.id.at.first,the court held that although the chamber engaged in political activities,its primary purposes involved business and economic issues in contrast to mcfl primary political purpose.id.second,the court observed that 
although the chamber also lacks shareholders,many of its members may be similarly reluctant to withdraw as members even if they disagree with the chamber political expression,because they wish to benefit from the chamber nonpolitical programs and to establish contacts with other members of the business community.
accordingly,the court found that the chamber members are more similar to shareholders of a business corporation than to members of mcfl.id.finally,the court remarked that more than of the chamber members are business corporations,whose political contributions and expenditures can constitutionally be regulated by the state.id.at.consequently,recognizing the chamber as an mcfl corporation would circumvent the purpose of michigan campaign finance law.
the secretary suggests that austin supports his theory that the court intends a bright constitutional line to exist between mcfl and entities.in fact,the court analysis suggests that the chamber challenge to michigan law failed because it was closer to a traditional corporation than a voluntary political association.given crlc close resemblance to a voluntary political association,much like the one at issue in mcfl,we agree with the district court that crlc acceptance of de minimis contributions does not transform it into a potential conduit for corporate funding of political activity.at quoting rifle ass n,at.
ii fec beaumont 
in beaumont,the plaintiff was an officer of north carolina right to life,ncrl,a corporation organized under north carolina law.ncrl funding came almost entirely from donations from individual members,but it also accepted a small amount in corporate donations.ncrl used its general treasury funds to make both independent expenditures and contributions to candidates for state office,as allowed by north carolina law.ncrl challenged the federal prohibition on contributions from its treasury to candidates for federal office.
ncrl,like crlc,based its challenge on mcfl,contending that as an mcfl entity,ncrl had a constitutionally protected right to make contributions to candidates.the fourth circuit agreed,holding that contributions by such a group,like independent expenditures,fell within the mcfl exemption to prohibitions on corporate activity.
the supreme court reversed,noting that the case was correctly characterized as a contributions,rather than an expenditures,case,and thus subject to reduced scrutiny.the court admonished that advocacy corporations may also raise corruption concerns,as they too benefit from significant advantages.beaumont,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the court asserted that n advocacy corporations are,moreover,no less susceptible than traditional business companies to misuse as conduits for circumventing the contribution limits imposed on individuals.id.emphasis supplied.
the district court here rejected the secretary reliance on beaumont because the case focuses on contributions,not expenditures,and is thus not analogous.beaumont,at.kennedy,concurring mcfl contains language supporting the court holding here that corporate contributions can be regulated more closely than corporate expenditures.emphasis supplied.because we focus on article xxviii restrictions on expenditures,we agree with this distinction,and reject the secretary argument on appeal.
iii mcconnell fec 
third and finally,the secretary and amici curiae colorado common cause and the league of women voters of colorado,turn to mcconnell for support of a application of mcfl.they focus specifically on the mcconnell court statement that o ur decision in mcfl related to a carefully defined category of entities.at.standing alone,we acknowledge this language limits the breadth of mcfl factors however,the mcconnell court also distinguished the case before it from mcfl 
mcfl was not established by a business corporation or a labor union,and it is its policy not to accept contributions from such entities.this prevents such corporations from serving as conduits for the type of direct spending that creates a threat to the political marketplace.
id.at.quotation marks omitted emphasis supplied.
the district court applied the same analysis.it noted that crlc closely resembled mcfl plaintiff both are nonprofit,corporations sharing very similar purposes,advocacy activities,and funding mechanisms,including voluntary donations from members and informal sales such as bake sales,in the case of mcfl,or pin sales in the case of crlc.d at.the notable difference between the two is that crlc receives about of corporate funding per year this amount represents less than one percent of crlc gross income and does not invite the creation of a political conduit for corporate funding of political activity we agree with the district court that the secretary has not demonstrated that infringement upon crlc protected speech is supported by a compelling justification for the same reasons,a,to the extent it proscribes a corporation from making expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate except through a committee,is unconstitutional as applied to crlc.id.at.
challenge to article xxviii definition of political committee 
the secretary next challenges the district court grant of summary judgment to and enjoinment of his enforcement of against crlc.section a defines political committee as any person,other than a natural person,or any group of two or more persons,including natural persons that have accepted or made contributions or expenditures in excess of to support or oppose the nomination or election of one or more candidates.const.art.xxviii,a.the district court struck down as applied to crlc.the district court stated that buckley establishes that regulation should be tied to groups controlled by candidates or which have a major purpose of electing candidates.d at.because i t was not clear whether the facts presented would expose crlc to political committee regulation,the district court assumed that they did and ruled on an basis.id.at.
here,the secretary argues he can regulate an entity even if it does not have buckley major purpose of nominating,electing,or defeating a candidate.should this court disagree with the secretary proposed broad regulatory powers,he urges us to construe as incorporating the major purpose test,thus still requiring disclosure.
federal regulation of political committees buckley major purpose test 
regulation of political committees by campaign finance law began with the passage of feca.according to feca,a political committee is any group that receives contributions or makes expenditures exceeding per year.a contribution or expenditure is any gift or payment made for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office.id.a i,a i.
the supreme court later added in buckley,that a group is not a political committee unless its major purpose is to influence federal elections.at.the court explained that 
the general requirement that political committees and candidates disclose their expenditures could raise similar vagueness problems,for political committee is defined only in terms of amount of annual contributions and expenditures,and could be interpreted to reach groups engaged purely in issue discussion.the lower courts have construed the words political committee more narrowly.to fulfill the purposes of feca they need only encompass organizations that are under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate.expenditures of candidates and of political committees so construed can be assumed to fall within the core area sought to be addressed by congress.they are,by definition,campaign related.
id.footnotes omitted emphasis supplied.this construction of the term political committee as applied to organizations has come to be known as the major purpose test.see fec akins,d considering whether certain of organization expenditures were membership communications in connection with application of the major purpose test.
in mcfl,the court suggested two methods to determine an organization major purpose examination of the organization central organizational purpose or comparison of the organization independent spending with overall spending to determine whether the preponderance of expenditures are for express advocacy or contributions to candidates.at.noting that mcfl central organizational purpose wa s issue advocacy,although it occasionally engage d in activities on behalf of political candidates see id.at.noting that should mcfl independent spending become so extensive that the organization major purpose may be regarded as campaign activity,the corporation would be classified as a political committee.thus,under feca,any group that spends more than in a year,and has as its major purpose the influencing of a federal election,should be considered a political committee.as a political committee,the group must adhere to certain registration,organizational,recordkeeping,reporting,and disclosure requirements.see mcfl,at.m ore extensive requirements and more stringent restrictions may create a disincentive for such organizations to engage in political speech.
colorado regulation of political committees 
under colorado definition of political committees,any group that spends more than a year to support or oppose the nomination or election of one or more candidates is subject to the state various administrative,organizational,and reporting requirements.in concluding that was unconstitutional as applied to crlc,the district court noted that the trigger,standing alone,is incompatible with a major purpose test t he amount of money an organization must accept or spend not substantial and would,as a matter of common sense,operate to encompass a variety of entities based on an expenditure that is insubstantial in relation to their overall budgets.d at.the court added that,under a,an entity that spends on various activities and donates of of its budget to a candidate is deemed a political committee.id.
the secretary first argues the district court erred when it determined was unconstitutional to crlc and that its reasoning was based upon the flawed assumption that the major purpose component is constitutionally compelled by buckley aplt br.at.the secretary also suggests that mcconnell somehow reevaluated buckley.the secretary avers without much explanation,that,a s with the distinction between express advocacy and issue advocacy,the incorporation of a major purpose test into the definition of political committee was an endpoint of statutory interpretation,not a first principle of constitutional law.aplt br.at quoting mcconnell,at.
because the distinction between issue advocacy and express advocacy is not constitutionally compelled,he argues,there is also no required inclusion of the major purpose test.in other words,it is the major purpose of the expenditure and not the major purpose of the organization that is constitutionally significant.aplt reply br.at emphasis supplied.thus,the secretary seems to suggest that the trigger satisfied the major purpose test.
we can not agree with the secretary broad propositions first,there is little question that buckley major purpose test is left unaltered in the wake of mcconnell.see political committee status,definition of contribution,and allocation for separate segregated funds and nonconnected committees,n o change through regulation of the definition of political committee is mandated by the bipartisan campaign reform act,bcra or the supreme court decision in mcconnell.the major purpose test is a judicial construct that limits the reach of the statutory triggers in feca for political committee status.the commission has been applying this construct for many years without additional regulatory definitions,and it will continue to do so in the future.emphasis added right to life,leake,d,in mcconnell,reviewing bcra the major purpose test was not directly examined.thus,the court in mcconnell did not overturn or criticize the major purpose test,and its authority remains in force.see also trevor potter,mcconnell fec jurisprudence and its future impact on campaign finance,miami,t he mcconnell court implicitly affirmed the continuing applicability of the major purpose test when it referred to the major purpose language in the buckley opinion.citing mcconnell,at.quoting buckley,at.hence,we hold that colorado interest in disclosure can be met in a manner less restrictive than imposing the full panoply of regulations that accompany status as a political committee mcfl,at.
second,for substantially the same reasons as the district court,we agree that the trigger,standing alone,can not serve as a proxy for the major purpose test as applied to crlc t he amount of money an organization must accept or spend not substantial and would,as a matter of common sense,operate to encompass a variety of entities based on an expenditure that is insubstantial in relation to their overall budgets.d at.the court added that,under a,an entity that spends on various activities and donates of of its budget to a candidate is deemed a political committee.id.section,as written,is thus unconstitutional as applied to crlc.
narrowing construction 
the secretary maintains that if we hold that the major purpose test survives mcconnell,then definition of political committee as applied to crlc is readily susceptible to a narrowing construction that will remedy any constitutional infirmity presented by the omission of the major purpose test.see aplt br.at citing citizens for responsible gov t state political action comm.davidson,cir.he avers that because colorado definition of political committee is substantially similar to the federal definition,and colorado has used federal campaign law as a template for its campaign laws,should withstand constitutional scrutiny.id.at.
generally,we consider the application of a narrowing construction in the context of a facial challenge.see virginia am.booksellers ass n,d it has long been a tenet of first amendment law that in determining a facial challenge to a statute,if it be readily susceptible to a narrowing construction that would make it constitutional,it will be upheld.citizens for responsible gov t state political action,at.as we later discuss,we decline to reach crlc facial challenge to.however,regardless of whether we characterize the secretary argument as addressing a facial or challenge,we agree with the district court that the statute does not lend itself to a narrowing construction.
to be readily susceptible to a narrowing construction,such a construction must be reasonable and readily apparent.stenberg carhart,d internal quotation marks omitted.w here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems,the court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of congress.edward debartolo.gulf coast constr.trades council,d.thus,we will not rewrite a state law to conform it to constitutional requirements.am.booksellers ass n,at.
here,importantly,we note that article xxviii definition of issue committee includes the very major purpose test at issue,suggesting that the legislature was well aware of buckley requirements when it drafted article xxviii.see id.a issue committee means any person,other than a natural person,or any group of two or more persons,including natural persons t hat has a major purpose of supporting or opposing any ballot issue or ballot question.the inclusion of the major purpose test in a indicates that the decision not to include this requirement in the definition of political committee was deliberate and consistent with the state citizenry intent.because we can not state laws to conform with constitutional requirements where doing so would be inconsistent with legislative,or here,the state citizenry intent,we hold that the district court properly concluded that as applied to crlc could not saved by incorporating a narrowing construction.see bartlett,at cir striking down north carolina campaign finance statute as facially vague and overbroad,noting that the court was unable to excise the word incidental from a statute because t o accept north carolina proffered interpretation would read the references to influencing elections a classic form of issue advocacy right out of the statute.
in its,crlc challenges three sections of article xxviii,and.first,it argues in the alternative,that if we reverse the district court decision that crlc is an mcfl entity,then we must address its facial overbreadth and vagueness challenges to and however,because we hold that crlc meets the mcfl exemption requirements,we need not address this argument.
next,it asks us to consider whether definition of political committee,which the district court declared unconstitutional as applied to crlc,is also facially unconstitutional.facial challenges seek to vindicate not only individual plaintiffs rights but also those of all others who wish to engage in the speech being prohibited.faustin,at.
to succeed,crlc must establish that the law,in every application,creates an impermissible risk of suppression of ideas,such as an ordinance that delegates overly broad discretion to the decisionmaker,and in cases where the ordinance sweeps too broadly,penalizing a substantial amount of speech that is constitutionally protected.forsyth county nationalist movement,d internal citations omitted faustin,at the overbreadth claimant bears the burden of demonstrating from the text of the law and from actual fact,that substantial overbreadth exists.this task presents a heavy burden for the plaintiff.mcconnell,at.
here,the district court determined it need not address crlc facial challenge to.we agree with the general proposition that a court should never formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied,and that the nature of judicial review constrains a federal court to consider only the case that is actually before it.mcconnell,at.citing united states raines,d and james beam distilling georgia,d blackmun,concurring united states treasury employees union,d a lthough the occasional case requires us to entertain a facial challenge in order to vindicate a party right not to be bound by an unconstitutional statute,we neither want nor need to provide relief to nonparties when a narrower remedy will fully protect the litigants.internal citations omitted broadrick oklahoma,d holding that a ruling of facial invalidity is,manifestly,strong medicine and noting that i t has been employed by the court sparingly and only as a last resort.
crlc facial validity argument is succinct because the application of political committee status to groups lacking the requisite major purpose is substantial,the provision ought to be declared unconstitutional on its face as well.aple br.at.we agree with crlc that the application of a to it creates an impermissible risk of the suppression of ideas because it omits the major purpose test and encompasses groups whose incidental purpose may be to engage in express advocacy.bartlett,at.however,without more,we can not say that in every application will be unconstitutional and we decline to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required.mcconnell,at.therefore,we decline to reach crlc facial invalidity challenge.
iii.conclusion 
this case demonstrates the exacting scrutiny a campaign reform act will undergo when it regulates an organization expenditures.here,because crlc is an entity,a and of article xxviii are unconstitutional as applied to it.section a is also unconstitutional as applied to crlc because it does not contain buckley major purpose test.
accordingly,we affirm the district court thorough and order to the extent that it granted summary judgment in part and afforded injunctive relief to crlc,and we dismiss the remainder of crlc.
the people of the state of colorado hereby find and declare that in recent years the advent of significant spending on electioneering communications,as defined herein,has frustrated the purpose of existing campaign finance requirements that independent research has demonstrated that the vast majority of televised electioneering communications goes beyond issue discussion to express electoral advocacy that political contributions from corporate treasuries are not an indication of popular support for the corporation political ideas and can unfairly influence the outcome of colorado elections and that the interests of the public are best served by limiting campaign contributions,encouraging voluntary campaign spending limits,providing full and timely disclosure of campaign contributions,independent expenditures,and funding electioneering communications and strong enforcement of campaign finance.const.art.xxviii.
expressly advocating is not defined in article xxviii.the buckley court defined express advocacy as express terms advocat ing the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office and advertisements that use terminology such as vote for elect,support,cast your ballot for,candidate name for congress,vote against,defeat,and reject.at.buckley adopted the express advocacy requirement to distinguish discussion of issues and candidates from more pointed exhortations to vote for particular persons.mcfl,at.
an electioneering communication is defined asany communication broadcasted by television or radio,printed in a newspaper or on a billboard,directly mailed or delivered by hand to personal residences or otherwise distributed that i unambiguously refers to any candidate and ii is broadcasted,prin
