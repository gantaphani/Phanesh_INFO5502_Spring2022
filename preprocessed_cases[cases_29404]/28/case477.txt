introduction 
petitioner california cannabis coalition,a california nonprofit corporation,and nicole de la rosa and james velez collectively,ccc,appeal judgment entered after the trial court denied ccc petition for writ of mandate writ petition.ccc writ petition requested the trial court to order the city of upland and city clerk,stephanie mendenhall,collectively,the city to hold a special election on ccc medical marijuana dispensary initiative initiative.
ccc contends the trial court erred in ruling ccc initiative could not be voted on during a special election under article xiiic article,section of the california constitution,because the initiative imposes a charge on medical marijuana dispensaries,which in effect is a general tax rather than a regulatory fee.ccc objects to the trial court requiring the initiative to be placed on the next general election ballot,instead of presenting it to the voters earlier by holding a special election.ccc further argues the city council prematurely determined,before the election on the initiative,that the initiative constituted a tax rather than a regulatory fee.
ccc requests this court reverse the trial court judgment and order the trial court to issue a writ of mandate compelling the city to hold a special election on the initiative.ccc suggests,in the interest of expediency,this court treat the instant appeal as a writ petition and directly order the city to call a special election on the initiative,to be consolidated with the june,primary.
we conclude article,section does not apply to ccc initiative.article,sections and refer to taxes imposed by local government.article is silent as to taxes imposed by initiative.article,sections and of the california constitution and elections code sections and,on the other hand,provide the people with initiative powers and state procedures for holding elections on initiatives.under article and elections code section and,the city is required to place the initiative on a special election ballot.the trial court ruling and judgment denying ccc writ petition is therefore reversed,and the trial court is directed to issue a writ of mandate compelling the city to place the initiative on a special ballot in accordance with article,sections and,and elections code sections and.we reject ccc request to treat this appeal as a petition for writ of mandate so that this court can issue a writ directly to the city directing it to place the initiative on the next ballot,because ccc has not cited any persuasive authority,and we are not aware of any,allowing this court to do so.
facts and procedural background 
on march,ccc filed a petition for writ of mandate and motion for peremptory writ of mandate writ motion.the facts alleged in the writ petition are undisputed.ccc alleges in the writ petition the following facts.ccc is a california nonprofit corporation.ccc sponsored and drafted a proposed medical marijuana initiative petition.the key provisions of the initiative are that the initiative would repeal existing city code provisions prohibiting medical marijuana dispensaries and would adopt regulations permitting and establishing standards for the operation of medical marijuana dispensaries within the city.the proposed initiative allows the city to permit a maximum of three medical marijuana dispensaries.an applicant must obtain a business license and applicable city permits.according to the initiative,a medical marijuana dispensary must pay the city an annual licensing and inspection fee of initiative.initiative proponents,nicole de la rosa and james velez,presented the initiative petition to the city.
before circulating the initiative petition,nicole de la rosa and james velez filed with the city a notice of intention to circulate the initiative petition.the city attorney prepared a title and summary for the initiative.thereafter,a notice of intention to circulate the initiative petition was published and circulated.
the initiative requested it be considered at a special election.at least signatures percent of registered voters were needed for the initiative to qualify for a special election,which would be held sooner than the next regular election.the county of san bernardino registrar reported there were signatures on the initiative petition.on february,the city council accepted the county certificate of sufficiency from the san bernardino county registrar of voters and ordered an agency report.
the city agency report 
the agency report dated march,agency report,was prepared jointly by city departments under elections code section,to address the anticipated impacts of the initiative on the city.the agency report concluded the initiative licensing and inspection fee exceeded the estimated actual costs incurred from issuing a license for a medical marijuana dispensary and conducting annual inspections of the dispensary.the city estimated the actual annual costs would total.because the licensing and inspection fee imposed by the initiative exceeded the anticipated costs of licensing and inspection of a medical marijuana dispensary,the city concluded in the agency report that the fee is a general tax,which must be presented to voters at a regularly scheduled election under article.in reaching this conclusion,the city relied on the reports provided by the city departments,which are included in the agency report.
the city attorney reported in the agency report that the annual licensing and inspection fee was a general tax,which under the california constitution,must be submitted to voters at a regularly scheduled election and can not appear on a special election ballot.the development services department development services reported in the agency report that the estimated cost of processing a typical permit for a medical marijuana dispensary was,with an estimated in from additional fees charged for processing the application.development services estimated the annual inspection cost for a single medical marijuana dispensary totaled.development services estimated a medical marijuana dispensary would generate per year in sales tax revenue.
the city administrative services director,stephanie mendenhall,summarized in the agency report the city departments reported costs for obtaining a medical marijuana dispensary permit and for an annual permit inspection as follows.the fire department determined its initial costs for processing a typical medical marijuana dispensary permit would be,with the additional annual cost of for two biannual inspections to ensure compliance with the uniform fire code.development services estimated an initial cost of for processing a typical permit and annually for an annual permit inspection by the building and planning divisions.the total estimated cost for obtaining a medical marijuana permit amounted to.the total estimated cost for annual permit inspections was.mendenhall further reported in the agency report that the estimated cost of a standalone special election was.the estimated cost of placing the initiative on the statewide election regularly scheduled election was.
march,city council meeting 
on march,the city council met.the city received the agency report and the city attorney provided additional information contained in the agency report.the city council discussed whether the initiative licensing and inspection fee is a tax and whether it must be placed on a special or general election ballot.the city council adopted resolution,finding the initiative fee is actually a tax because it exceeds the actual licensing and inspection costs,and the initiative does not specifically provide any legally binding mandate for use of the excess revenue generated from the fee.the excess revenue would thus by default be deposited into the city general fund used for general governmental purposes.the city determined the initiative did not qualify for a special election under elections code sections and,because under article the initiative imposed a general tax.resolution therefore provides notice and direction for ordering the initiative submitted to the voters at the next general election on november.
writ petition allegations 
ccc alleges in its writ petition that the initiative is not subject to article because the initiative fee is not a tax and is not imposed by a local government.rather,if adopted,the initiative fee would be imposed by the voters by initiative.ccc also alleges that,even if the licensing and inspection fee is a tax,the remedy would be to allow the initiative to go on the special election ballot.then,if erroneously approved,the court could strike the initiative or strike only the section imposing the fee.ccc concludes that the city failure to place the initiative on a special ballot therefore violates elections code section.
ccc further alleges the city refuses to allow ccc to participate in any discussion or hearing determining whether the initiative imposes a general tax.in addition,initiative section allegedly is only a minor part of the overall initiative and would only affect the three proposed medical marijuana dispensaries.ccc asserts in its writ petition the city took the position the initiative imposes a general tax because the city is against the initiative.ccc further alleges the city position allegedly is a pretext and serves no legitimate purpose.ccc concludes the city refusal to place the initiative on a special election ballot violates ccc rights under the elections code and california constitution.ccc writ petition therefore requests the trial court to issue a writ of mandate compelling the city and city clerk to place the initiative on a special election ballot in compliance with elections code section.
hearing on writ motion and petition 
the city filed an answer and amended answer to ccc writ petition and opposition to ccc writ motion.the city argued ccc writ motion was premature and procedurally improper,and the initiative imposes a tax,requiring placing the initiative on a general election ballot.the city also lodged materials with the trial court in support of the city opposition to ccc writ motion.the materials included a binder of information entitled marijuana and the drug cartels,and an accountant report dated february,entitled compliance summary checklist for lawful operation of medical marijuana dispensary in the city of upland california accountant report.these materials were submitted to the city council for consideration regarding the initiative during the march,city council meeting.
the accountant report was prepared by new era certified public accountants,llp new era,which specializes in accounting and tax preparation services for medical marijuana dispensaries.the accountant report provided a list of compliance areas,including licensing and permits,and estimated related costs incurred by cities and counties.new era estimated the total annual cost of the enforcement procedures itemized in the accountant report totaled per dispensary,plus an additional annual per dispensary to cover possible fees resulting from a noncompliant dispensary failing to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines,which could lead to revocation or suspension of a license.
on may,the trial court heard oral argument on ccc writ motion.without addressing whether article,section applies to initiatives that impose a tax,the trial court denied ccc writ petition and motion,finding that the fee imposed by the initiative qualified as a tax and therefore the initiative was required to be placed on the next general election ballot.on june,the trial court entered judgment in favor of the city and against ccc on each allegation in ccc writ petition.although ccc filed a premature notice of appeal of the may,ruling before entry of judgment,this court ordered the premature notice of appeal construed as an appeal of the judgment.
the appeal is not moot 
generally,an appeal will be dismissed as moot when any ruling by this court can have no practical impact or provide the parties effectual relief.citation.citations.alliance for a better downtown millbrae wade th,wade.this case presents an actual controversy.
the parties agree that ccc appeal is not moot.see jeffrey superior court th.however,by the time this decision becomes final,it may be too late to place the initiative on the june ballot.ccc has requested,and this court granted on january,expedited review and calendar preference.even if it is too late to place the initiative on the june,election ballot,this appeal would not be moot because the issue will remain as to whether article applies to the initiative.
standard of review 
when reviewing the trial court ruling denying ccc petition for a writ of mandate to compel a special election on the initiative,this court need only review the record to determine whether the trial court findings are supported by substantial evidence.citations.however,we review questions of law independently.citation.where,as here,the facts are undisputed and the issue involves statutory interpretation,we exercise our independent judgment and review the matter de novo.citation.wade,supra,th at.the issues raised here,of whether imposition of the initiative fee is a tax or a fee and whether pursuant to article,section,the initiative must be placed on a special election ballot,are questions of law for this court to decide on an independent review of the facts.weisblat city of san diego th,weisblat.the construction of a statute or an initiative,including the resolution of any ambiguity,is a question of law that we review de novo.schmeer county of los angeles th,schmeer.
law applicable to writs of mandate 
a challenge to ministerial acts by local officials under code of civil procedure section,may be brought by a petition for writ of mandate.to obtain such a writ,the petitioner must show a clear,present,ministerial duty on the part of the respondent and a correlative clear,present,and beneficial right in the petitioner to the performance of that duty.citations.wade,supra,th at.the city clerk act of placing ccc initiative on a general or special election ballot qualifies as a ministerial duty because it is an act that a public officer is obligated to perform in a prescribed manner required by law when a given state of facts exists.id.at.
issuance of a writ of mandate is not necessarily a matter of right.county of san diego state of california th.rather,issuance of a writ of mandate lies within the discretion of the court.however,where one has a substantial right to protect or enforce,which may be accomplished by such a writ,and there is no other plain,speedy and adequate remedy,the petitioner is entitled as a matter of right to the writ.ibid.it would be an abuse of discretion to refuse it.ibid.
article does not apply to ccc initiative 
ccc contends that,even assuming the fee imposed by the initiative qualifies as a tax,article,section does not apply because article is limited to taxes imposed by government,not by initiative.therefore article does not preclude the initiative from being placed on a special election ballot under elections code sections and.
laws applicable to placing a measure on an election ballot 
article,sections and,and elections code sections and instruct on placing an initiative on an election ballot.article provides voting requirements for taxes imposed by local government.
elections code section 
elections code section provides that,if the initiative petition is signed by not less than percent of the voters of the city according to the last report of registration by the county elections official to the secretary of state and contains a request that the ordinance be submitted immediately to a vote of the people at a special election,the legislative body shall do one of the following 
a adopt the ordinance,without alteration,at the regular meeting at which the certification of the petition is presented,or within days after it is presented.
b immediately order a special election,to be held pursuant to subdivision a of section,at which the ordinance,without alteration,shall be submitted to a vote of the voters of the city.
c order a report pursuant to section at the regular meeting at which the certification of the petition is presented.when the report is presented to the legislative body,the legislative body shall either adopt the ordinance within days or order an election pursuant to subdivision b.
in the instant case,the initiative petition was signed by over percent of the city voters,thereby qualifying the initiative for placement on a special election ballot under elections code section.the city council ordered a report pursuant to section,on the impact of the initiative on the city.after the city agency report was presented to the city,the city ordered a regular election,instead of a special election.
propositions,and 
the city argues the initiative imposes a general tax and therefore elections code section is superseded by article,which requires the initiative to be placed on the next regularly scheduled general election,on november.article,was enacted when voters passed proposition in,to implement proposition,the predecessor initiative that voters passed in to constrain the taxation powers of state and local government.weisblat,supra,th at,schmeer,supra,th at.
determining whether a fee or levy is a tax has been a recurring task since when california voters added article xiiia,commonly known as the jarvis gann property tax initiative or proposition,to our state constitution.citations.the purpose of the initiative was to assure effective real property tax relief.weisblat,supra,th at.article,section restricts local taxes and permits local governmental entities to impose special taxes only if approved by a vote of the electorate.weisblat,at.unlike taxes,fees are not subject to the voter approval limitation of article,section.id.at.the california supreme court in sinclair paint state bd.of equalization cal th sinclair,noted that a tax has no fixed meaning,and that the distinction between taxes and fees is frequently blurred,taking on different meanings in different contexts.citations.id.at italics added.

article,sections and 
section a of article,added by proposition,provides that all taxes imposed by any local government shall be deemed to be either general taxes or special taxes.article,section a defines general tax as any tax imposed for general governmental purposes that is,when its revenues are placed into the general fund and are available for expenditure for any and all governmental purposes.citation.howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th.under article,section b of proposition,n o local government may impose,extend,or increase any general tax until the matter is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote,subd.b.

construing voter initiatives 
here,the dispositive issue is whether article applies to the initiative,which imposes a fee.we need not reach the issue of whether the fee is a tax under article because,regardless,article,section does not apply to the initiative.this is because article,section is limited to taxes imposed by local government and is silent as to imposing a tax by initiative.
in construing article,we are required to apply the same principles governing the construction of a statute.schmeer,supra,th at.our task is to ascertain the intent of the electorate so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.we first examine the language of the initiative as the best indicator of the voters intent.citation.we give the words of the initiative their ordinary and usual meaning and construe them in the context of the entire scheme of law of which the initiative is a part,so that the whole may be harmonized and given effect.citations.if the language is unambiguous and a literal construction would not result in absurd consequences,we presume that the voters intended the meaning on the face of the initiative and the plain meaning governs.citations.if the language is ambiguous,we may consider the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet as extrinsic evidence of the voters intent and understanding of the initiative.citation.id.at.
is the initiative subject to article,section 
ccc argues that article does not apply to the initiative because it is limited to taxes imposed by local government.we agree.article,section e defines a tax as any levy,charge,or exaction of any kind imposed by a local government,subject to seven specified exceptions,e italics added.article,section e does not expressly include fees imposed by initiative.because article is silent in this regard,we decline to construe article as applying to taxes imposed by initiative.
the city relies on howard jarvis taxpayers city of la habra cal th la habra for the proposition a tax imposed by local government refers to,not only enactment of a tax by local government,but also its continuing collection by and payment to a local government.but la habra is not on point.it concerns proposition,which in,added government code sections and these provisions address taxes imposed by government without voter approval,before proposition took effect,which the city continues to collect.
in la habra,supra,cal th,the city adopted an ordinance establishing a utility users tax to raise revenue for general government purposes.the la habra court held the statute of limitations had not run on the petitioner challenge to the city of la habra continuing collection of a tax without obtaining voter approval of the tax.in reaching its holding,the court stated in la habra that the city allegedly illegal actions include not only the ordinance initial enactment,but also the city continued collection,through the agency of the service providers,of an unapproved tax.government code section,moreover,provides a remedy against a city continued collection of a tax that has not been approved by the voters,requiring the responsible county official to withhold property tax transfers in a dollar amount equal to the illegal collections.clearly the intent of proposition enactors was not merely to preclude enactment of a tax ordinance without voter approval,but to preclude continued imposition or collection of such a tax as well.la habra,supra,cal th at italics added.
in la habra,supra,cal th at pages,the court further explained t he city appears to contend that proposition can be violated only at the time a tax ordinance is first enacted because,in the city view,all proposition prohibits is imposition of a tax without voter approval,and imposition is limited to the time of initial enactment.both premises are faulty.government code section,subdivision b,which governs taxes imposed prior to the measure passage,provides that no such tax shall continue to be imposed without a vote within two years of the measure effective date,and that a taxing jurisdiction that fails to obtain a majority vote shall cease to impose such tax on and after november.clearly,in this provision,imposition is not limited to the time of initial enactment,and nothing in proposition suggests that it was used in a more restricted sense in government code section,the prohibitory provision at issue here.government code section,moreover,provides a remedy against a city continued collection of a tax that has not been approved by the voters,requiring the responsible county official to withhold property tax transfers in a dollar amount equal to the illegal collections.clearly the intent of proposition enactors was not merely to preclude enactment of a tax ordinance without voter approval,but to preclude continued imposition or collection of such a tax as well.italics added.
the instant case is distinguishable from la habra.la habra is founded on proposition and statutory language that expressly prohibits,not only taxes imposed by government without voter approval,but also taxes imposed by local government before adoption of proposition,which the government has continued to impose without obtaining voter approval of the taxes.there is no similar language in proposition article or proposition,from which this court can reasonably infer propositions and are intended to encompass taxes local government collects after they have been imposed by initiative,in which there has been voter approval.
the purpose and intent of propositions and is to limit the power of local governments to impose taxes by imposing voting requirements.section of proposition required that the provisions of the act be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.citation.weisblat,supra,th at,quoting pajaro,supra,th at and bay area cellular,supra,th at italics added see howard jarvis taxpayers city of riverside th.as explained in howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,in adopting proposition adding article,the people found and declared that proposition was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases.however,local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax,assessment,fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases,but also threaten the economic security of all californians and the california economy itself.this measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.italics added.
likewise,the purpose of proposition,which amended article by adding section e,was to curb the perceived problem of a proliferation of regulatory fees imposed by the state without a vote of the legislature or imposed by local governments without the voters approval by defining a tax to include any levy,charge,or exaction of any kind imposed by the state or a local government,with specified exceptions.schmeer,supra,th at italics added.as stated in proposition findings and declarations of purpose,proposition was passed in response to the recent phenomenon whereby the legislature and local governments have disguised new taxes as fees in order to extract even more revenue from california taxpayers without having to abide by these constitutional voting requirements.fees couched as regulatory but which exceed the reasonable costs of actual regulation or are simply imposed to raise revenue for a new program and are not part of any licensing or permitting program are actually taxes and should be subject to the limitations applicable to the imposition of taxes.ballot,text of,subd.e,see weisblat,supra,th at.proposition further states that,i n order to ensure the effectiveness of these constitutional limitations,this measure also defines a tax for state and local purposes so that neither the legislature nor local governments can circumvent these restrictions on increasing taxes by simply defining new or expanded taxes as fees.ballot,text of,subd.f,see weisblat,supra,th at.
taxation imposed by initiative is not taxation imposed by local government.we do not construe the term impose to include,not only creating or enacting a tax,but also collecting or receiving tax proceeds after the tax has been enacted.the dictionary defines impose as to establish.ponderosa homes,city of san ramon th,ponderosa,citing webster third internat.dict,in construing impose as used in the mitigation fee act see proposition implementation guide,september edition,by the league of cities,found at and proposition implementation guide,april,by the league of cities,found at.webster new world dictionary defines impose as to place or set a burden,tax,fine,on or upon as by authority.webster new world dict.college ed.
although not binding authority,the proposition implementation guide,citing ponderosa,supra,th at,discusses the meaning of the term impose,as follows by its terms,proposition applies only to fees that are imposed by government.fees imposed by private parties like telephone charges and many solid waste collection fees are not within the scope of proposition.moreover,many fees collected by local governments are not imposed by them,either because local government is collecting a fee imposed by the state or because the fee is voluntarily paid.courts can be expected to rely,as they have in similar contexts,on the dictionary meaning of impose,which is to establish or apply by authority or force.proposition implementation guide,april,by the league of cities,found at.
in ponderosa,supra,th,the court addressed the question of whether the imposition of fees in ponderosa occurred when the city first set the traffic mitigation fees as a condition on its tentative subdivision map approval,or when ponderosa paid an installment on the fees already required by the city.id.at.ponderosa homes,ponderosa homes argued that no cause of action protesting development project fees government code section accrues until the challenged fee is paid,because section,subdivision a establishes as the two prerequisites for a fee protest both the tender of the required payment in full and written notice that the payment is being tendered under protest.ponderosaat.the ponderosa court disagreed,stating the phrase to impose is generally defined to mean to establish or apply by authority or force,as in to impose a tax.webster third new internat.dict.there is a logical distinction between the act of imposing something and the act of complying with that which has been imposed.as applicable here,the phrase refers to the creation of a condition or fee by authority of local government it is not synonymous with the act of complying with that condition or fee.just as creation is different from compliance,so is imposition of a fee different from payment thereof.ponderos
