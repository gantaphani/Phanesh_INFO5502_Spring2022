three officials of the virginia state board of elections collectively,the board appeal a district court order holding that virginia open primary law,ann,is unconstitutional as applied to the senatorial district republican committee and its chairman,larry miller and enjoining the board from requiring the committee to hold an open primary in virginia senatorial district in.the committee another portion of that order holding that is not facially unconstitutional.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court order in its entirety.
on june,the republican party of virginia amended its plan of organization plan to allow its affiliated committees,of which the committee is one,to exclude from the republican nomination process any voter who participated in the nomination process of another party in virginia after march,or in the last five years,whichever is more recent.the plan provides an exception for voters who,in writing,renounce their affiliation with any other party,indicate their agreement with republican party principles,and express their intent to support republican nominees.the amended plan became effective on june.
the committee oversees the nomination process for the republican candidate for the district seat in the senate of virginia.stephen martin,a republican,currently holds the seat and is running for reelection this year.under virginia law,an incumbent state legislator is entitled to select the method of nomination for his seat.see ann.b.virginia allows nomination of candidates not only by a is conducted and funded by the also by methods other than a primary.ann.such other methods,which are conducted and funded by the party,include but are not limited to a party convention,see ann.ii a mass meeting,also known as a caucus and a party canvass or unassembled caucus,also called a firehouse primary.
in august,senator martin designated a primary as the method of nomination in the district for the election.in accordance with senator martin designation,the committee,on january,formally recognized that a primary would be used to select its nominee.consistent with the amendments to the plan,the committee chose to exclude voters who had voted in a democratic party primary between march,and june,the date of the republican primary,except those voters who complied with the written loyalty requirements of the plan.in a letter dated january,miller informed the board of the committee decision.his letter requested written confirmation of the board intention to implement the restrictions on the participation by democrats in our primary.
on february,the board secretary,jean jensen,replied to miller by letter.jensen stated that the committee could take whatever action it deemed appropriate under the plan.jensen noted,however,that the only provision of virginia law allowing political parties to restrict primary voters eligibility was the statute governing presidential primaries.see ann.a.further,jensen cited virginia open primary law,ann,which provides 
all persons qualified to vote,pursuant to ann.through,may vote at the primary.no person shall vote for the candidates of more than one party.
jensen explained that unless the committee could point to a specific provision of virginia election law authorizing the board to restrict voting in the district primary,the board would have to comply with the law of the commonwealth in effect at that time.
the committee subsequently brought this action against the board under west,seeking a declaration that violates the committee first and fourteenth amendment right of free association.the board moved to dismiss,arguing,inter alia,that the committee lacked standing and that the case was not yet ripe.the district court granted the board motion to dismiss on standing and ripeness grounds.see miller brown,d.we reversed,holding that the committee possessed standing and that the case was ripe.see miller brown,cir.we thus remanded for consideration of the merits.id.at.
on remand,the committee moved for summary judgment,arguing that was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the committee.the committee also moved for a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of the statute.after a hearing,the district court held that the open primary law was not facially unconstitutional because virginia law permitted other methods of nomination under which a political party could restrict participation in its nominating process to voters who share its political beliefs.see miller brown,d.regarding the challenge,however,the court determined that severely burdened the committee associational rights because senator martin selection of a primary as the method of nomination forced the committee to use a nomination process that prevented it from excluding voters with whom it did not wish to associate.see id.at.the court further held that the board had provided no compelling state interest justifying this burden.see id.at.the court thus concluded that was unconstitutional as applied to the committee.see id.at.accordingly,the court enjoined the board from requiring the committee to hold an open primary in.see id.on the board motion,the district court stayed the injunction pending the outcome of this appeal.see id.at.
we review de novo the district court rulings concerning the constitutionality of see united states fulks,cir,cert.denied,d.in considering a constitutional challenge to a state election law,we first examine whether the law burdens rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments.eu san francisco county democratic cent,d.if the law at issue burdens the rights of political parties and their members,it can survive constitutional scrutiny only if the state shows that it advances a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.id.citations omitted.
we first address the committee claim that the open primary law is facially unconstitutional.the committee argues that impermissibly burdens the right of political parties to associate freely with others who share their political beliefs.the committee contends that by requiring a party to include in its primary voters who may not share its views,the open primary law alters the party candidate selection process and the political message that the party conveys to the public.
the supreme court has made clear that the first amendment protects the freedom to join together in furtherance of common political beliefs.cal.democratic party jones,d quoting tashjian republican party of,d.in particular,the court has vigorously affirm ed the special place the first amendment reserves for,and the special protection it accords,the process by which a political party select s a standard bearer who best represents the party ideologies and preferences.id.at.quoting eu,at.second alteration in original.the court has also recognized that a corollary of the right to associate is the right not to associate.id.at.freedom of association would prove an empty guarantee if associations could not limit control over their decisions to those who share the interests and persuasions that underlie the association being.democratic party of the united states wisconsin ex rel.la follette,d internal quotation marks omitted.and,i n no area is the political association right to exclude more important than in the process of selecting its nominee.jones,at.
the supreme court has applied these principles in a series of decisions involving state primary statutes.in la follette,the court held that the state of wisconsin could not compel the national democratic party to seat at its convention delegates selected in wisconsin open presidential primary when the voters in that primary did not declare their party affiliation,as required by democratic party rules.see id.at.the court concluded that requiring the party to seat delegates selected in violation of party rules would impose a substantial burden on the party associational freedom,and that the state had not articulated a compelling interest justifying this burden.see id.at.the court stressed that the freedom to associate for the common advancement of political beliefs necessarily presupposes the freedom to identify the people who constitute the association,and to limit the association to those people only.id.at.citation internal quotation marks omitted.further,the court recognized that the inclusion of persons unaffiliated with a political party may seriously distort its collective impairing the party essential therefore political parties may protect themselves from intrusion by those with adverse political principles.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in tashjian,the court considered the constitutionality of a connecticut statute requiring voters in any political party primary to be registered members of that party.see tashjian,at.the republican party of connecticut had adopted a rule permitting independent voters not affiliated with any vote in republican primaries.see id.at.the party challenged the state voter eligibility statute on the ground that it violated the party right to associate politically with individuals of its choosing.see id.at.the court held that the statute burdened the party associational rights because it restricted the group of voters whom the party could invite to participate in the basic function of selecting the party candidates.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the statute,the court explained,limit ed the party associational opportunities at the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common principles may be translated into concerted action,and hence to political power in the community.id.at.and,the court held that the state had offered no compelling justification for this burden.see id.at.the court thus concluded that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the party.see id.at.
in jones,the court addressed the constitutionality of california blanket primary system,in which each voter primary ballot lists every candidate regardless of party affiliation and allows the voter to choose freely among them,with the candidate of each party who wins the most votes becoming the nominee of that party for the general election.jones,at.various political parties,each of which had adopted a rule prohibiting nonmembers from voting in the party primary,challenged the blanket primary law on the ground that it violated their associational rights.see id.at.the court agreed that the law impermissibly burdened the parties right of free association,emphasizing that it forces political parties to associate have their nominees,and hence their positions,determined who,at best,have refused to affiliate with the party,and,at worst,have expressly affiliated with a rival.id.at.the court could conceive of no heavier burden on a political party associational freedom.id.at.further,the court concluded that the state had offered no compelling interest warranting this severe burden.see id.at.
by contrast,in clingman beaver,d,the court rejected a first amendment challenge to oklahoma semiclosed primary system,which allowed a political party to invite only its own members and voters registered as independents to vote in the party primary.see id.at.the libertarian party of oklahoma lpo and several republican and democratic voters brought the action after the state refused the lpo request to open its primary to all voters without regard to party affiliation.see id.at.the court distinguished the oklahoma primary law from the one struck down in tashjian,which prevented a party from allowing independent voters to participate in its primary.see id.at.the court noted that the oklahoma law only prevented the lpo from associating with voters who had already affiliated publicly with another party.see id.at.the court thus held that the semiclosed primary system imposed only a minor burden on the lpo associational rights,and that the state had advanced important regulatory interests justifying that burden.see id.at.
here,we need not decide whether virginia open primary statute,viewed in isolation,impermissibly burdens a political party right to associate with those who share its beliefs.that is because it is clear that properly viewed in the context of other methods of nomination permitted by virginia not facially burden political parties associational rights.
as explained above,virginia allows political parties to nominate candidates not only by primary but also by other methods controlled and funded by the party.and,by merely choosing any of these other options,a party is free to limit its candidate selection process to voters who share its political views.thus,the forced association that the supreme court has condemned,jones,at,simply is not present here.indeed,neither of the two supreme court decisions holding primary laws unconstitutional involved a statute that represented only one of several options for candidate nomination.see id.at.indicating that under california law,political parties could only nominate candidates through primaries tashjian,at.explaining that although political parties in connecticut used conventions to select a candidate,any candidate not endorsed by the party but who received at least percent of the votes at the convention could challenge the candidate in a primary.we agree with the district court that it is constitutionally significant that the primary laws in those cases were both mandatory and exclusive.miller,d at.
the committee nevertheless argues that because virginia allows political parties to select their candidates by primary,a party has a constitutional right to restrict participation in the primary to persons of its choosing.but as the district court emphasized,a party has no constitutional right even to select its nominees by primary.see am.party of white,d holding that states may dictate the method by which political parties select their nominees.further,while the committee argues that a primary has certain advantages over other forms of as reduced cost to the party and broader exposure of party candidates to the is no constitutional requirement that virginia hold a primary at all.and,again,a party is free to select from various methods of nomination in which it can exclude voters who do not share its a closed primary conducted and funded by the party it is only when the party chooses to hold a primary operated and funded by the state that it must allow all voters to participate.
in sum,because virginia makes available to political parties multiple options for restricting their candidate selection process to individuals of their choosing,the refusal by the state to fund and operate a closed primary does not burden parties right of association.see miller,d at holding that s ection is constitutionally sound when engrafted onto a statutory scheme providing for alternative,less restrictive means of candidate selection.we therefore affirm the holding of the district court that is facially constitutional.
we next consider the board contention that the district court erred in holding unconstitutional as applied to the committee.the district court found that senator martin selection of a primary as the method of nomination pursuant to b force d the committee to conduct a mandatory open primary for the selection of the party candidate.id.at.and,relying on language from our prior opinion in this case,the court determined that the type of forced association caused by a mandatory open primary causes significant injury to the first amendment rights of a political party.see miller,at discussing,in context of standing analysis,constitutional injuries suffered by committee as a result of open primary law.further,applying strict scrutiny,the court held that the various state interests offered by the board in support of the open primary law were not compelling.see miller,d at.the court thus concluded that w hile survives facial constitutional challenge,it is constitutionally infirm as applied to the narrow facts of this case.id.at.
the board does not challenge the conclusion of the district court that forcing the committee to select its candidate through an open primary severely burdens its right of free association.indeed,the board concedes that if a political party is compelled to select its candidates by means of a primary,the state may not force the party to include voters in that primary.opening br.at see miller,d at noting that the board
