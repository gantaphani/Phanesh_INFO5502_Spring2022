proponents of a petition to recall a local mayor disputed the validity of requests by voters to withdraw their signatures from the petition that were filed with the city clerk and honored by the county registrar,because the requests lacked a declaration of a circulator,and in some instances,the voter signed the petition after filing the request.the city clerk filed an action for declaratory relief against the county registrar,naming the recall proponents and the mayor as real parties in interest.the recall proponents filed a for declaratory relief and a writ of mandate.the trial court declared that a request to withdraw a signature under elections code sections or must be accompanied by a declaration of circulator as provided in elections code section,and is ineffective as to a subsequent signature.the trial court issued a writ of mandate to the city clerk to certify the petition as sufficient.in a subsequent order,the trial court awarded attorney fees to the recall proponents under code of civil procedure section as against the county registrar and the city clerk.the county registrar appeals from the judgment and the order awarding attorney fees,contending that the trial court interpretation of the statutory requirements for withdrawal of a petition is incorrect.the city clerk appeals from the order awarding attorney fees on other grounds.
we conclude the appeal is moot as to the portion of the judgment issuing the writ of mandate,because the recall election has been held.however,the appeal is not moot as to the declaratory relief provided,because the recall proponents status as the successful parties for purposes of an award of attorney fees depends on the propriety of the trial court ruling on the merits.we hold that under the plain language of sections and,a request to withdraw a signature from a recall petition is effective,without regard to whether the voter signs the petition before or after signing the request,as long as the request is filed with the appropriate election official prior to the filing of the petition.we further hold that a voter request to withdraw his or her signature from a recall petition is not a petition or paper that requires the signature of a circulator under section.therefore,the withdrawal requests at issue in this case were valid,and the city clerk initial certification of the recall petition as insufficient was correct.the recall proponents should not have been found to be successful parties.we reverse the judgment and the order awarding attorney fees as to both the county registrar and the city clerk.
facts and procedural background

the total number of valid signatures was less than the number required to qualify the petition.on march,the clerk sent a notice to citizens stating that the number of signatures found sufficient was and the number required to qualify a recall for the ballot was.accordingly,the clerk deemed the recall petition to be insufficient and stated that no action shall be taken on the petition.

legal proceedings 
on august,the clerk filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the registrar.the complaint named citizens,its president and,individual proponents of the recall petition,and the mayor as the real parties in interest.the clerk sought a declaration of the respective duties of the clerk and the registrar to review the disputed signatures and withdrawal requests,and to correct errors in the signature verification process.

discussion 
effect of election 
we first address whether as a result of the recall election,the registrar appeal from the judgment is moot.we conclude that it is not.
a case is moot when any ruling by this court can have no practical impact or provide the parties effectual relief.citation.woodward park homeowners garreks,th,d.a matter is considered moot if,as a result of changed circumstances,its determination by declaratory relief will no longer significantly affect the legal relations of the parties.citation.redwood coast watersheds alliance state bd.of forestry fire protection th,d.a n action which originally was based upon a justiciable controversy can not be maintained on appeal if all the questions have become moot by subsequent acts or events.a reversal in such a case would be without practical effect,and the appeal will therefore be dismissed.citations.environmental coalition of orange county,local agency formation com.d.
however,i f an action involves a matter of continuing public interest and the issue is likely to recur,a court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue,even though an event occurring during its pendency would normally render the matter moot.citations.californians for fair on superior court th,d.

standard of review 
whether a determination is proper in an action for declaratory relief is a matter within the trial court discretion and the court decision to grant or deny relief will not be disturbed on appeal unless it be clearly shown that the discretion was abused.citations.application group,hunter group,th,d.however,we review questions of law independently.citation.where,as here,the facts are undisputed and the issue involves statutory interpretation,we exercise our independent judgment and review the matter de novo.citation.alliance for a better downtown millbrae wade th,d reviewing judgment on petition for writ of mandate under code civ.
our fundamental task in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d,coalition.our first step is to examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.id.at,d.
when the plain language of the statute does not resolve the interpretive question,we proceed to the second step of our inquiry.at this stage,we may turn to rules or maxims of construction which serve as aids in the sense that they express familiar insights about conventional language usage.citations.in addition,i f the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.citations.citation.ailanto properties,city of half moon bay th,d.

withdrawal requests dated prior to signatures on petition 
the registrar contends that a voter request to withdraw his or her signature from a recall petition is effective under sections and even if the voter signed the request before signing the petition.citizens argue that a voter can not withdraw a signature on a petition before the signature is in existence.the registrar interpretation of the statute is correct.
section states any voter who has signed an initiative,referendum or recall petition pursuant to the constitution or laws of this state shall have his or her signature withdrawn from the petition upon filing a written request therefor with the appropriate county elections official or city elections official prior to the day the petition is filed.
section similarly provides any voter who has signed a recall petition shall have his or her signature withdrawn from the petition upon filing a written request therefor with the elections official prior to the day the petition section bearing the voter signature is filed.
the only operative dates in sections and are the date that the withdrawal request is filed and the date that the petition is filed.the only timing requirement under the plain language of the statute is that the withdrawal request must be filed prior to the date that the petition is filed.if a withdrawal request is filed prior to the filing of the recall petition,the voter signature on the recall petition may not be counted.neither statute states that the withdrawal request must be signed after the petition is signed.whether the petition is signed before or after the withdrawal request is not a consideration under the plain language of the statute,as long as the request is filed prior to the date that the petition is filed.
citizens argument that a request to withdraw a signature from a recall petition should not be effective unless the petition was signed before the request has superficial appeal,but upon closer scrutiny this interpretation requires adding words to se
