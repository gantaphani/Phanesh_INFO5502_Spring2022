the chair of the republican party of texas rpt declared representative tom delay ineligible for election to the congressional district of texas.after the rpt declared delay ineligible,but before the secretary of state removed his name from the ballot,the texas democratic party tdp sought an injunction to prevent the removal of his name and to prevent the rpt from replacing delay with a new candidate.the district court granted the injunction,holding that the rpt,through its leadership,created an unconstitutional residency requirement.we affirm on the constitutional grounds enumerated by the district court and also affirm on the alternative state law ground that the declaration violated the texas election code.
facts and procedural background 
on june,defendant tina benkiser,the chairwoman of the rpt,declared delay ineligible for reelection as the united states representative for texas district.she acted under the texas election code provision that allows a party chair to declare a candidate ineligible.ann.f vernon.delay had represented the district since and had won the republican primary in march.delay,however,announced on april,that he would resign from congress and not seek reelection.benkiser declared delay ineligible after receiving a letter from him advising her that he had moved to virginia the letter,dated may,included copies of delay virginia driver license,virginia voter registration,and employment withholding form reflecting virginia as his residence.it is undisputed that benkiser intended to replace delay on the ballot with a new candidate chosen by the rpt.
the tdp filed this suit in texas state court on june,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.the rpt removed the case to federal court,where on june,the court held a hearing on the merits.after receiving briefs from both parties,the district court held that benkiser declaration of delay ineligibility violated the qualifications clause of the constitution.the court granted a permanent injunction that barred benkiser from declaring delay ineligible and certifying to the texas secretary of state any candidate for the district other than delay.the court also declared that delay is not ineligible to be the republican party nominee and voided benkiser previous declaration.finally,it prohibited the secretary of state from removing delay name from the ballot for the general election unless delay withdraws.the rpt appeals,arguing that the tdp lacks standing and that the district court erred in granting the injunction against benkiser.
ii.standard of review 
the district court interpretation of the qualifications clause is reviewed de novo.see united states osborne,cir.other legal issues,including questions of state statutory interpretation,also are reviewed de novo.see stephens witco,cir.we accept the district court findings of fact unless clearly erroneous.hughes training cook,cir.its decision to grant a permanent injunction after its decision on the merits is reviewed for abuse of discretion.mcclure ashcroft,cir.
iii.discussion 
a.the tdp has standing 
before addressing the merits of this appeal,we must determine whether the tdp has standing to sue.to satisfy the standing requirement,a plaintiff must show an injury in fact that is traceable to the defendant challenged conduct and that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision in the district court.lujan defenders of wildlife,d mccall dretke,cir.we hold that the tdp has both direct and associational standing.
the tdp has direct standing 
first,the tdp has direct standing because delay replacement would cause it economic loss.the district court found that the tdp would suffer an injury in fact because it would need to raise and expend additional funds and resources to prepare a new and different campaign in a short time frame.democratic party benkiser,wl.july,hereinafter dist.op.this finding of financial injury is not clearly erroneous because it is supported by testimony in the record.in addition,economic injury is a quintessential injury upon which to base standing,barlow collins,d 
the rpt argues,however,that the tdp should be expected to absorb any additional costs that a replacement candidate would cause in order to promote the state interest in voter choice.in addition,the rpt points out that its own candidate will have to put together a campaign in a short period of time.these fairness arguments have no place in the standing analysis.indeed,the rpt briefs confuse the issue of whether the tdp has shown an injury in fact with the different question of whether the tdp has a cause of action.the cases the rpt cites to support its fairness arguments were themselves decided on the merits in short,regardless of the equities in this case,injury to the tdp proverbial pocketbook is an injury in fact for standing purposes.
turning to causation and redressability,the rpt declaration of ineligibility and replacement of delay with a different candidate would be a cause of the tdp having to expend additional money on a new campaign strategy.and the district court injunction prevents the declaration of ineligibility and replacement,thereby redressing the tdp injury.
a second basis for the tdp direct standing is harm to its election prospects.the tdp witnesses testified below that if the rpt were permitted to replace delay with a more viable candidate,then its congressional candidate chances of victory would be reduced.in addition,according to the tdp,democratic candidates,like county commissioners and judges,would suffer due to the change effect on voter turnout and volunteer efforts.the rpt contends that these harms do not amount to an injury in fact.voluminous persuasive authority shows otherwise we find these cases persuasive because a political party interest in a candidate success is not merely an ideological interest.political victory accedes power to the winning party,enabling it to better direct the machinery of government toward the party interests.see storer brown,d.while power may be less tangible than money,threatened loss of that power is still a concrete and particularized injury sufficient for standing purposes.
having found injury in fact in the tdp threatened loss of political power,we also find causation and redressability.the injury threatened to the tdp electoral prospects is fairly traceable to delay replacement and likely would be redressed by a favorable decision,which would preclude a republican replacement candidate.
the tdp has associational standing 
in addition,the tdp has associational standing on behalf of its candidate associational standing is a test the association members would independently meet the article iii standing requirements the interests the association seeks to protect are germane to the purpose of the organization and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires participation of individual members.see hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d.
here,nick lampson,the democratic party candidate for delay house seat,would have standing for similar reasons that the tdp has direct standing.the rpt actions threaten his election prospects and campaign coffers.persuasive authorities establish that such injuries are sufficient to give a candidate standing to protest the action causing the harm.see krislov rednour,cir fulani hogsett,cir fulani league of women voters educ.fund,cir.in short,the first element of associational standing is satisfied.
with respect to the second element of associational standing,the tdp undoubtedly seeks to protect its organizational interests.as the supreme court has noted,the goal of a political party is to gain control of government by getting its candidates elected.see storer,at.
as to hunt third element,nothing requires the participation of lampson himself.lampson interests are fully represented by the tdp after the primary election,a candidate steps into the shoes of his party,and their interests are identical.as well,the type of relief sought,an injunction,will inure to lampson benefit.see int l union brock,d.in sum,the tdp has standing to sue on lampson behalf under hunt.
for the foregoing reasons,the tdp had standing to raise its claims before the district court 
benkiser acts effectively created a inhabitancy requirement and so violated the constitution 
constitutional and statutory provisions at issue 
the question before this court centers on the texas statute permitting a party officer to declare a candidate ineligible.ann.an officer can do so if a candidate application for a place on the ballot indicates ineligibility or facts indicating that the candidate is ineligible are conclusively established by another public record.id.at f if the public record establishes ineligibility,the officer shall declare the candidate ineligible.id.at g.if the candidate is declared ineligible on or before the day before the election,the candidate name is removed from the ballot.id.at.the party can fill the vacancy with a replacement candidate if the new candidate is certified to the secretary of state by of the day before the election.id.at a.in situations such as the one before this court,a replacement candidate can not appear on the ballot if the original candidate merely withdraws.see id.at b.
the district court held that the ineligibility statute as applied in the present case violates the constitution qualifications clause by creating a residency requirement see const,cl.the qualifications clause states 
no person shall be a representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years,and been seven years a citizen of the united states,and who shall not,when elected,be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen.
id.the rpt argues that the statute is constitutional under the elections clause because it merely acts as a procedural regulation.see id.at,cl.the elections clause states 
the times,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations,except as to the places of chusing senators.
benkiser declaration is unconstitutional as applied under the qualifications clause 
as the parties agree,the qualifications clause is exclusive and can not be enlarged by the states term limits,thornton,d t he text and structure of the constitution,the relevant historical materials,and,most importantly,the basic principles of our democratic system all demonstrate that the qualifications clauses were intended to preclude the states from exercising any such power and to fix as exclusive the qualifications in the constitution.the plain language of the inhabitancy requirement of the qualifications clause shows that a candidate for the house of representatives must only be an inhabitant of the state when elected.const,cl.
moreover,there is ample evidence suggesting that the framers deliberately chose to use the when elected language.as explained by the district court,records from the constitutional convention show that the framers debated whether to include lengthy inhabitancy requirements.the records of the federal convention of,at max farrand.delegates considered,and requirements and rejected all three.id.the position is further buttressed by an case in which congress considered the election of a representative who moved to maryland a mere two weeks before the election.cases of contested elections in congress clarke hall eds.discussing sundry electors key,case xxviii.congress found that the representative was qualified,given that he was an inhabitant of the state as of election day.id.at.
when benkiser reviewed the public records sent by delay and concluded that his residency in virginia made him ineligible,she unconstitutionally created a inhabitancy requirement.the qualifications clause only requires inhabitancy when that candidate is elected.given this language,benkiser could not constitutionally find that delay was ineligible on june,the date she made her decision therefore,her application of the ineligibility statute to delay was unconstitutional 
our conclusion conforms with the texas principle that a ny constitutional or statutory provision which restricts the right to hold office must be strictly construed against ineligibility.wentworth meyer.in addition,it is supported by decisions in the ninth and tenth circuits that struck down day residency requirements.schaefer townsend,cir campbell davidson,cir.in schaefer,relying on term limits and evidence of the framers intent,the ninth circuit held that a residency requirement violates the constitution by handicapping the class of nonresident candidates who otherwise satisfy the qualifications clause.at.the tenth circuit,in campbell,struck down a colorado law that,inter alia,required candidates to be residents of the state for at least thirty days.at.like the ninth circuit,it relied on term limitsand evidence of the framers intent.id.at citing the federalist james madison 
the rpt does not dispute that the qualifications clause requires inhabitancy on election day.instead,the rpt argues that such a determination can be made prospectively in a procedural manner allowed by the elections clause.
the rpt arguments for finding benkiser declaration constitutional under the elections clause fail 
states,through the elections clause,exercise some regulatory authority over federal elections because as a practical matter,there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order,rather than chaos,is to accompany the democratic processes.storer,at.this authority,however,is not unlimited.any regulation of time,place,and manner must not violate other portions of the constitution.see,smith allwright.texas is free to conduct her elections and limit her electorate as she may deem wise,save only as her action may be affected by the prohibitions of the united states constitution.in addition,while states enjoy a wide latitude in regulating elections and in controlling ballot content and ballot access,they must exercise this power in a reasonable,nondiscriminatory,politically neutral fashion.miller moore,cir.there is evidence that benkiser did not act reasonably and with political neutrality when she declared delay ineligible.indeed,the district court description of the events surrounding the letter sent by delay imply,at the very least,a lack of neutrality.dist.op.at explaining that benkiser had personally revised a previous draft of delay letter.
more to the point,even had benkiser acted with political neutrality,her actions would not fall within the limited authority delegated to the states under the elections clause.the manner of elections encompasses matters like notices,registration,supervision of voting,protection of voters,prevention of fraud and corrupt practices,counting of votes,duties of inspectors and canvassers,and making and publication of election returns.cook gralike,d quoting smiley holm.benkiser determination of ineligibility does not fall within this definition of the manner of elections.
the rpt argues that the determination did affect merely the manner of elections because the act was procedural and predictive.assuming the rpt argument is correct,the problem with the theory is that the tdp makes an challenge.despite the rpt attempt to classify the declaration as merely predictive,the evidence shows that it was not benkiser declaration was based on delay current residence,not his inhabitancy on election day.simply put,her declaration of ineligibility was not a mere predictive,ministerial act affecting the manner of the election.it was a direct determination of delay qualifications as a candidate.as such,the declaration was unconstitutional and can not be saved by the elections clause.
the rpt also contends that the declaration of ineligibility is a permissible manner regulation because delay is a frivolous candidate and removing frivolous candidates from the ballot constitutes protection of voters under supreme court precedent.this argument fails.whenever the supreme court has discussed the states authority to prevent frivolous candidates from appearing on the ballot,it has been in the context of a candidate that will only receive minimal support in an election.see term limits,at.storer,at.there is no evidence that delay,the incumbent candidate of a dominant political party,will receive only minimal support.here,we fail to see how removing delay from the ballot would protect the voters,inasmuch as it was the voters themselves who selected delay as the republican candidate for the general election.
even if benkiser declaration could be construed as a manner regulation,it would only survive a constitutional challenge if it would not exclude classes of candidates from federal office.term limits,at.see also schaefer,at asking whether state action has the likely effect of handicapping an otherwise qualified class of candidates.given that benkiser method of application would exclude,or at a minimum handicap,the pool of nonresident prospective candidates,it is unconstitutional under term limits 
c.the rpt failed to meet the standards of the ineligibility statute 
apart from the federal constitutional questions,this case presents a statutory question.for the purposes of this section,we assume arguendo that it would be constitutional for a state actor to make,prospective judgments about residency and that benkiser in fact made such a judgment.even granting those assumptions,the rpt declaration of ineligibility would violate texas law because delay future residency was not conclusively established by public record.
the conclusively established standard 
the governing standard,conclusively established,bears emphasis.something is conclusive when,by virtue of reason,it put s an end to debate or question,usually because of its irrefutability.webster third new international dictionary unabridged accordingly,texas courts have explained that public records must leave no factual dispute concerning the conclusiveness of ineligibility.see in re jackson,orig.pet.holding that a state actor under has no authority instead,she may administratively declare that a candidate is ineligible only when the record conclusively establishes the candidate ineligibility emphasis in original culberson palm,dist,orig.pet.holding that ineligibility was not conclusively established where there remained a fact question.thus refined,the issue is whether,based on the evidence properly before benkiser on june,there remained a fact question as to whether delay would reside in texas on election day,november.palm,at.
the intersection of,which requires that proof of ineligibility be conclusive,and the qualifications clause,which requires inhabitancy only when elected,presents an extraordinary burden to declaring a candidate ineligible on residency grounds prior to the election.this is because it is almost always possible for a person to change their residency to move to the state in question before the election,thereby satisfying the qualifications clause 
delay future inhabitancy was not conclusively established 
although the public records relied on by benkiser may have conclusively established delay present residency in virginia,they did not conclusively establish whether he will inhabit texas on election day.proof of delay present residency may suggest where he will be in the future however,it does not put the matter beyond dispute or question.
benkiser relied on three public records to declare delay ineligible 
delay virginia driver license 
delay virginia voter registration and 
an employment withholding form reflecting delay virginia residence.
dist.op.at.these documents do not conclusively establish whether delay will be an inhabitant of texas on november.delay could be a current resident of virginia,as the documents above provide,and nonetheless move back to texas before november.indeed,benkiser admitted in her testimony that the public records could not prove delay residency on election day and that delay could move back to texas before election day.
information that was before benkiser showing delay eligibility supports this conclusion.benkiser had before her delay original candidacy application,in which he swore that he was eligible for office.in terms of the qualifications clause,such a declaration necessarily contained an implicit promise that delay would be an inhabitant of texas on election day.it is also likely that benkiser the rpt confirmed his eligibility in prior delay had been an inhabitant of texas for decades.under these circumstances,the public records provided by delay could not have conclusively established his future residency.predicting delay future inhabitancy would have required a finding of fact,which the rpt had no authority to make.see,in re jackson,at.
the rpt argues against this analysis on several grounds,none of which is persuasive.first,relying on the language of the statute another public record,the rpt contends that one public record is sufficient for a declaration of ineligibility.if this is true,the rpt contends,surely three public records are sufficient.this argument ignores second requirement that ineligibility must be conclusively established.put another way,any number of public records may be sufficient only if they meet the conclusively established burden.such is not the case here.
second,the rpt relies on nixon slagle,tex,orig.pet,for the proposition that a prospective candidate voter registration form showing residence outside the jurisdiction in question is sufficient to conclusively establish ineligibility.the rpt argument ignores a key difference between nixonand the case at bar.nixoninvolved texas state residency qualification for a state senate seat,which required a candidate to be a resident of the relevant district for a year preceding the election.see.const.art.iii.therefore,the question in nixon was the location of the candidate current residence for state constitutional purposes.at,not as here delay future inhabitancy for federal constitutional purposes.the latter issue is speculative and can not be proven conclusively by a form showing current residence.
third,the rpt cites jones bush,d.its reliance on that case ignores that jones did not involve texas conclusively established standard.in addition,the rpt use of jones obscures that jones discussion of inhabitancy was in reference to present,not future,inhabitancy.jones definition of the term inhabitant can not make the rpt effort to predict delay future any more definitive.contrary to the rpt suggestion,this court can not presume that delay will remain an inhabitant of virginia rather,the fact must be conclusively established by public record under texas law.it is not 
in conclusion,delay future inhabitancy could not be determined conclusively without a finding of fact.his inhabitancy outside texas was not beyond dispute or question.thus,benkiser violated by declaring delay ineligible.
d.the injunction was an appropriate remedy 
apart from this case constitutional and statutory merits,the rpt argues that the district court erred in granting the tdp injunctive relief.in addition to prevailing on the merits,a party requesting an injunction must establish that there is a substantial threat of irreparable injury,the threatened injury outweighs the potential injury to the opposing party,and the injunction will not disserve the public interest.icee distribs.snack foods,cir citing of camenisch,d.
the rpt waived its irreparable harm argument 
in its opening brief,the rpt ties its irreparable harm argument to its standing argument.it argues that the tdp can not possibly show irreparable harm because it has shown no harm at all.the rpt arguments have been addressed above,see part,and found meritless.
for the first time in its reply brief,the rpt argues that the tdp has not shown irreparable harm because it has an adequate remedy at law.we need not consider this argument because the rpt effectively waived it by failing to raise it in its opening brief.see,linbrugger abercia,cir.in any event,the legal remedies proposed in the rpt reply brief would not make the tdp whole.we therefore reject the rpt arguments.
the rpt does not make a comparative harm argument 
the rpt argument concerning the appropriateness of the injunction centers on the public interest element.in fact,it never makes on argument concerning the requirement that the tdp threatened injury must outweigh any potential injury to the rpt.given that it has f
