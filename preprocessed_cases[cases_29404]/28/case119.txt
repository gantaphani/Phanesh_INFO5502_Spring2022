opinion of the court 
appellant steven biener,a delaware citizen who sought nomination as the democratic party candidate for the united states house of representatives the house,appeals the district court grant of summary judgment against him.biener and carol greenway,a registered voter who is a biener supporter,sued the democratic party of the state of delaware the party and frank calio,delaware state commissioner for elections,alleging that the filing fee for the democratic primary was unconstitutional.the district court rejected biener arguments under the qualifications,equal protection,and due process clauses and granted summary judgment on behalf of the party and calio.
the delaware statute provides a filing fee exception for indigent candidates who are unable to pay a fee.biener challenges the lack of a ballot access alternative for candidates.he asserts that he should have a choice not to pay the fee.we conclude that the availability of a choice is outcome determinative for biener qualifications and equal protection clause claims.those claims fail.additionally,we conclude that there is no due process violation.we will therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
facts and procedural history 
unlike general elections,which are held by the state to select government,primary elections are conducted by the state on behalf of and as a convenience to political parties to assist them in selecting their candidates for office.under delaware law,individual political parties share responsibility with the state for election primaries.political parties are authorized to set the filing fee amount,so long as it does not exceed of the total salary for the term of office the candidate seeks.a c.in,the party set the filing fee for candidacy to the house at.
when a party opts to impose a filing fee on candidates,delaware law provides only one exception.d e.candidates who demonstrate they are indigent by virtue of qualification for federal benefits may,in lieu of a filing fee,access the primary ballot by obtaining signatures on a petition.id.
biener sought to be included on the ballot for the democratic primary as a candidate for the house.he ran on an spending and interest platform,and did not solicit money for his campaign.biener submitted the necessary paperwork to the state and the party,but was informed that because he is he needed to remit the filing fee or would be left off the democratic primary ballot.
biener filed suit against calio seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.calio filed an unopposed motion to join the party as a defendant,and that motion was granted.the district court denied biener relief,stating that biener had not shown a likelihood of success on any of his claims.
once his complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief was rejected,biener paid the filing fee.he then amended his complaint to seek a refund of the fee,which constituted of the entire amount expended on his campaign.after paying the fee,biener was included on the democratic primary ballot and received of the votes but did not win the democratic nomination.
biener suit alleged that the filing fee requirement is unconstitutional on three grounds it adds an impermissible wealth requirement to the qualifications for house membership,it denies equal protection to candidates who would like to seek office without paying a filing fee,and it violates the due process clause because it inappropriately delegates state power to political parties.calio and the party made a motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted on all three grounds.
ii.discussion 
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,since this is an appeal of a final decision of a federal district court.we exercise plenary review over all jurisdictional questions,including whether a plaintiff has standing to assert a particular claim.see instrument of,cir.we also review the district court decision to grant summary judgment on a plenary basis.see blair scott specialty gases,cir.a grant of summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in reviewing the grant of summary judgment,we must affirm if the record evidence submitted by the is merely colorable or is not significantly probative.see port auth.of affiliated fm ins,cir quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.
as a threshold matter,we must consider whether biener has standing to make his claims.our decision here is informed by our recent opinion in belitskus pizzingrilli,cir.in that case,which involved a challenge to pennsylvania election filing fees,we rejected the argument that a candidate challenging a mandatory filing fee must establish that payment of the fee would result in the complete depletion of personal or campaign funds in order to demonstrate injury to a protected interest.id.at.
biener,by paying the filing fee in protest,depleted of his campaign funds.this is an injury in fact,which is clearly traceable to the filing fee set by the party and calio.the injury also can be redressed by a favorable decision in this court.biener thus has standing to challenge the filing fee on his own behalf.see communications of,verizon,cir reciting the three elements of a case or controversy for purposes of standing injury,causation,and redressability see also belitskus,at citing green mortham,an eleventh circuit court of appeals case in which the candidate used campaign contributions to pay the filing fee under protest and the court did not question his standing.
biener also purports to make claims on behalf of indigent or individuals.for example,biener alleges that delaware alternative to filing fees for indigent candidates is illusory because so few people qualify as indigent under the statutory definition.biener does not contend,however,that he is in the group of individuals who are allegedly prevented from availing themselves of this alternative.because he is not a member of that group nor does he possess a close relationship worthy of allowing him to act as a,biener lacks standing to make this claim.see.psychiatric soc y green spring health,cir it is a tenet of standing that a litigant must assert his or her own legal rights and interests,and can not rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.internal quotations omitted.
qualifications clause 
the district court held that delaware filing fee for the democratic primary does not violate the qualifications clause by improperly adding a wealth requirement to the qualifications for house membership.the qualifications clause of the united states constitution states that no person shall be a representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five years,and been seven years a citizen of the united states,and who shall not,when elected,be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen.const.art.i,cl.supreme court precedent establishes that states have no power to add to these age,citizenship,and residency requirements.term limits,thornton,d citing a long list of cases in numerous courts that conclude states lack the authority to supplement the qualifications in the qualifications clause.furthermore,states should not attempt to disguise qualifications for office as qualifications for election as a way to circumvent this rule,or they risk the qualifications for election being found unconstitutional.id.at.d ressing eligibility to stand for congress in ballot access clothing trivializes the basic principles of our democracy that underlie the qualifications clause.internal quotations omitted.the issue here is whether the filing fee for the democratic primary constitutes an additional qualification for house membership.
biener qualifications clause claim is based in large part on thornton,in which the supreme court found a statute unconstitutional as an impermissible attempt to add to the qualifications for office established by the constitution.id.at.latching onto thornton,biener argues that delaware filing fee is an eligibility requirement for office and thus an impermissible wealth qualification.in support of his claim,biener points to the debate by the framers of the constitution over whether to include a wealth or requirement in the qualifications clause,and their ultimate decision that qualifications would be limited to age,citizenship,and residency.
thornton and the impressive and uniform body of judicial decisions cited therein where courts have struck down laws on the basis that they improperly added qualifications to those found in the qualifications clause focus on qualifications that were inherent in the candidate.see,thornton,at.for instance,all of the following qualifications have been found unconstitutional term limits district residency requirements loyalty oath requirements voter registration requirements and restrictions on those convicted of felonies.see,id.at.schaefer townsend,cir campbell davidson,cir.unlike these impermissible qualifications,the filing fee for the democratic primary is not inherent in the candidate.see fowler adams,stating that a filing fee,unlike the article i,section,clause qualifications,is not personal to the candidate but may be paid by anyone in his behalf.
in a recent case before this court,we rejected a qualifications clause challenge to the hatch act because t he act allows a citizen a choice.merle united states,cir.there,we took notice that a resign to run law may force the prospective candidate to make a choice between federal employment and running for elective office,but does not constitute an additional qualification for the office of united states representative.id.likewise,a candidate financially able to pay a filing fee,but unwilling to do so,is not being subjected to an impermissible wealth requirement.
finally,we disagree with biener contention that thornton capsized existing precedent upholding states rights to require filing fees.see fowler.at cassidy willis,bodner gray,so d,kenneweg allegany county com rs.even after thornton,states still have the right to regulate elections by imposing reasonable requirements on candidates.in thornton,the court held that an amendment with the avowed purpose and obvious effect of evading the requirements of the qualifications clause by handicapping a class of candidates can not stand.at.here,there is no avowed purpose to evade the constitution and exclude a class instead,the purpose of the filing fee is to keep delaware ballots manageable.moreover,the logical consequences of biener argument would jeopardize states use of signature requirements.
equal protection clause 
next,we address whether the district court erred when it granted summary judgment for appellees calio and the party on the equal protection clause claim.like the district court,we hold that there is no equal protection violation.equal protection jurisprudence mandates a alternative for those unable to pay a filing fee.delaware law complies with this precedent by providing an alternative for indigent candidates.here,biener alleges only an unwillingness,not an inability,to pay.in its history,the supreme court has considered only two election filing fee cases,both of which were decided on equal protection grounds.in,the supreme court struck down an election primary filing fee where it was an absolute prerequisite to participation.bullock carter,d.the filing fees in that case were set by the county executive committees of the individual political parties and were subject to limitations only in some counties.id.at.the proceeds of the fee went to the party.id.at.the bullock court said that despite the political parties involvement with the filing fees,the mechanism of such elections is the creature of state legislative choice and hence is state action within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.internal citations and quotations omitted.
the bullock court closely scrutinized the filing fee,looking at whether the fee was reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of legitimate state objectives.id.at.the court recognized that states have a legitimate interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot to prevent the clogging of its election machinery,avoid voter confusion,and assure that the winner is the choice of a majority,or at least a strong plurality.id.at.additionally,it is a legitimate objective for states to protect the ballot from including frivolous or fraudulent candidates.id.but t o say that the requirement tends to limit the ballot to the more serious candidates is not enough.id.the court held the differing treatment must also bear some relevance to the objective,and that in bullock the fee was not reasonably necessary because other means to protect the state valid interests were available.id.at.the decision was motivated by a concern that without an alternative means of ballot access affluent candidates were advantaged.id.at.
a few years later,in lubin panish,an indigent candidate brought a suit to prevent california from enforcing its filing fee,d.the california elections code made forms required for nomination and election issuable only once candidates paid a filing fee.id.at.the fee amount was tied to the salary of the office sought.id.as in bullock,the supreme court applied a close scrutiny test and held that the fee was unconstitutional because no alternate means of ballot access was available for indigent candidates.id.at.according to the court,lubin was a less straightforward case than bullock because california fees were not as exorbitant.id.at.
more recently,we considered the constitutionality of pennsylvania election filing fees.because the ruling occurred after briefs were filed in this case,we sought comment from the parties on the applicability of belitskus.in belitskus,we held that pennsylvania requirement was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause because it failed to provide a reasonable alternative means of ballot access to indigent candidates.id.at.we applied a heightened level of scrutiny because indigent plaintiffs were challenging a mandatory filing fee.id.at.
the issue here is whether the filing fee violated the equal protection clause by extending alternate means of ballot access only to indigent candidates the parties agree that biener can not avail himself of delaware alternate means of accessing the the requisite number of signatures on a campaign he is not indigent or even.biener claim is that delaware filing fee is unconstitutional because it lacks an equivalent alternative for candidates 
biener urges us to find delaware filing fee unconstitutional under bullock and lubin.but biener reliance on bullock and lubin is misplaced because the candidates in both cases were indigent.see bullock,at.the candidates affirmatively alleged that they were unable,not simply unwilling,to pay the assessed fees see also cassidy,at noting that in lubin the inability to pay the fee is so much a part of the decision that we can not ignore it here.biener turns bullock and lubin on their heads when he argues that indigents are advantaged under delaware current system because they have an alternative that other candidates do not.biener assertion that we should reach the same result as bullock is discouraged by the language of that case,where the court said the opinion should not be read to cast doubt on the validity of reasonable candidate filing fees in other contexts.at.
because biener is not claiming indigence,bullock,lubin,and belitskus,while not determinative,are informative on the equal protection analysis.in determining whether or not a state law violates the equal protection clause,we must consider the facts and circumstances behind the law,the interests which the state claims to be protecting,and the interests of those who are disadvantaged by the classification.williams rhodes,d cited in bullock,lubin,and belitskus.
our first inquiry in an equal protection challenge is the appropriate level of scrutiny.see reform party of allegheny county allegheny county dep t of elections,cir en banc.the scrutiny test depends on the filing fee effect on biener rights.id.we need not automatically apply close scrutiny just because this case deals with ballot access.se
