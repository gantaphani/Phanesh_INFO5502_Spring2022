before us are three appeals from two superior court judgments in different cases,all involving a single subject,namely,the decision of county election officials not to certify a referendum to overturn a measure adopted by the san mateo city council,which decision resulted from the election officials invalidation of a number of categories of purported voter signatures.the officials decision was upheld by the trial court.
the parties raise a number of claims concerning the officials determinations on various categories of disqualified signatures.we find it necessary to decide only one of those claims whether the officials properly disqualified signatures where the voter did not personally write out identifying information as required by elections code section.we agree that the officials acted correctly in this regard,and hold,in this case of first impression,that the deficiency could not be cured by construing election code section to validate the signatures by the declaration of the petition circulator on each sheet of signatures.in light of this decision,all remaining contentions become moot because,no matter how any of the parties other contentions are resolved,there would still be an insufficient number of valid signatures to qualify the referendum for submission to the voters.we therefore affirm one judgment and dismiss two of the appeals.
background 
the bay meadows race track is a prominent feature of the history,economy,and geography of san mateo county.the race track is located on a parcel of approximately acres an adjoining parcel of about acres is not used for track operations,and was apparently unimproved.both parcels are owned by bay meadows land company bay meadows land company.
in,the san mateo city council council adopted a specific plan for the parcels it appears that thereafter bay meadows land company came to believe that the property would be more profitable if the race track were closed and other commercial uses were promoted.in november,the council adopted resolution which,among other things,amended the specific plan and approved a master tentative parcel map for the parcel.that same month the council approved a development agreement for creation of a commercial district with capacity of more than one million square feet of retail,office and space.
opposition to the proposed development was led by an unincorporated association named friends of bay meadows friends,which prepared a referendum petition and gathered signatures to put it on the ballot.friends attempt failed in early january,when norma gomez,the san mateo city clerk,and warren slocum,the san mateo county chief elections officer,refused to certify the petition on the ground it lacked the requisite numbers of qualified voters.
on january,friends commenced the first action,friends of bay meadows city of san mateo san mateo super.action no.civ,filing a petition for writ of mandate and complaint against the city of san mateo city,gomez,and slocum.the principal relief sought was a writ of mandamus directing those respondents to reverse their disqualification or invalidation of certain signatures to correct their certification to indicate that the referendum has qualified.friends also prayed for declaratory relief that elections code,both facially and as applied under the facts and conditions of this case is invalid in that it violates the people right of referendum under the california constitution by disallowing the petition signatures of electors and voters who,under elections code,remain duly qualified voters in spite of having moved to another residence within the same precinct 
bay meadows land company was not named as a party in friends action,and moved to intervene.the motion was denied,following which bay meadows land company,joined by taxpayer suzanne flecker,initiated the second action,their own petition for writ of mandate and complaint in flecker gomez san mateo super.action.this action named gomez and the city as respondents,and friends as a real party in interest.it alleged that the referendum petition had fatal defects of form that made it invalid even before the gathering of voter signatures began,specifically that the petition fails to advise potential signers that the referendum is protesting the adoption of an ordinance or resolution,as required by elections code section fails to provide either the number or the correct title of the ordinance or resolution being challenged,as required by elections code section and fails to include the full text and accompanying exhibits of the ordinance or resolution being challenged,as required by the same statute.like friends in its suit,this complaint sought a writ of mandate and injunctive relief prohibiting officials from taking any steps to place real parties referendum on the ballot,submitting it to the voters for approval,or repealing resolution in response to it.
in light of the obvious overlap between the two actions,the trial court effected an informal consolidation by establishing a unified briefing schedule.
the friends action was resolved first,on the basis of competing motions slocum,the city,and gomez moved for judgment to dismiss writ of mandate,and friends filed a to grant peremptory writ of mandate and judgment.the motions were submitted for decision on the basis of argument and stipulated facts which,as relevant here,and with minor editorial adjustments,read as follows 
on november,the san mateo city council approved resolution adopting the bay meadows specific plan and took certain other related actions.petitioners and plaintiffs circulated a referendum against an passed by the city council,bay meadows specific plan amendment.petition and collected signatures.
the petition was filed with gomez on december,
on december,the petition was received in slocum office.it contained petition sections and signatures.
the city of san mateo has registered voters as stated in slocum last official report of registration dated october,to the secretary of state prior to the petition.
gomez determined that the petition must have signatures to be certified.this represents percent of the registered voters within the city.
slocum staff determined the sufficiency of the signatures on the petition by examining the voter registration affidavits,if any,of the signers.
from this examination and subsequent reviews,slocum has determined the following 
a unverified signatures were filed by the proponent of the petition 
b signatures were found to be sufficient 
c signatures were found not to be sufficient 
d withdrawal cards were delivered and verified,of which were initially found to be sufficient.upon a later review,of these cards were determined to be of no effect because they were received by the city clerk on the same date that the petition was filed with the city clerk.the remaining withdraw al card signatures are included in the signatures found not to be sufficient.
from petitioners initial examination and two subsequent examinations of the insufficient signatures,petitioners contention that additional signatures found insufficient which should have been sufficient is limited to,as described in paragraphs below.
slocum determined that signatures were not sufficient because the signer did not personally affix printed name and place of residence on the petition.the petition section and line numbers for these petition signatures as well as the copies of the petition signature and corresponding registration affidavit,as well as each of these signer registration affidavits are attached hereto as exhibit 
slocum found that signatures were not sufficient because the residence address as written on the petition was different from the residence address on the signer voter registration affidavit.of these petition signatures,listed addresses on the petition that do not exist and listed addresses on the petition that are within the same precinct as the address on the signer voter registration affidavit,and one listed an address on the petition that is not with the same precinct as the address on the signer voter registration affidavit.the petition section and line numbers and address listings for these petition signatures in question as well as copies of the petition signature and corresponding registration affidavit,are attached hereto as exhibit 
slocum found that petition signatures were not sufficient because the signature on the petition did not match the signature on the voter registration affidavit.the petition section and line numbers for these petition signatures in question as well as copies of the petition signature and corresponding registration affidavit,are attached hereto exhibit 
slocum found that one petition signature was not sufficient because the person was not a registered voter.the petition section and line number for this petition signature in question as well as copies of the voter registration affidavit for the individuals registered at the same address are attached hereto in exhibit 
slocum found that one petition signature was not sufficient because the signer failed to personally affix her address.the copy of the petition section reflecting this signature and a copy of the registration affidavit for this signer are attached hereto as exhibit 
petitioner gerald krawetz is a registered voter residing within the city of san mateo.his voter registration affidavit states his residence as in san mateo.when he signed the petition,he listed a different address within the same precinct.slocum determined his signature not to be sufficient because the address listed on the petition was not the same address listed on his voter registration affidavit.his signature is one of the signatures listed in relation to paragraph.
gomez rejected one section of the petition containing signatures on the basis that the circular affidavit did not include a full date for the starting date for the petition circulation.the affidavit for the petition did not have a complete execution date and did include a statement that signature collection began in november 
gomez certified that the referendum petition did not have sufficient signatures in order for it to be considered valid.
on july,the trial court filed an order in the friends case,ruling as follows 
the court finds that respondent slocum properly determined with respect to the signatures whose validity is in question that a of the signatures were not sufficient because the signer did not personally affix printed name and place of residence,in violation of elections code nor could they be counted as valid under elections code b of the signatures were not sufficient because the residence address as written on the petition did not match the residence address on the signer voter registration affidavit,in violation of elections code and c respondent slocum was not arbitrary or unreasonable in his determination that of the signatures were not sufficient because the signature on the petition did not match the signature on the voter registration affidavit.based on the above,the court finds there remain insufficient valid signatures on the petition to qualify the referendum.
with respect to petitioners to grant peremptory writ of mandate,the court finds a that the elections office improperly invalidated signature on petition section and signature on petition for signatures,and signature on petition for failure to personally affix printed place of residence elections code,and these signature s shall be counted as valid and b that respondent norma gomez acted improperly in rejecting one petition section,when the contents of the petition clearly indicated it had not been circulated outside of the legally mandated time period.however,because even if all signatures on the unprocessed petition were found valid,there would still not be sufficient valid signatures to qualify the referendum,the court finds that requiring the petition signatures to be processed for possible validation would be a futile exercise.
for the reasons set forth above,it is hereby ordered respondent warren slocum motion to dismiss the petition for writ of mandate is granted.petitioners motion to grant the writ of mandate is denied in full.respondents city of san mateo and norma gomez motion to dismiss writ of mandate is denied.
on july,the court entered judgment in favor of the city,slocum,and gomez.friends filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.the city and gomez filed a notice of from the judgment insofar as it denied their motion to dismiss writ of mandate.
meanwhile,on july,the court entered an order denying the petition of bay meadows land company and flecker on the merits.judgment was entered on september,and bay meadows land company and flecker filed a timely notice of appeal.
we ordered the appeals coordinated for purposes of briefing and argument.we also granted bay meadows land company leave to intervene in appeal,the friends appeal from the july judgment.
discussion 
the california constitution acknowledges that all political power is inherent in the people.government is instituted for their protection,security,and benefit,and they have the right to alter or reform it when the public good may require.cal,art.ii.one of the ways in which the people may determine for themselves what their protection,security,and benefit or the public good may require is the referendum,which is defined as the power of the electors to approve or reject statutes or parts of statutes.id,subd.a.r eferendum powers may be exercised by the electors of each city or county under procedures that the legislature shall provide.id,subd.a.
with respect to municipalities with a population of more than,the legislature has provided that when not less than percent of the voters of the city sign a petition protesting adoption of the ordinance,the legislative body that enacted the ordinance may reconsider,repeal it failing that,the decision on the ordinance is made by the voters in a referendum,the petitions must conform to a specified standard,and must be circulated by a person who either is,or is qualified to be,a registered voter in the municipality.the petitions must also be turned in to the municipal elections official within days of the adoption of the ordinance by the legislative body.the election official is then required to examine the petition,determine the total number of valid signatures by registered voters,and certify the results.
in wheelright county of marin cal d,our supreme court explained the role of an election official in determining whether a signature on a referendum petition is valid these duties are ministerial but they are not mechanical.they involved more than a computation of the number of signatures.some judgment on the part of the election official is required.each signature on the petition must be handwritten and the election official must compare this handwriting with that on the registration affidavit to determine if it is the handwriting of the voter.the official must use eyesight and critical faculties to determine whether sufficient similarities exist to certify that this is a valid signature.if the official certifies that the petition contains the requisite number of valid signatures,that decision is therefore prima facie correct.citation.it is not conclusive,however,and may be challenged and reviewed by a court in mandamus proceedings.citation.where the signature on the petition is obviously spurious and is not that of the voter as shown by the registration affidavit,the official may and must reject it.the official has no discretion to certify a spurious signature.where there are dissimilarities which are so minor as to make rejection of the signature an unreasonable or arbitrary act,the court may not accept the official determination.where the dissimilarities are not so minor and the similarities are not so great that only one conclusion can be made as to the validity or invalidity of the signature,and where the court finds that in acting upon these dissimilarities and other indicia the official was not acting unreasonably or arbitrarily,the court must accept the official determination.id.at,see.
the role of the election official is meant to be as impersonal as possible.there is to be no concern with whether a referendum will be valid if enacted.farley healey cal d.if the person signing the petition has registered and has subscribed to the required affidavit,he or she may sign the petition,and the election official has no power to disqualify him or her by reason of a conjecture on his or her part,or by reason of information gained from other than the registration records any other rule might result in depriving a major portion of their right to sign such petitions,and this we are not inclined to sanction.ley dominguez cal.the role of an election official has been repeatedly described as purely ministerial,involving no exercise of discretion.see alliance for a better downtown millbrae wade th,d and authorities cited.
as is evident from its written decision,the trial court was obliged by friends trial strategy to conduct a detailed examination of the petitions examined by slocum and gomez.however,the claim of error we shall address does not require this court to repeat that examination,because it presents a pure issue of law.
friends appeal asserts error in connection with five categories of signatures invalidated by the election officials,the first of which contends that slocum acted unreasonably in invalidating those signatures where a second person apparently wrote the signer name and address.as friends explains the single largest category of contested signatures is signatures where,based on handwriting and other factors,it appears a second person assisted the signer by writing their name and address.slocum invalidated all such signatures.this in spite of elections code,which provides that a second person can write the name and address for a voter who is unable to do so,as long as the signature is underwritten by one witness.friends contends that the completed declaration of circulator at the end of each petition section satisfied this requirement.the trial court rejected this argument and affirmed slocum actions.friends is wrong.the trial court was right.
the governing statutes all use plain language,and provide as follows 
w henever any initiative,referendum,recall,nominating petition or any other petition or paper,is required to be signed by voters,only a person who is an eligible registered voter at the time of signing the petition or paper is entitled to sign it.each signer shall at the time of signing the petition or paper personally affix his or her signature,printed name,and place of residence,giving street and number,and if no street or number exists,then a designation of the place of residence which will enable the location to be readily ascertained.a space at least one inch wide shall be left blank after each name for the use of the elections official in verifying the petition or paper.
notwithstanding section,a voter who is unable to personally affix on a petition or paper the information required by section may request another person to print the voter name and place of residence on the appropriate spaces on the petition or paper,but the voter shall personally affix his or her mark or signature on the appropriate space of the petition or paper,which shall be witnessed by one person by subscribing his or her name thereon.
whenever any petition or paper is submitted to the elections official,each section of the petition or paper shall have attached to it a declaration signed by the circulator of the petition or paper,setting forth,in the circulator own hand,that the circulator circulated that section and witnessed the appended signatures being written,subds.a,b.
for purposes of verifying signatures on any referendum petition,the elections official shall determine that the residence address on the petition is the same as the residence address on the affidavit of registration.if the addresses are different,or,in the case of an initiative or referendum petition,if the information specified in section is not contained in the petition,the affected signature shall not be counted as valid.
friends is not challenging any part of any decision that involves examining the record for substantial evidence,that is,it does not contest the conclusions of gomez and slocum that the signatures were in fact written by others.rather,friends contention presents a pure issue of the trial court correctly upheld the respective decisions made by slocum and gomez disallowing ostensible voter signatures that were in fact made by someone else but lacked any information about the witnessing person alongside each signature.
in considering the requirement of section that each signatory must personally affix a printed name and address,the sixth district stated the requirement is neither redundant to checking whether the signature was valid nor insignificant.both the additional attention of the signer who must personally affix the information and the result the additional ability to verify that the signer was actually involved in the process aid in preventing forgery and other potential abuse.citations.in addition,the requirement that the signer personally affix the information ensures that the signer,at the time of signing,has actually affirmed the residence address placed on the petition.this affirmation goes to the very heart of the registrar ability to verify whether those who signed the petition were entitled to do so.citation.mapstead anchundo th,d.
this reasoning is equally sound when considering the demands of section.if a signer is unable to personally affix his or her signature,printed name,and place of residence as required by section,it is obvious that an additional safeguard was believed necessary.and this the legislature provided,by requiring that when each such voter shall personally affix his or her mark or signature on the appropriate space of the petition or paper it shall be witnessed by one person subscribing his or her name thereon.with this requirement,section specifies a mechanism that is an obvious aid to election officers in verifying the voter information.a city or county registrar would have the specific name of the person who actually sees the voter name and place of residence on the appropriate spaces written on the petition at the voter request.having that information is patently relevant to the ability of election officers to verify the signature or mark of a voter who could not,for whatever reason,write out the information personally no such witness signatures are present defect,we hold,that is not cured by the circulator verification of each section of the petition.
as noted above,the law requires that w henever any petition is submitted to the elections official,each section of the petition shall have attached to it a declaration signed by the circulator of the petition,setting forth,in the circulator own hand,that the circulator circulated that section and witnessed the appended signatures being written,subds.a,b.such declaration must appear on every referendum petition,which declaration counsel for both bay meadows land company and slocum characterize as the generic declaration of the circulator.and,they assert,such declaration can not substitute to satisfy the more personalized requirements of section.we agree.
if the legislature intended to permit a circulator to endorse all assisted signatures,it could readily have done so by employing language similar to that found in section.but it did not,and chose to provide that the voter mark or signature shall be witnessed by a person not by the circulator of the petition or paper.the irrefutable logic behind that choice is that the voter,and the person who witnessed someone other than the voter write out the voter information at the voter request,would be more reliable sources of verification than a circulator who might have a far less of each and every signatory.
as is apparent from the above,the legislature drew a clear distinction among circulators,voters,and persons.if we accepted friends construction,we would in effect be amending the language of section to conform to an unexpressed legislative intent.that is beyond the judicial competence.city of cotati cashman cal th,d,seaboard acceptance shay cal.likewise,acceding to friends construction would make the plain language of section surplusage to the way friends would like section to read.but we must deal with section with the language enacted b
