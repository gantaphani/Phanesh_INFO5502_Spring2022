national right to life political action committee nrlpac,national right to life committee,nrlc,and amarie natividad brought this action against the missouri ethics commission mec challenging the constitutionality of several missouri election laws.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted mec motion with respect to one of nrlpac and nrlc claims and dismissed their remaining claims as.nrlpac and nrlc appeal.we affirm.
background 
nrlc is a national,corporation incorporated in washington,its main objectives are to educate the public on issues and to support policies that are consistent with its agenda.it advances these objectives primarily by accepting donations and distributing literature and other communications,most commonly in the form of voter guides that identify candidates by their positions on issues.although nrlc occasionally donates money directly to candidates or candidate committees,expressly advocating the election or defeat of identified candidates is not its major purpose.nrlc established nrlpac,an internal political action committee,to make independent expenditures for express advocacy in elections.
prior to october,when governor and united states senate candidate mel carnahan was killed in an airplane crash,neither nrlc or nrlpac intended to make expenditures with respect to any missouri race in the november,election.rather,nrlpac had been vigorously advocating carnahan defeat in his race against senator john ashcroft.as a result of carnahan death,nrlpac decided to shift its focus and efforts toward the missouri gubernatorial race between jim talent and bob holden.nrlpac immediately printed new political communications expressly advocating jim talent election in that race.it planned to distribute these communications beginning october,days before the election.
nrlpac notified the mec of its intention to make expenditures in the missouri election and,according to nrlpac,was told by an mec staff member named mike that the kind of expenditures nrlpac was proposing would violate missouri law.specifically,mike explained that two separate missouri statutes prohibited committees like nrlpac from making any independent expenditures respecting a missouri election within thirty days of the election after its own examination of missouri election law,nrlpac concluded that,indeed,it could not make its planned expenditures.nrlc then considered whether the missouri statutes would also prohibit it,nrlc as opposed to nrlpac,from making its own expenditures in the election.concluding that the limitation would also preclude it from making independent expenditures,nrlc decided to omit any language expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates in the gubernatorial race.in effect,nrlc converted its express ads into issue ads.
nrlc was still concerned,however,that the missouri election laws did not appear to follow the distinction between express advocacy and issue advocacy as required by the united states supreme court in buckley valeo,d.nrlc lawyer sought guidance from michael reid,director of compliance at mec,by submitting for reid review hypothetical statements that resembled the kind of political communications his clients usually engage in.he asked reid to indicate whether such statements would subject nrlc to regulation under the missouri statutes at issue and to approve a specific legal interpretation of missouri law regarding the buckley test.reid declined to issue an official ruling,stating that t he commission determines on a case by case basis whether or not advertisements or speech urges voters to vote for or against an issue or a candidate it would be inappropriate for me to make any qualified statements concerning your communications.
mec practices appear,from the record,to support reid response.the commission decides whether to issue official opinions,pursuant to its authority under missouri revised statute section,only by affirmative vote of four members taken in official meetings and has not delegated authority to issue opinions to any staff members,including reid as the director of compliance.neither nrlc nor nrlpac has ever sought an official mec opinion concerning the missouri election laws at issue in this case.nor did they seek a temporary restraining order or other relief until they filed this lawsuit on the day of the election.they challenged several missouri election laws and sought a declaratory judgment to the effect that the challenged statutes are either unconstitutional on their face or,alternatively,as applied to nrlpac and nrlc.they also sought a permanent injunction against enforcement of the statutes.
ii.discussion 
under article iii of the constitution,federal courts may adjudicate only actual,ongoing cases or controversies.lewis cont l bank,d.thus,the supreme court has developed justiciability doctrines that go to the power of the federal courts to entertain disputes,and to the wisdom of their doing so.renne geary,d.in reviewing the application of those doctrines,w e presume that federal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary appears affirmatively from the record,and i t is the responsibility of the complainant clearly to allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute and the exercise of the court remedial powers.id.quoting bender williamsport area sch,d.
two,three,four 
in counts two,three,and four of their complaint,nrlpac and nrlc request declaratory and injunctive relief from enforcement of missouri revised statute section in count two they challenge that section prohibition on expenditures by committees within thirty days of an election.in count three they allege that section requirement that committees file disclosure reports fourteen days before making expenditures or contributions is also unconstitutional.in count four they point to the statute distinct treatment of committees domiciled outside of missouri as a violation of the privileges and immunities clause.the district court found that nrlpac and nrlc lacked standing to challenge section.we agree.
in order to prove standing,a plaintiff must demonstrate an actual injury that is concrete and particularized and not conjectural or hypothetical a causal connection between the injury and the defendant conduct and a likelihood,and not a mere speculative possibility,that the plaintiff injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.nrlpac and nrlc allege that section time restrictions and distinct treatment of residents violate the first amendment and the privileges and immunities clause in article iv,section of the constitution.we find,however,that these allegations do not assert an actual injury but are instead purely conjectural or hypothetical.
section imposes certain deadlines and filing requirements on committees only when those committees are not subject to the filing and other requirements in section thus,section does not apply to committees that receive at least twenty percent of their total contributions from missouri residents or that spend more than on missouri elections in a calendar year.contributions aside,nrlpac and nrlc have not alleged that they intended to spend less than on communications for the election and,indeed,the record quite clearly indicates that nrlpac identified expenditures would have exceeded.the plain language of section excludes nrlpac and nrlc from its purview.the evidence offered by nrlpac and nrlc to demonstrate that the mec enforces section against committees that spend more than,contrary to the statute plain meaning,is unpersuasive and,at best,amounts to evidence of a conjectural or hypothetical injury.we agree with the district court conclusion that the term committee as used in section is a statutory term that includes only committees that spend less than in a missouri election and are not domiciled in missouri.right to life political action comm.lamb,d.thus,section does not apply to nrlpac or nrlc and,accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of counts two,three,and four.
one,five,six 
in count one of their complaint,nrlpac and nrlc allege that missouri revised statute section is an unconstitutional prior restraint on political speech because it requires a continuing committee to be formed and registered at least thirty days before an election in order to make expenditures.in count five,they allege that,along with a battery of other statutes,section unconstitutionally fails,in its regulation of political organizations,to differentiate between groups whose major purpose is express advocacy and candidate contributions and those who engage in such activities only secondarily.and in count six,nrlpac and nrlc claim that section is facially unconstitutional because it does not follow the buckley test for distinguishing express advocacy from issue advocacy.there is no dispute over nrlpac standing to challenge section nrlpac clearly falls within the statute definition of a continuing committee.but the district court dismissed nrlpac and nrlc challenges to section as moot.although we disagree with the district court mootness analysis,particularly with respect to count one,we believe that counts one,five and six are presently nonjusticiable on ripeness grounds and that a brief discussion of the mootness issue is sufficient at this time.
the supreme court has repeatedly described the mootness doctrine as the doctrine of standing set in a time frame the requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation standing must continue throughout it existence mootness.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d citations omitted.thus,w e do not have jurisdiction over cases in which due to the passage of time or a change in circumstance,the issues presented will no longer be live or the parties will no longer have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the litigation.van bergen minnesota,cir quoting arkansas fcc,cir en banc.there is,however,an exception to the mootness doctrine for cases that are capable of repetition yet evading review.id.at.this exception will rescue an otherwise moot claim if the challenged conduct is of too short a duration to be litigated fully prior to its cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.id.at.election issues are among those most frequently saved from mootness by this exception.id.
nrlpac and nrlc section challenges became moot after the election and the district court declined to apply the exception for cases that are capable of repetition yet evading review.it grounded its holding on the uniqueness of the circumstances surrounding the election and concluded that any similar dispute between the parties is highly unlikely to recur.lamb,d at.the district court focused mainly on the unlikelihood that a candidate untimely death will again coincide with nrlc involvement in an election,calling the chances of such a recurrence tenuous at best.id.we are reluctant to draw such a narrow scope of probability.while,admittedly,the district court issued its opinion nearly six months before the death of minnesota senator paul wellstone during his senate bid in october the second such occurrence in as many years gives us pause.also,we think the chances are much better than tenuous that the death of a candidate within thirty days of an election will impact the abortion debate in that race and will therefore divert the attention of nrlc.most importantly,we believe that any number of events,other than the death of a candidate,might cause nrlc to become involved in a state race within thirty days of an election.for instance,polls might reveal a closer race than expected and attract nrlc resources.new information or effective advertising could drastically alter public opinion in the weeks before an election.trends in other races could elevate the importance of races with less clear outcomes.viewed together,these and other scenarios make it reasonably likely,in our view,that nrlc will again find itself in conflict with the limitation in section.this satisfies the capable of repetition prong of the mootness exception.
we also question the district court conclusion that future recurrences of this dispute will not evade review.it gave much weight to nrlpac and nrlc failure to seek a temporary restraining order or other expedited review,citing our cases declining to apply the mootness exception where procedures for expedited review were available.see midwest farmworker employment and training,dep t of labor,cir minnesota humane soc y clark,cir missouri ex rel.nixon craig,cir.but those cases did not involve elections and,more importantly,did not address disputes whose duration was,by definition,limited to the period before an election.election cases are inherently partisan,courts are reluctant to hastily decide their outcomes,and thus,as a practical matter,we doubt that even expedited procedures would have resolved this case in time for nrlc to have effectively participated in the election.
so,although we question the district court application of the mootness exception,we agree,as already stated,that the district court final disposition can be reached on ripeness grounds.accordingly,we now turn to that analysis.

the basic rationale of the ripeness doctrine is to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies,and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d.to that end,courts deciding whether a dispute is ripe should consider the hardship to the plaintiff caused by delayed review the extent to which judicial intervention would interfere with administrative action and whether the court would benefit from further factual development.ohio forestry sierra club,d.viewed in light of these considerations,nrlpac and nrlc section claims are,in our view,too immature and unfocused to be ripe for judicial review at this time.
in count one,nrlpac and nrlc allege that section amounts to an unconstitutional prior restraint on political speech by requiring a continuing committee to register and file disclosure reports at least thirty days before an election.but they have not alleged with any degree of specificity the constitutional threat they would face for failing to register before the cutoff.section does not,on its face,limit issue or express advocacy within thirty days of an election it merely states a registration deadline.and despite nrlpac and nrlc allegations that someone at the mec named mike told them they would not be permitted to make any contribution within thirty days of the election,president charles lamb filed an affidavit that paints a different picture 
in enforcing section,the commission has not refused to accept a statement of organization filed by a continuing committee after the thirtieth day before an election,has not otherwise refused to recognize such a continuing committee existence or registration,and has not taken any action to prevent a continuing committee from making or receiving contributions or expenditures in connection with an election if the committee has not filed a statement of organization by the thirtieth day prior to that election.the commission has found that continuing committees that fail to file a statement of organization by the thirtieth day before an election for which they receive contributions or expenditures have violated the deadline set by and has entered agreements with treasurers of those committees for the payment of fees pursuant to the commission authority under.
at.the district court correctly pointed out that h ow the mec would handle the fee for failing to file prior to the day window would have a significant impact on our constitutional scrutiny of section.lamb,d at.neither nrlpac nor nrlc have presented evidence on the issue of fees,nor have they sought clarification under section,the missouri statute authorizing the mec to issue advisory opinions.we think that these issues would benefit substantially from further factual development.and we agree with
