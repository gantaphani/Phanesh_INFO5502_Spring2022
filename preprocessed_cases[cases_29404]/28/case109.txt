opinion of the court 
on its face,this case presents the court with the issue of whether neighboring property owners who allege that their property values will be diminished and their neighborhood blighted by the construction of a storage facility have standing to sue under.the focus of this case is the propriety of the darby township zoning hearing board board decision to grant a variance,which permitted the construction of a storage facility in a residential zone,and the attendant state court decisions issued in the course of appeal.with the exception of the claim that appellants property values will be damaged by the grant of the variance,we will affirm the district court dismissal of the amended complaint because appellants have not alleged facts clearly demonstrating that they are proper parties to invoke the exercise of the federal court remedial powers.insofar as appellants taliaferro and alexander have alleged injuries to their property values and neighborhood arising from the approval of the variance,however,we will reverse the district court dismissal.
in,appellee delaware county redevelopment authority acquired by condemnation a tract of land in the township of darby darby township.in furtherance of a urban renewal plan,an agreement was entered into in by the redevelopment authority and a redeveloper,rupaca.the agreement contained a covenant binding the redeveloper and its successors and assigns until april,to devote the property to,and only to and in accordance with,the uses specified in the urban renewal plan,for residential purposes.there was also a covenant,unlimited as to duration,for use of the property.
the property was sold in to first urban redevelopers.first urban subsequently sold the property to charles rappa,who sold it to appellee maureen healy in.no development had occurred between and.although located in a partially commercial area,the property was still zoned residential,so healy made a variance request to allow the construction of an facility.that request was supported by expert testimony,which concluded that redevelopment to residential use was not economically feasible.at the behest of appellants lee taliaferro and samuel alexander,the delaware county court of common pleas remanded an original grant of the variance for additional testimony and evidence,but after further hearings,the board granted the final request for a variance on may.appellants again appealed the decision to the delaware county court of common pleas,which affirmed the board.appellants then appealed to the commonwealth court,which affirmed the court of common pleas decision.see taliaferro darby twp.zoning hearing,reh g denied,june,and appeal denied.
in the meantime,the complaint in this matter was filed in the eastern district of pennsylvania on june.plaintiffs lee taliaferro and samuel alexander are members of the community in darby township and neighboring property owners to the land in question.plaintiffs beatrice moore and bernice wilson were residents whose land was condemned pursuant to the urban renewal project.named as defendants were the board and its members,darby township and the manager of darby township,the delaware county redevelopment authority,and maureen healy 
an amended complaint alleged that appellants brought suit as citizens and beneficiaries of the urban renewal plan and subsequent redevelopment agreement,because they were promised the benefits of residential redevelopment of the property.despite the redevelopment agreement,however,appellants alleged that darby township,in order to perpetuate the white majority in the township,continuously discouraged residential developments by various means,including without limitation,demanding that the developer construct an unnecessary bridge,refusing housing style modifications and informal discouragement.appellants complained that the delaware county redevelopment authority failed to enforce the terms of the redevelopment agreement.they accused the appellees of conspiring to inhibit and prevent the residential redevelopment of the property for the purpose of preventing the population in darby township from expanding and gaining political control.
count i of the amended complaint sought enforcement of the redevelopment agreement,by way of an injunction in order to prevent the use of the property for purposes other than the residential use specified in the urban renewal plan and redevelopment agreement count ii alleged a claim under for violation of appellants rights of equal protection,substantive and procedural due process,and protection of property.count iii alleged a claim under for intentional racial discrimination by appellees preventing the growth of the community and introducing improper uses into the community to decrease property values and diminishing or curtailing the voting power of the community,as well as by denying them contracts which were required to protect and promote the appellant s community and by limiting the appellant s rights as parties before the board.count iv alleged conspiracy under and count v alleged a violation of the fair housing act.count vi,which attacked the board decision to grant the variance,was dismissed by order of the district court dated september.
in response to appellees motions to dismiss brought pursuant to.b and b,the district court concluded that the appellants lacked standing to bring the claims asserted,and dismissed the amended complaint.
lee taliaferro and samuel alexander,as members of the community in darby township and neighboring property owners,alleged they were injured by the racially discriminatory policies of the appellees in curtailing the voting and political power of the community,because the appellees allegedly made a land use decision granting a variance to allow the construction of an facility instead of the promised residential redevelopment in order to limit the effect of the vote in darby township in that their property values would be diminished and their neighborhood blighted by the construction of an facility and because have been denied equal treatment under the law in government hearings and meetings in that,at a hearing before the case was remanded by the state court,board members discriminately,repeatedly shouted down the protestants who were and threatened to expel them from the hearing,allegedly based on racial bias.the district court dismissed taliaferro and alexander claims,and noted that these appellants had not alleged what,if any,benefit they would receive if the urban renewal plan were implemented.thus,they neither alleged nor demonstrated that they,as individuals,suffered a concrete injury as a result of appellees alleged actions that would be redressed by the relief sought in this action.
beatrice moore and bernice wilson were residents who were removed pursuant to the urban renewal plan with the alleged promise of an opportunity to return.the district court dismissed their claims because they had not alleged they desired,or would be eligible,to move into residences that might have been constructed under the urban renewal plan.
in summary,the lower court determined that appellants had not contended that they had been injured personally by appellees conduct.accordingly,because none of the appellants would receive an actual benefit if the court granted the requested injunction,it found that they lacked standing to bring the amended complaint filed in this matter.see taliaferro darby twp.zoning,no.civ,wl,at,the relief requested would not confer a benefit to any of the parties,as granting an injunction against commercial use of the property in light of the expired u rban r enewal p lan would not necessarily lead to anything other than maintaining the property in its present fallow condition.alternatively,the court found that abstention,as articulated in younger harris,d,was appropriate,taliaferro,wl,at,and further,that the court lacked jurisdiction under the doctrine,id.at.

article iii of the constitution restricts the judicial power of the united states to the resolution of cases and controversies.see valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d.subsumed within this restriction is the requirement that a litigant have standing to challenge the action sought to be adjudicated in the lawsuit.id.standing has constitutional and prudential components,both of which must be satisfied before a litigant may seek redress in the federal courts.wheeler travelers ins,cir.absent article iii standing,a federal court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to address a plaintiff claims,and they must be dismissed.storino borough of point pleasant beach,cir.
the three elements necessary to satisfy the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing are 
the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical 
there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and 
it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.

thus,whether asserting first party standing or third party standing,a plaintiff must state an injury in fact.storino,at.in storino,we found a challenge by landowners to a zoning ordinance that made the use of their property as a boarding home into a legal nonconforming use insufficient to confer first party standing.the landowners argued that they would be injured in the future when the nonconforming use was no longer accepted by the city,because they would have to apply for a variance.because the injury of future costs when applying for a variance was prospective and conjectural,we found that the landowners had not sufficiently alleged an injury in fact that was particularized,actual,or imminent.id.at.therefore,the landowners did not satisfy the constitutional requirements for first party standing.id.in addition,we found that the landowners did not have third party standing to challenge the ordinance on equal protection grounds for decreasing the amount of income housing available in the area.because the landowners did not suffer an injury in fact themselves,they could not establish third party standing.id.at 
a plaintiff who seeks to challenge exclusionary zoning practices must allege specific,concrete facts demonstrating that the challenged practices harm him,and that he personally would benefit in a tangible way from the court intervention.warth seldin,d.this court has found injury allegedly suffered by potential tenants of a housing project sufficient to confer standing to sue public officials where the individuals already were public housing tenants who would have suffered a particular injury if the development was not built.resident advisory bd.rizzo,cir.
further,we have found that a claim that a building project would increase traffic,pollution,and noise in the area residents neighborhood was sufficiently concrete and particularized.society hill towers owners rendell,cir.there,we held that a group of residents of a particular neighborhood,society hill,in philadelphia,pennsylvania,had standing to sue the mayor of philadelphia,the secretary of housing and urban development,and the department of housing and urban development hud,challenging hud approval of a grant to philadelphia to assist in funding development of a hotel and parking garage in society hill.at.under the administrative procedures act apa,et,the national historic preservation act nhpa,and the national environmental policy act nepa,the plaintiffs alleged that the project that the city was funding would decrease their property values.id.at.cautioning against conflat ing issues of standing and questions of proof,we concluded that this was a sufficiently concrete and particularized injury 
the residents have alleged concrete and particularized injury in the form of increased traffic,pollution,and noise that will detrimentally impact the ambiance of their historic neighborhood and their ability to use and enjoy the penn landing waterfront.they assert that the impact of the proposed project on their neighborhood will decrease their property values.there is no assertion that these claims are disingenuous or that the residents claim these injuries merely to manufacture a jurisdictional case or controversy that would not otherwise exist.moreover,the interest of the residents is anything but manufactured.it is as real as it is fervent,and it is sufficient to give the residents standing to challenge the requested udag grant.
in addition to alleging actual and specific injury,plaintiffs must demonstrate a causal connection to a defendant alleged conduct.warth,at.in warth,the supreme court found that income residents lacked standing to assert that a neighboring town zoning regulations and zoning board actions discouraged the construction of income housing in that town.the court determined that the inability of the individuals to reside in the neighboring town was a consequence of the economics of the area housing market,rather than of the zoning board acts.id.at.
finally,the injury alleged must be redressable by the remedy sought.for example,in rizzo,we found that granting the relief sought would produce at least a substantial probability that the housing project would materialize,affording plaintiffs the housing opportunities they desire.at quoting vill.of arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d.
in this case,accepting as true the material allegations of the amended complaint,appellants have failed to allege an injury in fact that is concrete,particularized,or actual in order to confer standing upon them in regard to a denial of equal treatment as a result of the appellees alleged conspiracy to block the construction of residential housing on the property.such a claim is generalized,and does not allege any actual injury to the appellants thus,to the extent taliaferro and alexander have alleged that appellees made land use decisions in order to limit the effect of the vote in darby township,they have not asserted an actual injury that would confer constitutional standing upon them.that is,appellants have not demonstrated that they,as individuals,have suffered a concrete loss as the result of appellees actions,even if appellees had acted to ensure that the property would not be used for income residential housing.
to the extent taliaferro and alexander have alleged injuries to their property values and neighborhood arising from the approval of the variance,however,we conclude that they have alleged a constitutionally cognizable injury.this injur
