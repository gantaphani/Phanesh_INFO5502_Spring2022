plaintiffs native american sacred site and environmental protection association nassepa,fran yorba,and damien shilo appeal from a judgment entered after the court sustained without leave to amend the demurrers of defendants city of san juan capistrano and city of san juan city council and of real party in interest pueblo serra,llc pueblo to plaintiffs petition for writ of mandate.the issue is whether defendants properly adopted a initiative in compliance with elections code section.we agree with the trial court that they did and affirm the judgment.
preliminarily,we note that all parties refer to what pueblo describes as the record of proceedings submitted by plaintiffs.in their appendix,plaintiffs included one page noting the record of proceedings was omitted but will be transferred from the trial court.however,these documents were never designated nor were they provided to us.we will rely on statements in the briefs to the extent they contain information about which all parties agree.see davenport blue cross of california th,fn,d.otherwise,we will not consider any material in the record of proceedings.
this appeal involves an initiative to amend the general plan of defendant city and rezone two pieces of real property at the northeast and southeast corners of junipero serra road and camino capistrano.pueblo wishes to use the property for the development and operation of junipero serra high school,a private catholic high school.the smaller,parcel originally was developed with an office complex it has been remodeled to serve as the high school which has begun operating.the parcel is currently undeveloped.it is proposed to be used for the school recreational facilities and ancillary school activities.
the two parcels were originally designated in the general plan as office research and planned community,respectively.after acquiring the property,the larger piece by virtue of a lease,pueblo circulated a petition to qualify an initiative to amend the general plan and rezone the property to facilitate construction and operation of a public or private school for up to students.the initiative sought to amend the general plan to change the designation of the sites to public and institutional and the zoning to public institutional.
in september,the orange county registrar of voters certified the petition contained signatures of more than percent of the city registered voters and thus qualified for either placement on the ballot or adoption by defendants.the initiative was presented to defendants in october.defendants negotiated an implementation agreement with pueblo to mitigate certain conditions.on october,defendants passed an ordinance adopting the initiative and the implementation agreement.
plaintiffs then filed their first petition for writ of mandate in the superior court,challenging adoption of the initiative.plaintiffs are comprised of an unincorporated association formed by the acjachemen nation of native americans and two members of that tribe.they alleged in the petition that the parcel housed the ancient village of putiidhem,a native american burial ground and cemetery in recent times and the mother village for the juane√±o band of mission indians they also claimed that defendants could not adopt the initiative without completing a ceqa review.
the trial court granted the petition,ruling that defendants did not have the right to adopt the initiative in conjunction with the implementation agreement the elections code allowed defendants to adopt the initiative only without alteration,and the implementation agreement was an impermissible alteration.it ordered defendants to set aside the initiative and agreement.an appeal was filed but dismissed prior to decision.
at a city council meeting in may,defendants set aside the ordinance that had passed the initiative and agreement.at the same meeting,defendants also passed a new ordinance adopting the initiative exactly as presented in the petition,without including the implementation agreement.
plaintiffs then filed the petition for writ of mandate which is the subject of this appeal,seeking again to set aside the ordinance adopting the initiative.defendants and pueblo filed demurrers,which the court sustained without leave to amend.
discussion 
plaintiffs seek to void defendants readoption of the initiative,claiming they could not do so without complying with ceqa.we disagree.
public resources code section,subdivision b states that m inisterial projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies are not subject to ceqa.elections code section section provides that if at least percent of a city registered voters sign an initiative petition that requests the initiative be submitted to a vote at a special election,the city shall do one of the following a adopt the ordinance,without alteration,at the regular meeting at which the certification of the petition is presented,or within days after it is presented.b immediately order a special election at which the ordinance,without alteration,shall be submitted to a vote of the voters of the city.c order a report and w hen the report is presented to the legislative body,either adopt the ordinance within days or order an election pursuant to subdivision b.
without citing to any authority,plaintiffs contend that the only way defendants could have adopted the initiative as a ministerial act is if it did so within the period set out in section,subdivision a.since it was passed the second time several months after it was first submitted to defendants,they continue,adopting the initiative ceased to be a ministerial act and thus was subject to ceqa requirements.plaintiffs reasoning is flawed.

a city duty to adopt a qualified initiative,or place it on the ballot,is ministerial and mandatory,blotter farrell cal d,citizens for responsible behavior superior court th,fn,d see also citizens against a new jail board of supervisors d.applying parallel statute governing board of supervisors.this duty remains,even where performance is beyond the statutory time frame.
in goodenough superior court d,the city failed to call a special election to place a initiative on the ballot.the court of appeal issued a writ of mandate to compel the superior court to order the city to set the election.id.at.in so doing,it stated that the city had a clear legal duty to call a special election within the time set by statute.id.at.it held that failure to comply with the time period,what it described as a procedural detail,will not be permitted to defeat the clear purpose of the statute to bring initiative measures to an early vote.id.at.
similarly,in truman royer d,the court held that the ministerial act of correcting the certification of a referendum petition after the statutory period was deemed to relate back to the date of the original timely certificate.citation.therefore,time lapse between the two certifications is not fatal.id.at.likewise,here,passage of the ordinance sans the implementation agreement corrected the original erroneous adoption of the altered initiative.
moreover,even where the timing of the ministerial action was not directly at issue,courts have ordered implementation of the initiative process beyond the statutory time period,duran cassidy d.eight
