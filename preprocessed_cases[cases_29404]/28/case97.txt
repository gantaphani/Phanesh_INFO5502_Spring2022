opinion of the court 
kenyatta johnson and damon roberts collectively,appellants appeal the district court grant of summary judgment for the city of philadelphia the city,contending the district court erroneously concluded that a city ordinance prohibiting the posting of signs on street poles passes constitutional muster under the first,fourteenth,and twenty fourth amendments of the united states constitution.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm.
background 
a.the ordinance 
appellants challenge the constitutionality of a city ordinance that prohibits the posting of signs on utility poles,streetlights,sign posts,and trees in a public.enacted after a similar ordinance was enjoined on first amendment grounds the ordinance now at issue was designed to cure the earlier ordinance constitutional infirmities app.at and to promote public safety and aesthetics in the city see app.at testimony from the director of legislative affairs for the city department of licenses and inspections stating that signs are a source of blight that a side from being visually unattractive also present problems related to public safety,by causing distractions for motorists operating vehicles.
specifically,the present ordinance states that,except as provided in accordance with a program permitting banners under certain circumstances the banner program no person may post any banners,pennants,placards,posters,stickers,advertising flags,or plaques,philadelphia code,on any utility pole,streetlight,traffic or parking sign or device,including any post to which such sign or device is attached,historical marker,or tree or tree in the public,id.a.the ordinance further provides that any violating sign may be removed by the department of licenses inspections or its designees,id.a,with the party responsible for the posting of the sign bearing the cost incurred in its removal as well as a penalty of,id.b.the ordinance does not prohibit signs on private property,or otherwise restrict communication.
appellants constitutional challenge 
at the time their actions were brought,appellants were both candidates for political office in an area of the city that contains a classic urban landscape of row house neighborhoods,where most homes have no front yard.app.at.by their own description,appellants had relatively scarce resources to expend on their campaigns.johnson spent only on his campaign,and roberts spent with unpaid debts of.they assert that,given their limited funds,they would have ordinarily relied heavily on signs posted on street poles to spread their political messages however,if they had done so,they each faced the possibility of incurring significant fines because of the city ordinance.indeed,johnson received a letter from the city advising him that he must remove any signs placed in contravention of the ordinance or be billed for the cost incurred for the removal plus a penalty,app.at,and roberts,like several other political candidates and private businesses responsible for violating the city ordinance,received numerous tickets.
in support of their constitutional challenge,appellants submitted affidavits from johnson and his campaign manager,as well as a authored by joe long of the northampton county democratic committee.long report is fashioned as an expert opinion regarding the ordinance impact on appellants campaigns.it claims that the city ordinance totally bans one of the most effective campaign tools political signs,which eliminate s any chance of electoral success for candidates with limited resources,inasmuch as political signs are inexpensive and can be localized in a fashion that no other medium offers.app.at the affidavits are to the same effect,declaring that street signs are an extremely effective campaign tool that have no substitute.
c.the district court proceedings 
after johnson filed his initial complaint,he moved for a preliminary injunction.the district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge,who held a hearing on the motion and denied it,observing that t he of the challenged ordinance has been conceded app.at and deciding that johnson was unlikely to succeed on the merits.as noted supra note,roberts was later added as a plaintiff and his own civil action was consolidated with johnson.the city then moved for summary judgment,which was granted.the district court concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that the city was entitled to judgment on appellants claims.
this timely appeal followed.
appellants argue that the city ordinance violates the first,fourteenth,and twenty fourth amendments,and that the district court erred by concluding otherwise and granting the city motion for summary judgment.we address those contentions in turn.
appellants first amendment claims 
appellants allege that the city ordinance violates the first amendment because it is a restriction on political speech.see const.amend.i congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech members of city council taxpayers for vincent,under the fourteenth amendment,city ordinances are within the scope of the first amendment limitation on governmental authority.
whether the ordinance is content neutral 
the first step in assessing the first amendment claims is to determine whether the city ordinance is or.rappa new castle,cir.if a restriction on speech is,then the city is required to show that the regulation is necessary to serve a compelling government interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.id.quoting boos barry,internal marks omitted.if,however,a regulation is,a different,more lenient test applies.see id.at.ordinances,even if imposed in a public forum,do not offend the first amendment as long as the restrictions are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.id.at quoting ward rock against racism,see melrose city of pittsburgh,cir same.
here,resolving the threshold question of content neutrality is straightforward.when asked at oral argument,appellants counsel acknowledged that the ordinance is.although their briefing periodically implies otherwise appellants have conceded the point,and they were wise to do so.we thus take the of the ordinance as a given and turn to assess its constitutionality under that rubric.accordingly,we must consider whether the ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and whether it leaves open ample alternative channels for communication.
whether the ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest 
i.the asserted government interest 
appellants first argue that the city ordinance does not serve a significant government interest.as a preliminary matter,it is clear from supreme court precedent that the goals of traffic safety and the appearance of the city are substantial governmental goals.riel city of bradford,cir quoting metromedia,city of san diego,plurality opinion see taxpayers for vincent,at it is well settled that the state may legitimately exercise its police powers to advance esthetic values rappa,at t he sufficiency of the government interest in aesthetics and safety has,by this juncture,become unquestioned.here,as previously noted,the record indicates that the city ordinance was intended to promote those legitimate and significant values.see app.at referring to blight and to the safety of motorists.
nevertheless,citing our decision in rappa new castle county,in which we held that a regulation prohibiting campaign signs in public was an unconstitutional restriction on speech appellants argue that the city asserted interest in safety and aesthetics fails.appellants br.at.their argument seems to be that there is no evidence supporting those proffered considerations,particularly when the city allows banners to be posted under the banner program on the very poles where it bans political signs.appellants br.at.to a large extent,then,appellants contention that the city ordinance does not serve a significant state interest depends on the premise that the city ordinance targets political signs.the legislation we struck down in rappa did that,see rappa,at although rappa political signs were barred,a number of other types of signs were permitted,and we rejected the government argument in that case that the restriction on political signs was justified due to the fact that campaign signs tend to proliferate more than other signs and therefore create greater safety and aesthetic problems than other signs,id.at.
here,however,unlike the disputed ordinance in rappa,the city ordinance is a point which,as discussed earlier,appellants have expressly acknowledged.in other words,the city ordinance does not simply prohibit political speech it prohibits all speech in the form of temporary signs on utility poles,streetlights,sign posts,and trees in the public,and there is no evidence that it is selectively enforced or was crafted for the purpose of prohibiting political speech in particular.instead,every indication in the record is that the ordinance was intended to promote public safety and reduce blight.see app.at.under these circumstances,the city judgment that such goals are advanced by the ordinance is accorded deference unless that judgment is facially unreasonable.frumer cheltenham,cir citing metromedia,at.because we can not say the city judgment fails that test,we are bound to recognize that the ordinance advances significant government interests.id.
ii.the scope of the ordinance 
that does not end our inquiry,however,as the ordinance must be narrowly tailored to serve the city interest in safety and aesthetics.rappa,at.in order to be narrowly tailored,a regulation need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of furthering the identified interest.ward,at.rather,the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.id.at citation omitted.
appellants argue that the city ordinance is not narrowly tailored because it chose to solve its sign problem by the use of an unconstitutional sledge hammer that banned all speech.appellants br.at.the supreme court decision in members of city council taxpayers for vincent is instructive in assessing that contention.there,the court considered the constitutionality of an ordinance that was,in all material respects,similar to the ordinance at issue here.most importantly,like the city ordinance,the ordinance in taxpayers for vincent prohibit ed the posting of signs on public property,at,but not on private property,see id.at.the supreme court held that the taxpayers for vincent ordinance was narrowly tailored to serve the interests of safety and aesthetics because it respond ed precisely to the substantive problem which legitimately concern ed the city and curtail ed no more speech than was necessary to accomplish its purpose.id.at see id.at by banning these signs,the city did no more than eliminate the exact source of the evil it sought to remedy.moreover,the court in taxpayers for vincent reached that conclusion even though the ordinance at issue like the present ordinance was arguably of insufficient scope to fully remedy the evil caused by signs in that it did not ban signs on private property.see id.at the private citizen interest in controlling the use of his own property justifies the disparate treatment.
the city ordinance in this case is,for all practical purposes,indistinguishable from the ordinance upheld in taxpayers for vincent as narrowly tailored to serve the same interests as are implicated here.thus,the city ordinance can be said to curtail no more speech than is necessary to accomplish its purpose.id.at.
appellants argument to the contrary appears to depend on the belief that the city has banned all speech.in reality,however,the ordinance does not ban all speech it bans only signs,and that ban extends only to certain specifically defined portions of city property moreover,it can hardly be denied that the city interest would be more difficult to achieve without the regulation,as the source of the problem the proliferation of signs would otherwise be permitted on city street poles.accordingly,we conclude that the city ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve the government interests in safety and aesthetics.
whether the ordinance leaves open ample alternative channels of communication 
having determined that the city ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,we next examine whether it leaves open ample alternative channels for communication.rappa,at.
appellants contend that the city ordinance does not afford sufficient alternative channels because political posters have unique advantages including low cost and convenience to achieve name recognition,especially in philadelphia gritty urban landscape with no front lawns.appellants br.at.underlying that line of reasoning is the notion that appellants should be afforded the opportunity to speak in their preferred,most,medium.the law,however,provides no such entitlement.see,heffron int l soc y for krishna consciousness,t he first amendment does not guarantee the right to communicate one views at all times and places or in any manner that may be desired.
instead,t he supreme court has required that an alternative means of communication provide only a reasonable opportunity for communication of the speaker message.galena leone,cir.accordingly,a speaker is not entitled to his or her favored or most mode of communication.see,mastrovincenzo city of,f d,cir the requirement that ample alternative channels exist does not imply that alternative channels must be perfect substitutes for those channels denied to plaintiffs by the regulation at hand.he or she must simply be afforded the opportunity to reach the intended audience,startzell city of,cir citation omitted,in an adequate manner,see taxpayers for vincent,at a restriction on expressive activity may be invalid if the remaining modes of communication are inadequate.
it is clear that the city ordinance allows ample alternative avenues for communication.while the ordinance in taxpayers for vincent like the city ordinance prohibited the posting of signs on street poles,the supreme court was satisfied with the district court finding that there was nothing about the posting of political posters on public property that is a uniquely valuable or important mode of communication.at.the court relied on the district court finding that the plaintiffs had several alternative avenues for communication they remain ed free to picket and parade,to distribute handbills,to carry signs and to post their signs and handbills on their automobiles and on private property with the permission of the owners thereof.id.at.
here,too,notwithstanding appellants conclusory pronouncements that there is simply no way to wage a campaign in philadelphia in compliance with the city ordinance,the evidence demonstrates that there are several other avenues of communication.roberts and johnson themselves engaged in other means of campaigning and,in johnson case at least,it was effective he waged a successful campaign in spite of the ordinance restrictions,winning both the democratic primary and the general election for state representative.furthermore,the city ordinance has no bearing on a candidate ability to enjoy what appellants own expert indicated is the single most effective communication technique,namely,placing political posters on private property.see app.at there is absolutely no reasonable or viable alternative for an individual to make his political views known to his neighbor than the venerable political poster in his or her front yard.
as appellants evidently recognize,then,there is tremendous value in being able to post political signs on private property.likewise,the supreme court has noted 
residential signs play an important part in political campaigns,during which they are displayed to signal the resident support for particular candidates,parties,or causes.they may not afford the same opportunities for conveying complex ideas as do other media,but residential signs have long been an important and distinct medium of expression.
