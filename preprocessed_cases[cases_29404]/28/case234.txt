in and illinois adopted two significant changes to its ballot access laws for independent candidates.first,the deadline for independents to file nominating petitions was pushed back from days before the november general election to the same deadline that applies to partisan days before the march primary,or days before the november general election.second,the signature requirement for independent candidates was doubled,from of the vote in the last general election for the office sought to.these changes had a dramatic impact.before,independent candidates for the state legislature qualified for the ballot occasionally,though not frequently.since,year following the second of these a single independent candidate for state legislative office has qualified for ballot access.
david lee wanted to run as an independent candidate for the illinois state senate in.when it became clear to lee that he could not muster the required number of signatures by the deadline so distant from the general election,he abandoned his campaign bid and filed this lawsuit against the members of the illinois state board of elections to challenge the ballot access restrictions.he asserted that the restrictions violated his first and fourteenth amendment rights as a candidate and voter by erecting an unconstitutionally high barrier to ballot access for independent candidates running for the state legislature.the district court upheld the challenged statutes.
we reverse.in combination,the ballot access requirements for independent legislative candidates in early filing deadline,the signature requirement,and the additional statutory restriction that disqualifies anyone who signs an independent candidate nominating petition from voting in the to unconstitutionally burden the freedom of political association guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments.ballot access barriers this are the most restrictive in the nation and have effectively eliminated independent legislative candidacies from the illinois political scene for a quarter of a not sustainable based on the state asserted interest in deterring party splintering,factionalism,and frivolous candidacies.
background 
the relevant facts are not in dispute.illinois law requires an independent candidate for the general state senate and house of qualify for the general election ballot by collecting the signatures of registered voters in his or her legislative district equal to at least of the number of votes cast in that district during the last general election.see.comp.stat.anyone who signs an independent petition is disqualified from voting in the primary election.see.comp.stat.c.aspiring independent candidates must file their nominating petitions with the required number of valid signatures by the same deadline that applies to partisan candidates days before the primary,which is days before the general election.see.comp.stat.this early deadline for independent candidates was adopted in,see session laws,act at the prior deadline was days before the general election.all signatures must be collected within the days immediately preceding the filing deadline.see.comp.stat.
prior to when the requirement was adopted,see session laws,act at,illinois law required independent candidates to collect registered voter signatures equal to only of the votes cast in the previous general election.the record reflects that from through,independent general assembly candidates qualified for the general election ballot.but after illinois doubled the signature requirement to in,only three independents qualified in the election,and no independent legislative candidate has qualified for the ballot since then.
general assembly candidates who are not affiliated with an established political party may also qualify for the general election ballot by filing as new party candidates.a new party candidate must collect signatures from registered voters in his or her district totaling at least of the number of votes cast in that district during the last general election and must submit these signatures days before the general election.see.comp.statt.comp.stat.voters who sign the new party candidate petition must affirmatively declare their intention to form a new party.see.comp.statt.as with independent candidates,new party candidates must collect signatures within the days immediately preceding the filing deadline.see.comp.stat.other than having the required number of registered voters sign nominating petitions and declare their intention to form a new party,candidates running for general assembly under a new party banner need not establish any formal party machinery or field a slate of candidates for any additional offices.but if a new party candidate wins the general election,he or she must organize the party members to hold a primary election in order to appear on subsequent general election ballots for reelection.see vasquez mun.officers electoral,d.
by way of comparison to the other states,illinois deadline for independent legislative candidates to file signed nominating days before the general by far the earliest for the election.ohio march,deadline was the next earliest,but even that was months later than illinois december,cutoff.states set their filing deadlines at june of the election year or later 
illinois signature least as it applied to lee during the likewise more stringent than any other state.the easiest comparison is with the states that,like illinois,require independent candidates to collect signatures from registered voters equal to a specified percentage of the votes cast in the previous general election.among this group of states,illinois signature requirement stands alone it is the only one that exceeds.
some states require independent candidates to collect signatures equal to a percentage of all registered voters in the district.georgia and south carolina have the most demanding requirements among this group,requiring signatures equal to of the number of registered voters in the district.five percent of all registered voters may be more or less than of all votes cast in the preceding general election,so a useful comparison with illinois laws requires a bit of arithmetic.the record shows lee needed to collect valid signatures to qualify for the general election ballot for the senate district.we do not know how many voters were registered in lee district from september to december the window for lee to collect signatures,but as of may,there were registered voters.no one suggests this number of total registered voters changed in any significant way between and,so we use the number for our calculations.
the preliminary calculation is as follows the number of signatures lee was required to collect divided by the number of total registered voters equals rounded off.so for comparison purposes,lee needed to collect signatures from of all registered voters in his district.but any realistic analysis must also account for the fact that voters who sign an independent petition can not vote in the primary election.in illinois senate district,voters participated in the primary election for state senate.based on the sensible assumption that these voters would not have wanted to disqualify themselves from primary participation by signing an independent petition,we can subtract them from the eligible pool of petition signers.accordingly,minus the primary voters leaves divided by equals about,or.the result of all this number crunching is that when measured as an approximate percentage of eligible registered voters,illinois signature requirement for lee in was.
after realizing he would not be able to collect the required signatures by the deadline,lee quit his bid for the state senate and challenged the illinois ballot access statutes by filing suit against the members of the illinois state board of elections the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court entered judgment for the defendants,relying largely on this court opinion in stevenson state board of elections,cir.lee appeals.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court entry of summary judgment de novo and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving parties.scaife cook county,cir.summary judgment should be entered only where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c scaife,at.
we note as a preliminary matter that the parties do not argue mootness we are independently satisfied that we have jurisdiction,even though lee abandoned his bid for the illinois state senate before the november election and that election has been decided.storer brown,d the election is long over but this case is not moot,since the issues properly presented,and their effects on independent candidacies,will persist as the statutes are applied in future elections.this is,therefore,a case where the controversy is capable of repetition,yet evading review.internal quotation marks and citations omitted nader keith,cir there would be no question of the candidate standing to seek an injunction placing his name on the ballot in advance of the submission or even collection of any petitions.tobin for governor.state bd.of elections,cir the cases that traditionally have fallen within the capable of repetition exception have involved challenges to the validity of statutory provisions that will continue to operate past the election in question.the statutes lee challenges thwarted his bid to appear on the ballot and continue to restrict potential independent candidacies for the illinois general assembly.we proceed to the merits of the claim.
the first amendment,as incorporated against the states by the fourteenth amendment,protects the right of citizens to band together in promoting among the electorate candidates who espouse their political views.clingman beaver,d quoting cal.democratic party jones,d.accordingly,the impact of candidate eligibility requirements on voters implicates basic constitutional rights.anderson celebrezze,d.the exclusion of candidates burdens voters freedom of association,because an election campaign is an effective platform for the expression of views on the issues of the day,and a candidate serves as a rallying point for citizens.id.at.also,because voters can assert their preferences only through candidates or parties or both,t he right to vote is heavily burdened if that vote may be cast only for candidates at a time when other parties or other candidates are clamoring for a place on the ballot.id.at.quoting lubin panish,d.
ballot access laws thus place burdens on the right of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs,and the right of qualified voters,regardless of their political persuasion,to cast their votes effectively.both of these rights,of course,rank among our most precious freedoms.williams rhodes,d.illinois filing deadline and signature requirements must be addressed together and their constitutionality determined on the basis of their combined effect on lee political association rights as a voter and candidate.nader,at citing wood meadows,cir.
ballot access restrictions are evaluated under a flexible standard that weighs the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate against the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,taking into consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff rights.burdick takushi,d quoting anderson,at.under this standard,the rigorousness of the court inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens first and fourteenth amendment rights.burdick,at.restrictions that severely burden the exercise of constitutional rights must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance.id.quoting norman reed,d.but reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions that impose less substantial burdens are generally justified by the state important regulatory interests.id.
whether measured by comparison to the ballot access requirements in the other states or by the stifling effect they have had on independent legislative candidacies since their inception,the combined effect of illinois ballot access requirements for independent general assembly candidates falls on the severe end of this sliding scale.the filing the general election still nearly months by far the earliest deadline in the nation.the next earliest filing date is ohio its march deadline falls about months later than illinois and substantially precedes the deadlines set by the great majority of states,of which do not require independents to file until june of the election year or later.
illinois signature requirement also exceeds those of all other states.of the states that require independents to collect signatures equal to a specified percentage of votes cast in the last general election,illinois is the only state that requires more than.as it applied to lee during the election,illinois signature requirement even outstrips the demands of the two states georgia and south carolina that require candidates to collect signatures from of all registered voters.when converted to a percentage of registered voters eligible to sign lee petition,the illinois requirement was.that represents a increase over georgia and south carolina requirements and gives illinois the distinction of having both the most demanding signature collection requirement and by far the earliest filing deadline of all states.
unsurprisingly,the unrivaled severity of these ballot access restrictions has had the effect of thoroughly excluding independent general assembly candidates from illinois ballots.three independents did manage to qualify for the ballot during the first election governed by the increased signature requirement.but in the election cycles since,not a single independent legislative candidate has qualified.the supreme court has held that ballot access history is an important factor in determining whether restrictions impermissibly burden the freedom of political association past experience will be a helpful,if not always unerring,guide it will be one thing if independent candidates have qualified with some regularity and quite a different matter if they have not.storer,at.the inevitable question for judgment is whether a reasonably diligent independent candidate could be expected to satisfy the signature requirements,or will it be only rarely that the unaffiliated candidate will succeed in getting on the ballot id.not only are unaffiliated legislative candidacies rare in illinois,in the last years they have been nonexistent.
because illinois ballot access requirements combine to severely burden the rights of candidates and voters to launch and support independent candidacies,they must be narrowly drawn to advance a compelling state interest.burdick,at.see also timmons twin cities area new party,d.illinois asserts two primary interests it says are served by its ballot access restrictions preventing intraparty feuds and excessive factionalism from invading the general election and assuring that candidates whose names appear on the general election ballot have a significant modicum of support.
there is no question that states have a strong interest in confining party infighting to the primary election and reserving the general election for major political struggles.see timmons,at.burdick,at.states also have a strong interest in preventing voter confusion by limiting ballot access to serious candidates who can demonstrate at least some level of political viability.see anderson,at.jenness fortson,d.we need not decide whether these interests can be considered compelling because illinois has not demonstrated that its early filing deadline and high signature requirement,taken together,are narrowly drawn to the advancement of these interests.
illinois devoted much of its brief to arguing that we need not even engage in the foregoing analysis and should reject lee the filing deadline at a matter of stare decisis based on stevenson state board of elections,at.it is true that stevenson rejected a challenge to illinois early filing deadline for independents,but that decision does not cont
