appellants,electors of the city of los angeles,asserted a postelection challenge to measure r,a ballot measure approved by los angeles voters at the november,consolidated general election.the measure amends the city charter to change the number of terms a city council member can serve from two terms to three terms amends the city charter to prohibit lobbyists from being appointed as city commissioners and to prohibit campaign contributions from lobbyists and lobbying firms to officials and candidates and makes several revisions to the city ethics laws by ordinance.
appellants filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court,seeking an order directing the county of los angeles county,which administered the election,and the city of los angeles city to cease and desist from any action to implement measure r and to repeal any changes in the city charter or los angeles municipal code taken to implement the measure the superior court denied the petition finding that because measure r was not an initiative,the single subject rule imposed by the california constitution does not apply.appellants appeal,asserting measure r violates the california constitution,article ii,section,subdivision d,the single subject rule.we affirm the judgment and denial of appellants motion to vacate.
this is the third time an issue related to measure r has been before this court.there were two preelection challenges to measure r.in the first preelection case,this court issued a published opinion upholding the legality of the ballot title of measure martinez superior court th,d pasley.in the second preelection case,martinez superior court,no.donner,this court,in an order to show cause issued on september,denied preelection review and directed that the measure be included on the november ballot 
measure r originated in a proposal conceived by the los angeles area chamber of commerce chamber and the league of women voters of los angeles league.in july,the chamber and the league in a letter to the city council presented a comprehensive reform measure,entitled city government responsibility,lobbying and ethics reform act.the chamber and league asked the city council to place the measure on the november,los angeles city ballot.the stated purpose of the proposal was to create greater efficiency,accountability and transparency within los angeles city government.the chamber and league urged that we need to create an environment which encourages elected officials to focus on their current job,long as well as short term issues,and not on their next position.
the chamber and league asked the city council to place their proposal on the november election ballot as a city council sponsored ballot measure.
the city council agreed to do so and adopted a motion directing the city attorney to draft an appropriate ordinance and resolutions to place the proposal on the november ballot.pursuant to this directive,the city attorney prepared ordinances and associated resolutions to substantially reflect the language presented by the chamber and league.in doing so,the city attorney revised the language of the proposal to conform to city standards and made other substantive revisions.in a report to the city council,the city attorney observed there was an alternative way to present the measure to the voters.he nevertheless approved as to form and legality the city council election to place all of the provisions suggested in the chamber and league proposal on the november ballot.
los angeles voters approved measure r at the november,statewide general election,by a margin of percent to percent yes votes to no votes.
procedural history 
in december,appellants brought the present challenge to measure r as a petition for writ of mandate against the county and the city.
after briefing and hearing,the trial court concluded that measure r violated the single subject rule,stating the ultimate purpose of the single subject requirement of the california constitution is to prevent politicians and special interests from manipulating the initiative process by bundling together measures to force voters to accept all or none of them,when,if they were submitted to the voters separately,the voters would likely accept some and reject others.such manipulation is precisely the effect of the bundling in this case.it is likely that many voters would vote one way on the and ethics provisions of measure r,and the opposite way on the term limits provisions,if they were given an opportunity to do so.the trial court,however,found the single subject rule did not apply to measure r because it was not an initiative.
the court found that the city council did not propose an initiative when it voted to submit measure r to the voters,and the single subject requirement imposed by the california constitution upon initiative measures did not apply to the measure.the court therefore denied appellants petition for writ of mandate and entered a judgment in favor of respondents.the court later denied appellants motion to vacate the judgment.
appellants timely appeal from the judgment and order denying their motion to vacate the judgment 
standard of review 
this court review of the trial court legal determinations is de novo.see,city of rancho cucamonga regional water quality control bd.th,d.we determine whether substantial evidence supports the trial court factual determinations.ibid.
discussion 
presumption of validity 
at the outset,we address the city argument that measure r deserves a presumption of validity because of this court prior ruling in pasley,supra,th,d and because the voters overwhelmingly approved measure r at the november election.relying on senate of the state of cal.jones cal th,d,jones,the city argues our supreme court has held that a court refusal to grant preelection review in a single subject case means the challengers have not established a strong likelihood the measure is invalid.they further assert it is wholly unjustified to allow the voters to pass a measure only to confront the voters with a judicial decree that the voters action was in vain.id.at,d.we disagree.
jones stated only that preelection review might be appropriate upon a clear showing of invalidity.jones,supra,cal th at,d,quoting brosnahan eu cal d,brosnahan i.as the high court has explained,a majority of the court in brosnahan i was not persuaded that,in that instance,the challenged initiative violated the rule and thus had deferred ruling on the merits of a single subject challenge to the initiative at issue until after the election.jones,supra,at,d.absent some clear showing of invalidity,the court further elucidated,it is usually more appropriate to review constitutional and other challenges to ballot propositions or initiative measures after an election rather than to disrupt the electoral process by preventing the exercise of the people franchise.brosnahan i,supra,at.
the city overstates the implication of jones discussion to the case at hand.in pasley,we examined only the issue whether the ballot title adopted by the city council for measure r complies with the election law.pasley,supra,th at,d.we held that the ballot title was neither false nor misleading and that it was not partial to one side.id.at,d.we did not reach the merits of whether the ballot measure violated the single subject rule or,indeed,whether that rule applied to the measure.an opinion is authority only for a proposition actually considered and decided.in re chavez cal th,d.
the issue whether measure r is subject to or violated the single subject rule was squarely before us in donner.the donner matter came before us after the superior court,on september,directed the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the county and the city clerk to remove measure r from the november election ballot.
the city sought relief by filing a petition for writ of mandate with this court,and we issued an emergency order on september,directing the superior court to show cause why it should not be compelled to vacate its order and judgment in donner and issue a new and different order denying the petition in that matter.we also issued a temporary stay order,thereby allowing m
