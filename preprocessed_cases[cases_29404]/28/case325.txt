since statehood in,alaska has selected its state judges through a system generically and popularly known as merit selection.the governor appoints judges from a list of nominees selected from all applicants by a merit selection commission.in alaska,all judges must be lawyers.lawyers therefore play a significant role on the merit selection commission.the commission,known as the judicial council,is chaired by the chief justice of the alaska supreme court and composed of six additional lay members appointed by the governor and confirmed by the legislature,and three attorney members appointed by the board of governors of the alaska bar association.the board is the association governing body and membership in the association is mandatory for all lawyers practicing in the state.
this suit is an attack on alaska merit selection system,brought by a group of individuals seeking to establish the principle that all participants in the judicial selection process must either be popularly elected,or be appointed by a popularly elected official.thus,plaintiffs seek to enjoin operation of the alaska system because three members of the judicial council are appointed by the governing body of the alaska bar association,which is in turn elected by the bar membership and not by the public at large.
plaintiffs are to find legal support for the principle they seek to establish.in the district court,plaintiffs urged that the selection of the alaska bar association board of governors by lawyers amounted to a violation of equal protection.the district court dismissed the action,holding that the election of the board of governors,and the board of governors appointment of three lawyers to the judicial council,did not constitute a violation of equal protection because the role assigned to lawyers was rationally related to the state interest in selecting a qualified judiciary composed of lawyers.
on appeal,plaintiffs touch upon a number of legal principles discussed in various election cases.none of their arguments leads to any different result than that reached by the district court.the legal principle plaintiffs ask the courts to establish is in fact a change in policy that requires amendment to the alaska constitution.to date,there is no indication of any desire on the part of plaintiffs to invoke the amendment process.
the subject of judicial merit selection is not new to the federal courts.voters in at least two other states have brought challenges to merit selection systems that similarly rely on attorney input in the nomination of candidates to the governor.see bradley work,aff,cir voting rights legal defense fund,missouri.aavrldf,aff,cir per curiam unpublished.in bradley,minority voters challenged the merit selection system for county judges in indiana,which,like this case,involved a nominating commission composed in part of attorney members selected by the licensed attorneys of the county.at.the district court upheld the system as consistent with the equal protection clause,id.at,and the voters did not pursue the issue on appeal.bradley,at.similarly,in aavrldf,voters in missouri alleged they were denied equal protection of the laws because they were at the time underrepresented in the missouri bar association,which selected attorney members of a nominating commission.aavrldf.at.the district court upheld the constitutionality of missouri merit selection system because its purpose was not invidious discrimination.id.at.the eighth circuit affirmed in an unpublished opinion.aavrldf,at.
because the federal litigation has not resulted in any precedential opinion in any circuit,this case has gained the attention of individuals and groups with an interest in either protecting or replacing merit selection.this litigation,therefore,must be seen as part of a larger controversy generated by attacks on merit selection by proponents of popularly elected judges.see,michael debow et,the case for partisan judicial elections,tol.attacking merit selection brian fitzpatrick,the politics of merit selection.evaluating politicization of merit selection process sandra day,the essentials and expendables of the missouri plan.defending merit selection.we therefore take this opportunity to publish an opinion dealing with the issues plaintiffs raise as best we are able to perceive them.we turn first,however,to the background of merit selection in alaska and of this litigation.
alaska merit selection system 
alaska constitution and statutes establish a merit selection system for appointing state judges.the system was adopted,after extensive debate,at the constitutional convention in,when alaska was still a territory.see generally alaska constitutional convention minutes accm,days and and,available at.the alaska constitution was ratified by alaska voters and approved by congress,which found it to be republican in form and in conformity with the constitution of the united states and the principles of the declaration of independence.alaska statehood act,stat.
the system in the alaska constitution is based on the missouri plan,developed in missouri in the and later adopted in whole or in part by states and washington,although there is no uniform approach to selection,there are characteristics common to the systems utilized by alaska and other states.these characteristics include,among others vesting responsibility for screening applicants and recommending candidates in an independent,or nominating commission specifying that the nominating commission be composed of both lay people and lawyers and requiring the governor to make an appointment from a list of nominees submitted by the commission.
the alaska constitution prescribes judicial selection for the constitutionally created courts the alaska supreme court and the alaska superior court,which is the trial court of general jurisdiction for the state.alaska const.art.iv.the alaska legislature,by statute,adopted the same selection procedures for the judges of alaska other state courts.alaska stat,a,e.
the system requires the governor to appoint each judge from a list of applicants nominated as most qualified by an independent constitutional body,the alaska judicial council judicial council or council.alaska const.art.iv.the council consists of the alaska supreme court chief justice,three citizens appointed by the governor and confirmed by the legislature,and three attorneys appointed by the board of governors of the alaska bar association.alaska const.art.iv.the constitution describes the organization of the judicial council as follows 
the judicial council shall consist of seven members.three attorney members shall be appointed for terms by the governing body of the organized state bar.three members shall be appointed for terms by the governor subject to confirmation by a majority of the members of the legislature in joint session.vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term in like manner.appointments shall be made with due consideration to area representation and without regard to political affiliation.the chief justice of the supreme court shall be the seventh member and chairman of the judicial council.no member of the judicial council,except the chief justice,may hold any other office or position of profit under the united states or the state.the judicial council shall act by concurrence of four or more members and according to rules which it adopts.
the alaska bar association board of governors is the governing body of the organized state bar and is responsible for appointing three of the seven members of the judicial council.see alaska stat.the alaska bar is governed by the board of governors of the alaska bar.alaska const.art.iv,delegating to board of governors the power to appoint three members of the judicial council.the board of governors consists of three citizens appointed by the governor and confirmed by the legislature,and nine attorneys elected by the active members of the bar association.alaska stat.b a.in order to practice law in alaska,an attorney must be a member of the bar.id.a.only active bar members are eligible to vote for the nine attorney members of the board of governors.alaska stat.alaska bar bylaws art.iv.active members of the bar have passed a bar examination,paid their dues,and met the bar association standard of character and fitness.alaska bar rules.
alaska statehood founders explicitly debated this structure at the state constitutional convention.see accm,days and and.at the convention,the chair of the committee on the judiciary branch,george mclaughlin,explained to the convention delegates that judicial independence suffers when judges are elected,and that an appointive system would prevent the state judiciary from being controlled by a political machine.accm,day.mclaughlin also explained the importance of having attorney members on the judicial council,because they are knowledgeable about the strengths and weaknesses of fellow attorneys with whom they work 
the whole theory of the missouri plan is that in substance,a select and professional group,licensed by the state,can best determine the qualifications of their brothers.the intent of the missouri plan was in substance to give a predominance of the vote to professional men who knew the foibles,the defects and the qualifications of their brothers.it is unquestionably true that in every trade and every profession the men who know their brother careerists the best are the men engaged in the same type of occupation.that was the theory of the missouri plan.the theory was that the bar association would attempt to select the best men possible for the bench because they had to work under them.
accm,day.mclaughlin also explained the importance of having the bar association,rather than the governor,appoint the attorney representatives,because they represent no outside interests 
the three who are appointed by the bar are there,based solely on their professional qualifications but selected because they would represent in theory the best thinking of the bar,and they are there solely because they represent their craft.
id.he described the involvement of the state bar association in the selection of the attorney members as the very essence of the missouri plan.id.
another delegate proposed an amendment that would have required legislative confirmation of the attorney members of the council.id.delegate mclaughlin spoke against the proposal,arguing that the members should not have to be acceptable politically 
i f this motion is passed you might as well tear up the whole proposal and provide for the election of juries,because then it would be more efficacious and more democratic if you require a confirmation of your attorney members you can promptly see what will happen.the selection is not then made by the organized bar on the basis of a man professional qualifications alone.the determination of the selection of those people who are on the judicial council will be qualified by the condition,are they acceptable to a house and a senate or a senate alone,which is essentially democratic or essentially republican if political correctness enters into the determination of those professional members who are to be placed upon the judicial council,the whole system goes out the window.
id.delegate ralph rivers concurred 
i want to heartily second the remarks of mclaughlin but also want to point out that the purpose of the draft as now written is to have a selection of these lawyer members,and the minute you adopt something like this,you are making a partisanship proposition out of it.we want to carry through to a selection of judges 
id.the proposal to require legislative confirmation of the lawyers appointed to the judicial council failed by a vote of nays to four yeas,with two absent.id.
alaska has followed the judicial selection system adopted at the constitutional convention for over years.every judge who has been appointed since statehood has been appointed by the governor from the list of people nominated by the judicial council.
in practice,the judicial selection process begins when the judicial council receives notice that a vacancy exists or is about to occur.the council then begins seeking applicants for the open position by issuing notification of the vacancy to the public and the alaska bar association.the council screening process involves an application form and a comprehensive investigation into the applicant education,employment,credit,and criminal records.the judicial council solicits information from references,and interviews all applicants.the public is invited to comment on applicants by letter or email,and the council holds a public hearing to receive testimony.
after reviewing the information gathered,the council meets to vote for the candidates who will be sent to the governor as nominees.any action of the council to recommend a candidate requires the concurrence of four or more members,alaska const.art.iv,and the council must recommend at least two candidates for any vacant position,id.art.iv.the governor must appoint one of the council nominees within days of receiving the nominations.alaska stat.a.the governor is bound by the nominees presented to him the governor may neither select a person other than those nominated,nor ask the council for additional nominations.see alaska const.art.iv.
once a judge is nominated by the judicial council and appointed by the governor,the judge is subject to a retention election at the first general election held more than three years after appointment.id.art.iv.
procedural background 
this is a suit by individual voters against the members of the judicial council.plaintiffs,kenneth kirk,carl anders ekstrom,and michael miller collectively plaintiffs,are all registered voters in the state of alaska.kirk is also an active member of the alaska bar association and a former and potential future applicant for vacant positions on the alaska supreme court and the alaska superior court.ekstrom is a member of the board of governors.
defendants are the seven members of the alaska judicial council in their official capacities.they include chief justice walter carpeneti of the alaska supreme court,as well as the three attorney members and the three members of the council.
plaintiffs suit arose in in connection with an imminent vacancy on the alaska supreme court created when justice robert eastaugh announced his anticipated retirement.on april,the council invited members of the bar to apply for the position to be filled pursuant to alaska merit selection procedures.in july,plaintiffs filed a complaint and motion for preliminary injunction in the united states district court for the district of alaska alleging that their constitutional right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution was violated by alaska merit selection system,as prescribed in alaska constitution art.iv,sections and,and as implemented by alaska statutes sections,and.
plaintiffs sought to enjoin the three attorney members of the council from exercising their powers to deliberate and vote on nominees to fill the vacancy created by justice eastaugh retirement.as a corollary matter,in order to allow the remaining lay members of the judicial council to act,plaintiffs sought to enjoin the requirement that four votes were needed for the council to propose a nomination.
defendants moved to dismiss,arguing that the judicial selection system did not violate equal protection.after a hearing,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss and denied plaintiffs consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction.the district court identified the three stages of involved in alaska merit selection system and concluded that none violates the equal protection clause.the district court first looked at the overall appointment of judicial nominees,and held that the general one person,one vote rule first established in legislative redistricting cases does not apply to judicial elections and appointments.the district court then examined the two steps preceding the judicial appointment itself the election of the board of governors by the alaska bar association,and the board of governors appointment of attorney members to the judicial council.the district court held that the election of the board of governors by the membership of the alaska bar association did not violate
