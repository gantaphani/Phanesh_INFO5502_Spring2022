we are asked to decide whether the city of santa monica refusal to permit a candidate for the city council to designate his occupation as peace activist on the city election ballot violates the candidate rights of free speech and equal protection.because the ballot regulation prohibiting status designations is politically neutral and the city offers alternative channels of communication,we hold that the regulation does not severely burden a candidate first amendment rights.the city interest in preserving the simplicity of its ballot is an important one,and the regulation is not unreasonable.
ii.factual background 
jerry rubin was qualified to run as a candidate for the santa monica city council in the election.on august,rubin his nomination papers for candidacy to the santa monica city clerk,maria stewart.his filing included his candidate statement and his optional ballot designation of peace activist.
a candidate statement is a statement of words or less published by the city of santa monica and dispersed to voters at the city expense,in which a candidate may describe his or her background,education,and qualification for the position sought.
a ballot designation may take one of three forms under california elections code 
words designating the elective city,county,district,state,or federal office which the candidate holds at the time of filing the nomination documents to which he or she was elected by vote of the people,or to which he or she was appointed,in the case of a superior or municipal court judge.
the word incumbent if the candidate is a candidate for the same office which he or she holds at the time of filing the nomination papers,and was elected to that office by a vote of the people,or,in the case of a superior or municipal court judge,was appointed to that office.
no more than three words designating either the current principal professions,vocations,or occupations of the candidate,or the principal professions,vocations,or occupations of the candidate during the calendar year immediately preceding the filing of nomination documents.
the statute further mandates that n either the secretary of state nor any other election official shall accept a designation that would mislead the voter.cal.b.
to implement these standards,the secretary of state promulgated specific ballot designation regulations.these regulations define occupation as 
the employment in which one regularly engages or follows as the means of making a livelihood.examples of an acceptable designation of an occupation as defined in elections code,subdivision a,include,but are not limited to,rancher,restaurateur,retail salesperson,manual laborer,construction worker,computer manufacturing executive,military pilot,secretary and police officer.
the regulations further categorize certain designations as unacceptable 
a the secretary of state shall reject as unacceptable any proposed ballot designation which fails to comply with,or is otherwise inappropriate pursuant to,elections code,subdivision a is prohibited pursuant to elections code,subdivision b is misleading 
b the following types of activities are distinguished from professions,vocations,and occupations and are not acceptable as ballot designations pursuant to elections code,subdivision a 
statuses a status is a state,condition,social position,or legal relation of the candidate to another person,persons,or the community as a whole.a status is generic in nature and generally fails to identify with any particular specificity the manner by which the candidate earns his or her livelihood or spends the substantial majority of his or her time.examples of a status include,but are not limited to,philanthropist,activist,patriot,taxpayer,concerned citizen,husband,wife,and the like.
although the city of santa monica is not required to follow the state regulations for its local elections,it chooses to do so.when city clerk maria stewart accepted rubin nomination papers,she informed him that he could not designate himself a peace activist because the phrase constituted an impermissible status designation under california election regulations.stewart asked rubin to supply her with an alternative ballot designation,but rubin declined.
on september,rubin filed a complaint in federal court against the city of santa monica,city clerk stewart,and secretary of state bill jones,alleging both statutory and constitutional violations.he simultaneously filed a motion for a temporary restraining order tro and a preliminary injunction to force the city of santa monica to accept his peace activist ballot designation.rubin application for a tro and motion for a preliminary injunction were both denied.
secretary of state bill jones moved to dismiss the case against him on the grounds that the complaint failed to state a claim,that the court lacked jurisdiction,and that rubin lacked standing.on january,the district court issued a minute order granting jones motion to dismiss.the court soon thereafter issued a written order granting jones motion and sua sponte issued an order to show cause why entire case should not be dismissed as respects the city defendants.after additional briefing,the district court issued its final order dismissing the case,holding that the term peace activist is not a profession,occupation,or vocation as defined by the relevant regulations,and the ballot designation restrictions do not impose severe burdens on rubin first amendment rights,and that the restrictions are justified by the city important regulatory interests.although the court noted that the city presented substantial evidence to the effect that rubin did not earn his living as a peace activist,it assumed for the purpose of its decision that he did.
iii.standard of review 
we review de novo the constitutionality of a state statute.montana chamber of commerce argenbright,cir.
we also review de novo the dismissal of a party under federal rule of civil procedure b.zimmerman city of oakland,cir.when reviewing a b dismissal,the facts set forth in a plaintiff complaint are to be interpreted liberally and taken as true for the purpose of determining whether or not a basis for the plaintiff complaint exists.hishon king spalding,d.a dismissal may be affirmed on any proper ground,even if the district court did not reach the issue or relied on different grounds or reasoning.oscar.students.ass n,cir.
iv.jurisdiction and mootness 
we have jurisdiction over the district court final order of dismissal pursuant to.
the city of santa monica argues that,because the november,election has long since come and gone,the issues rubin raises on appeal are moot.generally,a case is rendered moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.schaefer townsend,cir citations omitted.however,a court is not precluded from exercising jurisdiction over an otherwise moot case where,as here,the case is capable of repetition,yet evading review.id.
although the city of santa monica election has passed,rubin claims are capable of repetition because future city election overseers would deny him the ability to use the designation peace activist on the ballot.the short span of time between the filing deadline and the election makes such a challenge evasive of review.id.candidate claim that residency requirements denied him the right to file a declaration of candidacy not rendered moot upon passing of election.as we have previously noted,i f election law cases were rendered moot by the occurrence of an election,many constitutionally suspect laws could never reach appellate review.id.quoting joyner mofford,cir alteration in the original.we accordingly exercise jurisdiction over rubin appeal.
california elections code a and california code of regulations do not violate rubin freedom of speech.election regulation and the first amendment 
rubin contends that,because california elections code and california code of regulations prevent him from designating himself a peace activist on the election ballot,the laws violate his freedom of speech and are unconstitutional both facially and as applied to him.
rubin and the city of santa monica analyze this case under the public forum principles announced in perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.rubin argues that a ballot is a limited public forum requiring strict scrutiny,while the city says that a ballot is a forum requiring only rational basis review.as we see it,the issue is not whether a ballot is some sort of public forum,but whether,applying supreme court election law,california ballot regulations constitute severe burdens on free speech rights.see timmons twin cities area new party,d.
in election regulation cases,the supreme court developed a balancing test to resolve the tension between a candidate first amendment rights and the state interest in preserving the fairness and integrity of the voting process.when deciding whether a state election law violates first and fourteenth amendment speech rights,courts are to weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the state rule imposes on those rights against the interests the state contends justify that burden,and consider the extent to which the state concerns make the burden necessary.id.quoting burdick takushi,d citations and internal quotations omitted.regulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs rights must be narrowly tailored and advance a compelling state interest.lesser burdens,however,trigger less exacting review,and a state important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions.id.citations omitted.the cases reiterate that n o bright line separates permissible regulation from unconstitutional infringements on first amendment freedoms,and that courts are required to make hard judgments given the interests involved.id.
the election regulations do not impose a severe burden on rubin right of free speech.
there is little question but that rubin speech is burdened by the restriction placed on how he may designate his occupation on the ballot.it is the severity of that burden,however,that determines the standard of review by which we judge the state interest and,accordingly,decide whether the restriction is unconstitutional.see id.
courts will uphold as not severe restrictions that are generally applicable,politically neutral,and which protect the reliability and integrity of the election process.see hussey city of portland,cir.this is true even when the regulations have the effect of channeling expressive activities at the polls.timmons,at.upholding city law prohibiting candidates from appearing as the candidate of more than one party on the ballot citation omitted.see also burdick,at.upholding prohibition of votes on election day where it was otherwise easy for candidates to appear on the ballots.recognizing that there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest,storer brown,d,the supreme court recently noted the propriety of requirements as to procedure and safeguards which experience shows are necessary to ensure the fundamental right involved.cook gralike,d citation omitted.
a restriction is particularly unlikely to be considered severe when a candidate is given other means of disseminating the desired information.in timmons,for example,the united states supreme court upheld a law prohibiting candidates from listing more than one party affiliation on the ballot,in part because the party retained great latitude in its ability to communicate its support for that candidate notwithstanding the minor ballot prohibition.timmons,at.in burdick,the supreme court upheld a hawaii law prohibiting voters from writing in names of candidates on election day,citing as justification the ease of access candidates otherwise have to hawaii ballots.burdick,at.similarly,in schrader blackwell,the sixth circuit upheld the constitutionality of a regulation that prohibited unrecognized party designations,such as libertarian,because reasonable means existed for a party to become recognized.schrader,cir.
courts will strike down state election laws as severe speech restrictions only when they significantly impair access to the ballot,stifle core political speech,or dictate electoral outcomes.for example,cook,at,overturned a law requiring ballots to contain notations describing whether or not the candidate supports term limits,holding that it punishes candidates on the basis of core political speech and dictates electoral outcomes.buckley american constitutional law foundation,d,similarly overturned a requirement that petition circulators wear badges and publish identifying information,because the regulation hinders core political speech.in eu san francisco county democratic central committee,d,the united states supreme court struck a regulation prohibiting official governing bodies of political parties from giving endorsements to candidates,holding that the law burdened core political speech.likewise,in rosen brown,cir,the sixth circuit invalidated a regulation prohibiting the political party designation of independent while permitting republican or democrat designations,holding that party labels designate the views of party candidates and the regulations therefore hinder core political speech.
applying these principles to the case at hand,we hold that the city of santa monica prohibition of status designations such as activist does not severely burden a candidate first amendment rights.
first,the regulation is viewpoint neutral.any use of the term activist is banned from the ballot whether used alone or with any additional description.peace activists and defense activists are treated the same.so are right to life activists and activists.the city viewpoint neutrality distinguishes the case before us from rosen,in which the sixth circuit held that prohibiting the designation independent was unconstitutional where the regulations allowed for other political party designations.rosen,at.as the schrader court noted,party labels provide a shorthand designation of the views of party candidates on matters of public concern.schrader,at.the regulation therefore affects core political speech.
second,even though the regulation prevents rubin from communicating his status as a peace activist on the ballot,it does not infringe on core political speech,or favor one type of political speech over another.the regulation does not prevent rubin from supporting or discussing political issues,it merely limits how he may describe his occupation on the ballot.in this way,the california law stands in stark contrast to the statute in cook.in cook,the supreme court struck down a missouri law requiring disregarded voters instruction on term limits or declined to pledge to support term limits to be placed on the ballot next to the names of certain candidates.cook,at.
third,the city of santa monica regulations provide rubin with an ample channel for communicating his peace activities to the public.california elections code allows the candidate to submit a candidate statement,in which the candidate may describe his background,education,and qualifications in up to words.the statements are published by the city,at the city expense,in a voter information pamphlet and distributed prior to the election to all registered voters within santa monica.rubin does not deny that he could have used those words to describe his peace activism to the public at the city expense.this device greatly decreases the burden imposed by the ballot restriction.see,timmons,at.upholding law prohibiting candidates from listing more than one party affiliation on the ballot,in part,because the party retains great latitude in its ability to communicate its support for that candidate notwithstanding the minor ballot prohibition.
rubin argues that the candidate statement does not cure the problem caused by the ballot restriction because the ballot designation is the last thing they see as they punch their ballots.see anderson martin,d.while there is no denying the importance of a ballot,the supreme court has recognized that b allots serve primarily to elect candidates,not as forums for political expression.timmons,at.a ballot is a ballot,not a bumper sticker.cities and states have a legitimate interest in assuring that the purpose of a ballot is not transform
