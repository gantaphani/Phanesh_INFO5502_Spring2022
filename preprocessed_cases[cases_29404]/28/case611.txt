in this original proceeding,the honorable karen angelini,currently justice of the fourth court of appeals,place five,seeks mandamus relief against charles soechting,state chair of the texas democratic party.the latter initially listed lauro bustamante as a candidate for place seven on the fourth court of appeals,then at the filing deadline as a candidate for place five,then after the deadline as disqualified,and finally as a candidate for place five again after this court issued three opinions on january,because we find fact issues that must be determined after a hearing on the merits,we deny the petition for writ of mandamus.
angelini alleges multiple defects in bustamante filings that could not be cured by the filing deadline.the facsimile date and time stamps on the filings indicate that they were transmitted to the party between and on january,the filing deadline angelini reports that a democratic party representative told her bustamante papers were actually received before the deadline,but that the party facsimile clock had not been reset from daylight savings time.in any case,angelini argues that our decision in francis did not authorize relief for a like bustamante,citing the following 
w e emphasize several limitations on today holding.first,it concerns only facial defects that are apparent from the four corners of a candidate filings it does not reach forgery,fraud,or other defects discoverable only by independent investigation.second,it concerns only early filings that allow time for corrections after the state chair review no additional time will be available for candidates who file at the last minute so that review can not be completed before the filing deadline.third,it does not allow political parties or candidates to ignore statutory deadlines it allows candidates only the time that the election code was designed to give them.fourth,it concerns only defective filings that have erroneously been approved it does not change what the election code says party chairs should and must reject 
as bustamante did not file until at or after the deadline,she argues that the state chair did not review it until after the deadline,did not erroneously approve it,and did not deny bustamante the opportunity to cure that the election code provides to early filers.
in response,bustamante has filed an affidavit in which he states that the democratic party reviewed his filings as each page arrived and approved them.further,he challenges the authenticity and veracity of all angelini evidence about his filings.finally,he avers that he had time to correct any mistakes before the filing deadline because he had staff,computers,facsimile machines,and a notary available.
it is well established texas law that an appellate court may not deal with disputed areas of fact in an original mandamus proceeding.there are several such factual disputes here,including whether bustamante filed his documents before the deadline,whether he complied with all statutory requirements except for facial defects that are apparent within their four corners,whether the party had sufficient time to complete its statutory review of his filings before the deadline whether after that review but before the deadline the party erroneously notified bustamante that his filings complied with statutory requirements and whether bustamante could have cured any facial errors before the deadline had the state chair properly notified him of those defects.if the trial court answers any of these questions no,then we agree angelini would be entitled to mandamus relief the parties may of course raise legal and factual issues other than these.
we decline the dissent invitation to disqualify bustamante without giving him a hearing.first,he does not admit that his filings were defective that is instead our colleague conclusion.while he avers that he had time for corrections,he never concedes that his filings needed any.more important,he challenges the authenticity and veracity of the copies of his filings submitted by angelini,the only basis upon which we could make any decision.
second,in concluding that bustamante filed only signatures that complied with the election code,the dissent decides several factual and legal issues without a hearing and barely any mention.bustamante petition contains almost signatures,but the dissent disqualifies all but because only two petition pages were signed by a circulator.voters signatures are valid under the election code if they appear in the same part of the petition as the circulator affidavit,and the same page of the petition as other items like the place number discussed in francis we need not decide today whether part and page are the same because,depending on what facts the trial court finds,it may be irrelevant in this case.
the dissent approach to defects in a candidate filings has not been the law for several years.a majority not a plurality of this court held in gamble that defective filings could be remedied after the filing deadline to correct a party official violation of a statutory duty gamble concerned an application for office rather than a petition,but the election code treats the two as one document so we can not treat them differently.
any mystery about the duty of state party chairs can be cleared up by reading the statute,which does not require them to do the work for any candidate,but does require them to review filings as soon as practicable after receipt and immediately deliver written notice of defects if the legislature intended for candidates to get what the dissent thinks they deserve,there would be no reason for state chairs to review anything before the deadline,and certainly no reason to move quickly.
as both angelini and bustamante are unopposed in their respective primaries,there should be ample time before the general election in november for a trial court to make its findings,and for any appellate review to be conducted first in the court of appeals rather than this court.generally,such proceedings must be presented first to the court of appeals unless there is a compelling reason not to do so.
for the foregoing reasons,we deny the petition for writ of mandamus.
i agree that mandamus relief should be denied because factual disputes exist.once that conclusion has been reached and expressed,however,no further controversy is before us as this matter is postured.i would not opine as to what relief is appropriate in the event of future hearings and if particular factual determinations result from those hearings.
further,although i joined with justice wainwright in dissenting from the court decisions in francis and holcomb and still believe that those cases were wrongly decided,the cases are now precedent of this court.thus,i can not join his dissent.i concur in the court decision to deny relief.
the court acknowledges that the respondent petition did not comply at the filing deadline with the requirements of the texas election code,yet it refuses to grant the mandamus and hold that respondent did not qualify as a candidate for justice of the fourth court of appeals,place.i therefore respectfully dissent.
on the filing deadline,lauro bustamante petition to be certified as a primary candidate for the court of appeals for the fourth district,place,contained less than half of the required signatures.code e.this assumes,notwithstanding all the reasons not to,that the circulator signature on two petition pages validated the petition signatures on other parts of his petition see section ii,infra.rather than simply affirm the invalidity of the petition and enforce the election code stricture that only candidates who comply with its requisites by the deadline may be certified for the ballot,the court extends the legislative deadline so bustamante can attempt to cure the defects in his petition.see.code.the legislature considered judgment notwithstanding,the court in this case grants a extension of the deadline.
all parties before the party bustamante respondent charles soechting,chairman of the texas democratic executive committee and relator,the honorable karen angelini,justice of the court of appeals for the fourth district,place that bu
