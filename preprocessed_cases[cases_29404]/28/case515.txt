introduction 
trung nguyen seeks,in this appeal from a judgment after an election contest,to be declared the winner of an election for an orange county supervisorial seat.the winner of the election,as certified by the county registrar of voters after a recount,was janet nguyen.that is,after the recount,janet nguyen had the highest number of legal votes among all those running for the office.trung nguyen theory is that janet nguyen requested a statutorily incorrect methodology for the recount,and therefore the recount itself was invalid,and he is thus entitled to take office as the certified winner of the election based on the results prior to the recount.
in specific terms,trung nguyen asserts this janet nguyen request that paper absentee ballots be recounted by hand but ballots cast by direct recording electronic dre machines be recounted electronically ipso facto invalidated the recount.he contends that sections and of the elections code do not permit a recount in which paper absentee ballots or valid paper provisional ballots are recounted one way manually,but electronic ballots are recounted another electronically.
as we explain in detail below,this argument is not persuasive.there can be no doubt that,in a recount,paper ballots may be recounted manually while electronic ballots may be recounted electronically.a recount requester does,of course,have the right to have electronic votes recounted manually,and if they are,the manual count governs over any electronic count.
moreover,even if trung nguyen statutory analysis is correct,two undisputed facts require us to affirm the judgment in janet nguyen favor 
trung nguyen presented absolutely no evidence to the trial court that a manual recount of the electronic ballots in this case would have made any difference.a manual recount would have been performed by examining an internal printout of each voter choices recorded by the machine and then kept within the machine.there are in this case,conspicuously,no allegations,much less evidence,that the electronic voting machines in this particular election were tampered with,manipulated,or in any way electronically recorded anything other than a totally accurate vote count.to be sure,trung nguyen did present evidence that the particular kind of machine used in the election could be tampered with.but he did not present any evidence that any machines in this orange county,california election were tampered with,or were in any way inaccurate.
trung nguyen deliberately decided to waive the right that he had to ask the trial court in his election contest to order the electronic ballots to be recounted manually.there is no question that if such a recount was necessary for a proper determination of his election contest,the trial court would have been obligated to order such a recount.see enterprise residents legal action against annexation com.brennan cal d,fn.rather,in open court,trung nguyen disavowed his right to have a manual recount of the electronic ballots.rather,he chose to stake his entire case on the idea that he is entitled,as a matter of law,to be placed in office by the courts as a result of an election contest based on what he claims is a statutorily invalid recount.
as we show below,our supreme court has made it clear in numerous cases that election results are not to be invalidated based on the technical with election statutes where there is no showing that the would have made any actual difference to the election.under that line of jurisprudence,we can not reverse the judgment even if trung nguyen statutory arguments regarding the kinds of recount permitted by sections and were.
finally,there is no way that this court,on this particular record,could legally declare trung nguyen the winner in this case.simply put,there is no substantial evidence that he received the highest number of legal votes in the election.a court can not declare a candidate the winner who has not received the highest number of legal votes.bradley perrodin th,d.the most that trung nguyen might achieve in this appeal is a judgment annulling the february election and holding a new one,but that is relief he manifestly does not seek.
ii.a glossary 
election cases often have their own nomenclature,which is not always obvious or intuitive to lay readers.here is a quick glossary of terms and abbreviations that are relevant to this case 
dre stands for direct recording electronic,that is,it represents an electronic voting machine.in the present case,the dre machines worked this way a voter arrives at his or her polling place and is given a code.when the voter enters the booth,he or she enters the code into the machine.the voter then uses a small wheel to scroll through the names of the various candidates and offices when the voter wishes to cast a vote for a candidate,he or she presses a button corresponding to the candidate indicated on the scroll.after completing all voting,the voting machine prints a paper facsimile of the votes cast by the voter,which allows that voter to confirm that the machine is indeed correctly recording the votes cast by the voter.the paper facsimile is displayed through a pane of glass,but is not given to the voter.rather,the printout is kept by the machine internally.
vvpat stands for voter verified paper audit trail,which is the paper facsimile printed out by the dre machine which the voter sees through the pane of glass but does not keep.as mentioned above,the printout is stored inside the dre machine.we should note here that the vvpat printouts are relatively fragile pieces of paper as anyone who ever experienced a paper jam in an office printer knows,that would not qualify as proper paper ballots in an election where a voter was casting his or her votes by means of a paper ballot.
mbb stands for mobile ballot box,but it is really a computer memory storage device inside a dre machine that electronically records the various votes made by a voter on a dre machine.when the votes are counted,the data on the mbb is downloaded in order to ascertain the vote count from the machine.
official canvass is the actual,public process of processing and tallying all ballots received in an election,that is,the official counting of the votes.
percent manual tally is a procedure used in california to test whether there are any discrepancies between the electronic record generated by a voting machine and what is essentially a manual audit of that electronic record.essentially,after each election,the official conducting the election is to conduct a public manual tally of the ballots tabulated by any voting machines cast in percent of the precincts chosen at random by the elections official.in the case of electronic voting machines with internal printouts or vvpats,there is no question that the vvpats trump any difference between them and the electronic record of the vote,subd.b.
illegal vote is a vote that has not been cast in the manner provided by law.gooch hendrix cal th,d,gooch see also bush head cal,bush the term illegal votes,as used in this section,clearly includes votes cast by persons not privileged to vote and votes not entitled to be counted because not cast in the manner provided by law.conversely,a legal vote is one which has been cast in a manner provided by law.for example,absentee ballots not delivered to the official from whom they came in violation of section are clearly illegal and can not be counted.gooch,supra,cal th at,d.we should add that the phrase illegal vote perhaps connotes more sting than its actual meaning justice kennard pointed out in her dissenting opinion in gooch that an illegal vote is simply a ballot cast in violation of the procedures established by the elections code,and does not necessarily mean that the voter,or the persons assisting the voter,intended to subvert the elections process.gooch,supra,cal th at,d,italics added dis.opn.of kennard.thus a voter may cast an illegal vote through ignorance or inadvertence rather than a conscious attempt to circumvent elections laws or to give any candidate an unfair advantage.ibid.
undervote is where no choice is recorded for a given office or measure on the ballot,southwest voter registration educ.project shelley cir,southwest voter defining undervotes as ballots read by the machine as not containing a vote bush gore,d dis.opn.of souter,bush gore defining undervotes in presidential election as those for which no presidential choice was recorded by a machine.
overvote is where a voter marks more than one choice where more than one choice is not allowed by law,southwest voter,supra,at defining overvotes as ballots disqualified because they are read by the machine as containing more than one vote on a single candidate contest or initiative issue bush gore,supra,at.dis.opn.of souter,defining overvotes as rejected because of votes for more than one candidate.unlike undervotes,which are not in themselves illegal,overvotes are by definition illegal,because it is impossible to tell the actual choice,if any,the voter was making.determination of overvotes are sometimes problematic with paper ballots for example,if a voter began to make a mark for one candidate and then realized that the mark voted for the wrong candidate and then made a mark for another candidate,a trial court could face a factual problem in which there was no legal bright line.
provisional ballots are ballots issued to individuals claiming to be properly registered,but whose qualification or entitlement to vote can not be immediately established at the voting place,subd.a.provisional ballots are segregated from the others,subd.b and only counted if the appropriate elections official ascertains that the voter really is qualified or entitled to vote,subd.c in the case before us,some provisional ballots were cast electronically,and others were cast on paper ballots.
certification of an election is done by the relevant elections official,who certifies the statement of results as complete and accurate.see see also on occasion,at least in other states,certifications by the relevant elections official have been delayed by the state courts to allow time for manual recounts,palm beach county canvassing bd.harris so d,delaying otherwise applicable statutory deadline for certification of results in order to allow for manual recount in certain counties.
election contest is the court challenge by which a candidate or voter may legally challenge the certification of election results hence election contests are brought in the wake of certification,pierce harrold d.it is readily apparent that the legislature contemplated that such contests would be filed soon after the election results become known.
count and recount 
a special election was held february,to fill the unexpired term of the vacant orange county supervisorial seat for the first supervisorial district.the election was not a prelude to a between the two top the winner would be the candidate with the most votes in the field,even if only a plurality.ten candidates were running.
voters who arrived at local polling stations mainly used a button dre voting machine.however,over absentee paper ballots were returned as well.there were also about provisional ballots cast during the election.the registrar determined that of those provisional ballots were not cast by individuals eligible to vote in the election.those ballots were not counted pursuant to section,subdivision c provisional ballots counted only if elections official verifies that voter was eligible.the rest were counted.
the initial vote count methodology was to use an optical scanner to count the absentee paper ballots votes unless the optical scanner could not read the ballot,in which case it was separately reviewed and tabulated manually,while the dre votes were counted electronically,by downloading and tabulating the mbb memory devices from the various dre machines.
the election was exceedingly close as between the top two.on friday,february,the orange county registrar of voters certified the official canvass of the votes of the election,with a difference of only seven votes.trung nguyen had janet nguyen had.the remaining eight candidates had significantly fewer votes.
on monday,february,the registrar of voters received a letter from janet nguyen attorney requesting a recount of all ballots cast.the next day,february,an attorney for a voter in the district,gerald feather,also requested a recount.the registrar spoke with both janet nguyen and feather attorney about how to proceed with the recount.both requested that all paper ballots including any provisional ballots cast on paper in all precincts be manually recounted,as distinct from being optically scanned.thus in the subsequent recount,all paper ballots were physically inspected by the registrar canvassing boards,and representatives for each candidate,including trung nguyen,had the opportunity to challenge each ballot.the recount of the paper ballots resulted in a number of challenges to a number of the ballots about brought by both sides,mostly on the theory that identifying marks made a number of ballots illegal and in some cases that some ballots were,or were not,true overvotes where the choice could not be truly ascertained.see no voter shall place any mark upon a ballot that will make that ballot identifiable any ballot that is not marked as provided by law or that is marked or signed by the voter so that it can be identified by others shall be rejected.cal,voting shall be secret.
the registrar made a determination of which challenges were meritorious,then asked the attorneys for janet nguyen and gerald feather whether they wanted to have the dre votes tabulated electronically by downloading the mbb memories or by manually counting the paper printouts inside each machine the vvpats.the extra cost was and would require an extra four days.the attorneys for both feather and janet nguyen opted for the less expensive and less download method.after making sure that every precinct had been counted,the registrar certified new vote totals to the effect that janet nguyen had received and trung nguyen received.the registrar certified those results on february,making janet nguyen the winner.
the provisional ballots originally not counted because the registrar determined them to have been cast by ineligible voters were not counted in the recount either.there is no argument in this appeal that the registrar erred by incorrectly ascertaining that those ballots were indeed cast by ineligible voters.
b.the election contest 
the next day after the certification,february,can nguyen filed a statement of election contest and then an amended statement of election contest,naming only janet nguyen as a defendant.can nguyen did not name the orange county registrar of voters can nguyen sought a judgment annulling the certificate of election issued to janet nguyen,declaring trung nguyen to be the elected supervisor for the district,and ordering a certificate of election be issued to trung nguyen forthwith.
the statement of election contest filed was one prong was based on the allegation that legal votes for trung nguyen which had survived the process of challenges to the paper ballots during the recount had been improperly deducted from his total,while another illegal votes had been improperly counted for janet nguyen.given janet nguyen margin of victory in the recount,the alleged errors in ascertaining legal votes were easily enough to entitle trung nguyen to be declared the winner if he prevailed on these attacks to various ballot challenges.
the second prong of the election contest was the allegation that there had been a failure to perform full recount,hence the recount was null and void,because the internal paper printouts or vvpats had not been counted manually.
one week later,on march,janet nguyen filed a counter statement of election contest,and naming both trung nguyen and the orange county registrar of voters as.janet nguyen statement alleged that the failure to include the orange county registrar of voters as a party was fatal to can nguyen challenge.this counter statement also alleged that,in fact,trung nguyen challenged twice as many ballots as janet nguyen,and prevailed over her among the successfully challenged ballots.in substance,though,janet nguyen did not seek any affirmative relief by,for example,having illegal votes for her adjudicated to have been legal votes.she simply sought a judgment reaffirming her election,and directing the board of supervisors to immediately swear her in.
trial began on march,and lasted five days.at times the trial court proceeded ballot by ballot.while trung nguyen did present evidence that the particular brand of voting machine used in the election were susceptible to inaccurate tallies,he presented no evidence that there had been any tampering or inaccuracy in their counting of electronic votes in this particular election.
during the trial trung nguyen made it clear that he was not asking for a manual recount of the vvpats.his attorneys,in fact,objected to the registrar even being asked the question of whether the vvpats might still be recounted,and told the court they were not making any such request 
the court announced its decision on monday,march.the court ruled that two ballots which the registrar had originally deemed overvotes should have been counted for trung nguyen,and two ballots,which the registrar originally deemed to be votes for janet nguyen,were really overvotes,and should not be counted for her.the court recognized,though,that the change in trung nguyen favor was insufficient to change the outcome of the election.the trial court called the evidence of the theoretical susceptibility of the machines to tampering speculative.
trung nguyen did not challenge the decision by petition for writ of mandate at that point.trung nguyen did not bring a petition for writ,or even ask for an emergency stay of the trial court judgment pending the bringing of a petition for writ as a result,the next day,tuesday march,janet nguyen was sworn into office.trung nguyen did not file a petition for writ challenging the trial court judgment until april,by which time janet nguyen had already assumed her office on the board of supervisors.in may,this court later denied trung nguyen petition for a writ of mandate,explaining that,since janet nguyen had by then been sworn into office,and the challenge at that point could mean judicially removing a sitting official and replacing her with another person,section favored proceeding by the more deliberate process of appeal rather than the comparatively hurried process of writ petition see nguyen super,supra,th at,d section certainly favors proceeding by appellate review as the norm.this case does not warrant departing from that norm.
in this appeal,trung nguyen does not challenge the trial court rulings as to what paper ballots represented illegal votes,and which did not.all his arguments in this appeal are variations on the theme that the recount was conducted contrary to sections and and therefore the recount itself was invalid.
iv.discussion 
a.the most natural reading of sections and is that they allow for the option of an electronic recount of electronic votes and a manual recount of paper ballots 
as this court intuited in nguyen superior court,supra,th at page,d,trung nguyen statutory argument is highly technical.it involves the interaction between section,which is in the part of the elections code governing recount procedures,and section,which is the part involving approval of voting systems.we now quote both section and section in full in the margin.
section clearly gives a recount requester a choice between a manual recount or the voting system used originally.there can be no question,then,that the statute envisions the legitimate possibility that a voter might ask for a recount using only the voting system used originally.for example,janet nguyen surely had the option of requesting a recount consisting solely of paper ballots through optical scanners and a second download of the data inside the mbb.
and,indeed,trung nguyen briefing recognizes this possibility as legitimate.his argument is simply that the statute does not allow for the possibility that one portion of the the paper be recounted manually while the remaining votes cast on electronic be recounted by the voting system used originally.he asserts that the recount requester must choose one,or the other,or both of them completely.
by the same token,section,subdivision a clearly allows for the possibility,when there is no recount which is most elections,that the official record of the vote will be the electronic record of each vote.that is,under section,most elections will be legitimately decided by looking only at the electronic record of ballots cast electronically,without ever counting vvpats.the data from the download of the mbb memory sticks in such cases is the official record.
and,again,trung nguyen recognizes this legitimate possibility for an initial canvass.his point is that subdivision b of section,with its language that the vvpats shall be used for any full recount means that there can be no legitimate recount at distinct from the initial the internal printouts or vvpats are always taken out of the dre machines and literally counted by hand.
the trial court,in comparing sections and,thought there was a conflict between the two statutes,with section affording such a mix and match option while section,if read literally,always requiring a manual recounting of the vvpats internally printed inside the dre machines.to reconcile the two statutes,the trial court ruled that section only applies if a recount requester exercises the option to ask for a manual recount of the vvpat printouts.
in this appeal,trung nguyen again contends that section does not afford any such mix and match option at all hence there is no need to reconcile conflicting statutes,because the critical words at the end of subdivision a of section,or both,simply do not allow for a combination of manual recounting and the voting system used originally.trung nguyen argues that if the legislature meant to allow for the possibility of a combination of manual and electronic recounts,it would have said something on the order of,or both,or a combination of the two.otherwise,he asserts,the use of the words,or both in section mean that a challenger must ask for either a percent manual recount,or a percent voting system used originally recount,or both a percent manual recount and a percent voting system used originally recount.
we examine trung nguyen argument concerning section first,and conclude it fails for two reasons.first,the words,or both are not,depending on the context,necessarily exclusive of the idea of a combination of two things.in the context of recounts,it makes logical sense that the legislature would give recount requesters the option of having paper ballots counted manually,as distinct from being run through an optical scanner again.if there are going to be vote challenges for incompleteness,ambiguity,overvotes or other defects,identifying marks see,they are more likely to be found among the paper ballots.
at the same time,assuming the inclusion of vvpats inside electronic voting machines have done the job of keeping the machines honest and no one believes that anyone is out to,literally,rig the election by tampering with the dre machines,nothing is likely to be gained by a manual recount of the vvpats.indeed,trung nguyen own actions in not requesting such a manual recount of the vvpat printouts himself speak louder than his briefs.
second,trung nguyen interpretation of section creates the anomaly that a recount requester could trigger two successive and substantively independent recounts.either that,or trung nguyen interpretation contemplates absurdity.
in this appeal,we do not need to explore the degree to which statutes in the elections code provide for more than one recount if,for example,there were different recount requesters with different agendas,each making timely recount requests.here,both janet nguyen and gerald feather agreed on what they would jointly request as to one recount,and in this record both may be treated as essentially one requester.
but it is safe to say that,for purposes of our analysis here,the elections code does not allow a single recount requester more than one recount.or at least no more than one recount,not including a recount pursuant to section as the result of an election contest.section uses the phrase the recount italics added twice.
under trung nguyen reading of or both,a recount requester could ask and pay for both a cheap option of simply paper ballots through optical scanners plus a second download of the mbb sticks and an expensive option of manually counting the same paper ballots that had been already through the scanner and also manually counting the dre machine vvpats.
it would be absurd,though,to suppose that a recount requester would ask for both methods to be conducted at the same time.the scenario is absurd,because the time and money spent for the cheap option would be certainly wasted as to the second mbb memory download,and it would be probably wasted as to the of the paper ballots through optical scanners as well.the issue of a potential conflict between,on the one hand,a voting system originally used of paper ballots and,on the other hand,a manual recount of paper ballots is not before us.
by the same token,a scenario where a candidate asked that manual recounts of the paper ballots and vvpat printouts be done first before any second of the ballots through optical scanners or second download of the mbb sticks would be even more absurd.no one in his or her right mind wants to pay for a meaningless of paper ballots through an optical scanner when workers have already gone through those ballots by hand and representatives from the various sides have had the opportunity to identify those paper ballots which they wish to challenge.
the remaining scenario is where a recount requester asks for the voting system used originally option first,a through the scanner plus a second mbb download,and then,if he or she does receive a result,shell out the extra money for the expensive option of hand counting both paper ballots and vvpat printouts.that is the only scenario using trung nguyen proffered interpretation of or both that even begins to make rational sense.but it is also clear that,just by describing this option,it involves one requester receiving two,separate,successive,and substantively independent recounts.there would be,literally,two,performed successively,of the paper ballots and two,performed successively,of the electronic votes.under trung nguyen interpretation of the or both clause,each vote would have been counted no less than three times.
the logical and natural reading of section or both language and the one adopted by the orange county registrar of voters here is that a recount requester can indeed mix and match recount methods,because different methods of voting are most efficiently audited by recount in different ways.if there is no reason to believe that any dre electronic vote machines have been tampered with,and therefore there is no reason to believe that they have functioned inaccurately in a particular election,the most logical and efficient procedure is to allow the recount requester both the inexpensive option of a second downloading of the mbb memory sticks and the expensive option of a manual recount of all paper ballots.
trung nguyen asserts that such a logical and natural reading would allow recount requesters to game recounts by,in effect,asking for a different method of recounting in different precincts.presumably,he envisions a scenario where,for example,a candidate might ask for a manual count of vvpat printouts plus a scanner of paper ballots in one precinct,then ask for a mbb download plus a hand count of paper ballots in another precinct.the request may specify the order in which the precincts shall be recounted.
such a scenario,however,does not fall under the category of absurd results that the legislature presumably did not intend.such mixing and matching of methods on a basis would yield at least as accurate a tally as the original canvass.if,for example,hand counts of paper ballots in a given precinct changed results because,in the original canvass,legal votes had not been counted and illegal votes had,no one could reasonably complain the results of that precinct would be more accurate than before.
moreover,the scenario of varying methods by precinct makes sense because the legislature could reasonably conclude that precincts might differ in accuracy.if there is going to be election tampering,it is more likely to occur in a given area than another.boss tweed no doubt had more influence in some precincts of century new york than others.the legislature could reasonably conclude that giving recount requesters the choice of subjecting some precincts to extra scrutiny by having absentee ballots hand counted while opting for a mbb download of dre votes was not a bad idea.
finally,any danger that gaming might lead to a substantively inaccurate recount is obviated by the ability of a candidate to bring an election contest under section in which the court would have power to order a recount if necessary for a proper determination of the contest.if,for example,asking for a manual recount of vvpat printouts in precinct a while only asking for a download of mbb memory sticks in precinct b lead to an inaccurate tally,a trial court clearly has the power to correct that by ordering,as part of its powers in an election contest,a full recount of manual vvpat printouts.
having established that section allows a recount requester to select one of two methodologies of recounting,or both,the question arises as to whether certain language in subdivision b of another elections code statute,section,strips that right away,and absolutely gives a recount requester no choice on the methodology of recounting electronic ballots,by mandating that the vvpat printouts be used in all circumstances.the language in subdivision b is the voter verified paper audit trail shall be considered the official paper audit record and shall be used for the required manual tally described in section and any full recount.
section is not part of the legislature scheme of rules governing recounts,found in sections et.rather,it was placed in that part of the elections code governing approval by the secretary of state of voting systems,sections et.
while the recount methodology statute,subdivision a of section,was enacted in,section was enacted in.stats,ch.interestingly though,in the very same bill the legislature also amended section,by adding subdivision b to it.in other words,if the legislature really intended to strip recount requesters of the option of having a recount but not having the vvpat printouts manually counted,it passed up the perfect opportunity to do so.
a few words in regard to subdivision b of section added in are in order now on the one hand,the text of subdivision b is confusing because,on its face,it differentiates paper record copies from the voter verified paper audit trail of the electronically recorded vote.are they supposed to be the same thing since the case before us now does not involve a request for a manual count of vvpat printouts,we need not explore here what the legislature might have meant by differentiating paper record copies from the voter verifies paper audit trail.
however,what is clear in the addition is that the legislature was still operating on the premise that recount requesters would still be doing some selecting.newly added subdivision b ends with the clause,as selected by the voter who requests the recount.the selection clause of section subdivision b is not compatible with the proposition that no valid recount could take place except if done under one prescribed method.
of course,repeals by implication are disfavored.the rule is that there must be no rational basis for harmonizing the potentially conflicting statutes,and the two must be so inconsistent that they can not have concurrent operation recently,our high court has also looked to whether the provision provides undebatable evidence of an attempt to supersede the earlier provision,and an test,which is whether the provision constitutes a revision of the entire subject of the earlier,such that a court could say the legislature intended to substitute the latter for the former 
here,there is absolutely no indication that the legislature intended section,subdivision b to repeal section,subdivision a.they essentially occupy different fields.as the trial court noted,section specifically governs recounts,while section was the product of the legislature effort to insure that electronic voting machines were kept honest by requiring them to have a means of objective,hard verification of their otherwise ephemeral electronic data.
besides the enigmatic subdivision b of section,there is also some indication in section itself that the legislature did not intend section to straightjacket recounts into always having a manual recount of vvpat printouts.first,there is the operation of subdivision a of section,which declares that the electronic record of each vote is to be considered the official record of the vote,except as provided in subdivision b.subdivision b of section makes reference twice,in both subdivisions b and b to the required manual tally and full recount.in other words,in normal elections where there is no recount,unless the required manual tally shows a problem with the accuracy of the electronic record here,the mbb memory sticks,the electronic record is good enough to decide the election.it would be highly counterintuitive for the legislature to say that an electronic record is sufficient for elections without recounts,yet require manual tallies of vvpat printouts in all recounts,regardless of whether there was any reason to think that the machines had not been percent accurate.
second,and more telling,is the language in subdivision b of section,which is easy to overlook if one only concentrates on the shall be used for any full recount language of subdivision b.the language of section,subdivision b is the voter verified paper audit trail shall govern if there is any difference between it and the electronic record during a manual tally or full recount.
literally,subdivision b provides for the possibility of a difference between the voter verified paper audit trail and the electronic record in a full recount.thus,if section b is read to absolutely preclude any valid recounts which do not involve the manual counting of the vvpat printouts,it contradicts subdivision b.
of course it makes good sense that the legislature would intend that a manual count of vvpat printouts would trump the electronic record any time where there is a difference between that manual count and the electronic record.but it does not make sense that the legislature would totally deprive recount requesters of any option of having a recount without a full and relatively expensive manual count of the vvpat printouts.
in many cases,of course,different statutes apply to different factual situations,perhaps even appearing to conflict with each other,and it is the duty of a trial judge to harmonize those different statutes if reasonably possible.as our supreme court observed in broughton cigna healthplans of california cal th,d,when we construe potentially conflicting statutes,our duty is to harmonize them if reasonably possible.
here,the trial court harmonized section and subdivision b of section with section,subdivision b by the means of reading the words full recount in section simply to refer to a recount where the requester wanted a manual count of the vvpat printouts,as distinct from every valid recount.as the court put it,what the legislature was saying was,if you want a manual recount of dre voting you have to use vvpat.as long as all votes are in fact recounted which is all that is required by section,as we show below,a valid recount does not have to be a full recount under section,complete with a manual counting of every vvpat printouts.that solution avoids having an internal contradiction within section in which subdivision b and would collide with each other,and it avoids the outright negation of section.
the trial court reconciliation was not only insightful,but scholarly.it preserved a clear right of the recount requester under section to have electronic ballots recounted by means of the electronic record,while sensibly confining section shall be used for any full recount language to the situation where a recount requester actually wants a manual recount of dre votes.the reconciliation does the least damage to either statute,because it preserves the rights of recount requesters to select how to recount dre votes,but respects the intended operation of section,subdivisions b and b to have manual counts of the vvpat printouts trump the electronic record.
the reconciliation is consistent with the legislative history of senate bill,which enacted section in.on the one hand,that history is inconclusive because the legislature did not appear to be concerned with the problem of potential conflict between section and section.page after page of the legislative history is devoted to the benefits of requiring dre machines to have vvpats,so that the electorate can have confidence in the electronic results of an election.on the other hand,it does appear safe to say that the legislative history is certainly devoid of any indication that the legislature wanted to repeal section,subdivision a.in this appeal trung nguyen opposed the registrar request that this court take judicial notice of the materials compiled by the legislative intent service,constituting the legislative history of senate bill.
there are two items in the legislative history that,in fact,support the trial court interpretation against repealing section.the strongest is on page of the june,report on senate bill reg.sess.of the assembly committee on elections and redistricting.that report made this reference in passing on the subject of the requirement to have vvpats in the first place this bill enacts into statute one of the standards for the use of the paper record copy of the ballots cast on a dre shall be used to conduct the one percent manual recount of ballots cast and any manual recount requested by a voter.italics added.the idea that the words full recount as used in section should be equated with any manual recount requested by a voter is,in substance,the trial court interpretation.
second,governor schwarzenegger signing message stated,i am signing senate bill this year that allows the voter verified paper audit trail to be used for a recount and requires they be used for the manual tally.italics added.while the word allows might be interpreted to mean that the senate bills provided the apparatus necessary for vvpat printouts to be mandated for all recounts,the tenor of the message more naturally suggests giving recount requesters an option that they previously did not enjoy.
even if trung nguyen interpretation of sections and were correct,it makes no difference 
however,even if the trial court and our reading of the interaction between section and section were incorrect,and trung nguyen complex statutory argument were the correct one,we would still be required to affirm the trial court judgment in this elections contest.
early on,our supreme court drew a distinction in election cases between mandatory election provision and directory ones.see gooch,supra,cal th at,fn,d,quoting rideout city of los angeles cal,rideout.the rule is a violation of a mandatory provision vitiates the election,whereas a departure from a directory provision does not render the election void if there is a substantial observance of the law and no showing that the result of the election has been changed or the rights of the voters injuriously affected by the deviation,original italics deleted.
the test for whether a provision is mandatory or directory is whether the act enjoined goes to the substance or necessarily affects the merits or results of the election.gooch,supra,cal th at,fn,d,quoting rideout,supra,cal.at,italics added.
further,as the gooch court noted,the modern elections code often explicitly states whether a given provision is mandatory or directory,pointing out,for example,that provisions which tightly prescribe how absentee ballots are to be returned to the relevant election official are explicitly mandatory,not directory.gooch,supra,cal th at,fn,d,quoting.in the present case,neither section or section has any language making it mandatory.
so we turn to the question would any deviation from the proper operation of either least under trung nguyen proffered the substance,merits or results of the election 
no.there is no question that both sections and are consistent with the legitimate possibility that most ballots in most elections will be counted electronically,without any manual recounting of the internal printouts.and from that fact we may deduce that an electronic if done in arguable contravention of section subdivision b,does not necessarily go,in the language of gooch quoting rideout,to the substance or necessarily affects the merits or the results of the election.the election returns might be just as accurate based on the electronic record.only if there are allegations of tampering or inaccuracy regarding the dre machines would the need for vvpats go to the substance of the election.
as the gooch case reminds us,even a deviation from a merely directory provision of the elections code will vitiate an election where that deviation might have changed the result.but any showing of the possibility of a changed result in this case is.
if trung nguyen had any basis to believe that the download of mbb data pursuant to the janet feather recount request resulted in any inaccurate data,he could have requested that the trial court order the vvpat printouts be counted,and that request would have had to have been honored.enterprise residents legal action against annexation com.brennan,supra cal d,construing predecessor to section to the effect that where statement of contest alleged enough illegal votes to make difference in election,trial court erred in not ordering recount when recount was requested 
indeed,having already lost the election based on the registrar resolution of challenges to the paper ballots,trung nguyen had a strong incentive to ask the trial court to order such a manual recount of the vvpats.and,while such a manual recount might have cost him something the initial estimate was,it seems safe to say that the amount quoted for the recount has been easily dwarfed by his subsequent attorney fees.
that is,trung nguyen would have asked for a recount if he thought that a manual counting of the vvpat printouts would have made a difference.he obviously did not.as we have seen his lawyers affirmatively opposed the idea of a court ordered recount,and made it clear that that he was not seeking the relief of a manual recount of the vvpat printouts 
the strong inference that arises,then,from his clear disavowal of any request for the court to order a manual recount of the vvpat internal printouts is that trung nguyen knew that there was very little likelihood that such a manual recount of the vvpats would make any even four votes worth of difference of course,if he had asked for such a manual recount,it would have been fatal to his hope of winning the election in court solely by virtue of an argument from with sections and.
our conclusion is confirmed by an examination of the case law concerning technical challenges to election results.where technical deviations from elections code provisions have not posed the possibility of an actual change of result,the courts have uniformly upheld the results of the election as against any challenges based on those technical deviations,people ex rel.lee prewett cal,defective notice of school board election,and even opening of the polls hour late was insufficient to invalidate election where no one was prevented from voting by the delay rideout,supra,cal.at,violation of statute requiring words municipal ticket on back of ballot and deviations from prescribed size of certain type were insufficient to annul two bond elections east bay municipal utility dist.hadsell cal,arguably insufficient notice of bond election insufficient to invalidate it where electors were fully informed of the time,place and purpose of election and of each polling place davis county of cal d,misdescription of outlying precincts in notice of election was not material and did not affect the result of the election wilks mouton cal d,violation of then statutes precluding third parties from mailing or delivering completed absentee ballots insufficient to invalidate where there was no finding of tampering or fraud.
the rule operates in the opposite direction as well in cases where the violation of statutes even might have made a difference in who received the highest number of legal votes and typically such cases center on mischief with the paper absentee ballots,the courts have not hesitated to throw out the results of the election and order a new one,canales city of alviso cal d,more illegal votes cast than margin of victory,including nine illegal votes where court could not determine how they were cast,so judgment confirming election had to be reversed gooch,supra,cal th,d,admitted political organization engaged in various forms of election wrongdoing in regard to absentee ballots,including having representatives personally pressure absentee voters while they were voting wrongdoing resulted in illegal absentee ballots,but trial court could not determine with certainty how those illegal ballots were cast,so supreme court upheld trial judgment annulling election hardeman thomas d.because of intimidation of absentee voters by mayor and his supporters in city council election and number of illegal votes easily exceeded winner margin of victory,trial court correctly annulled results of election and ordered a new one held.
the cases cited have this common thread where there is no showing that violations of elections provisions might have had any effect on the actual election results,the courts refused to annul the election,letting the winner or winning ballot measure stand.because trung nguyen presented no evidence that the results of the recount were substantively incorrect,this case slots into that category.
the very point about trung nguyen inability to show that the method of recount in this case made any difference in the actual returns came up at oral argument in the trial court.trung nguyen counsel tacitly acknowledged that he had shown that if the recount had been conducted the way he wanted presumably a percent manual recount of everything,including the vvpat printouts it would have made any difference.rather,he pointed to another recount statute,section,which,he argued,simply nullified the whole recount without regard to the actual results,thus restoring him as the original winner.
trung nguyen argument based on section,when considered in the light of his statutory argument regarding sections and,is manifestly unpersuasive.we quote the entirety of section in the margin basically,section stands for the common sense idea that a recount can not change the results from the official canvass and be the official returns unless,in the recount,the votes are counted in each and every precinct.
the key sentence for our purpose,that is,the one trung nguyen necessarily relies on,is if the office,slates of presidential electors,or measure are not voted on statewide,the results of any recount which is not completed by counting the votes in each and every precinct in the jurisdiction within which votes were cast on the candidates for the office,on the slates of electors,or on the measure in question shall be declared null and void.the word is counting,not recounting.any legitimate means of counting the first time satisfies the need in section for a counting the second time.
there is no doubt in this case that the recount was completed by counting the votes in each and every precinct in the first supervisorial district.the registrar himself so testified and the trial judge specifically so found.said the judge first,it appears to me,let me just make a couple of findings,it appears to me that all the votes were counted.that has been the testimony of the registrar of voters and i accept that.they just were all counted the way that trung nguyen argues they were required to be counted on recount 
indeed,to accept trung nguyen argument that not all the votes were counted pursuant to section would be to accept the utter absurdity that the dre votes were counted in the first official canvass that he initially won.after all,the same method was used both times the votes were no less counted the first time than they were counted the second.
c.this court can not direct judgment for trung nguyen because there is no evidence he received the highest number of legal votes in the election 
in bradley perrodin,supra,th,d,the trial court awarded a city council seat to the losing candidate on the theory that the candidate would have won if listed first on the ballot.that was clear error,said the appellate court,making it clear that before a candidate can be awarded an office in an election contest,the candidate must have won the highest number of legal votes although we agree irving election was properly annulled,we disagree that judgment was properly entered for andrews,who was judicially declared elected despite her failure to win the highest number of legal votes in the june runoff election.under section,having found irving,the winning candidate,disqualified for having committed misdeeds that failed to change the result of the election,the trial court should have entered judgment annulling and setting aside the election.bradley,supra,th at,d,italics added,original italics deleted.
a few pages later,the bradley court elaborated on the sort of relief that can be given in an election contest under sections,and,only illegal votes may be discarded in an election contest.if the court finds,after discarding the illegal votes given for the winning candidate,that another candidate has the highest number of legal votes,the court shall declare that person elected.otherwise,if discarding the illegal votes given for the winning candidate would not change the result of the election,and the winning candidate is disqualified from taking office due to having committed offenses against the elective franchise,the court shall enter judgment annulling and setting aside the election.id.at,d,italics added.
trung nguyen forgets that the initial canvass using optical scanners for paper ballots counted ballots that were illegal votes and may not have counted ballots that were legal votes optical scanners do not reject paper ballots with identifying marks,and sometimes they reject ballots as overvotes when a visual examination shows only a slip of the pen.essentially,his argument on appeal is ignore what the manual recount of paper showed as regards the proper categorization of legal and illegal votes,just go back to the status quo ante recount.but the status quo at that point included illegal votes and did include legal votes,and we have no authority to install a candidate into a office who can not show he obtained the highest number of legal votes in the election.
under bradley,it would be clear legal error for this court to declare trung nguyen the winner.
conclusion 
we can not accept that by enacting section the legislature meant to repeal the rights afforded recount requesters in section to ask and pay for a manual recount of paper ballots while opting for the less expensive option of downloading the electronic record for electronic ballots,as provided in subdivision a of section.but even if the legislature did mean to repeal that right,and even if it did mean to mandate that all recounts have a hand counting of the vvpat printouts,we would still be required to affirm the judgment in favor of janet nguyen.trung nguyen presented no evidence at trial that,if there had been a manual count of the vvpat printouts,it would have made any difference.he presented no evidence that he received the highest number of legal votes.
vi.disposition 
we affirm the judgment.respondents janet nguyen and the orange county registrar of voters are to recover their costs on appeal.
