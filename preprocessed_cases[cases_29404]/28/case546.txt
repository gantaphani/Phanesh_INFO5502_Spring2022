here we conclude that the electorate can not,by initiative,in a general law county,enact an ordinance prescribing minimum future annual budgets for county public safety agencies.such an ordinance exceeds the electorate initiative power and is constitutionally invalid.
the board of supervisors of the county of ventura appeals from a stipulated judgment entered in favor of respondent officials of ventura county public safety agencies gregory totten,district attorney of the county of ventura and bob brooks,sheriff of the county of ventura.additional respondents are the city of thousand oaks and citizens for a safe ventura county appellant contests the portion of the judgment upholding the validity of sections and of initiative ordinance hereafter the ordinance.these two sections establish a minimum annual budget for ventura county public safety agencies.the sections usurp the board of supervisors exclusive statutory power to adopt a budget by depriving it of the discretion to provide a lower level of funding.
although the instant appeal involves the expenditure of money,it concerns an issue far greater than a monetary turf war between public entities.as we shall explain,sections and of the ordinance not only chill the board of supervisors exclusive power to enact a budget,but may well end up freezing it out of existence.we observe that this dispute is an unfortunate one.the board of supervisors and the public safety agencies have a history of serving and protecting all of the people of ventura county.they should be on the same side.nevertheless,they have a legitimate difference of opinion with respect to the effect of the ordinance.we do not shrink from our duty to decide this dispute.
factual and procedural background 
the ordinance states that its purpose is to ensure compliance with the constitutional mandate of proposition and that priority be given to the provision of adequate public safety services.proposition,adopted by the voters in november,added section to article xiii of the california constitution.the section imposes a statewide sales and use tax at the rate of percent.all revenues from the tax are to be transferred to the local public safety fund for allocation by the legislature to counties.moneys in the local public safety fund shall be allocated for use exclusively for public safety services of local agencies,subd.d.
according to the legislative analyst analysis of proposition,the additional sales tax revenue generated by the measure was intended to offset part of the billion in county and city revenue losses that resulted from adoption of the state budget.specifically,billion in annual property tax revenues were shifted from counties and cities to the schools,thereby reducing the state funding obligations to public schools.california ballot pamphlet,special election.
to implement proposition,the legislature enacted government code sections through the statutes create the local public safety fund in the state treasury to receive the sales and use tax revenue generated by proposition.the revenue in the fund shall be allocated to each qualified county in proportion to its share of the total taxable sales in all qualified counties during the most recent calendar year for which sales have been reported by the state board of equalization,subd.a.each county must establish a public safety augmentation fund in its treasury to receive its share of the proposition revenues.amounts deposited in this fund shall be expended exclusively to fund public safety services,and for that purpose shall be allocated among the county and the cities in the county pursuant to a statutory formula.ibid.public safety services includes,but is not limited to,sheriffs,police,fire protection,county district attorneys,county corrections,and ocean lifeguards.public safety services does not include courts,subd.b.
in citizens for a safe ventura county collected sufficient signatures to qualify a public safety initiative measure the ordinance for the ballot.pursuant to elections code section,in may appellant adopted the measure without submitting it to a vote of the electorate 
the ordinance creates a public safety augmentation trust fund to receive proposition revenues allocated to ventura county.ordinance.the ordinance specifies the amounts of the budgets for the fiscal year for the following ventura county public safety agencies district attorney,sheriff,corrections,public defender,and ventura county fire protection district only.these amounts shall be known as the base year budgets of the respective agencies.section of the ordinance provides for subsequent years the budget for each public safety agency shall,at a minimum,be one hundred percent of the base year budget plus any associated inflationary costs.the ordinance does not define associated inflationary costs.section of the ordinance provides that portion of a public safety agency base year budget funded by general fund appropriations,plus any associated inflationary costs,shall continue to be funded by general fund appropriations.that portion of a public safety agency base year budget funded by proposition revenues,plus any associated inflationary costs and any additional appropriations,allocations and equipment approved by the board of supervisors subsequent to the base year,shall first be funded from proceeds contained in the public safety augmentation trust fund.
according to respondents,from until the fiscal year,appellant interpreted the any associated inflationary costs provision as requiring annual increases in the appropriations to each of the public safety agencies in the amount of the actual increase in costs of delivering services,particularly increases in personnel costs,for that particular public safety agency.
in march appellant decided that,to calculate inflationary costs,it would use the consumer price index for all items for the los county area as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the united states department of labor hereafter cpi.the change in calculation was recommended by harry hufford,the interim chief administrative officer.in a march letter to appellant,hufford warned public safety departments are increasingly consuming more net county cost and experiencing continual general fund budgetary growth.public safety net cost increased over a period from of total net county cost to.on the other hand,safety net cost decreased from to.without a revision to the ordinance inflation factor definition,it is expected that the identified net cost disparity would continue to widen in the future.hufford estimated that,by using the cpi to calculate inflationary costs,public safety budgets for the fiscal year would be reduced by approximately million.
respondents filed actions in superior court seeking,inter alia,a writ of mandate to compel appellant to abide by its interpretation of the any associated inflationary costs provision.the actions were consolidated.
appellant moved for summary adjudication on the issue of the constitutionality of sections and of the ordinance.appellant contended,inter alia,that sections and are unconstitutional because they impair its exclusive authority over the county budget.the trial court disagreed and denied the motion for summary adjudication.
thereafter,the parties signed a document entitled,settlement agreement and stipulation for entry of judgment hereafter agreement stating that its purpose is to facilitate the board right to appeal the superior court ruling that sections and of the ordinance are constitutional,while simultaneously resolving all remaining issues in the consolidated actions.
pursuant to the agreement,judgment was entered on april.section of the judgment declares that sections and of the ordinance are facially constitutional.section of the judgment governs the implementation of sections and of the ordinance for the fiscal year and thereafter.the judgment provides that section will be inoperative if section of the judgment is reversed on appeal.appellant filed a notice of appeal from section of the judgment 
electorate right to initiative may be restricted by the legislature 
t he local electorate right to initiative and referendum is guaranteed by the california constitution,article ii,section,and is generally with the legislative power of the local governing body.citation.w e will presume,absent a clear showing of the legislature intent to the contrary,that legislative decisions of a city council or board of supervisors are subject to initiative and referendum.devita county of napa cal th,d,fn.omitted hereafter devita.t he adoption of a budget is a legislative function citation.anderson superior court th,d.

in ascertaining whether the legislature intended to delegate authority exclusively to the local governing body,the paramount factors are statutory language,with reference to legislative body or governing body deserving of a weak inference that the legislature intended to restrict the initiative and referendum power,and reference to city council board of supervisors deserving of a stronger one citation the question whether the subject at issue was a matter of statewide concern or a municipal affair,with the former indicating a greater probability of intent to bar initiative and referendum citation.devita,supra,cal th at,d.i f doubts can be reasonably resolved in favor of the use of the reserve initiative power,courts will preserve it.citation,at,d.
statutory language expressly delegates authority over the county budget to the board of supervisors 
ventura county is a general law county.in general law counties,the structure of county government is laid out in various statutes enacted by the legislature and found in the state government code.people ex rel.kerr county of orange th,d.sections set forth the procedures for the adoption of a budget by a general law county.these sections do not refer to a legislative body or governing body.instead,they refer to the board,which is defined as the board of supervisors of the county,or the same body acting as the governing board of a special district whose affairs and finances are under its supervision and control,subd.c.
sections expressly delegate authority over the county budget to the board on or before june of each year,as the board directs,each official or person in charge of any budget unit shall file with the auditor an itemized estimate of available financing,financing requirements,and any other matter required by the board.from the estimates the county auditor shall prepare a tabulation that shall be submitted to the board.upon receipt of the tabulation the board shall consider it and shall make any revisions,reductions or additions therein that it deems advisable.on or before july of each year the board,by formal action,shall approve the tabulation with the revisions,additions and changes in conformity with its judgment and conclusions as to a proper financial program for the budget period,whereupon it shall constitute the proposed budget for the period to which it is to apply,subd.a.on or before august of each year,the board shall conduct a public hearing at which meeting any member of the general public may appear and be heard regarding any item in the proposed budget or for the inclusion of additional items.in addition,at the meeting a ny official whose estimates have been or are proposed to be revised,reduced,or increased,or who desires to change his or her estimates,shall be given the opportunity to be heard thereon.ibid.after the conclusion of the hearing,and not later than august of each year,and after making any revisions of,deductions from,or increases or additions to,the proposed budget it deems advisable during or after the public hearing,the board shall by resolution adopt the budget as finally determined,subd.a.
in committee of seven thousand superior court cal d,our supreme court noted that the term legislative body is more easily read as including the electorate than the terms city council or board of supervisors.the court reasoned that the legislature use of the terms board of supervisors and city council in section gives rise to a strong inference that the legislature intended to preclude exercise of the statutory authority by the electorate.ibid.by the same reasoning,the legislature use of the term board in sections gives rise to a strong inference that the legislature intended to preclude the electorate from exercising authority over the adoption of a county budget.
indeed,the term board in sections can not be reasonably interpreted as including the electorate.the auditor can not submit his tabulation each year to the electorate for approval.because the electorate can only cast their ballots at the polls,they do not have the means to consider the tabulation and make any revisions,reductions or additions therein that they deem advisable.nor can the electorate adopt a proposed budget by approving the tabulation with the revisions,additions and changes in conformity with their judgment and conclusions as to a proper financial program for the budget period,subd.a.moreover,the electorate can not conduct a public hearing and,following the hearing,by resolution adopt a final budget after making any revisions of,deductions from,or increases or additions to,the proposed budget it deems advisable,subd.a.
in the area of public safety,the legislature has expressly recognized the board of supervisors exclusive budgetary authority over the district attorney and sheriff.section provides,the board of supervisors shall not obstruct the investigative function of the sheriff of the county nor shall it obstruct the investigative and prosecutorial function of the district attorney of a county.the section goes on to state,nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the budgetary authority of the board of supervisors over the district attorney or sheriff.
county budgets for public safety agencies are a statewide concern 
a n intent to exclude ballot measures is more readily inferred if the statute addresses a matter of statewide concern rather than a purely municipal affair.this is so because the legislature constitutional authority to restrict the local right of initiative or referendum generally derives from its partial preemption of local government authority pursuant to the fulfillment of a state mandate or objective.citation.only in matters that transcend local concerns can the legislature have intended to convert the city and county governing bodies into its exclusive agents for the achievement of a legislative purpose of statewide import.citation.devita,supra,cal th at,d.the state plenary power over matters of statewide concern is sufficient authorization for legislation barring local exercise of initiative and referendum as to matters which have been specifically and exclusively delegated to a local legislative body.committee of seven thousand superior court,supra,cal d at.
county budgets for public safety agencies are of particular statewide concern.such budgets involve the use of state funds provided pursuant to proposition.each county must establish a public safety augmentation fund in its treasury to receive the proposition funds.section,subdivision e,provides the legislature finds and declares that the allocation of the public safety augmentation fund is a matter of statewide concern and is not merely a municipal affair or a matter of local interest.moreover,the people of the state have declared in the state constitution that p ublic safety services are critically important to the security and of the state citizens and to the growth and revitalization of the state economic base.cal,art.xiii,subd.a see also rivero superior court th,d i nvestigation and prosecution of state criminal law are statewide concerns,not municipal affairs.
furthermore,since county budgets for public safety agencies constitute a major portion of county spending,such budgets are of statewide concern because they may affect a county ability to adequately fund programs unrelated to public safety.counties are generally responsible for funding local programs mandated by state legislation enacted before january.pursuant to article xiii b,section of the california constitution,the state is required to reimburse the counties for any new governmental programs,or for higher levels of service under existing programs,that it imposes upon them by state legislation enacted after january.see hayes commission on state mandates th,d.
some examples of legislation mandating county funded programs are as follows welfare and institutions code section,which provides that t he board of supervisors in every county shall provide and maintain,at the expense of the county,a suitable house or place for the detention of wards and dependent children of the juvenile court and of persons alleged to come within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.elections code section,subdivision a,which provides all expenses authorized and necessarily incurred in the preparation for and conduct of elections as provided in this code shall be paid from the county treasuries,except that when an election is called by the governing body of a city the expenses shall be paid from the treasury of the city.welfare and institutions code section,which requires counties to relieve and support all indigent persons lawfully resident therein,when such persons are not supported and relieved by their relatives or by some other means.citations.county of san diego state of california cal th,d,italics added by mooney pickett cal d.c ounties have no discretion to refuse to provide medical care to indigent persons within the meaning of welfare and institutions code section who do not receive it from other sources,at,d,fn.omitted.
in adopting a budget,the board of supervisors must strike a balance between public safety needs and the county obligation to fund programs unrelated to public safety.in our view,it is a matter of statewide concern that a proper balance be struck to ensure adequate funding in both areas.
sections and of the ordinance seriously impair the exercise of essential governmental functions 
the mere fact that county budgets for public safety agencies are of statewide concern does not mean that sections were intended to preclude initiative action by the electorate.courts are not to automatically infer that a statutory scheme restricts the power of initiative or referendum merely because some elements of statewide concern are present.devita,supra,cal th at,d.i t is erroneous to assume that a statute or statutory scheme that both asserts certain state interests and defers in other respects to local decision making sic implies a legislative intent to bar the right of initiative.rather,courts must inquire concretely into the nature of the state regulatory interests to determine if they are fundamentally incompatible with the exercise of the right of initiative or referendum,or otherwise reveal a legislative intent to exclusively delegate authority to the local governing body,at,d.
in devita our supreme court noted that in some cases exclusive delegation was inferred in part on the grounds that the legislature must have intended to prevent disruption of routine operations of government.devita,supra,cal th at,d.as an example of such cases,it cited geiger board of supervisors cal d.in geiger the butte county board of supervisors adopted an ordinance levying a sales and use tax.the geiger court concluded that the ordinance was not subject to referendum because application of the referendum process would seriously impair essential governmental functions,at.the geiger court reasoned an essential function of a board of supervisors is the management of the financial affairs of county government,which involves the fixing of a budget to be used as the basis for determining the amount and rate of taxes to be levied.before the board can properly prepare a budget,it must be able to ascertain with reasonable accuracy the amount of income which may be expected from all sources,and,when it has adopted ordinances imposing taxes,it can not make an accurate estimate unless it knows whether the ordinances will become effective.these are some of the reasons why the people have entrusted to their elected representatives the duty of managing their financial affairs and of prescribing the method of raising money,at.in rossi brown cal th,d,our supreme court stated that in geiger it had reasoned that m anaging the county government financial affairs was entrusted to elected representatives,and was an essential function of the board which could not accurately estimate income if tax ordinances were subject to referenda.citation.
the geiger court recognized that the fixing of a budget is included within the board of supervisors essential function of managing county financial affairs.because of their experience in government and knowledge of local conditions and interests,members of the board of supervisors are particularly well qualified to make budgeting decisions.the budgetary process entails a complex balancing of public needs in many and varied areas with the finite financial resources available for distribution among those demands.it involves interdependent political,social and economic judgments which can not be left to individual officers acting in isolation rather it is,and indeed must be,the responsibility of the legislative body to weigh those needs and set priorities for the utilization of the limited revenues available.county of butte superior court d.moreover,t he statutes of the state provide for detailed statements to be presented to the supervisors by the various county officers at stated intervals to the end that the board may be constantly aware of the financial condition of the county and the needs thereof.ferguson gardner.on the other hand,voters are not immersed in government so as to be able to make reasoned judgments on the complex financial management of government,the interplay of various appropriations on a budget.the voters do no qualify as comptrollers.convention center referendum committee district of columbia bd.of elections and ethics en banc,dis.opn.of gallagher,
sections and of the ordinance seriously impair the exercise of appellant essential governmental function of managing the county financial affairs.these sections require appellant to fund county public safety agencies at a level at least equivalent to their budgets for the fiscal year,plus any associated inflationary costs.ordinance.appellant would have no discretion to decrease public safety funding below this level if the crime rate plummeted,if improved efficiency or innovations reduced public safety costs,or if the required level of public safety funding prevented the county from adequately funding state mandated programs unrelated to public safety.
sections and of the ordinance exceed the initiative power of the electorate and are constitutionally invalid 
we conclude that,in enacting sections,the legislature intended that the authority to adopt budgets for county public safety agencies be exercised specifically and exclusively by the board of supervisors,barring use of the local initiative power.our conclusion is based on the following factors statutory language in sections expressly delegates authority over the county budget to the board of supervisors county budgets for public safety agencies are a matter of statewide concern and as sections and of the ordinance illustrate,application of the initiative process to county public safety budgets would seriously impair the board of supervisors essential governmental function of managing the county financial affairs.sections and of the ordinance,therefore,exceed the initiative power of the electorate and are constitutionally invalid
