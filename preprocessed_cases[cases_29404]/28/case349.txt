we are called upon to decide whether oregon ballot measure prohibition of payment to electoral petition signature gatherers on a or per signature basis unconstitutionally burdens core political speech.because the district court did not clearly err in determining that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the challenged measure significantly burdens speech,we can not hold the measure imposes a severe burden under the first amendment.therefore,because the defendant has established an important regulatory interest in support of the measure,the plaintiffs have failed to prove that the prohibition violates the first amendment.
in november,oregon voters approved ballot measure measure,a voter initiative,by a margin of percent to percent.measure reads 
to protect the integrity of initiative and referendum petitions,the people of oregon add the following provisions to the constitution of the state of oregon it shall be unlawful to pay or receive money or other thing of value based on the number of signatures obtained on an initiative or referendum petition.nothing herein prohibits payment for signature gathering which is not based,either directly or indirectly,on the number of signatures obtained.
barbara and eugene prete and jason williams collectively plaintiffs,as chief petitioners later coordinated signature gathering to place various initiative measures on the february and november general election ballots.oregon elections division office sent inquiry letters to plaintiffs in november,advising plaintiffs that the elections division had received complaints alleging plaintiffs had paid signature gatherers on the basis of the number of signatures collected,in violation of measure.the inquiry letters requested additional information from plaintiffs 
plaintiffs responded by bringing an action in federal district court against defendant,alleging measure violated the first amendment.plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief.six days later,tim nesbitt and the oregon collectively brought a motion to intervene as of right under.a,and alternatively,for permissive intervention under.b.nesbitt,president of the oregon,was chief petitioner for measure,and the oregon was a major supporter of measure.plaintiffs opposed the motion bill bradbury,in his official capacity as the secretary of state of oregon hereinafter defendant,did not.the district court granted the motion to intervene as of right.
plaintiffs then brought a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin defendant from enforcing measure.after oral argument on the motion,the parties stipulated no further discovery was needed and the court could issue a final ruling on the merits pursuant to.a 
in its amended opinion and order,the district court found measure was targeted at electoral processes rather than at the communicative aspect of petition circulation.the court reasoned measure prohibited only one method of payment for petition circulators,a matter entirely between the circulator,his or her employer,and the chief petitioner.next,the court found measure imposed no severe or substantial burdens on the circulation of initiative or referendum petitions,and defendant interest in protecting the integrity of the initiative process justified the lesser burdens imposed by the measure.the court,therefore,denied plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction and entered judgment in favor of defendant and.plaintiffs timely appealed.
on appeal,plaintiffs assert the district court erred in granting motion to intervene as of right,and measure violates the first amendment of the united states constitution.we have jurisdiction under and we hold the district court erred in granting motion to intervene but that error was harmless and the district court did not err in determining plaintiffs failed to establish measure violates the first amendment accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
this court reviews de novo a district court ruling on a motion to intervene as of right pursuant to.a.united states alisal water,cir 
under.a an applicant for intervention as of right must demonstrate that the intervention application is timely the applicant has a significant protectable interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action the disposition of the action may,as a practical matter,impair or impede the applicant ability to protect its interest and the existing parties may not adequately represent the applicant interest.alisal water,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.although the party seeking to intervene bears the burden of showing those four elements are met,the requirements for intervention are broadly interpreted in favor of intervention.id.
timeliness,significant protectable interest,and impairment 
here,plaintiffs wisely concede the application was timely and the have a significant protectable interest relating to the subject of this action.first,brought the motion to intervene only six days after plaintiffs brought the action.second,for purposes of intervention as of right,a public interest group that has supported a measure such as an initiative has a significant protectable interest in defending the legality of the measure.sagebrush rebellion,watt,cir.third,an adverse court decision on such a measure may,as a practical matter,impair the interest held by the public interest group.id.
in sagebrush rebellion,this court held that a public interest group may have a protectable interest in defending the legality of a measure it had supported.id.at.there,a public interest group which had supported the creation of a conservation area in idaho sought to intervene on behalf of the government in an action challenging the federal statute that created that conservation area.id.at.the district court denied the motion to intervene.this court reversed,holding the group had a protectable interest in defending the creation of the conservation area.we stated in broad language that a public interest group is entitled as a matter of right to intervene in an action challenging the legality of a measure which it had supported.id.at.further,an adverse decision against the conservation area would impair the society interest in the preservation of birds and their habitats,an interest the conservation area was designed to protect.id.at.this court also held the government representation of the group interest may be inadequate for reasons discussed infra thus,this court reversed and remanded to the district court for it to grant the motion to intervene.id.at.
here,nesbitt was chief petitioner for the measure,and the oregon was a main supporter of the measure.under the rule from sagebrush rebellion,thus have a significant protectable interest related to this action,and an adverse judgment might impede or impair that interest.
plaintiffs contend,however,that arizonans for official english arizona,d hereinafter aoe,controls here and bars initiative sponsors from intervening in judicial challenges to the initiative.plaintiffs misread aoe.there,the plaintiff yniguez,a state employee,brought an action against the state of arizona alleging the adoption of an initiative which declared english the official language of arizona violated the first amendment.id.at.yniguez complained she often spoke spanish with persons as part of her state job,and the initiative mandate for state employees to act in english could expose her to sanctions.id.at.after a bench trial,the district ruled the initiative was unconstitutional as overbroad.id.at.the arizonans for official english committee aoe which was the principal sponsor of the brought a motion to intervene,seeking to defend the constitutionality of the initiative on appeal.id.at.the district court denied the motion.yniguez then resigned from her employment with the state.aoe appealed nonetheless,and this court determined aoe had article iii standing to pursue the appeal in defense of the initiative,and the action was not moot because of yniguez resignation.id.at.the supreme court reversed.the court observed that aoe was not an elected representative,nor did any arizona state law appoint initiative sponsors as agents to defend,in lieu of public officials,the constitutionality of initiatives made law of the state.id.at.on that basis,the court stated we thus have grave doubts whether aoe ha s standing under article iii to pursue appellate review.nevertheless,we need not definitively resolve the issue.rather,we will follow a path we have taken before and inquire,as a primary matter,whether originating plaintiff yniguez still has a case to pursue.id.at.the court concluded yniguez resignation after the district court judgment but before appeal mooted the case,and the court then vacated the decision of the district court and the court of appeals.id.at.
aoe did not hold that initiative sponsors do not have an interest in defending the initiative sufficient to support intervention.the main issue presented in aoe was whether the there had article iii standing to pursue an appeal when a step taken by the original plaintiff resignation of her job rendered the entire case or controversy moot.such a scenario is not at issue here therefore,we hold that under sagebrush rebellion,have a significant protectable interest related to this action and an adverse judgment may impair or impede that interest.
adequacy of representation 
a closer issue is presented whether established that the existing parties may not adequately represent the applicant interest.see alisal water,at.plaintiffs contend that because defendant is defending the constitutionality of measure,interest in defending the constitutionality of measure is adequately represented.the district court disagreed,concluding defendant might not adequately represent interests because claim an interest in preventing the gathering and eventual counting of invalid signatures for initiatives opposing union interests,and thus defendant possibly could make different arguments than.
in assessing whether a present party will adequately represent an interests,we consider several factors,including whether a present party will undoubtedly make all of the intervenor arguments,whether a present party is capable of and willing to make such arguments,and whether the intervenor offers a necessary element to the proceedings that would be neglected.sagebrush rebellion,at.the burden of showing inadequacy of representation is minimal and is satisfied if the applicant shows that representation of its interests may be inadequate id.internal citations omitted.
although the burden of establishing inadequacy of representation may be minimal,the requirement is not without teeth 
the most important factor in determining the adequacy of representation is how the interest compares with the interests of existing parties.when an applicant for intervention and an existing party have the same ultimate objective,a presumption of adequacy of representation arises.if the applicant interest is identical to that of one of the present parties,a compelling showing should be required to demonstrate inadequate representation.
arakaki cayetano,cir internal citations omitted.additionally,t here is also an assumption of adequacy when the government is acting on behalf of a constituency that it represents.in the absence of a very compelling showing to the contrary,it will be presumed that a state adequately represents its citizens when the applicant shares the same interest.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
in sagebrush rebellion,discussed supra,we held the public interest group seeking to intervene as of right established that the defendant the secretary of the interior might not adequately represent the group interest.at.we reasoned that the secretary of the interior,james watt,had previously been head of the foundation which was representing the plaintiff in the present action.thus,the public interest on the defendant bring a perspective materially different from that of the present parties and was entitled to intervene.id.
in league of united latin am.citizens wilson,however,this court recognized that when an intended intervenor and a party in the action seek the same ultimate objective,a presumption arises that the intervenor interests are adequately presented.in league of united latin am.citizens,the plaintiff brought a lawsuit challenging california proposition,which had been enacted into law.id.at.a public interest group brought a motion to intervene as of right,claiming it participated in the drafting and sponsorship of the proposition and desired to intervene in support of its defense.id.at.the district court denied the motion,and we affirmed.this court recognized the defendant the state of california and the public interest group sought the same ultimate,to defend the constitutionality of proposition thus a presumption of adequacy of representation arose.id.at.hence,we held the interests were adequately represented by the state defendant and affirmed the denial of the motion to intervene 
here,the ultimate objective for both defendant and is upholding the validity of measure.thus,a presumption arises that defendant is adequately representing interests.see id.at.second,defendant is the oregon government,and the oregon and its president share the same interest with defendant,defending measure.therefore,it is assumed that defendant is adequately representing interests.arakaki,at.while it is unclear whether this assumption rises to the level of a second presumption,or rather is a circumstance that strengthens the first presumption,it is clear that i n the absence of a very compelling showing to the contrary,it will be presumed that the oregon government adequately represents the interests of the.see id.
fail to present that compelling showing of inadequate representation.in their motion to intervene,stated first that defendant may not be able to provide a complete defense of measure due to budget constraints.virtually all governments face budget constraints generally,and if such a basis were sufficient to establish inadequate representation,it would eliminate the presumption of adequate representation when the government and the share the same interest.most importantly,there is no evidence in the record that defendant is unable to mount an effective defense of measure due to alleged budget constraints.see league of united latin am.citizens,at citing moosehead san.dist.phillips,cir holding a petitioner must produce something more than speculation to the purported inadequacy in order to justify intervention as of right 
second,assert defendant may be inclined to give an unnecessarily narrow construction of measure in the face of legal attacks on the measure.yet neither plaintiffs nor defendant have argued for a narrowing construction of measure,and measure does not seem susceptible to any narrowing construction thus,have failed to present evidence sufficient to meet their burden of a compelling showing on this score as well.
third,contend defendant does not have the breadth of knowledge regarding the signature gathering process to fully develop the record and respond to plaintiff factual allegations.assert they have particular expertise in the subject of the dispute.for example,they have direct knowledge and experience in how well a signature gathering campaign staffed by hourly circulators can run.
yet defendant,as oregon secretary of state,is undoubtedly familiar with the initiative process and the requisite indeed,defendant is the government party responsible for counting the signatures defendant also administers oregon election processes and promulgates regulations to give effect to the state election statutes.see or.admin.interpreting measure.although may have some specialized knowledge into the signature gathering process,they provided no evidence to support their speculation that the secretary of state lacks comparable expertise.to the contrary,defendant presumably is sufficiently acquainted with the signature gathering process and could also acquire additional specialized knowledge through discovery,by calling upon to supply evidence or through the use of experts thus,such a reason is insufficient to provide the compelling showing necessary to overcome the presumption of adequate representation discussed supra.
accordingly,while we emphasize that the burden of showing inadequacy of representation is generally minimal,here failed to present evidence sufficient to support a finding that their interests are not adequately represented by the defendant in this action.we hold,therefore,that the district court erred in granting the motion to intervene as of right.
the remedy for an improper grant of intervention has not been clearly established.it is more common for appellate courts to consider the denial of a motion to intervene and the few cases reversing the grant of a motion to intervene are distinguishable because here the district court did not enter separate judgments for the defendant and the as in the cited cases,but entered a single judgment in favor of both defendant and that measure does not violate the first amendment 
here,the district court erred in granting intervention as of right and thereby allowing to present evidence and argument.under and federal rule of civil procedure however,we may not reverse the district court judgment unless this error affected the substantial rights of the parties.texas hogarth shipping.applying harmless error review to the erroneous grant of intervention as amicus curiae alaska suburban propane gas,cir applying harmless error review under rule to the erroneous denial of a motion to intervene california ex rel.state lands com united states,cir declining to consider whether or under what circumstances an erroneous grant of intervention could constitute reversible error under.hackin lockwood,cir the improper joinder of a civil defendant does not prevent this court from addressing the merits of the action as to the proper parties.
here,the district court error in granting the motion to intervene did not affect the substantial rights of the parties.in its amended opinion and order,the district court discussed only one piece of evidence submitted by an affidavit submitted by ted blaszak of democracy resources of oregon,a firm.blaszak averred that the requirement to pay petition circulators by the hour rather than by the signature did not significantly increase his costs or decrease productivity.although helpful to defendant case,the evidence was not crucial.as noted infra in footnote,consideration of that affidavit does not make it more probable than not that the district court error tainted the judgment 
accordingly,the district court erred in granting motion to intervene as of right,but the error was harmless and,therefore,does not require vacating the judgment of the district court.

the first amendment,incorporated and made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment,prohibits state governments from enacting a law abridging the freedom of speech.mcintyre ohio elections comm n,d.as discussed infra,the circulation of initiative and referendum petitions involves core political speech,and is,therefore,protected by the first amendment.see meyer grant,d.

for purposes of determining whether a state election law violates an individual first amendment rights,we 
weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the state rule imposes on those rights against the interests the state contends justify that burden,and consider the extent to which the state concerns make the burden necessary.regulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs rights must be narrowly tailored and advance a compelling state interest.lesser burdens,however,trigger less exacting review,and a state important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions.

in meyer grant,the supreme court recognized the expressive nature of petition circulation and held the wholesale prohibition of paid petition circulators imposed an impermissible burden on free speech under the first amendment,d.in meyer,the plaintiffs challenged an amendment to the colorado constitution which made it a felony to pay money or anything of value to petition circulators who circulated initiative or referendum petitions.id.at.after a bench trial,the district court upheld the statute,but the court of appeals reversed.id.at.the supreme court affirmed,explaining 
the circulation of an initiative petition of necessity involves both the expression of a desire for political change and a discussion of the merits of the proposed change.although a petition circulator may not have to persuade potential signatories that a particular proposal should prevail to capture their signatures,he or she will at least have to persuade them that the matter is one deserving of the public scrutiny and debate that would attend its consideration by the whole electorate.this will in almost every case involve an explanation of the nature of the proposal and why its advocates support it.thus,the circulation of a petition involves the type of interactive communication concerning political change that is appropriately described as core political speech.
the court recognized that a wholesale prohibition of paid petition circulators limited such core political speech in two ways it limits the number of voices who will convey plaintiffs message and the hours they can speak and,therefore,limits the size of the audience they can reach and it makes it less likely that plaintiffs will garner the number of signatures necessary to place the matter on the ballot,thus limiting their ability to make the matter the focus of statewide discussion.id.at.the court rejected colorado argument that the prohibition was justified by the state interest in protecting the integrity of the initiative process,reasoning that colorado presented no evidence that paid petition circulators are more likely to accept fraudulent signatures over those of a volunteer,and that other colorado statutes prohibited accepting forged or fraudulent signatures.id.at.the court thus concluded the prohibition imposes a burden on political expression that the state has failed to justify,and hence the prohibition violated the first amendment.id.at.
similarly,in buckley the supreme court struck down a colorado statute which required petition circulators be registered voters in colorado petition circulators wear an identification badge bearing the circulator name and initiative proponents publicly disclose the names and amounts paid to all paid circulators.at.first,the court observed the registered voter requirement decreases the pool of potential circulators as certainly as that pool is decreased by the prohibition of payment to circulators.both provisions limit the number of voices who will convey the initiative proponents message and,consequently,cut down the size of the audience proponents can reach.id.at.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the court rejected colorado assertion that the registered voter requirement was not a severe burden because it was not difficult to register to vote although failure to register sometimes results from ignorance or apathy,the decision not to register can also implicate political thought and expression.id.at.the court also struck down the name badge requirement and the disclosure provisions,explaining that both provisions forced circulators to surrender the anonymity enjoyed by their volunteer counterparts and had only a tenuous relationship to colorado interest in ensuring the integrity of the initiative process.id.at.
unlike meyer,measure does not completely prohibit the payment of circulators.instead it prohibits one method of payment.plaintiffs claim that measure in practice limits the available pool of people willing to circulate petitions.to the extent meyer may be read to indicate that any resulting decrease in the pool of available circulators is sufficient to constitute a severe burden under the first amendment,in buckley the court refined its analysis and made clear that the degree of the decrease resulting from the measure is properly considered in determining the severity of the burden.see id.at.analyzing the degree of the effect of the challenged provisions on the pool of available circulators and explaining we therefore detail why we are satisfied that,as in meyer,the restrictions in question significantly inhibit communication with voters about proposed political change,and are not warranted by the state interests alleged to justify those restrictions.emphasis added.
unlike buckley,where the pool was limited to state residents registered to vote,here,anyone may serve as a petition circulator,regardless of residence or registration.therefore,we find the eight circuit analysis of a north dakota state law more analogous to measure,and thus more persuasive.in initiative referendum inst.jaeger,cir,the eighth circuit distinguished north dakota prohibition on paying circulators on a basis related to the number of signatures obtained,the same type of restriction at issue here from the complete prohibition on paid petition circulators in meyer.in jaeger,the court noted that the state had an important interest in preventing signature fraud in the initiative process,and that the state had supported that interest with evidence that paying petition circulators per signature encouraged such fraud.id.at.further,the plaintiffs had produced no evidence that payment by the hour,rather than on commission,would in any way burden their ability to collect signatures.the plaintiffs have only offered bare assertions on this point.id.thus,because the state asserted an important interest in preventing signature fraud,supported that interest with evidence that signature fraud was actually a problem in north dakota,and the plaintiffs failed to present evidence the restriction would otherwise burden their ability to collect signatures,the court upheld the ban on paying petition circulators on the basis of the number of signatures collected.id.for reasons discussed further below,our case is more properly analyzed under the framework applied in jaeger than under meyer or buckley.
severe or lesser burden 
plaintiffs contend measure imposes a severe burden on the circulation of initiative petitions because the measure makes paid signature gathering prohibitively expensive,inefficient,and results in a higher rate of invalid signatures.plaintiffs thus contend that strict scrutiny should apply and measure is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.the district court rejected this argument,finding plaintiffs did not prove that measure imposed severe burdens on the circulation of initiative petitions,and any lesser burdens imposed by measure were reasonably related to and justified by the state interest in preventing fraud in the initiative process.
in reaching that conclusion,the district court assessed plaintiffs claims that measure eliminates an avenue of and decreases the available pool of petition circulators measure increases the costs of gathering signatures,making it more difficult to circulate petitions and qualify initiative or referendum measures for the ballot and measure resulted in a significant decrease in the number of valid signatures collected by signature gatherers.because these are claims of historical fact,we review the district court findings regarding these claims for clear error.see planned parenthood,at.because the district court did not clearly err in rejecting each of these claims,we affirm the district court holding that measure imposes only a lesser burden on the circulation of initiative petitions.
the effect of measure on the pool of petition circulators in oregon 
plaintiffs presented affidavits from william arno of arno political consultants apc,a california petition circulation firm,and tracy taylor of taylor petition management,llc,a washington state petition circulation firm under contract with apc.arno averred measure make s it less likely that companies such as apc will continue to do business in oregon and stated he had personal knowledge that at least three of his chief competitors will not do business in oregon because of measure.yet arno later testified that his personal knowledge of those companies came only from taylor.
taylor averred that several professional petition circulators he knew were not interested in working in oregon on an hourly wage basis when they could work in other states on a basis.yet he did not identify those circulators,nor state whether they would work in oregon absent measure.indeed,both arno and taylor conceded that other factors might cause petition circulators to leave or not to work in oregon.for example,arno noted that access to private property for petition circulators was particularly strict in oregon.both arno and taylor also noted that harassment of paid petition circulators by the voter education project discouraged some companies from working in oregon.last,arno also suggested that measure makes it more difficult for petition circulation companies to operate because those companies have to treat petition circulators as employees rather than independent contractors.yet oregon employment law requires that petition circulators must be treated as employees rather than independent contractors measure does not itself mandate such treatment.see canvasser services,employment dep t,holding,under oregon law,petition circulators are employees rather than independent contractors.
the district court rejected arno and taylor averments of circulators leaving or refusing to work in oregon as unsupported speculation because arno received his information from taylor,taylor only repeated the basic claim that paid circulators would not work in oregon because of measure,and several factors other than measure could explain the alleged reluctance of petition circulators to work in oregon.the district court factual conclusion is supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.
plaintiffs also presented affidavits from david rubin of universal petitions,a southern california petition circulating firm lura lucille cordes,who employs circulators to gather signatures in california and angelo paparella of progressive campaigns,a national signature gathering firm.rubin averred that his by signature is more efficient than payment by the hour,and measure would thus make signature gathering more difficult in oregon,he is sure i would never be asked to go to oregon to coordinate a petition drive with measure restrictions in effect.similarly,cordes stated because of the burdens imposed by measure,she would not come to oregon to circulate signatures.paparella also stated that because of measure,his company will not circulate petitions in oregon because the cost of hiring and maintaining a workforce of hourly wage workers is very,very high when compared to using petition circulators who are independent contractors.yet none of these affiants stated they had ever circulated petitions in oregon or would do so in the absence of measure.further,paparella averment suggests he would not come to oregon because he would have to treat petition circulators as employees rather than as independent contractors,which is the law in oregon notwithstanding measure.therefore,the district court conclusion that plaintiffs did not prove measure caused a reduction in the number of available circulators or otherwise limit ed the size of plaintiff audience is supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.
the effect of measure on the cost of signature gathering in oregon 
arno averred that measure would increase the cost of signature collection by percent.taylor similarly averred measure would increase the cost of gathering signatures in oregon.yet both arno and taylor based their predictions on the misapprehended fact that measure converted circulators from independent contractors into employees,resulting in increased payroll costs.as noted above,oregon law recognizes petition circulators as employees,rather than independent contractors,notwithstanding measure.
further,arno and taylor had little,if any,experience in circulation in oregon before measure was passed.arno testified he had worked on one initiative campaign in oregon around,but that campaign ended up folding prior to turning in signatures.arno had not worked on any other initiative campaigns in oregon.similarly,taylor testified that apart from an unrelated petition referendum petition placed on the november ballot,he had never worked on any initiative campaigns in oregon before or after measure was passed.thus,as noted by the district court,neither arno nor taylor could offer a reliable comparison on the added costs,if any,imposed by measure.
plaintiffs submitted several other affidavits which they contend support their claim that measure poses a severe burden by increasing costs.jason williams one of the plaintiffs averred he did not circulate an initiative petition due in large part to the fact that the cost of circulating the petition,using paid signature gatherers,has increased significantly.yet williams does not aver that measure is responsible for any such price increase.russell walker,chief petitioner for an unrelated initiative initiative petition,averred that he did not circulate that petition due in large part to the fact that the cost of circulating the petition,using paid signature gatherers,has increased significantly.similarly,he makes no averment that measure is to blame.
the district court ultimately concluded measure imposes no appreciable burden in terms of costs for an initiative or referendum campaign.implicit in this finding is the conclusion that measure does not substantially increase the cost of circulation.this finding is supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.
the effect of measure on the invalidity rate of signatures gathered for initiatives in oregon 
arno averred he noticed a significant decrease in the number of valid signatures collected by signature gatherers since measure became law.taylor similarly averred he discovered a disproportionate number of signatures to be invalid in oregon,as opposed to the validity rates i am encountering in washington and ohio which states do not prohibit payment by signature.yet taylor does not attribute the higher invalidity rate to measure or suggest any reason for the higher invalidity rate.he stated,however,that signature gatherers paid by the hour have more of an incentive to defraud me compared to signature gatherers paid per signature because they know that regardless of whether i think the signatures are valid,the signature gatherer must still be paid an hourly wage.as the district court noted,however,both arno and taylor testified they had limited to no experience in initiative and referendum processes in oregon.thus,their assertions that paying petition circulators by the hour,instead of per signature,results in higher signature invalidity rates carry little weight.
both williams and walker also averred oregon had a higher signature invalidity rate.yet neither affiant attributed the higher invalidity rate directly to measure.
in contrast,defendant submitted an affidavit from richard ellis,a political science professor at willamette university in oregon.ellis averred that the available that circulators paid by the hour also have a higher validity rate than those paid by the signature.for example,in oregon election year,measure which used only circulators paid by the hour had a signature validity rate of percent,higher than the ten other initiative petitions submitted for that election.ellis also states the overall signature validity rates have dropped in oregon not because of measure,but because a march directive by the oregon elections division instructed county clerks who confirm the validity of signatures on petitions not to count initiative signatures by inactive voters,voters who have registered but have not voted in a certain number of past elections.
further,referendum petition,which was qualified for the february oregon ballot,after the passage of measure,had a signature validity rate of percent.arno,taylor,and williams were involved in the circulation and gathering of signatures for referendum petition.the high validity rate of the collection of signatures for referendum petition,conducted after the adoption of measure,weighs against plaintiffs claim.the record,therefore,supports the district court conclusion that measure results in higher validity rates for signature collection,rather than lower validity rates.therefore,the district court finding is not clearly erroneous.
in sum,plaintiffs presentation of proof falls short here.the district court did not clearly err in finding that measure did not decrease the pool of petition circulators in oregon did not increase the costs of signature gathering and did not result in a higher invalidity rate of signatures gathered for initiatives.
we next review the district court determination that measure creates only a lesser burden on plaintiffs first amendment rights.because this question relates to a constitutional fact,what constitutes a severe burden or a lesser burden,we review the district court determination de novo.see planned parenthood,at.
as noted supra,the district court did not clearly err in finding plaintiffs failed to prove measure resulted in any burden on their first amendment rights.unlike meyer,plaintiffs did not prove that measure limited the number of voices who will convey plaintiffs message and the hours they can speak that measure limits the size of the audience plaintiffs can reach or that measure makes it less likely that plaintiffs will garner the number of signatures necessary to place the matter on the ballot,thus limiting their ability to make the matter the focus of statewide discussion.see meyer,at.moreover,unlike buckley,plaintiffs did not prove that measure significantly limits the available pool of people willing to circulate petitions or constrains petition circulators political thought and expression.see buckley,at.
of course,from an economic perspective,eliminating one method of payment but not every method,a la meyer for petition circulators could result in some barriers to entry in the signature procurement market.for a task like signature gathering,it is possible that paying per signature,a commission basis can be more productive of signatures than paying an hourly wage.whether measure creates such barriers to entry,however,is a question of historical fact reviewed for clear error here,the district court did not clearly err in finding plaintiffs failed to prove the existence of such barriers to entry or that,if present,they diminished petition circulators ability to garner the requisite number of signatures to qualify initiatives for the ballot.absent proof that such barriers to entry existed and had the claimed result,we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made by the district court.see sawyer whitley,d sec rubera,cir citing easley cromartie,d under the clearly erroneous standard,we defer to the lower court determination unless,based on the entire evidence,we are possessed of a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.
moreover,even if such barriers to entry did arise,they would result in only a lesser burden under the first amendment.measure is quite limited in its proscription,barring only payment of petition circulators on the basis of the number of signatures gathered.it does not prohibit adjusting salaries or paying bonuses according to validity rates or productivity,see or.admin,which could likely counter any barriers to entry.
in the absence of proof that measure creates such barriers to entry or otherwise burdens their first amendment rights,plaintiffs have established only that measure imposes lesser burdens upon the initiative process.generally,the finding of a lesser burden triggers a less exacting review under which an important regulatory interest will support a finding that the measure is a reasonable,nondiscriminatory restriction.see bayless,at 
oregon important regulatory interest 
defendant has an important regulatory interest in preventing fraud and its appearances in its electoral processes.see bayless,at see also timmons,at.states certainly have an interest in protecting the integrity,fairness,and efficiency of their ballots and election processes as means for electing public officials.further,the record supports the conclusion that measure is aimed at combating actual instances of fraud and forgery committed by petition circulators paid on the basis of the number of signatures gathered.
first,the voter pamphlet circulated to the voters in consideration of measure supports the conclusion that measure is aimed at combating fraud in the signature gathering process.see ecumenical ministries oregon state lottery comm n,or,in considering the history of a constitutional provision adopted through the initiative process,oregon courts examine,as legislative facts,other sources of information that were available to the voters at the time the measure was adopted and that disclose the public understanding of the measure such as the ballot title and arguments for and against the measure included in the voters pamphlet.the voter pamphlet states in support of measure that t his most recent election cycle saw convictions of paid petition circulators on a variety of forgery,fraud,and identity theft counts,charges pending against others and allegations of dozens more.measure would combat such fraud,the pamphlet states,by removing the incentive for fraud out of the system by mandating hourly pay rather than per signature.
as evidence of the actual existence of fraud and forgery in the initiative process,defendant presented an affidavit from bill carroll,a criminal investigator in the oregon department of justice.he averred that paying petition circulators per signature leads to two types of fraud.first,the signature gatherers often forge signatures,thus receiving payment for a collected signature even though the signature is invalid.second,the signature gatherers falsely certify the petition signature sheets either for petitions submitted by themselves or for other petition circulators.
as attachments to his affidavit,carroll supplied reports of interviews of various signature gatherers paid per signature who had forged signatures on their petitions purchased signature sheets filled with signatures,then submitted them with their petitions as if they had collected the signatures themselves or participated in signature parties in which multiple petition circulators would gather and sign each others petitions 
defendant also submitted an affidavit by john lindback,director of oregon secretary of state elections division.he averred the practice of paying signature gatherers by the signature is a substantial case of fraud and forgery in the initiative process.
plaintiffs point to the arno and taylor affidavits,however,which aver that signature gatherers would not engage in fraud or forgery 
because signature gatherers are selling each signature to apc,and apc wo buy a signature apc deems questionable.in that respect,signature gatherers paid by the signature police themselves because professional signature gatherers do want a reputation that would cause them to not be hired by apc in the future,or not be hired by other signature gathering companies.
although such a general proposition may be sound,it does not controvert defendant evidence discussed above that some signature gatherers paid per signature have engaged in fraud and forgery,nor does it diminish defendant important regulatory interest in preventing such fraud 
like jaeger,defendant asserted an important regulatory interest in preventing fraud and forgery in the initiative process.defendant supported that interest with evidence that signature gatherers paid per signature actually engage in such fraud and forgery.this court duty is not to determine whether the state chosen method for prevention of fraud is the best imaginable.once the burden is found to be of the lesser variety,our inquiry is limited to whether the chosen method is reasonably related to the important regulatory interest.last,as the district court correctly determined,plaintiffs did not prove measure would otherwise burden their ability to collect signatures.see jaeger,at.
in sum,because plaintiffs failed to prove the district court erred in determining that measure does not severely burden their first amendment rights in circulating initiative petitions,and defendant has established that measure serves the important regulatory interest in preventing fraud and forgery in the initiative process,we hold that measure does not violate the first amendment,as applied,and affirm the judgment of the district court.
oregon secretary of state issued an administrative rule interpreting measure.the rule states in part measure bans the practice of paying circulators or others involved in an initiative or referendum effort if the basis for payment is the number of signatures obtained.this means that payment can not be made on a per signature basis.employment relationships that do not base payment on the number of signatures collected are allowed.allowable practices include paying an hourly wage or salary,establishing either express or implied minimum signature requirements for circulators,terminating circulators who do not meet the productivity requirements,adjusting salaries prospectively relative to a circulator productivity,and paying discretionary bonuses based on reliability,longevity and productivity,provided no payments are made on a per signature.admin.a violation of measure will result in civil penalties of a minimum of for each individual signature sheet containing signatures collected in violation of measure.id.
under oregon law,a petition for a ballot measure must designate one to three chief petitioners,who are the main sponsors of the measure.see or.
as the district court noted,the inquiry letters did not threaten prosecution,but simply notif ied plaintiffs that complaints were filed and request ed additional information.nonetheless,the inquiry letters sent to plaintiffs are sufficient to establish standing.for first amendment purposes,a plaintiff demonstrates an where the plaintiff intends to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest and that there is a credible threat that the challenged provision will be invoked against the plaintiff.arizona right to life pac bayless,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,plaintiffs intended to engage in signature gathering where payment is made per signature,and receipt of the inquiry letters is sufficient to establish a credible threat that measure will be invoked against plaintiffs.
the district court initially issued an opinion and order construing the parties submissions as motions for summary judgment and granting summary judgment for defendant and.the court later vacated that opinion and order because the parties intended the court to consolidate trial on the merits with plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction,pursuant to.a.the court then issued an amended order and opinion,granting final judgment on the merits for defendant and.plaintiffs do not contest the steps taken by the court to convert for summary judgment to a trial on the merits,and thus we consider the amended order and opinion the final judgment of the trial court in this matter.
to be clear,we do not hold that measure is facially constitutional.rather,as discussed infra,we hold that because the district court did not clearly err in determining plaintiffs failed to establish that measure significantly diminishes the pool of potential petition circulators,increases the cost of signature gathering,or increases the invalidity rate of signatures gathered,we can not conclude that measure imposes a severe burden under the first amendment.because plaintiffs have established only a lesser burden,and defendant has offered an important regulatory interest in preventing fraud,we conclude the district court did not err in upholding the constitutionality of measure as applied.we express no opinion,however,regarding whether measure could withstand strict scrutiny had plaintiffs proven the measure imposed a severe burden under the first amendment.see buckley am.constitutional law,d requiring plaintiffs to establish the challenged restrictions resulted in a significant decrease in the available pool of petition circulators to support a finding of a severe burden.
this court reviews for abuse of discretion a district court ruling on a motion for permissive intervention pursuant to.b.kootenai tribe of idaho veneman,cir.although brought a motion in the alternative for permissive intervention,the district court did not rule on that motion because it granted the motion to intervene as of right.
a provides in part upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest,unless the applicant interest is adequately represented by existing parties.
there is some question,however,whether an must independently establish article iii standing to intervene as of right.for example,in the case at hand,article iii standing is satisfied between plaintiffs and defendant.but a circuit split exists whether an must also independently satisfy article iii standing to intervene as of right.compare planned parenthood of eastern kansas,ehlmann,cir requiring independent intervenor standing and building const.trades dep t reich,same,with associated builders contractors perry,cir no independent intervenor standing required,and postal serv.brennan,cir same.the supreme court has not yet settled the issue.see charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.this court also has not definitively ruled on the issue.although some sources such as federal practice and procedure cite yniguez arizona,cir,for the proposition that this court does not require independent article iii standing for intervenors,id.at,that opinion was vacated by the supreme court.see aoe,at.league of united latin am.citizens wilson,cir noting yniguez was vacated by the supreme court and is thus wholly without precedential authority.regardless,we need not reach this issue because,as discussed infra,the district court erred in granting motion to intervene on grounds other than whether had independent standing.
further,the court distinguished sagebrush rebellion,noting that in that case the defendant,secretary of the interior watt,had previously served as the head of the foundation representing the plaintiff.id.at.in league of united latin am.citizens,however,this court noted that the defendant had vigorously defended proposition,and there was no evidence the defendant would cease to do so in the future.id.
we do not hold that budgetary constraints that impact the ability of the government to adequately litigate its position can never support a motion to intervene as of right by a citizen of that government.rather,we hold only that absent any evidence of oregon alleged budgetary constraints and the impact of said constraints on this litigation,failed to meet their burden to present a compelling showing of inadequate representation.
also argue that measure protects their interest in preventing fraudulent signatures from being gathered for initiatives that are contrary to their union interests,and defendant may not defend that interest.we will read this claim as evincing an interest in preventing fraudulent signatures on all petitions,not just those petitions which are contrary to their union interests.we are left ignorant of what constitutes intervenors union interests,if any,apart from preventing fraudulent signatures on petitions.absent any basis for determining there are union interests separate and distinct from the prevention of fraudulent signatures,we see no basis for intervention on this score.
to be precise,the oregon secretary of state does not count every signature on the petitions.instead,it employs a statistical sampling technique to determine whether the petitions contain the requisite number of signatures to support certification of the initiative for the ballot.
while we recognize may have greater knowledge than the secretary of state regarding the impact of measure on petition circulation,it will often be the case that a private party has greater first hand knowledge of the impact of legislation on private individuals than the government.such knowledge may support a trial judge discretionary grant of permissive intervention,but it is not sufficient by itself to support intervention as of right in this case.see garza county of los angeles,cir unlike intervention as of right,t he decision to grant or deny permissive intervention is discretionary,subject to considerations of equity and judicial economy.therefore,while an interest may not be sufficiently weighty to warrant intervention as of right,the court may nevertheless consider eligibility for permissive intervention under.b.in this case failed to present any evidence that the oregon government could not have obtained any knowledge it lacked through the use of discovery and expert testimony.absent such evidence,failed to make a compelling showing of inadequate representation sufficient to support intervention as of right.
the reason for this disparity is straightforward the denial of a motion to intervene is a final order and is thus immediately appealable.see stringfellow concerned neighbors in action,d.yet the grant of a motion to intervene is not a final order and is not appealable until after final judgment.id.at.
see mothersill petroleos mexicanos,cir the plaintiff brought a contracts action against the defendant,and the parties agreed to settle a corporate employee moved to intervene as of right,claiming he was due payment for services rendered under the contracts the district court granted the motion to intervene and later entered judgment for the intervenor,awarding him payment for past services under the contracts the fifth circuit reversed,holding intervention was improper and vacating the judgment in favor of the intervenor.stockton united states,cir the plaintiff sought a tax refund from the defendant,and the district court entered judgment for the plaintiff the plaintiff attorney then moved to intervene as of right,claiming an interest in his attorneys fees to be paid from the refund recovery the district court granted the motion to intervene and granted judgment for the plaintiff attorney this court reversed,holding intervention was improper and vacating judgment for the intervenor.
on the hearing of any appeal or writ of certiorari in any case,the court shall give judgment after an examination of the record without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.
no error in either the admission or exclusion of evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict or for vacating,modifying,or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order,unless refusal
