allan zaremberg and john dunlap iii are proponents of a voter referendum petition to overturn the health insurance act of act stats,ch.by petition for writ of mandate,they challenge orders entered december,by the sacramento county superior court which prohibit qualification of the referendum for the ballot the superior court found that the attorney general title and summary of the referendum petition is inaccurate and misleading and also that the petition failed to comply with section,which requires a short title at the top of each page after the first page.we disagree and accordingly will issue our peremptory writ 
the petition was filed in this court late in the day friday,december,this court did not receive the complete petition,other filings and the record until the end of the day,december.referendum proponents included a request for a stay of the superior court orders and of the printing of ballots for the march,election.but according to documents submitted by referendum proponents the ballot labels for the million ballots to be printed for that election were transmitted to the printing firms by the close of business,december,one week before we received the complete petition and record.failure to comply with the december,deadline would create a significant risk that printing of ballots would not be completed by february,the first day of absentee balloting for the election.accordingly,although we issued our alternative writ in order to resolve the merits of the case by opinion,we denied the request for stay,subd.a.
background 
senate bill,the health insurance act of stats,ch,was enacted october.immediately,referendum proponents commenced their effort to overturn the act and collected signatures sufficient to qualify the measure for the march,ballot.on december,state senators john burton and jackie speier initiated a proceeding in the county of sacramento superior court,subd.b challenging the referendum petition on two grounds.first,they contended that the title and summary,which is set forth on the first page of the petitions and on the signature pages,contains a significant,misleading and prejudicial error.it states that sb creates mandatory employee health care benefits program for employers with or more employees.in fact,sb creates a mandatory program only for employers with or more employees.second,they argued that the petitions fail to set forth on each page a short title showing the nature of the petition and the subject to which it relates as required by election s code section.
the referendum proponents denied these allegations and,in addition,argued that the doctrine of laches barred senators burton and speier from making their challenge.on december,the secretary of state informed the superior court that his office would not certify the measure for the ballot unless ordered to do so by the court because the referendum petitions failed to comply with section.thereafter,referendum proponents filed their own action to compel the secretary of state to certify the referendum for the ballot.that action was consolidated with that of senators burton and speier.after briefing and oral argument,the sacramento county superior court granted the petition of senators burton and speier and denied that of referendum proponents.this petition followed.
discussion 
fundamental principles guide our review in this case.the referendum is the power of the electors to approve or reject statutes or parts of statutes except urgency statutes,statutes calling elections,and statutes providing for tax levies or appropriations for usual current expenses of the state,art.ii,subd.a.the initiative and referendum are not rights granted the people,but power s reserved by them.declaring it the duty of the courts to jealously guard this right of the people citation,the courts have described the initiative and referendum as articulating one of the most precious rights of our democratic process citation.it has long been our judicial policy to apply a liberal construction to this power wherever it is challenged in order that the right not be improperly annulled.if doubts can reasonably be resolved in favor of the use of this reserve power,courts will preserve it.citations.rossi brown cal th,d.consistent with this policy,we recently observed,t he ballot box is the sword of democracy.a court will intervene in the process only when there are clear,compelling reasons to do so.san francisco nishioka th,d.at the same time,despite the courts duty to jealously guard the people right of initiative and referendum noncompliance with the elections code can result in disqualification from the ballot although courts are charged to construe the elections code to favor the people awesome power,the statutes designed to protect the elector from confusing or misleading information should be enforced so as to guarantee the integrity of the process,at,d,citations omitted.
the attorney general title and summary.
prior to circulating a referendum petition for signatures,proponents must submit it to the attorney general for preparation of a title and summary of the chief purpose and points of the proposed measure which may not exceed words.the summary must be included in the petition to be circulated in type,upon each page of the petition on which signatures are to appear,subd.a and upon each section of the petition preceding the text of the measure,subd.b.the attorney general is required to provide an impartial statement in language that shall neither be an argument,nor be likely to create prejudice,for or against the proposed measure.the main purpose of the title and summary requirements is to avoid misleading the public with inaccurate information.amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d,and see clark jordan cal d,boyd jordan cal d.
the title and summary prepared by the attorney general read as follows 
referendum petition to overturn amendments to health care coverage requirements.if signed by the required number of electors and timely filed with the secretary of state,this petition will prevent implementation of chapter,statutes of,previously approved by the legislature and governor,unless and until it is approved by a majority of voters.measure creates mandatory employee health care benefits program for employers with or more employees.employees working hours per month are covered.fee for coverage paid at least by employer and up to by employee contribution.exempts employers providing for alternative coverage.
senators burton and speier argue here,as they did below,that the summary is affirmatively misleading because it states that the bill passed by the legislature creates mandatory employee health care benefits program for employers with or more employees when in fact section of the bill specifies that the health care benefits provisions will not apply to businesses employing to persons unless a tax credit is enacted that is available to those employers with at least employees but no more than employees.the tax credit has not been enacted.
referendum proponents reply that the attorney general statement is technically correct.they argue the measure does enact a mandatory health care benefits program for all employers with or more employees even if employers with to employees will only become subject to the law if the specified tax credits are enacted.the program,however,is still mandatory.
senate bill is a relatively lengthy and complex bill with the goal of providing health care coverage to employees through contributions from both the employer and employee.the attorney general was mandated to prepare a title and summary of the referendum to overturn this legislation in words or less.this can be a difficult task where multiple reasonable interpretations of the referendum and the complex underlying legislation are possible.our high court has therefore required that all legitimate presumptions should be indulged in favor of the propriety of the attorney general actions.epperson jordan cal d.the attorney general is required to summarize the chief purpose and points of a measure,and i f reasonable minds can differ as to whether a particular provision is
