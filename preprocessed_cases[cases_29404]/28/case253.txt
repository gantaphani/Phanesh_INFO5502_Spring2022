trudy nolles,angie palmer,and david jeffrey collectively plaintiffs are registered voters in nebraska who brought this action challenging the state committee for the reorganization of school districts hereinafter state committee implementation of legislative bill lb,which implementation occurred prior to the november referendum vote which ultimately repealed lb.the plaintiffs claim that the state committee actions violated the plaintiffs rights to substantive and procedural due process and their right to vote as protected by the united states constitution.we dismiss both of the due process claims for lack of standing,and we affirm the district court judgment dismissing the right to vote claim.
in,the nebraska legislature,overriding the governor prior veto,passed lb,which,inter alia,mandated the dissolution of all class i school districts and required the class i school districts to be merged into larger school districts that served students through the twelfth grade.class i school districts provided education for students only from kindergarten through the eighth grade.lb required the state committee to issue orders by december,directing how each class i school district would be merged.the orders merging the school districts were required by lb to take effect on june,following the end of the school year.
nebraska citizens commenced a referendum effort,see.const.art.iii,and obtained enough signatures to put the repeal of lb on the ballot at the next general election,which was to be held on november.the referendum effort did not,however,garner enough signatures to suspend the operation of lb pending the result of the election,as required under nebraska constitution article iii,section requiring the signature of of registered voters to suspend the operation of the challenged law.three residents and taxpayers in class i school districts,along with several school districts,filed suit in nebraska state court referred to as the pony lake litigation seeking an injunction to prevent the state committee from complying with lb and entering consolidation orders before the november election.the state district court granted a permanent injunction,finding that the effective dates of the consolidation orders impermissibly burdened the people right of referendum.
the state committee appealed the injunction to the supreme court of nebraska.under nebraska law,the appeal stayed the district court injunction,see,and the supreme court declined to issue its own temporary restraining order.on december,no longer under any injunction,the state committee issued its orders of merger as required by lb,although the orders were not to take effect until june.the state court appellees then,claiming that lb effective dates denied them the right to vote and the right to freedom of speech protected by the united states constitution.the supreme court of nebraska reversed the district court on march,concluding that the trial court had misapplied nebraska constitutional provisions regarding referendums and holding that article iii,section of the nebraska constitution clearly provided that where the referendum petition failed to garner sufficient signatures,the legislation facing the ballot was not to be suspended pending the vote.see pony lake sch.dist.state comm.for the reorg.of sch,cert.denied,d.the state supreme court also addressed the federal voting right and free speech right issues raised by the to determine if the trial court could be affirmed on either alternative basis but determined that it could not.it determined that the right to vote protected by the federal constitution applied to the right to participate in a representative government and had no impact on the direct democracy referendum process.id.at.it further found no free speech violation because the referendum process did not restrict the state appellees ability to communicate with voters about their attempt to repeal lb.id.at.
after the supreme court of the united states denied the pony lake plaintiffs petition for certiorari on may,the current plaintiffs,none of whom were parties to the state court litigation,brought a declaratory judgment action in federal district court on june,claiming that lb violated the federal constitution protection of the rights to vote and to freedom of speech,and the fourteenth amendment protection of the rights to substantive due process and procedural due process.they sought a declaration that the state committee actions were unconstitutional and therefore null and void.in the meantime,the school districts were merged pursuant to lb effective june.the federal district court stayed its ruling on the claims to see if the voters would retain lb,thus mooting the claims.the referendum appeared on the ballot at the november,general election,and the voters of nebraska voted to repeal lb.nothing about the repeal affected the prior actions of the state committee or otherwise authorized the of the dissolved school districts.
the district court subsequently dismissed the federal case,finding all of the claims to be barred by res judicata based on the pony lake litigation.the district court also determined that the right to vote and the right to freedom of speech claims were mooted because the plaintiffs did in fact vote on the referendum and that the due process claims lacked merit.the plaintiffs appeal 
due process

substantive due process 
the plaintiffs claim that the implementation of lb prior to the referendum vote,as required by article iii,section of the nebraska constitution,rendered their vote in the referendum election ineffective,resulting in a fundamentally unfair election process in violation of their right to substantive due process.the contested standing issue with respect to the substantive due process claim is whether the plaintiffs can establish an injury in fact.a federal court can not pronounce any statute,either of a state or of the united states,void,because irreconcilable with the constitution,except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.baker carr,d internal marks omitted see also id.at.holding that only those voters who allege facts showing disadvantage to themselves as individuals have standing to sue.federal courts lack the authority to review legislative acts merely because they are allegedly unconstitutional.rather,the courts are limited to considering the constitutionality of a legislative act only when it is said to result in or threaten a direct injury to the party challenging the act.see massachusetts mellon.dismissing for lack of standing a claim that the maternity act was unconstitutional in a case brought based on taxpayer standing.w here large numbers of americans suffer alike,the political process,rather than the judicial process,may provide the more appropriate remedy for a widely shared grievance.fed.election comm akins,d.

the supreme court has consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about only harm to his and every citizen interest in proper application of the constitution and laws,and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at not state an article iii case or controversy.lance coffman,d quoting lujan,at.in lance,four colorado voters brought a claim in federal court,alleging that a provision of the colorado constitution permitting congressional redistricting only once per census violated their elections clause right to have their elected representatives set their congressional district boundaries see id.the supreme court held that the voters lacked standing to challenge application of the colorado constitution because their only injury,that the the elections d not been followed,alleged only a generalized grievance.id.at.the court found the voters claim to be quite different from the sorts of injuries alleged by plaintiffs in voting rights cases where it had found standing.id.distinguishing baker,at,where the court held that voters in specific counties had standing to challenge as a substantive due process violation a state apportionment statute that apportioned state representatives among counties in a racially discriminatory manner see also hays,at.holding that while a plaintiff residing in a racially gerrymandered district had standing to challenge the redistricting,a plaintiff not residing in such a district lacked standing to challenge the redistricting.

the plaintiffs in this case are attempting to bring a generalized grievance shared in common by all the voters in nebraska who voted to repeal lb.because they have not asserted a personalized injury,they lack standing to assert a violation of substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment.the plaintiffs couch their claim as one against the actions of the state committee in voting to dissolve the class i school districts prior to the referendum election.we respectfully reject this characterization.first,the state committee did not act of its own accord,exercise its own independent judgment or discretion,or vote in any sense of the term,but instead acted pursuant to the mandatory requirements of the nebraska constitution and the lawful directions of the then lb,which ordered the state committee to dissolve the school districts on or before december,with an effective date of june.see appellants app.at,lb o n or before december,the state committee shall enter an order dissolving any class i school district that does not comply with the requirements of subsection of section of this act emphasis added,lb the effective date shall be june,for all other purposes besides establishing residency.the state committee members did not vote to dissolve the school districts,but merely acted to carry out their obligatory duties as mandated by the duly enacted and then binding and effective legislation.
second,the claim that the application of article iii,section of the nebraska constitution which prevented the delaying of the implementation of lb until after the referendum election resulted in a fundamentally unfair election does not allege a personalized injury.the plaintiffs do not allege that they were treated differently than other voters or that their votes were diluted as compared to other voters,that election officials refused to count their votes or failed to follow state election procedures,or even that the state committee violated state law in dissolving the school districts the plaintiffs complaint is the the state committee followed state law to the plaintiffs detriment.nebraska voters successfully repealed lb through the referendum voting process.as in lance,they challenge only the application of the nebraska constitution to the referendum process.this is a generalized grievance better left to the state political and legislative process.in short,the plaintiffs fail to allege a specific individualized injury necessary to establish standing in federal court resulting from the allegedly unfair election,that is,an injury not shared by all the voters who voted as they did in the referendum election.see appellants suppl.br.at,arguing that there had been an injury to the right of every voter to a fundamentally fair election.because the plaintiffs lack federal article iii standing,their substantive due process claim must be and is dismissed for lack of federal jurisdiction.
procedural due process 
the plaintiffs,all property taxpayers,also brought a procedural due process claim,alleging that the consolidation of the class i school districts would increase property taxes for some properties located in a former class i district,and that they were entitled to a hearing before their property taxes could be raised.none of the plaintiffs alleged,however,that their own property taxes were in fact or would be increased,only that some property taxes within the state would be raised,some would be lowered,and some would remain unchanged.indeed,a t the time this suit was filed the tax rates for the newly reorganized districts had not yet been set.appellants suppl.br.at.the amended complaint filed in the district court did not mention an increase in property taxes at all,but asserted only that the state committee actions of dissolving school districts and changing school district boundaries were actions requiring a hearing.appellants app.at.
