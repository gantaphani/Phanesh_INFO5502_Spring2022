samuel former official of the puerto rico national he was terminated from that position on account of his political affiliation.he sued the commonwealth of puerto rico,the puerto rico national guard,and various officials,seeking relief primarily under.this interlocutory appeal presents only the question whether the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from lopez damage claims.
lopez was hired as director of the general services section of the puerto rico national guard in.in the elections,the popular democratic party pdp defeated the new progressive party npp.known supporter of the that after the election,he was gradually stripped of his professional duties.in july,disciplinary proceedings were instituted against him within the national guard.
lopez then filed suit in federal district court in puerto rico,seeking injunctive and monetary relief.in july,while his suit was pending,lopez was terminated.he sought preliminary injunctive relief ordering his reinstatement and amended his complaint to reflect the fact of his termination.in october,the district court denied lopez request for preliminary injunctive relief.
shortly thereafter,the individual defendants moved for a ruling on their previously asserted defense of qualified immunity.they urged that lopez position was not protected from political patronage firings under the elrod branti line of cases,see elrod burns,d branti finkel,d,and that in any event,defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because any such protection was not clearly established at the time of lopez termination.
the district court denied the motion,and defendants filed this interlocutory appeal.although the district court order is not a final disposition of the case,we have jurisdiction to the extent defendants seek review of the district court denial of their qualified immunity defense,torres puerto rico,cir,but only so far as it rests on a legal ruling rather than a factual dispute.riverdale mills pimpare,cir.as to the legal questions,our review is de novo.galloza foy,cir.
the qualified immunity defense depends on whether the nature of lopez position was such that defendants were entitled to consider his political affiliation as a job qualification and,even if they were not,whether a reasonable officer at the time would have understood patronage dismissal to be barred.see limone condon,cir.analytically,the second question may often be answered without resolving the first,but in accordance with saucier preferred approach,we not the questions in sequence.saucier katz,d.
in elrod,the supreme court announced a new rule rendering patronage firings a violation of the first amendment save where political affiliation is an appropriate qualification for the particular position.elrod,at.branti,at.yet,as we said in flynn city of boston,cir,cert.denied,d,doctrine in this area remains 
largely a porridge of general statements and variables positions are less likely to be protected to the extent that they are higher,more political,more confidential,and so on duties prevail over titles everything depends on circumstances.
our decisions have asked whether a position functions are those of a policymaker,a privy to confidential information,a communicator,or some other office holder whose function is such that party affiliation is an equally appropriate requirement.jimenez fuentes torres gaztambide,cir en banc,cert.denied,d see also flynn,at.actual functions of the job,not titles,control,and an official description of job functions is a presumptively reliable basis for determining those functions.olmeda,cir citation omitted.
we also consider the position relative pay and whether it entails technical competence,power to control others,authority to speak in the name of policymakers,public perception,contact with elected officials and responsiveness to partisan politics and political leaders,cir.under the case law,the classification of a position as career rather than trust under puerto rico law is relevant,although not dispositive,cir.
as director of the general services section,lopez headed the unit of the guard responsible for inventory not including military equipment,utilities,property maintenance and related functions.he supervised approximately thirty other employees.both are factors tending to indicate that one position involves discretionary judgments,which in turn often entail policymaking.see,cir.he earned just over per year and his job classification form said that review of his work was superficial as opposed to thorough.
on the other hand,lopez position was classified as a career position under puerto rico law and a closer look at his detailed job description suggests that he had modest,if any,involvement in policymaking.true,the first listed responsibility is spacious plans,coordinates and supervises the activities of the general services section relating to maintenance,property,purchasing,transportation,reproduction,inventory,receiving equipment,leasing of establishments and general services,but almost all of the specifics are routine and fairly pedestrian.they include merely as examples responsibility for 
hiring and radio maintenance services,radios,fumigation,cleaning and others,whether with federal or state funds 
matters relating to the telephone service switchboard and state transportation regulations,use,
seeing that the agency is provided with utility service of water,electricity and telephone 
supervis ing the work of employees working in the state warehouse,their purchasing,inventories,
oversee ing proper filling in of purchasing logs and controls and control of existing property 
revis ing and coordinat ing matters relating to the maintenance and cleaning of the agency and 
supervising employee training in the computer and programming system.
in addition,a number of the functions involve reporting and other paperwork matters most look mechanical,responsible for seeing that all contracts are filed with the comptroller office pursuant to provisions,although a few not necessarily policy judgments depending on the precise role lopez actually played in the process,supervises bids carried out in the section purchasing area.
so far as appears,lopez job did not involve advising any senior officials on policy matters.he did not operate as a spokesperson or otherwise liaise with the public or other government agencies,except in ways largely ministerial.his job does not appear to have entailed discretionary judgments involving the implementation of policy,broadly understood.as to bid supervision,the district court found that puerto rico law largely divested lopez of discretion in handling bids of significant size.
lopez did supervise approximately thirty other employees,but they were mostly janitors and other employees.it is hard to see how lopez position implicates significant policy issues,let alone partisan political interests or concerns,branti,at,nor does he appear to be one of those officials or employees who are significantly connected to.flynn,at.
although lopez reported directly to a political appointee,defendants have failed to identify policy decisions in which lopez was directly involved or over which he had influence.their main argument is that the puerto rico national guard is involved in as law enforcement and natural disaster involve policymaking and implicate partisan concerns that as director of general services lopez was involved in procuring and maintaining the guard inventory and property and that because a proper supply chain is critical to any successful operation,lopez was well positioned to frustrate any programs or operations with which he disagreed.
this argument proves too much.any malfunctioning cog can jam the gears.an ability to undermine operations through incompetence or malfeasance does not mean the actor engaged in policymaking or was a confidante or spokesman for policymakers.hadfield mcdonough,cir,cert.denied,d.on the spectrum between policymaker and clerk,at,lopez was closer to the latter and is,at least on the present record,protected under elrod.whether his termination was in fact politically motivated is a quite different question.
still remaining is the question whether his status was clearly established at the time of his termination.of course,the abstract right of a employee to be free from politically motivated termination dates from elrod and branti but this is not enough to defeat qualified immunity.the purpose of qualified immunity is to protect reasonable,if mistaken,decision making by government officials,jordan carter,cir,and it does not matter whether the mistake is related to broad principle or specific application.
the crucial question here is whether a reasonable official acting at the time of lopez termination should have known on what side of the line lopez own position fell,at.largely for prudential reasons,the test is not subjective but asks what a reasonable official would have thought.pagan calderon,cir.on the present facts,this is a close call but the issue is treated as one of law,at and,in disagreement with the able district judge,we believe that as the law stood when the decision was made a reasonable official could albeit mistakenly have deemed lopez outside protection.
as already explained,a few features of lopez position in combination might have led reasonable superiors of lopez involved in the termination decision to believe he was subject to patronage dismissal for example,that he headed the unit in question,that some of his duties were broadly phrased even if seemingly less impressive in practice,that he was fairly well paid and his position lightly supervised,that he reported directly to a political appointee and that he supervised thirty other employees.
defendants also point to two prior first circuit opinions in which we held that the personnel and general services officer in the ombudsman office and the regional director of the puerto rico general services administration were subject to political dismissal.see,cir roman melendez inclan,cir.both cases are distinguishable because the jobs were classified as trust positions,and involved supervision of large numbers of employees,discretionary provision of government services,representation of the agency before the public and other agencies.
but,weighing in defendants favor,the job titles are similar,and in roman melendez we noted that in every case concerning regional directors of government agencies in puerto rico,we have concluded,at least for purposes of qualified immunity,that a regional director was,in fact,a policymaker.at.those reading our past decisions like could reasonably have believed that in general,middle managers with impressive sounding titles and duties were generally outside the protected category.
the district court own contrary decision rests significantly on a possible ambiguity in our own case law,which we now repair.some of our precedents may suggest that even if an official has significant policymaking responsibility,he is still protected unless it is also established that the policy judgments are those for which partisan political motivations or judgments are appropriate,jimenez fuentes,at by contrast,other language from our case law indicates that involvement in policy or matters implicating political disagreement is sufficient,flynn,at see also tomczak city of chicago,cir.
it is conceivable that there are rare cases where the distinction might,a high official whose duties were nonetheless entirely technical.jimenez fuentes,at.but for the most part policymaking is in the nature of things the basis for preserving the right of the democratic political process to operate civil service protections can be afforded by statute but the constitution does not require them.the reference to partisan politics comes from branti but it is far from clear that it comprised a separate test.at.
and for his part,plaintiff has not cited any analogous first circuit cases that would have put defendants on notice of jeopardy.given past precedent,we can not say it was clearly established that lopez,a director of a significant unit within the puerto rico national guard,was insulated from political dismissal.accordingly,while lopez may seek injunctive relief for his termination,he may not obtain monetary relief from the individual defendants in their personal capacities.
the order denying qualified immunity is vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.the damage claims against the individual defendants in their personal capacities are barred but the suit may otherwise proceed.all parties will bear their own costs.
it is so ordered.

this circuit leads the nation as one of the most prolific generators of political discrimination cases in this area of litigation,the district of puerto rico has the dubious distinction of being the most fecund district in the circuit.see,cir i n puerto rico,a change between the popular democratic party pdp and the new progressive party npp gives rise to overly zealous political operatives of the prevailing party terminat ing,demot ing,or reduc ing the salaries of employees affiliated with the outgoing opposition party.as a result of the proliferation of these cases and their public notoriety,the legal precepts established by them are widely known in puerto rico,particularly by those in public administration.it is,therefore,inconceivable in this day and age that a reasonable public official would an inquest into whether a position in a government agency requires political affiliation before taking the drastic action of firing an employee based on party affiliation.considering the state of the law,one who fails to do so can hardly be classified as a reasonable public official.
any reasonable public official conducting such an inquiry would have concluded that position was not one requiring political affiliation.indeed,by following the case law in this circuit,the majority properly reaches the conclusion that related position was protected from political patronage dismissal.op.at on the spectrum between policymaker and clerk,lópez quiñones was closer to the latter and is,at least on the present record,protected under elrod.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.

it is in the granting of immunity that i part company with my learned colleagues.under our qualified immunity law,after finding that a constitutional right was violated,we turn to whether the law was clearly established at the time of the violation and whether a reasonable public officer would have understood that he was violating that right.see sueiro vázquez torregrosa de la rosa,cir.i disagree with the majority conclusion that as the law stood a reasonable of
