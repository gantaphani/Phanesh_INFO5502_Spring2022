this appeal is about voting.florida statute says that no person may solicit voters within feet of the entrance to any polling place or early voting site,and broadly defines solicit to include,among other things,seeking or attempting to seek a signature on any petition.stat.a b the florida statute codifies the florida legislature view that the right of florida citizens to vote warrants substantial protection from is,bustle,stir,the voting place.today,we must decide whether the florida legislature went too far in defending the right to vote by banning solicitation that targets voters exiting polling and that also concerns matters unrelated to any issue then on the ballot.we conclude that the florida legislature did not go beyond its lawful power and,thus,reverse the district court decision to bar enforcement of the florida statute.
background 
plaintiff citizens for police accountability political committee is a political action committee in the state of florida.plaintiff florida state conference of the naacp is the parent organization of florida branches of the national naacp.plaintiffs support an amendment to the fort myers,florida,city charter that would create a citizen oversight panel for the city police department.to place the charter amendment on a ballot,though,plaintiffs must gather signatures from percent of the city registered electors as of the last preceding municipal general election.stat.plaintiffs claim that the best way to obtain signatures is to approach voters exiting polling places.
in january,plaintiff citizens for police accountability political committee tried to solicit signatures from voters leaving a polling place in fort myers although the proposed charter amendment related to nothing then on the ballot,election officials,in accordance with the florida statute,banned the from soliciting voters within feet of the polling place.plaintiffs say that many voters were able to park,vote,and leave without interacting with the.
then in august,plaintiffs filed suit and sought injunctive relief under against kurt browning,in his capacity as secretary of state of the state of florida,and sharon harrington,in her capacity as supervisor of elections in lee county,florida collectively,the state.plaintiffs claimed that the florida statute violated their first amendment right to engage in political speech at polling places.plaintiffs asked the district court to declare the florida statute unconstitutional on its face and as it applied to their efforts.plaintiffs also sought to enjoin the state from enforcing the florida statute against them when they solicited voters leaving polling places on election day later in august.as with the january election,the proposed charter amendment related to nothing on the ballot in the august election.
the district court held oral argument just before the august election.the next day,the district court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the state from enforcing the florida statute against plaintiffs at polling places on election day the district court concluded that the florida statute was probably unconstitutional as it applied to plaintiffs efforts because the state had produced little evidence that the ban was necessary to serve a compelling interest or that it was sufficiently drawn to achieve that end.the state appeals 
standard of review 
we review a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.klay united healthgroup,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard,applies the law in an unreasonable or incorrect manner,follows improper procedures in making a determination,or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.id.we review de novo questions of law.united states endotec,cir.
discussion 
a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy.mcdonald robertson,cir quoting all care nursing,bethesda mem l,cir.to secure an injunction,a party must prove four elements a substantial likelihood of success on the merits irreparable injury absent an injunction the injury outweighs whatever damage an injunction may cause the opposing party and an injunction is not adverse to the public interest.id.
the state challenges on appeal only the district court conclusion that plaintiffs established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that the florida statute is unconstitutional as it applies to efforts.the state admits that the florida statute infringes some on plaintiffs right to engage in political see meyer grant,d but contends that the restriction is necessary and narrowly tailored to protect the,at least,equally critical right to vote free from intimidation,interference,and fraud.
in burson freeman,d,the supreme court addressed the facial constitutionality of a tennessee statute that proscribed campaign activity within feet of a polling place id.at.considering the tennessee statute as a restriction on political speech in a public forum,the statute could survive only if it was necessary to serve a compelling state interest and was narrowly drawn to achieve that end.id.at quoting perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.
the supreme court upheld the tennessee statute in doing so,a plurality of the supreme first reviewed whether tennessee had a compelling interest to support its statute.tennessee offered two protecting voters from confusion and undue influence and preserving the integrity of the election process.id.at.the plurality agreed that those interests were sufficiently compelling to warrant protection.id.
the plurality then turned to whether the tennessee statute was necessary to serve those compelling interests.in typical cases involving review,the supreme court would look to the state to offer evidence that the pertinent statute is necessary to promote the compelling interest.see eu san francisco county democratic cent,d.but in burson,the plurality required tennessee to produce no evidence of necessity.burson.at.instead,the plurality relied on the long history of regulation to combat election misconduct,the substantial consensus in favor of a secret ballot secured by a zone that emerged from that history,and common sense to conclude that some restricted zone around the voting area was necessary to secure tennessee compelling interests.id.emphasis in original.
the plurality last examined whether the tennessee statute was narrowly tailored.to pass this test,a state normally must show that the pertinent statute used the least restrictive means available to serve the compelling interest.see boos barry,d.the plurality recognized,however,that it faced a unique situation because of the importance of protecting the right to vote and the difficulties in and dangers of requiring tennessee to demonstrate the effects of its statute on political stability burson.at.so the plurality departed from the customary analysis and applied a modified burden of proof under which the tennessee statute was sufficiently tailored if it was reasonable and did not significantly impinge on constitutionally protected rights.id.at emphasis in original.the plurality concluded that the minor geographic limitation in the tennessee this more lenient standard.id.the statute was constitutional.
the parties dispute the extent to which burson affects this case.the state says that the florida statute is no different than the tennessee statute in burson and,thus,the florida statute should survive for the same reasons.plaintiffs,on the other hand,claim that the facts in burson are materially different because there a campaign worker wanted to solicit votes on election day,while here plaintiffs aim only to seek the supporting signatures of had already a issue.
we accept that burson does not bind us here the material facts are different in some ways.nevertheless,we believe that the burson plurality opinion is highly persuasive and we extend its reasoning to the facts of this case.
compelling interest 
under the burson plurality standard,we must first examine whether the state has a compelling interest to support its statute.the state contends that it shares the same compelling interests as tennessee in burson protecting voters from confusion and undue influence and preserving the integrity of the election process.plaintiffs take no issue with the presence or legitimacy of those compelling interests in this case.nor do we.
having identified the pertinent compelling interests,we turn to the more difficult question of whether the florida statute is necessary to serve those interests.the state claims that it need not produce evidence of exit solicitors intimidating voters or interfering with the election process to prove necessity.instead,the state asserts that it,like tennessee in burson,may rely on our country long history of election regulation,the widespread agreement that emerged from that history,and common sense to show that the ban on exit solicitation within feet of a polling place is necessary to promote its compelling interests.
plaintiffs criticize this approach.they say that exit solicitation is a peaceful,activity targeting only those voters who have already and claim that this feature distinguishes their conduct from the more intimidating,violent,and unsavory behavior talked about in the burson plurality opinion plaintiffs,therefore,argue that the state may not rely on the historical evidence of election abuse discussed in the burson plurality opinion but must instead offer its own proof that the ban on exit solicitation in the florida statute is necessary.echoing the district court,plaintiffs say that the state has produced no such evidence.
about history,we agree with the state.we simply can not accept that exit solicitation is so different from the other political conduct highlighted in burson to compel a different result here.as we see it,commotion tied to exit solicitation is as capable of intimidating and confusing the electorate and impeding the voting deterring potential voters from coming to the other kinds of political canvassing or political action around the polls.this observation seems especially true given the reality that polling places are of such a diverse size and shape,including sometimes using the same doors to enter and exit the polling place,that voters waiting to cast their ballot will often be close to and indistinguishable from voters who have already done so although plaintiffs suggest that election officials can police the polls to ensure that exit solicitation remains peaceful and targets only voters who have already voted,we believe this proposal places too great a burden on those officials to make decisions on who is being solicited,on how they are being solicited,and about what they are being solicited an invitation to controversy and more disturbances then and there.
but even in plaintiffs imagined perfect world when absolutely only those people who have voted are solicited,our belief does not waiver.the state wants peace and order around its polling places,and we accord significant value to that desire for it preserves the integrity and dignity of the voting process and encourages people to come and to vote.see buckley am.constitutional law,d acknowledging that there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order,rather than chaos,is to accompany the democratic processes quoting storer.at clean up heinrich,cir we recognize that the state has a significant interest in protecting the orderly functioning of the election process.it must ensure its voters that they may exercise their franchise without distraction,interruption,or harassment.given the example of history,if exit solicitation must be allowed close to the polls,it takes little foresight to envision polling places awash with exit solicitors,some competing albeit peacefully for the attention of the same voters at the same time to discuss different issues or different sides of the same issue.and we accept it as probable that faced with running the gauntlet will refrain from participating in the election process merely to avoid the resulting commotion when leaving the polls 
the burson plurality opinion teaches us that the state need not wait for actual interference or violence or intimidation to erupt near a polling place for the state to act the state may take precautions to protect and to facilitate voting and the pertinent history is broad enough to provide the proof of reasonableness for a zone of order around the polls.
it is hard for state election officials to know the precise moment just before solicitation becomes interference in the election process.and if an election is disturbed,it is hard to know what the impact was on the election.the cost of a disturbed election is too high to allow the state only to react to disturbances but not to prevent disturbances.we,therefore,reject the contention that the state must offer its own evidence demonstrating that the ban on exit solicitation is necessary to serve its compelling interests our country long history of election regulation,the consensus emerging from that history,and the practical need to keep voters and voting undisturbed all prove that the ban is warranted 
narrowly tailored 
we last explore the breadth of the florida statute.to prove that the florida statute is narrowly tailored,the state must show that the florida statute is reasonable and does not significantly impinge on constitutionally protected rights.burson.at quoting munro socialist workers party,d emphasis added in burson.the florida statute mirrors in many the size of the restricted tennessee statute upheld in burson.and we conclude that the florida statute is sufficiently tailored to satisfy the pertinent standard.
conclusion 
we accept that the right to engage in political discourse is the essence of.garrison louisiana,d.but voting is about the most important thing there is.and as history has taught us,the right of political discourse is far from absolute it must at times step aside so other freedoms similarly pivotal to our republic can thrive.the florida statute,which balances the right to engage in political speech against the right to vote without interference and harassment,represents one of those times.
we stress the short time a few days a year and small area less than a football field in which the florida statute suppresses some political speech around the polls plaintiffs are free to solicit signatures unencumbered most days a year and to solicit signatures outside the zone all days a year.and by the way,we are not alone in our decision other courts,in cases involving petitions,have also upheld statutes establishing zones around polling places we believe that the sanctity of the voting process and the abuse it has historically faced must allow the florida legislature to exercise some foresight,to take precautions,and to prohibit questionable conduct near polling places before that conduct proves its danger a compromised election is too great a harm to require otherwise.
we,therefore,conclude today that the florida statute does not violate the first amendment by banning plaintiffs from engaging in exit solicitation about a issue within feet of polling places in florida.accordingly,the district court abused its discretion in granting plaintiffs a preliminary injunction.
the florida statute defines solicit and solicitation to include,but not be limited to,seeking or attempting to seek any vote,fact,opinion,or contribution distributing or attempting to distribute any political or campaign material,leaflet,or handout conducting a poll except as specified in this paragraph seeking or attempting to seek a signature on any petition and selling or attempting to sell any item.the terms solicit or solicitation shall not be construed to prohibit exit polling.stat.b.
when we refer to polling places in this opinion,we also mean early voting sites.
plaintiff florida state conference of the naacp did not join the effort until april.
the district court refused to issue an injunction on the ground that the florida statute is facially unconstitutional.the district court,instead,granted the injunction on an as applied basis the extremely close to the not enforce or threaten to enforce the florida statute as to plaintiffs peaceful,orderly and solicitation of signatures for their petition to place an
