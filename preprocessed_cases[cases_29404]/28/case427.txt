this action challenges the constitutionality of two electoral districts in putnam county,georgia.appellants claim that these two districts were racially gerrymandered in violation of the equal protection clause of the united states constitution.after a bench trial,the district court granted judgment to putnam county.this appeal followed.
in,the united states district court for the middle district of georgia invalidated elections in putnam county,georgia the county,concluding that this electoral system had been created and maintained with the invidious discriminatory purpose of limiting black voters meaningful participation in the electoral process in violation of their fourteenth and fifteenth amendment rights under the united states constitution.bailey vining.the court ordered the creation of four electoral districts with districts and to be remedial districts district was constructed to have a black voting age population of district to have black voters 
over the next decade,however,the black population of putnam county declined from over,to just under this was attributable in large part to a substantial influx of white residents,largely into district the census revealed that,as a result of these population shifts,the county four electoral districts had become seriously malapportioned.there was an overall deviation from equal district population of almost all concerned realized that the county electoral districts would have to be reapportioned to satisfy the constitutional requirement of.reynolds sims,d gray sanders,d hadley junior college,d extending reynolds to school board districts avery midland county,d county commissioner districts 
the county hired christopher coates to assist it in the reapportionment process.he had represented the plaintiffs suing the county in bailey vining,which resulted in the,remedial redistricting of.coates,along with the county,consulted with linda meggers of the georgia reapportionment services office in atlanta,an office established by the legislature to provide technical assistance to local governments engaged in redistricting.it was meggers who,at the direction of the county,actually produced the plan.
the plan was approved by a majority vote of the county board of commissioners,and,pursuant to the georgia constitution,was presented to the legislature for its approval.regrettably,the legislature followed a course not unfamiliar to those observing state action in matters of this sort.in short,the legislature walked away from the issue defaulted its responsibility to deal with georgia election matters and failed to take any action on the reapportionment plan the county,through coates,took the plan to the district judge who,in bailey vining,had ordered the redistricting.the county asked the court to amend its judgment by adopting the plan although the bailey case had long been closed,the district court agreed and ordered the implementation of the new plan on an interim basis,until the georgia legislature could adopt a constitutionally satisfactory reapportionment plan.once the plan was enacted,however,no further efforts for legislative approval were undertaken 
the county did submit the plan to the department of justice the doj for its approval.section of the voting rights act prohibits the county from instituting any changes in its electoral laws until they have been precleared with the doj.to obtain preclearance,a covered jurisdiction must convince the doj that the electoral change was not adopted for the purpose of discriminating against protected minorities,nor will have that effect.the doj approved the plan,and the county implemented it.

race may not,however,be used as the primary tool in assigning voters to electoral districts.shaw reno,d.just as the state may not,absent extraordinary justification,segregate citizens on the basis of race in its public parks,it may not separate its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race.miller,at.citations omitted.traditional districting principles,such as protecting contiguity,compactness,incumbency and communities of interest may not be subordinated to race in the crafting of electoral districts.shaw,at.if race is shown to have predominated over these traditional factors in the development of a redistricting plan,the constitution requires that we strictly scrutinize that plan to determine whether it is narrowly tailored to serve some compelling state interest.bush vera,d citing miller,at.if it is not,it is unconstitutional.miller,at.
the county does not deny that it set out to maintain its two majority black voting districts,nor that it used race as a basis for assigning voters to those districts.this was not,however,the county only motive.the county was also concerned with traditional districting reapportioning its electoral districts the issue,then,is whether race predominated over these traditional considerations in the redistricting.miller,at.the plaintiff burden is to show,either through circumstantial evidence of a district shape and demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative purpose,that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.id.
the direct evidence of apportionment 
there is much in the record to indicate that racial considerations drove the redistricting.the chairman of the county commission at the time,harold dennis,testified that he told coates that maintenance of the two majority black voting districts was his and other commissioners goal in the reapportionment process in order to ensure racial proportional representation on the county commission and board of education.he testified that county officials instructed meggers that two of the voting districts should have black general populations and voter age populations as high as possible within the constraints of a range of deviation no greater than,generally,plus or minus five and to maximize the black voting strength in districts one and two.
meggers testified that her predominant consideration in crafting the plan was to maintain the core of the existing majority minority districts and strive toward a black vap voting age population.in order to achieve this benchmark,the county instructed her to include every contiguous census block available which would have the effect of increasing the black percentage in the two majority black voting districts.
coates testified that the city of eatonton was divided so as to maximize the black population within districts and,while keeping as much of the white population as possible within district.bill moore,the current chairman of the county board of commissioners,testified that the only reason behind district boundary line placement was to include as many blacks within districts and as possible and make each of these districts majority black.he testified that it was common knowledge that the law required this result.
these district lines enhanced the black voting strength in districts and,despite the fact that the county had lost almost of its black population between the and the censuses.coates testified that we took the plan that existed,we changed it to the extent of attempting to preserve the two majority black districts.we were conscious about the race of the people in the districts in doing that,and we assigned them so as to achieve the majority black districts.he testified that he believed that maintenance of the two districts was necessary in order to obtain approval of the plan by the doj 
in fact,the county submission to the doj describes the reapportionment of districts and in exclusively racial terms 
we have requested of meggers that two of the four voting districts have black general population and voting age populations as high as possible within constraints of a range of deviation no greater than generally plus or minus five.moreover,local officials requested that the available concentrations of black population be distributed substantially equally between two of the voting districts so that these districts would both be majority black.
this approach to redistricting was specifically employed because of the fact that since,two county commissions and school board districts have been represented by black representatives elected from majority black districts.
quite simply,the submitted plan creates two voting districts in which black voting strength in putnam county has been maximized.such maximization is readily apparent when it is remembered that the submitted district voting plan provides for black populations in excess of in two of four voting districts in a county which constitute of the population.emphasis in original 
that race predominated in the redistricting is also evidenced by the letter the county directed its lawyer to send to the bailey district court in following the supreme court rejection of districting in shaw.in that letter,the county attorney sought the district court advice about the continued constitutionality of the districts in putnam county since they were established along racial lines.
circumstantial evidence 
the plan assigns of the black population to two districts,each of which contains approximately black voters,in a county which contains only black residents.these percentages were obtained by the deliberate manipulation of district lines to maximize the number of black voters in the two challenged districts meggers testified that the decline in the black population in the county made the maintenance of racial hegemony in districts and a challenge she was ultimately able to do so only by utilizing the redistricting tool of keeping the majority black districts at a negative population deviation,an undercount.by deliberately choosing to underpopulate the two majority black districts,she was able to achieve the county goal of at least black voting age population within them.
meggers testified that when she did have to add voters to districts or,she was careful to do so in a way that would avoid upsetting her black voter goal.for example,after some initial population shifting,district was still significantly underpopulated,resulting in too great an overall deviation from equal district population.to reduce this deviation,she testified that she reached out into the far north of district to capture a group of voters because they were equally divided racially.she chose this racially balanced group because shifting them from district to district would help balance the districts populations without doing any harm to my numbers.the parties refer to this area which protrudes north into district as the feather.a of the creation of the feather,was the creation of a land bridge connecting the two parts of district which were virtually bisected by district feather.
similar byproducts of meggers redistricting were the smokestack and the pie slice.the smokestack,like the feather,was a protrusion into district to pick up voters who would help populate district without upsetting the racial goals.the pie slice is an area cut out of district,shaped like a piece of pie,to exclude white voters from district.in each of these cases,meggers testified that these unnatural shapes were the result of a deliberate attempt to maintain and maximize the strength in the black voting districts.
we do not lightly reverse a district court findings of fact.nevertheless,in view of the record before us,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson,at.contrary to everything said by the county during the plan creation and implementation,and the uncontroverted,solemn representations made by it to the department of justice,upon which the plan received preclearance,the district court found that race did not predominate over traditional factors in the plan.this was clearly error.
in order to reach its conclusion,the district court had to do two things.first,it had to ignore the extensive testimony from all involved that race was the primary focus of the redistricting process.second,it had to totally discount the county own assertions,indeed admissions,in its submission to the doj that race was the paramount consideration in the redistricting process.neither of these courses of action was justified.
race predominated over traditional districting factors 
the district court did not cite any of the extensive testimony from the county commissioners,coates and meggers that make it clear that,although malapportionment was the why of the redistricting plan,race was the how.all of this testimony conceded that when decisions had to be made on how to shift population from one district to another,racial considerations dominated.the testimony was overwhelming that no shift was made that would have done damage to meggers goal of black voting age population in districts and.in view of this record,even the district court conceded that it is virtually beyond dispute that the county intended to maintain these districts as districts in.
nevertheless,the court concluded that race did not predominate over traditional districting principles,because it found that the county four electoral districts are relatively compact,adhere to natural boundaries,preserve communities of interest,and protect incumbents.we disagree.
the mere recitation that traditional factors were not subordinated to race is insufficient to insulate the county decision to maximize the black populations of districts and.miller,at.the county contention that traditional factors were not subordinated to race is not supported by the record.the evidence is overwhelming that the county decided at the outset to maintain its two black voting districts and to assign as much of the black voting age population as possible to those districts.this agenda was never seriously questioned until after the supreme court decision in shaw which prompted the county to inquire of the district court concerning the constitutionality of its two districts.see vera,at.
the fact that other considerations may have played a role in the county redistricting does not mean that race did not predominate.race may be shown to have predominated even if,as here 
factors other than race are shown to have played a significant role in the precise location and shape of those districts.if the process is shown to have been infected by such a deliberate racial purpose,strict scrutiny can not be avoided simply by demonstrating that the shape and location of the districts can rationally be explained by reference to some districting principle other than race,for the intentional classification of voters by race,though perhaps disguised,is still likely to reflect the impermissible racial stereotypes,illegitimate notions of racial inferiority and simple racial politics that strict scrutiny is designed to smoke out.
shaw hunt,rev on other grounds,d.we look now to the role played in the redistricting by each of the traditional factors.
putnam county four electoral districts are relatively compact.the district court concluded that this fact militated against a finding that race predominated over this traditional districting factor.the supreme court,however,has rejected this conclusion.miller instructs that bizarreness of shape is not a threshold showing for racial gerrymandering at.shape must be considered in conjunction with racial and population densities,id.at,and in this case those factors militate against a finding that compactness trumped race when it came to reapportioning the districts.
intentionally,over of the county black population was assigned to either district or.the feather,smokestack,and pie slice all indicate that when meggers was looking for population to shift to bring her deviation into constitutional range,race determined who should be shifted.the fact that the resulting irregularities in natural boundaries are small does not undermine the inevitable conclusion that they are there at all precisely because their racial composition helped achieve the plan racial goals.see miller,at.such deliberate racial supports a finding that race predominated in the redistricting process.
race not only determined who was shifted in the redistricting process even more importantly,it also determined who was not.meggers could have reduced her almost deviation from equal district population by shifting voters from the overpopulated white districts into the underpopulated contiguous black districts.she chose not to,however,because to do so would have done harm to her racial numbers.as a result,the county,which undertook the redistricting to correct malapportionment,remains significantly malapportioned.the county commitment to the constitutional mandate of,was secondary to its primary racial agenda.this the constitution does not permit.reynolds,at.shaw,at.miller,at.
communities of interest 
the district court also concluded that the plan elevated communities of interest over race in the redistricting process.it offered this explanation for district pie slice which pulls population out of district and places them into district.the district court approved the inclusion of the pie slice in district because it is characterized by fine,old houses and populated by a predominately affluent population,in contrast to the humbler conditions in the urban areas of district two.the court concluded that,without the pie slice,there would have been an unnatural division of this distinct community of interest.even if assignment of voters on the basis of status is a legitimate,traditional districting principle,which appears unlikely,nothing in the record suggests that this was the reason for carving the pie slice out of district.on the other hand,the census tracts make clear that the population in the pie slice was largely white and would have done damage to meggers numbers.
incumbency 
finally,the district court accepted the county and meggers contention that incumbency was,in fact,the primary consideration in the reapportionment process.while it is undoubtedly true that the county was interested in protecting incumbents,it is clear that racially motivated gerrymandering had a qualitatively greater influence on the drawing of district lines than politically motivated gerrymandering,and that political gerrymandering was accomplished in large part by the use of race as a proxy.vera,at.the county sought to protect its two black incumbents by maximizing the black population in their districts incumbency protection achieved by using race as a proxy is evidence of racial gerrymandering.id.at.furthermore,it is indicative of the sort of racial stereotyping that the supreme court has condemned as resembling political apartheid 
it reinforces the perception that members of the same racial of their age,education,economic status,or the community in which they alike,share the same political interests,and will prefer the same candidates at the polls.we have rejected such perceptions elsewhere as impermissible racial stereotypes.
by perpetuating such notions,a racial gerrymander may exacerbate the very patterns of racial block voting that districting is sometimes said to counteract.
shaw,at.citing holland illinois,d.
thus,we conclude that the district court finding that traditional districting factors were not subordinated to racial considerations was clear error.
b.the county preclearance admissions 
in order to uphold the plan,the district court also had to discount the county own clear admissions in its preclearance application that race predominated in the redistricting.the court did so by finding that these representations were made in an effort to persuade the doj that the plan was not retrogressive,and were,therefore,essentially puffing.
the supreme court,itself,however,has consistently looked to statements in preclearance applications as evidentiary admissions sufficient to support a finding that race predominated over traditional districting principles.in shaw,the court observed that north carolina submission,which expressly acknowledged that the state overriding purpose in redistricting was to create two congressional districts with effective black voting majorities,was direct evidence of the legislature objective.at.
similarly,in vera,the court affirmed the texas district court determination that several of texas congressional districts had been racially gerrymandered based upon the district court reliance on the state own statements in its submission indicating the importance of race.at.thus,we do not believe that the district court dismissal of the county own clear admission that race predominated in this process was warranted 
we conclude that the district court erred when it concluded that race was not the county paramount concern in the redistricting.accordingly,the plan must be strictly scrutinized to determine whether the county has demonstrated that these districts were narrowly tailored to satisfy some compelling state interest.shaw,at.
to withstand strict scrutiny,the county must demonstrate that its redistricting plan serves some compelling interest.miller,at.furthermore,the plan must have been narrowly tailored to achieve this interest.id.
a.the county compelling interest 
the district court held that,if the plan was,it was justified by both the need to remedy past unlawful discrimination and to avoid retrogression in violation of of the voting rights act there are several reasons why we reject this conclusion.
no evidentiary basis for remedial districting 
although there is a significant state interest in eradicating the effects of past racial discrimination,shaw,at,there is no evidence in this record of the need for remedial districting.there is none because the district court specifically excluded this evidence.intervenors,the naacp and several individual voters,urged the district court to hear evidence of racially polarized voting in putnam county.they argued that this evidence was necessary to meet the strict scrutiny test,establish a compelling state interest.
the district court refused,noting that it was undisputed that the redistricting plan was developed as the result of malapportionment,the unequal distribution of people across district lines.therefore,the redistricting plan was simply a reapportionment plan,and not a remedial plan developed as the result of a finding of liability.
nor could it have been.the county already had two districts,each consistently electing minority candidates,and there was no showing whatsoever that,in,there was any need to remedy any minority vote dilution within these districts.in fact,the minority voters in these districts were already as the result of the underpopulation of these districts in relation to districts and.thus,in this case,the district court correctly refused to hear evidence of that the plan was adopted to remedy minority vote dilution.
nevertheless,the district court concluded that the plan is justifiable as a remedy for past unlawful discrimination.it based this conclusion on the demonstration of dilution and racial bloc underlay the plan.
this was error.the need for a remedy in can not be established by reliance on a wrong that has already been remedied.wygant jackson bd.of,d plurality opinion under strict scrutiny,state must have convincing evidence that remedial action is necessary before implementing affirmative action.nor can the court rely on some generalized assertion of past discrimination to justify a remedy.shaw hunt shaw ii,d.in order to rise to the level of a compelling interest,the alleged discrimination must be identified with some specificity and there must be a strong basis in evidence before a court may order a remedy.id.at.quoting wygant,at.since there is no evidence in this record of an unremedied discriminatory purpose or effect in the county electoral districting,the district court erred when it held that county had a compelling interest in remedying such discrimination 
as a compelling state interest 
the supreme court has consistently held that the purpose of preclearance requirement is to avoid erosion in minorities existing political opportunities.beer united states,d.under beer,a plan is entitled to preclearance unless it would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.id.at.emphasis added.
in the early,the doj interpreted nonretrogression mandate to require both the maximization of the number of districts,and the number of minority voters in those districts.miller,at.and the justice department implicit command that states engage in presumptively unconstitutional districting brings the act,once upheld as a proper exercise of congress authority under of the fifteenth amendment,into tension with the fourteenth amendment citations omitted abrams johnson.justice department policy unconstitutionally.section preclearance depended upon compliance with this policy.id.
as we have already seen,the county intended to comply fully with this policy.the chairman of the county commission at the time testified that he instructed coates to develop a plan with two majority black voting districts and to maximize the black voting age population in those districts.it was his understanding that the law required this result.coates testified that he,too,understood the law to require both the maintenance of the county two districts and the maximization of the black voting age population within them,and that he so instructed meggers.
meggers testified that she was instructed to maintain the two districts in order to comply with the doj nonretrogression guidelines.she constructed districts and as supermajority black districts with approximately black voters.she did so because she thought that we needed to maintain black vap in order to comply with the doj rule,which conditioned preclearance upon a minimum of black vap in a district.
in the resulting plan,the city of eatonton was divided along racial lines so as to accomplish this maximization of the black population in districts and.the county has explicitly conceded that it did so deliberately in an effort to create two districts in which black voters would constitute a because this was the law.
in its submission to the doj,the county touted its successful maximization of the black vote in districts and 
quite simply,the submitted plan creates two voting districts in which black voting strength in putnam county has been maximized.such maximization is readily apparent when its remembered that the submitted district voting plan provides for black populations in excess of in two of four voting districts in a county in which african americans constitute of the population.emphasis in original 
in view of this overwhelming evidence,the district court found that the county plan was designed to comply with the doj nonretrogression requirements by maintaining and maximizing its two districts it also concluded,as a matter of law,that compliance with is a sufficiently compelling state interest to withstand strict scrutiny.accordingly,the district court held that,even if the county had racially gerrymandered districts and,maintenance of these two districts and maximization of the black vote within them complied with the doj nonretrogression requirements and,therefore,satisfied the strict scrutiny test.
this is not the law.ironically,at the same time the county was boasting of its compliance with the doj policy,the supreme court was in the process of rejecting it.less than a year after the doj precleared the plan,the court held that race may not be used as the primary means of assigning voters to electoral districts shaw,at.then,in miller,the court made clear that it does not accept the contention that the state has a compelling interest in complying with whatever preclearance mandates the justice department issues.miller,at.the court specifically held that the doj policy was an invalid interpretation of nonretrogression requirement.the court said 
in utilizing to require states to create districts wherever possible,the department of justice expanded its authority under the statute beyond what congress intended and we have upheld w e recognized in beer that the purpose of has always been to insure that no changes would be made that would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.the justice department maximization policy seems quite far removed from this purpose and the justice department implicit command that states engage in presumptively unconstitutional districting brings the voting rights act,once upheld as a proper exercise of congress authority under of the fifteenth amendment into tension with the fourteenth amendment there is no indication congress intended such a application of,so we reject the justice department interpretation of the statute and avoid the constitutional problems that interpretation raises.
at.citations omitted.
the court also said that w hen a state governmental entity seeks to justify remedies to cure the effects of past discrimination,we do not accept the government mere assertion that the remedial action is required.rather,we insist on a strong basis in evidence of the harm being remedied.id.at.thus,section does not confer carte blanche on the doj to command racial gerrymandering in the name of nonretrogression.shaw,at.c ompliance with federal laws can not justify districting where the challenged district was not reasonably necessary under a constitutional reading and application of those laws.miller,at.
accordingly,the district court erred when it held that,even under strict scrutiny,the plan survives because the county had a compelling interest in complying with the doj nonretrogression policy.districting can not survive strict scrutiny absent a compelling state interest,and the court has made clear that that the doj requirement of black maximization without any showing of a constitutional or statutory wrong,is not such an interest.miller,at.wygant,at.
furthermore,even if black maximization were a compelling state interest,the plan would not survive strict scrutiny because it is not narrowly tailored to meet that interest.
plan not narrowly tailored 
as a result of the redistricting,districts and are underpopulated and districts and are overpopulated.meggers testified that she had to use the tool of under populating the two districts in order to achieve the county goal of a black voting age population in those districts.this challenge was created by the sharp decline in the county black population.there were simply not enough black voters to go around.only by underpopulating the black districts,and overpopulating the white districts was meggers able to create two black voting districts with supermajorities.
of course,exact equality of population in electoral districting is not required.reynolds,at.nor is there any numerical test to determine when a deviation from population equality is large enough to violate the constitutional requirement of,chapman meier,d.nevertheless,the supreme court has instructed that reapportionment plans must ordinarily achieve the goal of population equality with little more than de minimis variation.id.at.
the county plan produced an overall deviation of.this is certainly more than the de minimis deviation required of plans it even exceeds what the supreme court considers to be of prima facie constitutional validity for plans.connor finch,d deviations under presumptively valid.
more importantly,however,the size of this deviation was not the unavoidable result of some traditional districting consideration,or even a remedial effort.on the contrary,it was.it was the inevitable product of the county commitment to maintain and enhance the voting strength of its two black voting districts.this goal could only be achieved by the county deliberate decision to compensate for its declining black population by under populating the two black voting districts and overpopulating the two white districts.thus,in setting out to remedy malapportionment,the county designed a plan which deliberately malapportioned its districts.
the voting rights act does not require this result.city of richmond united states,d.the supreme court long ago rejected the contention that nonretrogression requires the permanent overrepresentation of minorities and underrepresentation of other elements of the community in order to avoid a diminution in the electoral power of a declining minority population.the court held that neither of these alternatives was intended by congress.id.rather,in such circumstances,requires no more than that the number of electoral districts fairly reflect the strength of the black community.id.
racial gerrymandering by malapportionment occurs when the deviation produced by underpopoulating a district is too great to be justified.the constitution does not permit the county to intentionally dilute the vote of any of its citizens.reynolds,at.the county obligation is to make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts as nearly of equal population as is practicable.id.
moreover,the county not only maintained its two minority districts,it actually succeeded in increasing the black voting age population in one of them,despite the decrease in the black population of the county.this was accomplished,according to county officials,in order to ensure that the voters in districts and could elect their choice of candidates and the county government would continue to have proportional representation 
in vera,the court rejected the maximization of the minority vote in a district in which their population had declined,warning that n onretrogression is not a license for the state to do whatever it deems necessary to insure continued electoral success it merely mandates that the minority opportunity to elect representatives of its choice not be diminished,directly or indirectly,by the state actions.at.emphasis in original 
nor does either the constitution or the voting rights act require racially proportional representation.bolden,at.the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment does not require proportional representation as an imperative of political organization b n othing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.awarding public office on the basis of racial quotas not only offends the equal protection clause,but would balkanize this country into competing racial factions.shaw,at.under such a system,elected officials are more likely to believe that their primary obligation is to represent only the members of that group,rather than their constituency as a whole.this is altogether antithetical to our system of representative democracy.id.at.as justice douglas explained almost forty years ago 
here the individual is important,not his race,his creed,or his color.the principle of equality is at war with the notion that district a must be represented by a negro,as it is with the notion that district b must be represented by a caucasian,district c by a jew,district d by a catholic,and so on 
id.quoting douglas,dissenting in wright rockefeller,d.
the plan maintains the two voting districts,and actually enhances the minority voting strength in one despite a declining minority population.in order to accomplish this goal,it chose to underpopulate its other two districts,thereby under representing those voters.whether there was another way to accomplish the county goals without diluting the votes in districts and,we can not say we can say,however,that the plan,gerrymandered to guarantee representation in putnam county,was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest because it went well beyond what is necessary to avoid retrogression.vera,at.citing shaw,at.
in sum,we hold that putnam county redistricting plan is unconstitutional.it assigns voters on the basis of race to electoral districts.since it does so,we have strictly scrutinized it to determine whether it is narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest.we hold that it does not meet a compelling state interest because it was designed to satisfy the doj nonretrogression requirements,which incorrectly interpreted.furthermore,the plan is not narrowly tailored because it overpopulates the two majority districts,thereby unconstitutionally diluting the vote in those districts.additionally,it maximizes the concentration of minority voters in districts and,thereby seeking unconstitutionally to ensure their electoral success.
accordingly,the plan is unconstitutional and the judgment of the district court is reversed.
as i understand the record,the facts found by the district court are not clearly erroneous.accepting the district court facts,i consider no reversible error to be present.i would affirm the district court judgment.
there are two elective bodies in the county.the board of commissioners and the board of education each have one member from each of the four electoral districts.the chair of each board is elected.
in a electoral district,a majority of the voting age population is from the minority population.upon a showing of invidious discriminatory purpose in electoral districting,a court is entitled to remedy the constitutional violation by creating these districts.mobile bolden,d.
there is some minor disagree
