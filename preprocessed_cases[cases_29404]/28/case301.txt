during the presidential campaign,plaintiff appellees,michael moss and others who opposed president bush protestors or protestors,organized a demonstration at a campaign stop in jacksonville,oregon.they contend that secret service agents,defendant appellants tim wood and rob savage agents or secret service agents,engaged in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination in violation of the first amendment,by requiring the protestors to demonstrate at a distance from the president because they were protesting rather than supporting his policies.in addition,the protestors maintain that the police officers who carried out the secret service agents directions,supervised by defendant appellants ron ruecker,superintendent of the oregon state police,and eric rodriguez,captain of the southwest regional headquarters of the oregon state police police supervisors,used excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment.they seek to hold ruecker and rodriguez liable for the use of this force.
we hold that the protestors have stated a claim against the secret service agents for violation of the first amendment.the protestors have not,however,pleaded sufficient facts to sustain their fourth amendment claim against the police supervisors.we therefore hold that the excessive force claim should be dismissed.
factual and procedural background 
during the presidential campaign,president george bush was scheduled to spend the evening of october,in jacksonville,oregon at the jacksonville inn honeymoon cottage a group of people opposed to president bush organized a demonstration to protest his policies.they discussed their plans with the chief of the jacksonville police and with the jackson county sheriff,informing both law enforcement officials that the planned demonstration was to be multigenerational,peaceful,and.the jackson county sheriff agreed to the proposed protest route and stated that officers in riot gear would not be deployed unless necessary.the jacksonville police chief similarly stated that he did not plan to use police.
at about on october,between two and three hundred protestors gathered in griffin park in jacksonville.an hour later,the protestors,in accordance with the demonstration route they had with local law enforcement,left the park and proceeded to california street between third and fourth streets.they stood in front of the main building of the jacksonville inn,approximately two blocks south of the inn honeymoon cottage where the president planned to stay a group of demonstrators gathered across third street from the protestors.
after the two groups had gathered,the president decided to stop for dinner at the restaurant at the jacksonville inn,located in the main building.neither group was aware that the president would not proceed directly to the honeymoon cottage until approximately p,an hour after the demonstrations in front of the inn began.after learning the president would be stopping at the restaurant,both and demonstrators clustered on the side of the street on which the inn main building is located.the demonstrators allege that at that point,b oth sets of demonstrators had equal access to the president during his arrival at the jacksonville inn.
shortly before the president was to arrive at the restaurant,the secret service agents on the scene requested that state and local police officers clear the alley from third street to the patio dining area behind the inn,as well as the california street alley running alongside the inn.police officers,dressed in riot gear,cleared these alleys.they also blocked third street,north of california street,and began preventing demonstrators both and from crossing the street at the intersection of third and california streets.
president bush arrived at the jacksonville inn at approximately and ate dinner on the inn outdoor patio,which was enclosed by a foot high wooden fence.this fence,along with the buildings along california street,made it impossible for the protestors to see the president.
in addition,these obstacles,as well as police officers stationed around the perimeter of the inn,prevented anyone from walking from the demonstration site to the president location on the patio.
there were several other diners on the patio in addition to the president party.in addition,upstairs from the restaurant was a group of approximately thirty people at a medical conference,some of whom ventured downstairs and,finding an unguarded door to the patio,were able to observe the president from a distance of approximately fifteen feet.
at about,the secret service agents directed state and local police to clear california street between third and fourth streets,where the protestors had been standing.they first directed the police to move the protestors to the east side of fourth street.subsequently,the agents asked that the protestors be moved to the east side of fifth street.the agents assert that they told the police that the reason for these requests was to prevent anyone from being within handgun or explosive range of the president.the protestors allege that any security rationale provided by the agents to the police was false.neither the demonstrators nor anyone staying at or visiting the inn was required to move or to undergo security screening.the protestors maintain that,in fact,the real motive for the agents action was the suppression of the protestors viewpoint that is,that the agents sought to prevent the president or the media from seeing or hearing the protestors message.
in accordance with the secret service directive,police officers in riot gear formed a line across california street,facing the demonstrators and with their backs to the demonstrators.the officers made amplified announcements,unintelligible to many of the protestors,stating that the protestors assembly was now unlawful,and ordering them to move.the protestors allege that the police failed to ascertain whether the protestors had heard and understood the direction to move,let alone give them time to move of their own accord.instead,officers forcibly moved the protestors,in some cases violently shoving them,striking them with clubs,and firing pepper spray bullets.
once the protestors had been moved to the east side of fifth street,the police officers divided them into two groups and encircled the groups,preventing some protestors from leaving the area and separating some families.the defendant police supervisors ruecker and rodriguez were not present at the protest,but the protestors allege that the two supervisors nevertheless supervised and directed the police action and that they were responsible for the training,or lack thereof,that led to the force used against the protestors.
procedural history 
at issue in this appeal is the protestors second amended complaint sac.their first amended complaint fac contained several claims for relief arising out of the facts detailed above.only two of these claims remain at issue here a claim for damages under bivens six unknown named agents,against secret service agents wood and savage in their individual capacities for viewpoint discrimination in violation of the first amendment and a claim for damages under against police supervisors ruecker and rodriguez in their personal capacities for excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment.
after the protestors filed the fac,the secret service agents moved to dismiss.the district court denied their motion and also denied them qualified immunity.the agents appealed to this court.see moss secret service,cir moss i.we held that although the facts the protestors pleaded in the fac did not rule out the possibility of viewpoint discrimination,they were insufficient to allege such a claim with the degree of precision required by bell atlantic twombly,and ashcroft iqbal,both of which had been decided after the protestors filed the fac.id.at.
in particular,we held in moss i that the protestors unsupported allegations of impermissible motive on the agents part,a sub rosa secret service policy of suppressing speech critical of the president,and systematic viewpoint discrimination at the highest levels of the secret service were,under the pleading standards,conclusory and therefore not entitled to an assumption of truth.moss i,at.we further determined that the protestors allegation that the agents directed the police to move the protestors to the east side of fourth street was insufficient to support a claim of viewpoint discrimination.we explained that the fourth street location was comparable to the location of the demonstrators in terms of its proximity to the president when he was dining at the inn restaurant.id.at.finally,moss i held that the protestors allegations concerning the guests and diners at the inn who were within close range of the president but not subject to screening or required to move offer ed little if any support for the protestors viewpoint discrimination claim,because these guests and diners were not seeking to communicate their views and therefore were not similarly situated to the protestors.id.for these reasons,we concluded that the protestors had fail ed to plead facts plausibly suggesting a colorable bivens claim against the agents.id.recognizing,however,that the fac had been filed before the supreme court decided twombly and iqbal,and that it was possible the complaint could be amended to meet the standards articulated in those cases,we granted the protestors leave to amend.id.at.
accordingly,the protestors amended their complaint.the sac,the complaint at issue here,raises the same claims as the fac but supports these claims with more and more detailed factual allegations.
after the protestors filed the sac,the secret service agents again sought to dismiss the first amendment claim.reviewing the agents motion to dismiss,the magistrate judge to whom the case was referred concluded that the allegations in the fac,held by moss i to be conclusory,were in the sac supported by factual allegations and thus entitled to an assumption of truth and that v iewing all the factual allegations entitled to assumption of truth in the sac,the protestors had pled a plausible claim.the state police supervisors also filed a motion to dismiss.the magistrate recommended that this motion also be denied,explaining that under the framework set forth by this court in ashcroft,cir,overruled on other grounds by ashcroft,the protestors had pled a plausible fourth amendment claim against the supervisors.the magistrate determined that neither the secret service agents on the first amendment claim nor the police supervisors on the fourth amendment claim are entitled to qualified immunity at this stage.
the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendation in full.before us now are the secret service agents and police supervisors appeals of the district court denial of qualified immunity.
we begin by briefly discussing the framework for evaluating whether qualified immunity is appropriate,as that framework is pertinent to both of the claims at issue.we then address the first amendment and fourth amendment claims in turn.
ii.discussion 
qualified immunity framework 
q ualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.pearson callahan,quoting harlow fitzgerald.the purpose of such immunity is to ensure that public officials may be held accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly,while shield ing them from harassment,distraction,and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.id.
to determine whether a government official is entitled to qualified immunity,we conduct a analysis.see,mattos agarano,cir.government officials are denied qualified immunity only if the facts that a plaintiff has alleged make out a violation of a constitutional right and the right at issue was clearly established at the time of the defendant alleged misconduct.pearson,at internal quotation marks omitted see mattos,at.these prongs need not be addressed in order rather courts may exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.pearson,at.
the first prong assesses whether the wrong a plaintiff alleges is,in fact,a constitutional violation.the second prong assesses the objective reasonableness of the official conduct in light of the decisional law at the time a right is clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity only where the contours of the right are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.dunn castro,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because qualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability,courts have also evaluated the sufficiency of the allegations of the defendant personal involvement in the deprivation of the right at the second stage of the qualified immunity analysis.ashcroft,at internal citation,quotation marks,and emphasis omitted see iqbal.at.
in analyzing the protestors first amendment claim against the secret service agents,we begin by addressing the first prong of the qualified immunity framework whether the facts the protestors have alleged make out a constitutional violation and then move to the next prong whether the right the protestors allege was violated was clearly established at the time of the protest.we proceed in this order because,in this instance,one can not sensibly determine the reasonableness of the agents actions without carefully identifying the right they are alleged to have violated and the conduct by which they are alleged to have done so.
with respect to the excessive force claim,we ultimately hold that the protestors have alleged insufficient facts to state a claim against the defendant police supervisors in particular.we nevertheless conduct both prongs of the qualified immunity analysis to clarify which parts of the sac are sufficient and in what respects it must be amended to state a claim.
first amendment 
the protestors claim that the secret service agents sought to suppress political speech undertaken on a public street based on the viewpoint of that speech.this claim strikes at the core of the first amendment.
public streets are the archetype of a traditional public forum.frisby schultz,as they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public,id.at quoting hague cio.in such traditional public fora,the government ability to permissibly restrict expressive conduct is very limited first amendment protections are strongest,and regulation is most suspect.long beach area peace network city of long beach,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.moreover,p olitical speech is core first amendment speech,critical to the functioning of our democratic system.id.at.traditional public fora,such as the public streets upon which the protestors sought to demonstrate gain even more importance when they are host to core first amendment speech.id.at.
as the supreme court has repeatedly reiterated,government regulation of political speech in a public forum based on its content is presumptively unconstitutional.see united states playboy entm t group,rosenberger rector visitors of the of,city of paul.when the government targets not subject matter,but particular views taken by speakers on a subject,the violation of the first amendment is all the more blatant.rosenberger,at.viewpoint discrimination is thus an egregious form of content discrimination,one from which t he government must abstain.id.the government may not regulate speech based on the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker,nor may it favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others,members of city council taxpayers for vincent.we recently summarized these longstanding principles as instructing that government may not favor speakers on one side of a public debate.hoye city of oakland.cir 
a restriction on speech is if on its face,it distinguishes between types of speech or speakers based on the viewpoint expressed or though neutral on its face,the regulation is motivated by the desire to suppress a particular viewpoint.see berger city of seattle,cir en banc citing turner broad,fcc,aclu city of las vegas,cir citing ward rock against racism.the protestors allege both that the agents actions were facially viewpoint discriminatory that is,that the agents explicitly treated and demonstrators differently and that their actions,even if facially neutral,were motivated by an impermissible purpose to discriminate against the viewpoint the protestors expressed.
in the fac,the protestors alleged that the secret service directed police to move them to the east side of fourth street,approximately the same distance from where the president was dining as the demonstrators.moss i,at.moss i held this allegation insufficient to support a plausible claim of viewpoint discrimination,explaining 
if the agents motive in moving plaintiffs away from the inn was suppression of plaintiffs message,then presumably,they would have ensured that demonstrators were moved to an area where the president could not hear their demonstration,or at least to an area farther from the inn then sic the position that the demonstrators occupied.instead,according to the complaint,the agents simply instructed state and local police to move the protestors to a location situated a comparable distance from the inn as the other demonstrators,thereby establishing a consistent perimeter around the president.
now,in the sac,the protestors allege that the agents did indeed direct that the demonstration be moved farther from the inn than the demonstration.the sac avers that the secret service agents not only directed the police to move the protestors to the east side of fourth street,but that the agents subsequently directed that the protestors be moved to the east side of fifth street.the demonstrators were left in place on the west side of third street.as a result,the protestors were more than a block farther from where the president was dining than the demonstrators,and,one can infer,were therefore less able to communicate effectively with the president,media,or anyone else inside or near the inn.
the agents object to the protestors failure to plead specifically that the president could no longer hear their protests once they were moved.while such an allegation would strengthen the protestors complaint,its absence does not make their claim implausible.regardless of whether the president and those near him could actually hear the protestors after they had been moved,it is a plausible inference from the facts alleged that the protestors chants would be less intelligible from two blocks away.
in addition,and critically,if allowed to remain in their initial locations,members of both the and groups would have been standing along the motorcade route by which the president left the restaurant.however,once the secret service agents moved them,the protestors were two blocks away from the motorcade route,while the demonstrators remained along it,and,according to the sac,could cheer for president bush as he traveled to the honeymoon cottage.
in their brief,the agents insist that the president motorcade route between the restaurant and the honeymoon cottage is irrelevant,because the armored limousine in which the president was traveling had far greater security than the patio where the president dined.this argument is unavailing for two reasons first,it rests on facts outside of the complaint and is therefore not properly cognizable at this stage.second,the assertion of a rationale can not transform a facially discriminatory policy allowing one group of demonstrators access to the president while moving protestors with the opposing view further away into a valid one.see aclu,at.
in sum,the protestors have alleged that,at the direction of the secret service agents,they were moved to a location where they had less opportunity than the demonstrators to communicate their message to the president and those around him,both while the president was dining at the inn and while he was en route to the honeymoon cottage.these allegations support a plausible claim of viewpoint discrimination.
in addition to these allegations of facial viewpoint discrimination,the protestors also allege in the sac that the secret service agents acted with an impermissible motive of shielding the president from those expressing disapproval of him or his policies.as the supreme court has explained,
t he principal inquiry in determining content or viewpoint neutrality is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys the government purpose is the controlling consideration.
ward,at emphasis added internal citations omitted.thus,if true,the motive allegation would be sufficient in and of itself to support a claim of viewpoint discrimination in violation of the first amendment.that is,it would be adequate to establish a first amendment violation even if there had been no demonstrators and therefore no differential treatment.
as noted,the secret service agents ostensibly told the police on the scene that their reason for moving the protestors was to ensure that nobody was within handgun or explosive range of the president.the protestors allege that even if the agents did give the police such an explanation,it was merely a pretext and that the agents were in actuality motivated by the determination to suppress the protestors message.a restriction on expressive activity is only content or if it is based on a reason divorced from the content of the message attempted to be conveyed.united states griefen,cir.at this stage,the protestors need only plead facts that make plausible their claim that they were moved because of their viewpoint that the security rationale,if indeed offered by the agents at all,was pretextual.the protestors,in the sac,have met this burden.
first,the sac states that it would have been impossible from where the protestors were initially located and certainly from the east side of fourth street,where the secret service agents initially directed they be moved for anyone to reach the president with a handgun or an explosive.the police cleared the alley between where the protestors were demonstrating and the inn where the president dined,and officers,clad in riot gear,blocked any access to that alley.in addition,there were buildings and a high fence blocking any contact between the protestors and the president.none of the protestors attempted to surmount these obstacles to get access to the president.the protestors therefore assert they posed no threat to the president,and there was thus no reason for them to be moved from their initial location,and certainly no reason for them to be pushed beyond the east side of fourth street to the east side of fifth street.moreover,according to the sac,the obstacles between the protestors and the president were similar to those faced by the demonstrators.if the location of the protestors had been a significant security risk,they reason,so too would have been that of the demonstrators.
second,the secret service agents allowed the demonstrators to gather along the motorcade route,well within handgun or explosive range of the president as he traveled from the inn to the honeymoon cottage where he was staying,as noted,the secret service agents argue that this distinction does not indicate that their security rationale was pretextual,because the armored limousine in which the president traveled provide d a substantially higher degree of protection from potential external threats than did the patio where he ate dinner.but one could view this explanation as further evidence of an impermissible motive even where there admittedly was no security threat,the demonstrators were forcibly located farther away from the president than the demonstrators,such that the demonstrators were within sight and hearing range of the president while the protestors were two blocks away.
finally,the sac elaborates in much more detail a conclusory allegation in the fac that the secret service maintains an officially authorized pattern and practice of shielding the president from dissent.moss i held that the pattern and practice allegation in the fac,without any factual content to bolster it,is just the sort of conclusory allegation that the iqbal court deemed inadequate.moss i,at.the sac provides this additional factual content.
the sac provides twelve detailed allegations,relying on published reports,of similar instances of viewpoint discrimination against protestors expressing negative views of the president.for example,during a speech given by president bush,those expressing critical views of the president were sequestered approximately of a mile away from where he was speaking,while those supporting the president were permitted to stand alongside the motorcade route right up to where the president was located.
in addition,the sac alleges that a policy and practice of suppressing criticism of the president is set forth in the presidential advance manual,a redacted copy of which was attached to the complaint.the advance manual directs the president advance team to work with the secret service and have them ask the local police department to designate a protest area where demonstrators can be placed,preferably not in view of the event site or motorcade route.emphasis added.removal of protestors opposed to the president,is,of course,precisely what the protestors allege happened to them.while the advance manual is designed to guide the president political advance team,not the secret service,it itself suggests that the secret service may play a part in ensuring that protestors are contained to an area away from the president.furthermore,the protestors allege that,in this instance,because of the sudden change in the president plans,the advance team had insufficient time to suppress the protest.instead,they relied on the secret service to do so.
the protestors allegations that the agents conduct in this case accords with viewpoint discriminatory practices instituted in other,similar,circumstances and encouraged by the president advance manual support the plausibility of the inference that,in this case,the secret service agents directed that the protestors be moved because of their viewpoint.
in sum,the protestors have pleaded nonconclusory factual allegations that they were treated differently than the demonstrators that any explanation for this differential treatment offered by the secret service agents was pretextual and that the agents directives in this case accord with a pattern of secret service action suppressing the speech of those opposed to the president these allegations,taken together,are sufficient to allow the protestors claim of viewpoint discrimination to proceed.
even if they acted unconstitutionally,the secret service agents are entitled to qualified immunity unless the contours of the first amendment right they violated were sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.saucier katz,internal quotations and citations omitted.the secret service agents contend that even if the protestors have established a plausible claim of viewpoint discrimination,they have failed to demonstrate that the right they claim was infringed was clearly established in the specific context at issue here.they characterize the qualified immunity question as whether 
every reasonable officer would have understood that moving the protestors only a half block farther from the president than his supporters were located constituted viewpoint discrimination in violation of the first amendment.
this statement inaccurately characterizes both the protestors allegations and the governing law.
first,as a factual matter,the parties contest the relevant distances.the protestors allege that they were moved over a block farther from the inn than the demonstrators.further,although the agents repeatedly characterize the locations of the and protestors as comparable,we have already noted that based on the facts alleged,there are relevant ways in which the distances were not comparable.
in addition,the secret service agents focus solely on the distance between the protestors and the president while he was dining.they do not address the allegation that the demonstrators were permitted to remain along the president motorcade route,while the protestors were kept away.this additional discrepancy is quite relevant in assessing whether a reasonable agent could have believed the direction to relocate the protestors was consistent with the first amendment.
more fundamentally,the protestors claim is not simply that they were moved,but that they were relocated because they criticized the president.the protestors allege that if the agents asserted a security rationale for moving the protestors,that rationale was false.that is,they allege that the agents action was both facially discriminatory and driven by an improper motive.we must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.knievel espn,cir.therefore,taking the protestors allegation of discriminatory motive as true,it is clear that no reasonable agent would think that it was permissible under the first amendment to direct the police to move protestors farther from the president because of the critical viewpoint they sought to express.
the agents suggest that because there are no cases with similar fact patterns,a reasonable agent could not have known that their conduct was unconstitutional.but the denial of qualified immunity does not require a case directly on point.ashcroft.rather,it requires that existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.id.it is beyond debate that,particularly in a public forum,government officials may not disadvantage speakers based on their viewpoint.
as decades of supreme court doctrine make clear,i t is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys.rosenberger,at see,at police dep t of chicago mosley,see also metro display adver.city of victorville,cir.the government may not grant the use of a forum to people whose views it finds acceptable,but deny use to those wishing to express less favored or more controversial views,for above all else,the first amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message,its ideas,its subject matter,or its content.mosley,at.indeed,in a case closely on point,the circuit held in mahoney babbitt that the government could not grant permits to demonstrate along the inaugural parade route to those supportive of the president and refuse permits to those opposed.
the protestors have plausibly alleged that the secret service agents acted with the sole intent to discriminate against them because of their viewpoint this intent can never be objectively reasonable.after discovery or trial,the evidence could demonstrate that the agents did not,in fact,act with viewpoint discriminatory intent or that,notwithstanding some discriminatory motivation,they acted with the primary intent to protect the president and therefore would have taken the same actions absent any discriminatory motive.in that case,they are,of course,free to renew their qualified immunity motion.see behrens pelletier,mitchell forsyth.however,the agents are not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage.
fourth amendment 
to succeed on their fourth amendment claim,the protestors must allege facts from which we could plausibly infer that excessive force was used against them that the law at the time of the protest clearly established that the force used was unconstitutionally excessive and that even though they were not present at the demonstration,superintendent ruecker and captain rodriguez played a sufficient role in the use of excessive force that they may be held liable for it.while the protestors allegations are sufficient to support a claim of excessive force and to deny qualified immunity to those who might be liable for the use of that force,they have pleaded no facts that would allow us to make a plausible inference that ruecker and rodriguez were in any way involved in the use of excessive force such that they may be held liable for it.
fourth amendment claims of excessive force are evaluated according to the framework
