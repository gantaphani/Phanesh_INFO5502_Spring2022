on june,kimberly prude was indicted on one count of voter fraud in violation of b.the charge was based on her own conduct in representing that she was eligible to vote and in casting a single absentee ballot,despite being a convicted felon under the supervision of the wisconsin department of corrections and,therefore,ineligible to vote under wisconsin law.see.stat.she was convicted of voter fraud and sentenced by the district court to months imprisonment.prude timely appeals her conviction.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
during the election cycle,prude was serving a term of supervised release for a forgery conviction in wisconsin.this crime is a felony under wisconsin law and,because her sentence was not yet complete,she was ineligible to vote under wisconsin law.stat.b see also providing for the restoration of the right to vote for felons at the conclusion of a term of probation or parole for the offense that led to voting disqualification.at regular intervals throughout her period of supervision,prude was required to meet with a corrections officer and,on numerous occasions,also was required to acknowledge and sign a copy of the rules of her supervision.among these rules was one that stated,y ou shall not,as a convicted felon,and until you have successfully completed the terms and conditions of your sentence,vote in any federal,state or local election.
at the suggestion of an acquaintance,prude became a volunteer for candidates in the presidential election campaign in the weeks leading up to the election.she made calls encouraging area residents to vote and offering to arrange transportation or absentee ballots for those who requested it.on october,with fellow campaign workers,she attended a rally at which all persons were encouraged to march to milwaukee city hall,register to vote,request an absentee ballot and vote in the presidential election prude did all of these things with her fellow marchers.she testified that,on the day she cast her vote,she observed no signs telling her that persons on supervision could not vote.the registration card she signed,which was introduced into evidence at trial,asked only two specific eligibility questions whether she was a united states citizen and whether she would be at least eighteen years of age on election day.above the signature block,the card further provided,
i certify that i meet the eligibility requirements of the state of wisconsin,and that the information i have provided is true to the best of my knowledge under penalty of perjury.if i have provided false information,i may be subject to a fine or imprisonment or both under federal or state laws.
ex.prude also filled out an application to be officially employed by the election commission as a poll worker on election day and was hired.
prude statement was that,the following day,she was discussing her volunteer work with a friend,who informed her that,because she was a felon whose civil rights had not yet been restored,she was ineligible to vote.see at.prude further testified that she called her probation officer and told him that she would be working the polls on election day.she testified that the officer told her that she could not vote.she further testified that,at this point,realizing the gravity of her mistake,she attempted to withdraw her ballot by contacting the election commission,but was told not to worry about it by a commission staff person.she testified that she received no further information regarding the withdrawal process from the person with whom she spoke at the commission and therefore took no further action.
prude continued volunteering for the campaign for a few days,then began a paid position in a community campaign with an organization called project return.
on election day,she reported to the location assigned to her by the election commission for her poll worker position and worked as scheduled.
she was arrested in following an investigation into voting fraud in milwaukee and charged based on casting a ballot despite being an ineligible voter.
at trial,in addition to introducing prude signatures on five separate rules of community supervision,each of which contained a reminder that she would be ineligible to vote until she had completed her term of supervision or parole,the government also introduced evidence that signs were posted at city hall on the date that prude had registered and voted and at the front desk of the parole office during the period in which she was required to report each of these signs reminded felons that they were ineligible to vote during parole,probation and supervision.the government further introduced the testimony of one of prude probation officers,who specifically stated that,in september of,prude had indicated her desire to volunteer for the campaign and that the officer had reminded her at that time that she was ineligible to vote.the officer stated that prude specifically acknowledged during that conversation that she understood she could not vote prude testified to the contrary.the government also introduced substantial evidence of prude conduct on election day,though she was not charged in relation to any of her activities on that day its theory apparently was that her conduct as a poll worker was probative of an intent to defraud at the time she voted,an element of the charge 
at the conclusion of a trial,the jury convicted prude of voting fraud,and the district court imposed a month sentence,to be served concurrently with a sentence imposed by the wisconsin courts on other charges.
discussion 
prude was convicted under prude now challenges three rulings made by the district court during the course of her trial.each will be discussed in turn.
rosie testimony 
prude challenges the district court admission,over her objection,of the testimony of rosie,the chief inspector at the polling location where prude worked on election day.
at trial,testified concerning the activities of a woman sent to work at her polling location on election day.was unable to identify that woman by name and could not recognize prude in the courtroom.at one point,in answer to the prosecutor question,she referred to the woman who was the subject of her testimony as the woman who you all told me is kimberly prude.at.after allowing the foundation questioning to proceed,prude attorney objected we do know who the person is that miss lewis is speaking about.she has been able to identify.id.at.the court interrupted counsel and responded,no,it goes to the weight,not the admissibility.so the court will allow it.id.
proceeded to testify that she had become concerned when,on election day,she observed the unidentified registration worker signing a card when no registrant was seated with her.see id.at.she also testified concerning two registration cards for the same voter,one with different handwriting than the first,both by prude verifying the identity of the voter.
prude specifically contends that the testimony was irrelevant and prejudicial because an appropriate foundation linking prude to the woman described had not been laid.prude appears to be arguing that the woman to whom referred could have been someone else.by allowing the testimony,she contends,the court suggested to the jury that it should attribute that woman questionable activities to prude.
we review a district court decision to admit evidence over an objection,including for lack of foundation,for an abuse of discretion.united states thomas,cir.further,we shall not overturn erroneous evidentiary rulings if the error is harmless.united states chavis,cir.
we have observed that no rule of evidence requires a foundation foundation is simply a loose term for preliminary questions designed to establish that evidence is admissible.credit legion ins,cir.prude foundation objection is essentially that relevance,and therefore,admissibility,were not established and that prejudice resulted to prude.see.stating that relevant evidence is any evidence tending to make the existence of any material fact more or less probable.providing that relevant evidence is generally admissible.
the difficulty prude faces is that,regardless of whether the admissibility testimony was correctly decided,the record discloses no actual dispute that,on election day,prude indeed was the registration worker at the rose park senior center where had been the chief inspector.see at.multiple exhibits introduced by the government placed prude at the registration desk of that location indeed,during her testimony,identified some of these documents as originating at her polling location and read aloud the name of the verifying registration worker as kimberly and kimberly prude.at.during prude own testimony,she stated that she had worked at the rose park location,described in particular her work at the registration desk,see at,and referred to conversations with a woman named rose,id.at.prude also entered into a stipulation with the prosecution that she was hired as a paid poll worker to work at the rose park senior center on election day.
the district court did not err in admitting the testimony of over prude objection.
testimony concerning the procedures for withdrawal of her vote 
prude next claims that she was denied,on relevancy grounds,the opportunity to introduce testimony about the procedures for withdrawing the vote that,she maintains,she cast unaware that the law forbade her from voting.consequently,she contends,she was denied the opportunity to submit evidence in support of her theory of defense.she further claims that the district court later permitted the government to explore the same topic with a less favorable witness.
at trial,the defense sought to introduce the testimony of sue edman,the director of the milwaukee election commission at the time of trial.the defense proffered director edman testimony on several distinct subjects.first,defense counsel stated that director edman would testify that prude was indeed an official poll worker at the rose park senior center on election day and that she had been compensated for her work.this testimony was offered to respond to testimony that she had attempted but failed to verify with the election commission that prude was an official staff member on election day.second,defense counsel stated that director edman would testify that,at the time prude voted,there was no policy in place to effectuate the withdrawal of a ballot once cast.in the defense view,this testimony would have supported prude contentions that she unsuccessfully had attempted to withdraw her ballot.this testimony also would have responded to testimony by and edith greene,both of whom had stated that there were such procedures.third,defense counsel stated that director edman would testify that the election commission office,in which prude had registered and voted,was chaotic during the election period the defense believed this testimony would have supported its argument that prude was unable to see any signage that might have been posted.
the government objected to director edman testimony on the ground that she lacked personal knowledge it pointed out that she had assumed her responsibilities with the election commission only after the relevant election cycle.the government also submitted that her testimony would confuse and mislead the jury.it agreed,however,to stipulate to prude official employment on election day.
after a substantial colloquy with counsel,the district court concluded that the testimony describing the office chaos was not relevant to the offense.at.with respect to the procedure for withdrawal,the court stated 
to allow this witness to testify to the procedure for a matter i do think we have touched on i do think that that relevant,because what happened after the four elements were met does really impact the case.or the elements of the offense.except the theory of the defense could be,well,she did really intend to deprive or defraud the residents of wisconsin,because she took steps to withdraw her vote after she found out that she did wrong.and that argument can be made without indicating that there were there was a lack of policies in the election commission for anyone to do that.
we have the testimony of detective sandvick that indicates that he was told that believe,if i recall the testimony,he was told that by the defendant.that she tried to correct this after she found out from her probation officer that she was supposed to do this.so it,i suppose,can still be argued,but whether or not there were policies in place at the election commission to do this,to recover from an improper vote,or casting of an improper vote,i do think that relevant.
it a waste of time.it is going into collateral matters that would serve to confuse the jury.
the court therefore ruled that it would allow director edman testimony only as custodian of public records to establish prude employment.the parties entered into a stipulation as to this fact,and therefore edman was not called as a witness.
later,prude counsel called officer neil saxton to the stand.counsel line of inquiry on direct examination focused on officer saxton investigation of prude election day activities.specifically,one item in evidence was a set of two different voter registration cards,each purporting to verify the identity of the same voter.prude had both of these cards,and another individual,lawrence madison,had provided an additional verification signature on one of them.defense counsel tested the thoroughness of officer saxton investigation into the duplicate cards.she asked officer saxton if he had investigated whether madison improperly might have verified the card.she then asked about the extent of any conversations officer saxton had had with prude herself during his investigation.when he stated that he spoke with prude when she was arrested,counsel asked what prude had said,if anything.over the government hearsay objection,saxton stated that she had said something about calling the election commission to withdraw her vote.see id.at.
on,the government asked officer saxton if he was aware of a procedure for someone to challenge their sic vote,an absentee ballot,once it been cast.id.at.officer saxton responded with a lengthy explanation of how someone else would challenge another voter ballot,if he believed that the voter had been ineligible and therefore that the vote should not be counted.no objection was made to this testimony.
on appeal,prude argues that it was error for the court to admit officer saxton testimony on withdrawal procedures after ruling that edman testimony was inadmissible because it was irrelevant.the government responds that prude opened the door to officer saxton testimony on the point by asking him about her statements made at the time of arrest.because the defense did not object to the introduction of this evidence at trial,we review for plain error.before we may correct an error not raised at trial,we must find that there is error,that it is plain,and that it affects substantial rights.once these three conditions have been met,we may exercise our discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states james,cir citation omitted.it is the defendant burden to establish that substantial rights were affected by establishing that,but for the error,the outcome of the trial probably would have been different.id.
we can not accept the government view that the defense had opened the door to this testimony in its direct examination of officer saxton.fairly read,the direct examination was limited to prude subjective belief that she had cast the vote while under the mistaken belief that she was not forbidden to vote.during its earlier ruling on the defense proffer of edman testimony,the district court clearly anticipated that prude would and could introduce such evidence of her own attempts to withdraw her ballot as circumstantial evidence of her good faith,without the necessity of any further examination of the existence of procedures for doing so.at t hat argument regarding her personal attempt to withdraw can be made without indicating that there were there was a lack of policies.by contrast,the government inquiry on was designed to elicit evidence on the objective existence of
