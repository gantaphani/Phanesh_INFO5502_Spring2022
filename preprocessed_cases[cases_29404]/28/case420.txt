plaintiffs are former independent political candidates who appeal the district court order granting summary judgment to the state defendants on plaintiffs constitutional challenge to alabama ballot access restrictions.specifically,under alabama law,independent candidates seeking ballot access must submit a petition with the signatures of at least three percent of qualified electors who cast ballots at the last general election for governor,and the signature petition must be filed by the first primary election date,which is the first tuesday in june.see current version at current version at.plaintiffs contend that the signature requirement and primary election date filing deadline,independently and in combination,infringe upon their first and fourteenth amendment rights.after review and oral argument,we agree with the district court that,based on the record in this case,plaintiffs have not shown a constitutional violation,and thus we affirm.
background 
election campaign 
on april,plaintiff johnny swanson,iii joined the race for united states senator in alabama as the candidate of his newly formed party,the independent democrats of alabama.in the early spring of,plaintiff frank cobb began his campaign as an independent candidate for alabama house representative district,and plaintiff joseph grimsley began his campaign as an independent candidate for sheriff of barbour county.
under alabama law,if a political party has not garnered more than twenty percent of the votes cast at the preceding general election,that political party must petition the alabama secretary of state or county probate office for placement on the ballot.see current version at a.prior to,alabama required that independent and minor party candidates must provide the signatures of one percent of voters with their petitions.in,alabama adopted a requirement that petitions include the signatures of at least three percent of the qualified electors who cast ballots for the office of governor in the last general election for the state,county,city,district,or other political subdivision in which the political party seeks to qualify candidates for office a emphasis added.
under this signature requirement,plaintiff swanson needed to gather valid signatures in order to appear on the general election ballot in his statewide race in.plaintiffs cobb and grimsley needed to gather several hundred valid signatures to appear on the ballot for their local races.
prior to,independent candidates had to submit the required number of valid signatures six days after the second primary election,which was july in the election cycle.on december,the alabama governor signed act.the act,which,inter alia,moved the deadline for independent candidate registration to the date of the first primary election.see act of.laws the first primary election date in the election cycle was june.
on march,the act was submitted to the department of justice for preclearance.on may,the department of justice precleared the act,and the alabama secretary of state issued a press release to the general public about the registration deadline change to june,exactly one week after the act went into effect 
although plaintiff swanson first learned about the act shortly after it was submitted for preclearance in march,the secretary of state office did not inform him of the new june deadline until a week before the deadline.plaintiff grimsley learned about the new deadline as he was collecting signatures on the first primary election date on june,and plaintiff cobb learned about the deadline several days after june.
on july,the old filing deadline before the act went into effect,cobb and grimsley attempted to file their registration petitions with the required number of verified signatures.by july,swanson had submitted just under signatures to be verified by the secretary of state office,well short of the signature threshold even if all signatures were verified.swanson actually would have been short even if the signature threshold had been in effect.
preliminary injunction suit and hearing 
on june,swanson filed an initial complaint under.on august,swanson,joined by cobb and grimsley,filed an amended complaint against the alabama governor,alabama attorney general,alabama secretary of state,and probate judges of barbour county and calhoun county the amended complaint alleged that alabama ballot access laws violated the qualifications clause the interstate commerce clause and the first,tenth,fourteenth,and seventeenth amendments.the amended complaint sought three forms of relief injunctive relief to place plaintiffs swanson,cobb,and grimsley on the general election ballot injunctive relief to stop the implementation of the act and a declaratory judgment that the signature requirement and the act are unconstitutional.
in august,the district court held a preliminary injunction hearing.plaintiffs swanson,cobb,and grimsley testified about obstacles they faced in collecting valid signatures.cobb and grimsley stated that they had collected a sufficient number of signatures by the first primary election date of june,but they did not submit their petitions until july because of the late notice of the deadline change.swanson admitted that he fell short of the signature threshold,but said that he lost volunteers willing to gather signatures after he learned about the deadline change to june.
mark bodenhausen of the libertarian party and bob belcher of the reform party testified that primary polling places are critical venues for gathering signatures and asserted that the new filing first primary election undermine ballot access efforts.bodenhausen stated that the libertarian party gained general ballot access in the election cycle based on solid election results from the race,which followed a campaign begun seventeen months before the election 
richard winger,the editor of an election law newsletter,testified that polling places are the best locations to gather signatures and that the deadline change would have a very significant effect on independent candidates attempting to qualify for ballot access.winger also testified that alabama was the second toughest state for independent and minor party candidates to gain ballot access in.david gillespie,a political science professor at presbyterian college,testified that alabama ballot access laws were more restrictive than many states and would not contribute to voter education.
despite the short notice of the new june,filing deadline,independent candidates jimmy blake and tracy larkin testified that they met the signature requirement and qualified for ballot access in their local races in the election both candidates admitted that they would have had more difficulty qualifying for ballot access if they were not already.
after the hearing,the district court granted a preliminary injunction in part and denied it in part on august.swanson bennett swanson i,d.the district court found that alabama signature requirement was less than the signature requirements in other states that had been upheld in two united states supreme court cases as not excessive and constitutional.id.at citing storer brown,d jenness fortson,d.the district court also noted that this court previously had upheld florida signature requirement.id.at citing libertarian party of florida florida,cir.the district court further determined that the alabama statute had sufficient alleviating factors to ease the burden of gathering signatures.id.at.accordingly,in denying swanson request for a preliminary injunction,the district court determined that plaintiff swanson did not have a substantial likelihood of success in his challenge to alabama signature requirement.id.
as to plaintiffs cobb and grimsley,the district court noted that they had met the signature requirement and determined that they had a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claims that they were deprived of fair notice of the change in the filing deadline.id.at.the district court found that cobb and grimsley expected to have until july to meet the registration deadline and were given no notice of the new date of june.id.at.furthermore,the district court found that the state has failed to articulate an adequate reason for applying the new deadline to the current election cycle instead of delaying its applicability or granting candidates such as cobb and grimsley a grace period for compliance.id.accordingly,the district court concluded that cobb and grimsley satisfied the requirements for a preliminary injunction and ordered defendants to place cobb and grimsley names on the general election ballot.id.at.the district court emphasized that the problem with the deadline change statute was not its content,but the manner in which it was promulgated without sufficient notice to those affected by its terms.id.
for summary judgment 
following the election,the district court addressed the parties for summary judgment.in support of these,plaintiffs brief noted that defendants did not dispute any of the factual allegations in this case,and defendants brief also observed that there were no genuine issues of material fact.
on august,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants in part.swanson bennett swanson ii,d.the district court first noted that t he facts in this case are not in dispute and summarize d the relevant facts.id.at.the district court then addressed the fair notice claim.
after noting its preliminary injunction order and that the election cycle had passed,the district court stated that its conclusion at the summary judgment stage was now different from the preliminary injunction stage as to the fair notice claim.id.at.the district court determined that the only way the same wrong could recur for grimsley,cobb,and swanson would be if alabama were to change the law regarding the registration deadline again and fail to give them notice of it again id.after finding that this scenario was unlikely to occur,the district court issued a order as to why the fair notice claim should not be dismissed as moot.id.at.
the district court next considered the signature requirement.the district court noted that,in its preliminary injunction order,it had already found that the state did have an important interest in requiring independent candidates to show they had a significant modicum of support before printing their names on the ballot.id.at quoting swanson i,d at.the district court concluded that the signature requirement is reasonable based on jenness and libertarian party,especially given the alleviating factors present in the alabama statute containing the signature requirement.id.
the district court also cited this court decision in cartwright barnes,cir,where this court upheld georgia signature requirement.id.the district court then found that alabama ballot access laws had sufficient alleviating factors and reiterated its earlier ruling that the signature requirement does not unreasonably restrict or place suffocating restrictions on a candidate ability to gather signatures.id.at.
in upholding alabama signature requirement,the district court acknowledged that plaintiff swanson offered the affidavit of richard winger,which stated that few other states imposed the restrictions that alabama does.id.the district court found this fact irrelevant because a court is no more free to impose the legislative judgment of other states on a sister state than it is free to substitute its own judgment for that of the state legislature.id.quoting swanson i,d at quoting libertarian party,at.the district court also repeated its earlier finding that the state had an important interest in requiring independent candidates to show they had a significant modicum of support before printing their names on the ballot.id.at citation omitted.after concluding that alabama signature requirement was constitutional,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on this claim.id.at.
subsequently,on may,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs additional claim that the filing deadline on the primary election date impermissibly burdened signature gathering.swanson worley swanson iii,d.the district court dismissed the fair notice claim as moot and noted its earlier finding that the signature requirement was constitutional.id.at.
after resolving those two claims,the district court considered whether the filing day of the first primary and unconstitutionally denied plaintiffs the opportunity to collect signatures at primary polling places,which plaintiffs asserted was the most viable source of successful petition drives id.at.the district court agreed with plaintiffs that the deadline on the primary election day deprived plaintiffs of a meaningful opportunity to gather signatures on the primary election day itself.id.at.the district court acknowledged that plaintiffs had given these reasons why having the primary election day to collect signatures for the signature requirement was so important 
the mindset of electors is on election issues,petitioners are assured that the elector is a registered voter,the electors district and polling places are readily apparent,electors are not suspicious of the petitioners need for personal information,it is the only public place where petitioners activities are welcomed,and it is the least costly means of obtaining signatures.
id.at.therefore,in evaluating the constitutionality of the filing deadline,the district court was advised of and noted the interrelationship between the deadline change and the signature requirement and how changing the deadline to the primary election day caused plaintiffs to lose the least costly and most effective way for plaintiffs to collect signatures to meet the signature requirement.
nonetheless,the district court concluded that the deadline change to the primary election date for meeting the signature requirement was not unconstitutional because other factors present in the alabama election scheme alleviate this perceived loss.id.quotation marks,internal citation,and alteration omitted.in evaluating the deadline change,the district court recited those other factors,including 
alabama does not restrict voters from signing petitions based on their party affiliation 
alabama does not restrict voters who have already voted in the primary from signing the petition 
i ndependent candidates can seek signatures from voters who have already signed other petitions 
there are no restrictions on how many signatures may come from a specific geographical area 
alabama does not restrict how many signatures can be submitted in an effort to meet the requirement and 
alabama allows unlimited time to conduct the petitioning effort.
id.quotation marks and citation omitted.the district court then applied the balancing test and factors identified in swanson i and concluded that changing the deadline for independent candidates to collect signatures from six days after the second primary election to the day of the first primary election is reasonable and does not put an unreasonable burden on independent candidates.id.quotation marks,citation,and alteration omitted.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied in part on jenness and characterized jenness as holding that the deadline on the primary election for independent candidates to meet the signature requirement is not unreasonably early.id.quoting jenness,at.at.
plaintiffs timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
in their brief on appeal,plaintiffs raise these two issues 
is alabama statute requiring independent and minor party candidates to obtain signatures of three percent of the electors who cast votes for governor in the last election unconstitutional because it substantially burdens the first and fourteenth amendment rights of voters and candidates but fails to serve any legitimate state interest 
ii.does the alabama statute changing the filing deadline for the signature petitions of independent and minor party candidates to the day of the primary election,combined with a three percent signature threshold,abridge the first and fourteenth amendment rights of candidates and voters by denying them the only meaningful opportunity to collect signatures and meet the threshold 
before addressing the merits of plaintiffs two claims,we outline the applicable balancing test for constitutional challenges to ballot access restrictions 
a.the supreme court balancing test 
the supreme court long has recognized candidates constitutional rights under the first and fourteenth amendments to associate for political ends and to participate equally in the electoral process.see burdick takushi,d anderson celebrezze,d.ballot access restrictions also implicate the constitutional rights of voters,especially those with preferences outside the existing parties,to associate and cast their votes effectively.see williams rhodes,d.however,the supreme court also long has recognized that states have important and compelling interests in regulating the election process and in having ballot access requirements.green mortham,cir collecting cases.in particular,the supreme court has emphasized that a state has an important state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization candidate on the interest,if no other,in avoiding confusion,deception,and even frustration of the democratic process at the general election.jenness,at.at.
in order to balance these interests,a court must first consider the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the first and fourteenth amendments that the candidate seeks to vindicate.anderson,at.at.it then must identify and evaluate the precise interests put forward by the state as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.id.in making this evaluation,a court must determine the legitimacy and strength of the state interests and consider the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the candidate rights.id.a court then must weigh all these factors to determine if the statute is constitutional.id.
furthermore,if the state election scheme imposes severe burdens on the plaintiffs constitutional rights,it may survive only if it is narrowly tailored and advance s a compelling state interest.timmons twin cities area new party,d.but when a state ballot access law provision imposes only reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions upon the plaintiffs first and fourteenth amendment rights,a state important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions.id.quoting burdick,at.at.lesser burdens trigger less exacting review id.
under this framework,we first review the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to plaintiffs constitutional rights,considering the burden posed by the signature requirement and the june filing deadline independently and in combination.
signature requirement 
plaintiffs assert that alabama signature requirement violates the first and fourteenth amendments based on our precedent,we conclude that alabama signature requirement by itself does not impose a severe burden on plaintiffs rights but is a reasonable,nondiscriminatory restriction.
this court previously upheld a signature requirement in a challenge under the first and fourteenth amendments in libertarian party of florida florida.in libertarian party,we considered the constitutionality of a florida statute requiring the signatures of three percent of all registered voters in order for a minor party candidate to appear on the general election ballot.see,at.based on jenness,we observed that the state had compelling state interests in regulating the state election process in requiring a significant modicum of support before placing a candidate on a ballot and in avoiding confusion,deception,and frustration of the democratic process.id.at citing jenness,at.at.we rejected strict scrutiny analysis and stated that the test was whether the signature requirement was a rational way to meet this compelling state interest.id.at.we added that the test is one of reasonableness,whether the statute unreasonably encroaches on ballot access.id.at citing anderson,at.at.in light of the compelling state interest and several factors that eased the burden of gathering signatures,this court concluded in libertarian party that florida signature requirement was valid.id.at.
alabama signature requirement is less burdensome than florida signature requirement in libertarian party.while florida required signatures of three percent of all registered voters,alabama requires only the signatures of three percent of qualified electors who voted in the last gubernatorial election,a significantly smaller pool than all registered voters.
moreover,the supreme court has upheld even more restrictive signature requirements than alabama requirement.see am.party of white,d upholding texas signature thresholds of three and five percent for local independent candidates storer,at.at concluding that california signature requirement was not per se unconstitutional jenness,at.at upholding georgia requirement cartwright,at reaffirming jenness in upholding georgia signature requirement.based on this long line of precedent,we must conclude that alabama signature requirement is a reasonable,nondiscriminatory restriction that imposes a minimal burden on plaintiffs rights.
as the district court noted,alabama statute also has the same alleviating factors that eased the burden of gathering signatures in libertarian party.see swanson ii,d at swanson i,d at.specifically,the district court found that alabama statute 
does not restrict voters from signing petitions based on their party affiliation,nor does it restrict voters who have already voted in a primary from signing the petition.independent candidates can seek signatures from voters who have already signed other petitions,and there are no restrictions on how many signatures may come from a specific geographical area.alabama does not restrict how many signatures can be submitted in an effort to meet the requirement,and the state allows unlimited time to conduct the petitioning effort.
swanson i,d at emphasis added.therefore,while there is a deadline for collecting signatures,there is no required start date or limited time period for collecting signatures.these alleviating factors resonate just as strongly in this case as they did in libertarian party,if not more so,and ameliorate any burden on plaintiffs constitutional rights 
the ability of minor party candidates in alabama to qualify for the ballot in the past also bolsters the reasonableness of alabama signature requirement.specifically,many libertarian party candidates met alabama signature requirement and qualified for ballot access in both statewide and local offices in the election.based on strong election results in the election,the libertarian party gained general ballot access for the election,entitling it to nominate a slate of both statewide and local candidates in the election in alabama.the libertarian party successes in the and election cycles in alabama demonstrate that the signature requirement does not hinder diligent independent and minor party candidates,and alabama election law thus provides a realistic means of access.libertarian party,at noting that a signature requirement was not unreasonably burdensome when one minor party qualified its slate of candidates in two election cycles.
for all of these reasons,alabama signature requirement is a reasonable,nondiscriminatory regulation that does not impose a severe burden 
filing deadline combined with signature requirement 
even if a signature requirement alone passes constitutional muster,plaintiffs also contend that alabama filing deadline on the first primary election date,in combination with the signature requirement,violates the first and fourteenth amendments specifically,plaintiffs assert that primary polling sites are critical locations for gathering signatures to meet the signature requirement,that alabama june filing deadline effectively precludes gathering signatures at primary polling sites,and that the filing deadline in tandem with the signature requirement severely burdens plaintiffs constitutional rights to ballot access.based on our review of binding precedent and the undisputed facts in this case,we conclude that alabama june filing deadline,in combination with the signature requirement,does not place a severe burden on the constitutional rights of independent candidates.
we begin our analysis with jenness fortson,wherein the supreme court rejected a challenge to georgia signature requirement and june filing deadline acting in concert.jenness,at.at.despite having a similar june filing deadline,the election scheme upheld in jenness was significantly more restrictive than alabama.specifically,the georgia statute in jenness required the signatures of five percent of all registered voters,unlike the three percent of actual voters in alabama.id.at.at.moreover,candidates had only days to circulate signature petitions in jenness,unlike the unlimited time allowed in alabama.id.at.at.furthermore,in jenness,the june filing deadline for independent candidates to appear on the november general election ballot was the same deadline for a major party candidate qualifying to appear on an august party primary election ballot.id.at.at.the june deadline for independents thus precluded signature gathering not only on the primary election date but also two months before the primary election date in august.
in jenness,the supreme court noted that this june filing deadline was not unreasonably early,distinguishing it from the february deadline invalidated in williams rhodes,d.id.at.at.moreover,the supreme court concluded that the absence of suffocating restrictions on signature gathering minimized any burden posed by the deadline,and it upheld georgia signature requirement and june filing deadline.id.at.at.as noted repeatedly by the district court in upholding the june filing deadline,the alabama statute here also imposes none of the suffocating restrictions on the circulation of signature petitions outlined in jenness.see swanson iii,d at swanson ii,d at citing jenness,at.at swanson i,d at.
based on the reasoning in jenness,other circuits have upheld statutes with filing deadlines on the primary election day or even the day before in combination with signature requirements,despite the deadline effect on signature gathering.see,lawrence blackwell,cir,cert.denied,d upholding ohio filing deadline for independent candidates on the day before the primary election date,which is as early as march in presidential election years,with a signature requirement wood meadows,cir analyzing virginia june filing deadline on the primary election date in conjunction with its signature requirement of of registered voters and concluding that its election scheme taken as a whole is constitutional council of alternative political parties hooks,cir concluding that the combination of new jersey deadline on the primary election date and signature requirement of up to signatures imposed only a minimal burden rainbow coal.of.state election,cir holding that a may filing deadline is not unconstitutional even in conjunction with the relatively high signature requirement while we recognize that ohio,virginia,and new jersey chose a less restrictive signature requirement than alabama signature requirement,the signature requirement was upheld in jenness along with an even earlier deadline.accordingly,on this record,we have no basis to conclude that alabama statute falls outside the spectrum of constitutional legislative choices.
plaintiffs do not cite,much less address,jenness in their initial or reply briefs.instead,plaintiffs rely on the supreme court decision in anderson celebrezze and this court decision in new alliance party hand,cir.however,the statutes in those cases are materially different from alabama statute at issue here.
anderson is different in two material ways.first,anderson involved a presidential election where the supreme court noted that the state has a less important interest in regulating presidential elections than statewide or local elections anderson,at.at.in contrast,the alabama statute,challenged by plaintiffs,addresses only statewide and local elections,and a separate alabama statute not at issue on appeal governs independent presidential candidates.see a current version at a.
second,the ohio statute in anderson placed independent candidates at a relative disadvantage to major party candidates.specifically,the ohio statute invalidated in anderson required major party candidates to declare their candidacies by late march in order to be on the primary election ballot,which was days later in.independent presidential candidates had to file a nominating petition with signatures by the same date in late march in order to appear on the general election ballot,which was over seven months later in november.anderson,at.at.in requiring independent candidates to file signature petitions by late march,the ohio statute thus placed independent candidates at a relative disadvantage to major party candidates because major party candidates alone had the flexibility to respond to intervening events between the march filing deadline and the national nominating conventions five months later,and the early deadline burdened signature gathering when the general election was far in the future.id.at.at.this discrimination against independent candidates constituted a severe burden because a burden that falls unequally on new or small political parties or on independent candidates impinges,by its very nature,on associational choices protected by the first amendment.id.at.at emphasis added.
in anderson,although major party candidates had to declare their candidacies on the same date as the filing deadline for independent candidates,the supreme court noted that the burdens and the benefits of the respective requirements are materially different id.at.at.specifically,although major party candidates had to declare their candidacies in late march before the party primary to allow reasonable time to prepare the primary election ballots,there was no similar administrative justification for requiring independent candidates to register in late march before the major party primary in june.id.at.at.additionally,while the major party candidates would benefit from the added publicity and organizational support tied to the party primary elections,independent candidates would gain no corresponding benefit from the lead up to the primary elections.id.at.at.accordingly,as demonstrated in anderson,courts subject filing deadlines that are well prior to the primary election to more exacting scrutiny.see id.at.at wood,at noting that courts subject to searching scrutiny election schemes requiring both independent and major party candidates to declare their candidacies on the same date prior to the major party primary election date.
in contrast,alabama statute does not discriminate against independent candidates relative to major party candidates when the filing deadline for independent candidates is set on alabama primary election date,which is sixty days after major party candidates must declare their candidacies although major party candidates enjoy the benefits of the publicity and automatic support of an experienced party organization,major party candidates in alabama have the additional burden of filing earlier,thus placing independent and major party candidates in comparable positions.see lawrence,at wood,at.although the constitution bars states from discriminating against independent and minor party candidates,it does not mandate that states give independent and minor party candidates preferential treatment over major party candidates.timmons,at.at concluding that states have no obligation to remove all hurdles facing independent and minor party candidates and that an election scheme may,in practice,favor the traditional system munro socialist workers party,d states are not burdened with a constitutional imperative to reduce voter apathy or to handicap an unpopular candidate to increase the likelihood that the candidate will gain access to the general election ballot.by extending the filing deadline for independent and minor party candidates to the primary election date,sixty days after major party candidates must declare their candidacies,alabama imposes no discriminatory burden on independent and minor party candidates.
similarly,new alliance party hand is distinguishable because the old alabama statute invalidated in that case was like the ohio statute in anderson and placed independent and minor party candidates at a relative disadvantage to major party candidates.in new alliance party,this court addressed alabama old election statute,which required local and statewide independent candidates to file their signature petitions in april,sixty days before the primary election.see new alliance party,at citing.this court concluded that the early deadline make s it moderately difficult for a minor party candidate to qualify to be on the ballot id.at.this court struck down the election scheme under a strict scrutiny framework,noting that the state failed to adopt the least drastic means to achieve its ends.id.at internal quotation marks,citation,and alteration omitted.
in new alliance party,the april filing deadline placed unequal burdens on independent and minor party candidates again similar to the filing deadline days before the primary election invalidated in anderson.just as in anderson,alabama old scheme required independent and minor party candidates to file their petitions on the same day that major party candidates simply declared their candidacies without any of the administrative justifications or corresponding benefits of the major party primary elections.see id.at see also anderson,at.at.
in contrast,as discussed above,alabama new june filing deadline on the primary election date does not place independent and minor party candidates at a relative disadvantage to major party candidates.indeed,major party candidates have the additional burden of declaring their candidacies sixty days before independent and minor party candidates must file their signature petitions in june,and independent and major party candidates thus are in roughly comparable positions.accordingly,unlike the april filing deadline invalidated in new alliance party,alabama new filing deadline is a nondiscriminatory restriction,and the strict scrutiny analysis applied in new alliance party is not appropriate for alabama filing deadline on the primary election date for independent and minor party candidates.
more importantly in this case,the burden posed by alabama filing deadline is significantly lessened by the statute alleviating factors.in particular,alabama sets no limit on the time period for conducting the petitioning effort,a far more permissive scheme than filing deadlines that have been upheld in the past see,am.party of,at.at upholding a statute requiring minor party candidates to gather roughly signatures a day within a petitioning period jenness,at.at,upholding a signature requirement with a petitioning period libertarian party,at upholding a signature requirement with a petitioning period.given the unlimited petitioning window,a diligent independent or minor party candidate could meet the filing deadline by collecting signatures many months before the june primary deadline.
plaintiffs attempt to sidestep the clear precedent in jenness by pointing to evidence that few independent and minor party candidates have been able to obtain access to alabama ballot since both the signature requirement and june filing deadline have been in place.since the signature filing deadline was moved to the primary election date in the election cycle,two independent candidates obtained ballot access in despite the short notice of the deadline change,two independent candidates obtained ballot access in,and six independent and minor party candidates obtained ballot access in.
although plaintiffs note that these candidates were running for only local races and that no independent or minor party candidate has obtained ballot access in a statewide race since,there is no evidence in this particular record that an independent or minor party candidate has even sought ballot access in a statewide race since plaintiff swanson in.moreover,there is no evidence in the record in this case that any independent or minor party candidate sought and failed to gain ballot access in any alabama races since plaintiffs in.all we say here is that the evidence in this particular record does not establish any severe burden on rights instead,the successes of several independent and minor party candidates demonstrate that alabama election scheme does not completely insulate the system from minor parties or independent candidates competition and influence timmons,at.at see also cartwright,at upholding georgia signature requirement even though no libertarian party candidate had ever satisfied it libertarian party,at concluding that florida law does not freeze the status quo but provides a realistic means of access based on one minor party success in qualifying a slate of candidates in two election cycles.
plaintiffs also point to winger testimony that alabama had the second toughest ballot access restrictions among all states in the election.this court in libertarian party instructed that the legislative choices of other states are irrelevant,however,because a court is no more free to impose the legislative judgments of other states on a sister state than it is free to substitute its own judgment for that of the state legislature.libertarian party,at.furthermore,the supreme court has upheld a broad array of election schemes,and we confine our inquiry to whether alabama election scheme is constitutional,not whether alabama scheme is the best relative to other states.see green,at there is a range of fees and signature requirements that are constitutional,and a state legislature is free to choose its ballot access requirements from that constitutional spectrum.
further,plaintiffs point to no case in which a court has invalidated a filing deadline on the primary election day combined with a signature requirement similar to alabama laws.because alabama does not discriminate against independent and minor party candidates,and because there are significant alleviating factors in alabama statute,such as the unlimited time to gather signatures,we conclude that alabama filing deadline on the primary election date,in tandem with the signature requirement,is a reasonable,nondiscriminatory regulation.
state interests 
because alabama filing deadline on the june primary election date in combination with its signature requirement imposes reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions on plaintiffs rights,less exacting review of alabama election regulations is proper.timmons,at.at.under this review,we conclude that important state interests provide sufficient justification for these reasonable,nondiscriminatory regulations.see id.specifically,defendants identify various state interests supporting the regulations,such as avoiding voter confusion and promoting political stability 
the district court found that alabama had an important interest in requiring independent candidates to show they had a significant modicum of support before printing their names on the ballot.swanson ii,d at quotation marks and citation omitted.by requiring candidates to demonstrate a modicum of support,alabama discourages frivolous candidacies and thereby serves its important interests in avoiding confusion,deception,and even frustration of the democratic process at the general election.jenness,at.at.this court previously has recognized that signature requirements promote the important state interest of ensuring that only bona fide independent candidates with a measure of support gain ballot access,preventing frivolous candidates from clogging the ballot and confusing voters.see cartwright,at libertarian party,at see also fulani krivanek,cir noting that a signature requirement promotes the interest in demonstrating a modicum of support.accordingly,alabama election scheme as a whole promotes the state important interest in limiting ballot access to candidates with a modicum of support,thus avoiding voter confusion.
moreover,reasonable ballot access regulations promote important state interests in preserving political stability by temper ing the destabilizing effects of and excessive factionalism.timmons,at.at see also storer,at.at recognizing a state interest in discouraging independent candidacies prompted by political goals,pique,or personal quarrel.although this interest i
