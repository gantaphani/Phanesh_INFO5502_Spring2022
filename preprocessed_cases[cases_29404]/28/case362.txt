plaintiffs appeal the district court grant of summary judgment dismissing their claim that washington state felon disenfranchisement scheme constitutes improper vote denial in violation of section of the voting rights act section.upon conviction of an infamous crime in the state of washington,each plaintiff was disenfranchised,and none has had his voting rights restored.
the district court determined that although washington felon disenfranchisement scheme disenfranchises a disproportionate number of,and minorities,the cause of this disparate impact on their right to vote was external to the felon disenfranchisement provision itself and therefore could not provide the requisite causal link between the voting qualification and the prohibited discriminatory result.
notably,the district court attributed the cause of this discriminatory effect on minority voting power to discriminatory activity in washington criminal justice system.although it determined that plaintiffs evidence of discrimination in the criminal justice system,and the resulting disproportionate impact on minority voting power,is compelling,the district court held that evidence of discrimination in the criminal justice system was not significant for purposes of the totality of the circumstances analysis used in determining whether a challenged voting practice results in a denial of minority voting rights under section.instead,focusing on the disenfranchisement scheme itself,the court concluded that there was no evidence that the enactment of washington disenfranchisement provision was motivated by racial animus,or that its operation by itself has a discriminatory effect,and therefore determined that plaintiffs had failed to establish a section violation.
we disagree with the district court analysis,because it conflicts with our understanding of section.as recognized by both the supreme court and our circuit,a section totality of the circumstances inquiry requires courts to consider how a challenged voting practice interacts with external factors such as social and historical conditions to result in denial of the right to vote on account of race or color.thornburg gingles,d see also smith salt river project agric.improvement power,cir.because a section analysis clearly requires that we consider factors external to the challenged voting mechanism itself,we hold that evidence of discrimination within the criminal justice system can be relevant to a section analysis.in light of the district court having improperly disregarded this evidence,combined with its assessment that plaintiffs evidence of discrimination in washington criminal justice system was compelling,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
felon disenfranchisement is a voting restriction that denies citizens who are convicted of felonies the right to vote.article vi,section of the washington state constitution provides that a ll persons convicted of an infamous crime are excluded from the elective franchise.disenfranchised felons in washington remain ineligible to vote until they have completed all the requirements of their sentences and have obtained certificates of discharge under section of the revised code of washington rcw.a discharge under section has the effect of restoring all civil rights lost by operation of law upon conviction.rcw.
plaintiffs muhammad shabazz farrakhan,marcus price,ramon barrientes,tim schaaf,clifton briceno,and are citizens who were convicted of felonies in washington state and consequently disenfranchised under article vi,section of the washington state constitution.none of the plaintiffs has had his civil rights restored under rcw.
when plaintiffs initially filed their complaint,they challenged washington disenfranchisement scheme on federal constitutional grounds and as violative of the voting rights act vra they sought both declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin from applying the voting restriction and related statutory provisions against all felons.in allowing plaintiffs to proceed on their vote denial claim under section,the district court rejected the state argument that the vra could not apply to felon disenfranchisement laws.farrakhan locke.however,the court dismissed plaintiffs constitutional and vote dilution claims and denied plaintiff farrakhan request for leave to file a due process challenge to washington statutory scheme governing the restoration of felons civil rights.id.at.
in their fourth amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged that article vi,section of the washington constitution,along with the process set forth for restoration of disenfranchised felons civil rights,result in the denial of their right to vote on account of race in violation of section.this was the operative complaint upon which the parties relied when they filed for summary judgment.
in support of its motion,the state filed a statement of material facts as required by rule a of the local rules for the eastern district of washington.in this statement,the state set forth facts that it contended were not disputed regarding plaintiffs criminal histories and the fact that none had completed all the requirements of his sentence,the background and history of washington felon disenfranchisement law and statistics regarding citizens who had been affected by it,the statutory procedure for restoration of civil rights and reinstatement of the right to vote,the history of washington population,the racial and ethnic of washington population,the composition of washington felony population,the background and work of the washington state minority and justice commission,wsmjc and the history of and changes to washington voting laws and practices.with the exception of three issues relating to the operation of washington disenfranchisement scheme and its history of discrimination against native americans,plaintiffs did not dispute the state statement of material facts.
to substantiate their vote denial claim,however,plaintiffs presented statistical evidence of the disparities in arrest,bail and release rates,charging decisions,and sentencing outcomes in certain aspects of washington criminal justice system they also submitted expert declarations and relied on the same reports and studies that the state had submitted to show the extent to which these disparities could be attributed to racial bias and discrimination in addition to this evidence regarding racial bias in washington criminal justice system,plaintiffs offered evidence of the tenuous policy justifications for washington felon disenfranchisement law,and presented evidence of the discriminatory intent that guided the enactment of these laws in several states,discussing the similarities between other states statutes and the one enacted in washington.
as noted,the district court ultimately granted the state motion for summary judgment.despite the fact that there was little dispute over the state separate statement of material facts the district court nonetheless characterized plaintiffs evidence of discrimination in washington criminal justice system and the resulting disproportionate impact on minority voting power as compelling.however,the district court ultimately concluded that such evidence was insignificant to its inquiry regarding a possible causal connection between the disenfranchisement provision and the disproportionate impact on the number of minorities ineligible to vote as we explain,the district court analysis and conclusion misunderstand section totality of the circumstances test,which requires the court to consider the way in which the disenfranchisement law interacts with racial bias in washington criminal justice system to deny minorities an equal opportunity to participate in the state political process.
discussion 
congress enacted the vra for the broad remedial purpose of rid ding the country of racial discrimination in voting.south carolina katzenbach,d.initially responding to the increasing sophistication with which the states were denying racial minorities the right to vote,farrakhan.at,congress amended section of the vra in to relieve plaintiffs of the burden of proving discriminatory intent chisom roemer,d ruiz city of santa maria,cir noting congress statement that the intent test was unnecessarily divisive in that it involved charges of racism on the part of individual officials or entire communities and placed an inordinately difficult burden of proof on plaintiffs and asked the wrong question.internal alteration and quotation marks omitted.as amended,section provides 
a no voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,practice,or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any state or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the united states to vote on account of race or color,or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section f of this title,as provided in subsection b of this section.
b a violation of subsection a of this section is established if,based on the totality of the circumstances,it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the state or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection a of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.the extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the state or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered provided,that nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.
thus,a plaintiff may establish a section violation by showing that,based on of the totality of the circumstances,the challenged voting practice results in discrimination on account of race 
the senate report accompanying the amendments identified typical factors that may be relevant in analyzing whether section has been violated 
the extent of any history of official discrimination in the state or political subdivision that touched the right of the members of the minority group to register,to vote,or otherwise to participate in the democratic process 
the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized 
the extent to which the state or political subdivision has used unusually large election districts,majority vote requirements,shot provisions,or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group 
if there is a candidate slating process,whether the members of the minority group have been denied access to that process 
the extent to which members of the minority group in the state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education,employment and health,which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process 
whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals 
the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction 
whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group 
whether the policy underlying the state or political subdivision use of such voting qualification,prerequisite to voting,or standard,practice or procedure is tenuous.
see,at,reprinted in,senate report.congress did not intend this list to be comprehensive or exclusive,nor did it intend that any particular number of factors be proved,or that a majority of them point one way or the other.id.at.rather,as explained by the supreme court,in examining the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a challenged voting practice results in vote denial or vote dilution on account of race,courts must consider how the challenged practice interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.gingles,at.
as a preliminary matter,we agree with the district court that plaintiffs claim of vote denial is cognizable under section of the vra.felon disenfranchisement is a voting qualification,and section is clear that any voting qualification that denies citizens the right to vote in a discriminatory manner violates the vra.indeed,the supreme court has made clear that states can not use felon disenfranchisement as a tool to discriminate on the basis of race,see hunter underwood,d holding that where racial bias motivated its original enactment,a facially neutral felon disenfranchisement law violated the equal protection clause,and congress specifically amended the vra to ensure that,in the context of all the circumstances in the jurisdiction in question,any disparate racial impact of facially neutral voting requirements did not result from racial discrimination,senate report at see also chisom roemer,at.
permitting a citizen,even a convicted felon,to challenge felon disenfranchisement laws that result in either the denial of the right to vote or vote dilution on account of race animates the right that every citizen has of protection against racially discriminatory voting practices.although states may deprive felons of the right to vote without violating the fourteenth amendment,richardson ramirez,d,when felon disenfranchisement results in denial of the right to vote or vote dilution on account of race or color,section affords disenfranchised felons the means to seek redress 
next,we consider whether the district court erred in failing to consider evidence of racial bias in washington criminal justice system in determining whether washington felon disenfranchisement laws result in denial of the right to vote on account of race.we hold that it did,as the district court misconstrued the causation requirement of a section analysis.
relying extensively on our decision in salt river,at,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that washington felon disenfranchisement provision was either motivated by racial animus,or that its operation by itself has a discriminatory effect.although it determined that the disenfranchisement statute resulted in the underrepresentation of minorities in washington political process,the district court found that plaintiffs had failed to satisfy their causal burden because the cause of the underrepresentation is not the voting qualification instead,the cause is bias external to the voting qualification,discrimination in the criminal justice system in so ruling,the district court applied a causal standard at odds with the salt river decision which compelled its understanding of the section analysis,the plain language of the vra,its legislative history,and other judicial precedent.
section plainly provides that a voting practice or procedure violates the vra when a plaintiff is able to show,based on the totality of the circumstances,that the challenged voting practice results in discrimination on account of race.the supreme court has interpreted t he essence of a section claim to be that a certain electoral law,practice,or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.gingles,at.emphasis added.thus,it is clear that whether a particular practice results in vote denial or vote dilution in violation of section always depends on the totality of the circumstances in which the practice operates.
in fact,in salt river,we applied the totality of the circumstances test to determine whether an agricultural improvement and power district land ownership voting qualification violated section.at.the plaintiffs were,residents of the district who claimed that the land ownership requirement was a racially discriminatory voting qualification because a disproportionate percentage of landowners in the district were white.id.at.
in assessing their claim,we considered both the interaction of the challenged landownership requirement with the surrounding social and historical circumstances in the district and expert testimony regarding the relationship,or lack thereof,between race and home ownership in the district.id.at.deferring to the district court factual findings,we focused on its conclusion that the observed difference in rates of home ownership between whites and is not substantially explained by race but is better explained by other factors independent of race which adequately rebutted any inference of racial bias that the disparate impact statistics might suggest.id.at emphasis added internal citations omitted.because the land ownership rates did not reflect racial discrimination,we concluded that the land ownership requirement did not violate section.id.at.
in so concluding,the salt river court did not focus solely on the land ownership requirement and exclude external factors that helped determine the qualification disparate racial impact.instead,we considered the external factors,but ultimately concluded that the statistics evidencing the disproportionate percentage of white landownership did not reflect racial discrimination and so failed to satisfy the on account of race requirement of the results test.as we noted,this conclusion was dictated by the salt river plaintiffs admission that there was no evidence of discrimination as measured by the senate report factors,id.at,and their stipulation to the nonexistence of virtually every circumstance which might indicate that voting results in racial discrimination,id.at,leaving only a bare statistical showing of disparate impact to support their section claim.
in light of these constraints,the salt river court statement regarding the need for evidence of a causal connection between the challenged voting practice and a prohibited discriminatory result,id.internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original,simply does not stand for the proposition that the practice must,by itself,cause the discriminatory result.indeed,if it did,there would have been no need for the court to consider whether land ownership rates reflected racial discrimination or to assess other totality of the circumstances factors.
further,demanding by itself causation would defeat the interactive and contextual totality of the circumstances analysis repeatedly applied by our sister circuits in section cases,as they also require a broad,review of the evidence to determine whether a challenged voting practice interacts with surrounding racial discrimination in a meaningful way or whether the practice disparate impact is better explained by other factors independent of race.salt river,at internal quotation marks omitted see,ortiz city of philadelphia office of the city comm rs,cir acknowledging that section violations occur when challenged voting practices interact with social and historical conditions to deny minorities equal access to the political process,but ultimately upholding pennsylvania voter purge law because there was no evidence that discrimination or societal disadvantages had contributed to low minority voter turnout salas.junior coll,cir noting that practical impediments to voting are relevant in assessing a section challenge but finding no credible evidence that the effects of prior unemployment,illiteracy,and low contributed to the low voter turnout that caused hispanics lack of electoral success,the court held that the real cause of this lack of success was not the challenged voting practice irby virginia state bd.of elections,cir upholding an appointive rather than an elective scheme for selecting county school boards because in the few counties in which blacks were significantly underrepresented the disparity was due to the fact that fewer blacks sought appointment,and the composition of the officials responsible for making appointments either manifested no discrimination or should have been addressed through a challenge to the selection procedures for those officials united states marengo county comm n,cir finding that the evidence demonstrated that blacks lack of success at the polls was not due to apathy but rather due to social and historical factors including a history of pervasive racial discrimination,and holding that an election system therefore resulted in a section violation.
moreover,the district court by itself causation standard would effectively read an intent requirement back into the vra,in direct contradiction of the clear command of the amendments to section.a facially neutral voting qualification,even one that results in substantial discriminatory effects,would only be discriminatory by itself if its purpose was to achieve those discriminatory effects.instead,courts must be able to consider whether voting practices accommodate or amplify the effect that discrimination has on the voting process,salt river,at internal quotation marks omitted absent proof that the challenged practice was adopted or maintained out of overt,intentional racial animus,its disproportionate effect on minority voters could only ever be on account of race through its interaction with racial discrimination outside of the challenged voting mechanism.
in sum,although salt river made clear that a bare statistical showing of disproportionate impact on a racial minority does not satisfy the section results inquiry because causation can not be inferred from impact alone,at,the legislative history of the vra along with the consistent judicial interpretation of section clarify that e ven a consistently applied practice premised on a racially neutral policy would not negate a plaintiff showing through other factors that the challenged practice denies minorities fair access to the process.senate report at.certainly,plaintiffs must prove that the challenged voter qualification denies or abridges their right to vote on account of race,but the amendments and subsequent case law make clear that factors outside the election system can contribute to a particular voting practice disparate impact when those factors involve race discrimination.therefore,under salt river and consistent with both congressional intent and judicial precedent,a causal connection may be shown where the discriminatory impact of a challenged voting practice is attributable to racial discrimination in the surrounding social and historical circumstances.in light of this determination,we turn to the question of whether evidence of racial discrimination in the criminal justice system qualifies as such evidence.
as noted above,the senate report accompanying the amendments identified typical factors that may be relevant in analyzing whether a particular voting practice violates section,but congress did not intend the listed factors to be exhaustive.the legislative history accompanying the amendments acknowledged that while these enumerated factors will often be the most relevant ones,in some cases other factors will be indicative of a section violation.senate report at.further,the supreme court has emphasized the importance of maintaining a practical perspective when evaluating the effects or lawfulness of a challenged voting practice,gingles,at,and courts have followed this directive in considering the lower status of american indians,see old person brown,cir,the disproportionate number of blacks living in poverty and inadequate housing,see johnson halifax county,a board of education opposition to school desegregation,see marengo,at,and the past and continuing unemployment,illiteracy,and low income that hispanic citizens face,see salas,at.
thus,simply because congress did not specifically identify racial bias in the criminal justice system as a relevant factor in identifying a section violation does not mean that it should be excluded from a totality of the circumstances analysis.in fact,this kind of evidence is encompassed within the scope of factor,directing courts to consider the extent to which members of the minority group in the state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education,employment,and health.senate report at.
this factor underscores congress intent to provide courts with a means of identifying voting practices that have the effect of shifting racial inequality from the surrounding social circumstances into
