plaintiffs,oregon voters who signed referendum,appeal the district court denial of permanent injunctive relief against oregon secretary of state bill bradbury secretary.the secretary determined that referendum,which sought a statewide vote on a legislative act establishing domestic partnerships,did not have enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot.plaintiffs contend that the secretary procedures for verifying referendum petition signatures violated their equal protection and due process rights.the district court held that no constitutional violations occurred.we affirm.
the citizens of oregon have reserved the power to refer legislative acts to the ballot for approval or rejection by the state voters.or.const.art.iv.a referendum qualifies for a statewide vote upon submission of a petition containing valid signatures of a number of qualified voters equal to four percent of the total number of votes cast for all candidates for governor in the most recent gubernatorial election.id.b.the deadline for submission of a referendum petition is ninety days after the end of the legislative session in which the legislation was passed.id.the secretary must complete the signature verification process within thirty days of the petition filing deadline.id.a.
the oregon constitution subjects the people referendum power to regulation by the legislature.see id.a b.statutes require the secretary to use a statistical sampling method for verifying referendum petition signatures,using an elector voter registration record or other database.the secretary samples approximately five percent of the submitted signatures for each referendum,and submits the sampled signatures to county elections officials.or.admin.a.the state initiative and referendum manual,adopted by the secretary through administrative rule,see or.admin,requires county elections officials to verify the original signatures sampled from referendum petitions using voter registration records.a publication entitled directive for signature verification,issued by the secretary on november,specifies that county elections officials should c ompare the signature on the petition and the signature on the voter registration card to identify whether the signature is genuine and must be counted.the secretary extrapolates the overall number of valid petition signatures using the sampled signature results.see or.admin.
under these procedures,county elections officials verify sampled referendum signatures by determining whether each petition signature matches the signature on the signer existing voter registration card.oregon law does not provide procedures by which a voter can introduce extrinsic evidence to rehabilitate a referendum signature after its rejection.see.in contrast,for ballot signatures returned during oregon elections,the secretary vote by mail procedures manual requires county elections officials to give the voter notice and an opportunity to submit an updated voter registration card.
in,the oregon legislature passed house bill hb,which establishes domestic partnerships.see or.laws,ch.plaintiffs are oregon voters who signed petitions for referendum,which sought a statewide vote on hb.on september,proponents of referendum submitted approximately unverified signatures to the secretary.the secretary randomly selected signatures from the petition through statistical sampling.
on october,the secretary distributed the sampled signatures to county elections officials.an accompanying memorandum instructed county officials to c heck the registration of the names indicated by comparing the signature on the petition to the signature on the registration card.one of the options for rejecting signatures was that the s ignatures do not match.the memorandum instructed the counties to complete their verification by october.
counties allowed petitioners and members of the public to observe the signature verification process.every county had a system for reviewing initially rejected signatures.the counties rejected of the sampled signatures of the rejected signatures,were invalid because they did not match signatures on existing voter registration cards.no county gave notice to voters with rejected signatures.the counties also refused to consider extrinsic evidence presented by voters with rejected signatures,such as affidavits and updated voter registration cards.
on october,after extrapolating the verification results,the secretary announced that there were valid signatures for referendum,fewer than the valid signatures required to qualify for the ballot.plaintiffs filed an action in federal district court against the secretary and several county officials,alleging violations of state and federal rights,including equal protection and due process.plaintiffs sought an opportunity to rehabilitate their signatures,and a declaration that referendum contained enough signatures to qualify for the ballot.on december,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction,staying the effective date of hb until a hearing on the merits.
after hearing oral argument on february,the district court vacated the preliminary injunction,denied permanent injunctive relief,and dismissed plaintiffs federal claims.first,the court held that the secretary signature verification procedures did not violate plaintiffs equal protection rights.the court concluded that signing a referendum petition does not implicate a fundamental right,and in any event the secretary procedures do not unconstitutionally infringe on plaintiffs alleged rights.the court also ruled that county elections officials use specific,uniform standards for signature verification.second,the district court held that the secretary did not violate plaintiffs due process rights by denying them notice and an opportunity to rehabilitate their rejected referendum signatures

the fourteenth amendment provides that no state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.const.amend.xiv.plaintiffs do not challenge the sampling concept,but contend that the secretary procedures for verifying sampled signatures violate their equal protection and due process rights.first,they argue that the method of verifying referendum signatures burdens their fundamental right to vote.second,plaintiffs contend that the secretary violated their equal protection and due process rights by not providing the same notice and opportunity to rehabilitate referendum signatures that is afforded to signers of election ballots.third,plaintiffs argue that county elections officials lack uniform statewide rules for verifying referendum signatures,violating the rule from bush gore,d.
we hold that the secretary procedures did not violate plaintiffs constitutional rights.although regulations on the referendum process implicate the fundamental right to vote,the state important interests justify the minimal burden on plaintiffs rights.additionally,oregon signature verification standards are uniform and specific enough to ensure equal treatment of voters.
we agree with plaintiffs that state regulations on the initiative and referendum process implicate the fundamental right to vote.in moore ogilvie,d,the supreme court held that restrictions on candidate nominating petitions implicate voters fundamental rights because a ll procedures used by a state as an integral part of the election process must pass muster against the charges of discrimination or of abridgement of the right to vote.id.at.in idaho coalition united for bears cenarrussa,cir,we relied on moore and held that regulations on a state initiative process implicate the fundamental right to vote,for the same reasons and in the same manner,as regulations on candidate nominating petitions.id.at.w hile a state may decline to grant a
