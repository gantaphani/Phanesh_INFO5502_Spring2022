virginia senatorial district republican committee and its chairman,larry miller collectively referred to as the plaintiffs,appeal the district court order dismissing their constitutional challenge to virginia open primary law for lack of justiciability.we reverse.we remand to the district court for decision on the merits.
on june,the republican party of virginia amended its plan of organization to exclude voters who participated in the nomination process of another party within the preceding five years from voting in the republican primary the plan of organization offers an exception for those who,in writing,renounce their affiliation with the other party,indicate their agreement with republican party principles,and express their intent to support the republican party nominees.these amendments to the plan of organization became effective on june.
the plaintiffs conduct nominations for the republican candidate running for the district seat in the senate of virginia.stephen martin,a republican,currently holds the seat and is up for reelection in.in virginia,incumbents may select their method of nomination.ann.b.on august,senator martin submitted a form to the plaintiffs that designated a primary as his chosen method of nomination for the election.
on january,the plaintiffs decided to hold the primary consistent with the recent amendments to the state party plan of organization.that is,they would exclude anyone who voted in any democratic primary in virginia since march,from participating in their primary.miller informed the virginia state board of elections board of the plaintiffs decision in a january,letter.the letter requests written confirmation from the board of its receipt of this letter and of the board intention to implement the restrictions on the participation by democrats in our primary.
jean jenson,the board secretary,replied on behalf of the board on february.she explained the plaintiffs may take whatever action they deem appropriate that complies with their party plan of organization,but pointed out several virginia statutes for miller review.she noted that under section,the state board of elections may accept notification of the selection of the primary method of nomination for the election in senate district no earlier than february,and no later than march.emphasis in original.section provides 
at least days prior to the regular date for a primary,the board shall inquire of each state chairman and each county and city chairman whether a direct primary has been adopted.the board shall advise each chairman that notification to the board of the adoption of a direct primary is required and must be filed with the board not more than days and not less than days before the date set for the primaries.
each chairman shall file timely written notice with the board whether or not a primary has been adopted and identify each office for which a primary has been adopted.the requirement to notify the board of the adoption of a direct primary shall be satisfied when the board receives by the deadline i written notice from the appropriate party chairman or ii a copy of the written notice from an incumbent officeholder to his party chairman of the incumbent selection,pursuant to,of the primary as the method of nomination.
at the conclusion of the letter,jensen stated the board must follow section,virginia open primary law.this law provides 
all persons qualified to vote,pursuant to through,may vote at the primary.no person shall vote for the candidates of more than one party.
ann.after quoting the statute,she explained that unless miller can point to a specific provision of virginia law authorizing the board to restrict voting in the pending primary,the board will have to comply with the law of the commonwealth in effect at that time.
on april,the plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action under seeking a declaration that virginia open primary law violates their constitutional rights to free association.the board filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure on june.the plaintiffs filed a summary judgment motion two months later.following a hearing,the district court granted the defendant motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court ruled the plaintiffs lacked standing and that the case was not ripe.
it is well established that before a federal court can decide the merits of a claim,the claim must invoke the jurisdiction of the court.whitmore arkansas,d.article iii gives federal courts jurisdiction only over cases and controversies,const.art.iii,cl,and the doctrine of standing identifies disputes appropriate for judicial resolution.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church and state,d.a claim is justiciable if the conflicting contentions of the parties present a real,substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interests,a dispute definite and concrete,not hypothetical or abstract.babbitt united farm workers union,d quoting ry.mail ass corsi.
we review a district court dismissal for lack of standing and ripeness de novo.soc y for human life,fec,cir.
the doctrine of standing is an integral component of the case or controversy requirement.marshall meadows,cir.there are three components of constitutional standing the plaintiff must allege that he or she suffered an actual or threatened injury that is not conjectural or hypothetical,the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and a favorable decision must be likely to redress the injury.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.the party attempting to invoke federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing standing,dallas,d.the plaintiffs argue the district court erred when it concluded they lack standing.we agree.
the first component of standing requires the plaintiffs to allege an actual or threatened injury.valley forge christian,at.the plaintiffs complaint alleges 
by maintaining,implementing enforcing a set of laws forbidding plaintiffs the right to exclude democrat party primary voters from their republican party nomination in accordance with their own adopted rules contained in the party plan,defendants are propogating sic customs,policies,and practices that violate the plaintiffs rights of free association under the first amendment of the united states constitution.
the allegation of having to associate with members of the other party during their processes unquestionably pleads a constitutional injury.see cal.democratic party jones,d finding blanket primary unconstitutional because it forces petitioners to adulterate their process by opening it up to persons wholly unaffiliated with the party.whether this alleged injury is actual or threatened,however,requires closer examination.
the district court held the asserted injuries were not actual or imminent.the district judge explained that senator martin is not an official candidate for the primary until he files a written declaration of candidacy,which can not occur until at least march.see ann.stating a candidate for a party nomination in a primary must file a written declaration of candidacy with the board id.explaining the declaration of candidacy should be filed with the board between noon on the day and on the day preceding the primary.the district judge also cited section,which requires at least two persons to file declarations of candidacy to hold a primary.
in the standing analysis,we avoid focusing on the injuries of senator martin,who is not a party,and concentrate on the injuries of the plaintiffs.focusing on the plaintiffs injuries reveals that their alleged constitutional injuries are not conjectural or hypothetical.the participation of democrats in the plaintiffs upcoming primary is inevitable knowing their upcoming process for selecting a nominee will include democrats prevents the plaintiffs from formulating a message and selecting the candidates best tailored to their party interests.see clingman beaver,d,concurring and the choice of who will participate in selecting a party candidate obviously plays a critical role in determining both the party message and its prospects of success in the elec
