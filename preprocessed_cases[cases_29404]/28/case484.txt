all towing services llc all towing appeals from the summary judgment entered in favor of the city of orange city and its city council members,denis bilodeau,jon dumitru,and fred whitaker on all towing conflict of interest claims arising from the award of a vehicle towing contract.all towing contends triable issues of fact prevented summary judgment.as we explain,however,all towing failed in its opposition to summary judgment to identify any disputed facts suggesting whitaker had a conflict of interest,and as a matter of law the or more in campaign contributions bilodeau and dumitru received in an earlier election cycle do not create a conflict of interest.we publish our discussion of the latter issue to explain the error of a contrary statement in breakzone billiards city of torrance th,breakzone.
factual and procedural background 
in the fall of,the orange police department solicited bid proposals to perform towing services for the official police towing and services storage opts program under contract with the city opts agreement,or optsa.under the optsa,the police department calls tow operators on a rotational basis whenever it needs vehicles towed for police purposes,such as after an accident or as part of a criminal investigation.according to all towing,the police department screened and scored the proposals it received before submitting them to the city council for a final decision and,of the seven tow companies submitting bids,all towing earned the third highest score.
the city alerted the seven companies it would award opts towing contracts at a city council hearing on january,but all towing regarded the meeting as a formality where matters are routinely approved,and did not appear.all towing later explained that one of its owners and the person who prepared its bid proposal,norma odeh,did not attend the hearing because she was caring for her mother,who died four days later.all towing did not send anyone in her place.
the city council voted at the hearing to award opts contracts to five towing companies,and all towing was not among them.the council initially awarded only four contracts,expressing reservations about one of the bidders,california coach.but a california coach representative addressed the council concerns at the meeting and,before it adjourned,the council voted to award a fifth towing contract to the company.the council,however,did not execute the contracts immediately.
all towing lawyer complained in a letter to the city soon after the council meeting that two tow operators receiving opts contracts had poor qualifications and that three of the five scored lower than all towing on the police department screening criteria.the letter also alleged that at the optsa city council meeting councilmember fred whitaker mentioned that he had checked the public records and discovered that all towing had a collection dispute with a large tax provider for the city of orange sc fuels and,f or that reason,whitaker disqualif ied our client from the process.the letter complained that whitaker failed to disclose he previously had been a vice president and general counsel for sc fuels and that when he rejoined his law firm,cummins white,sc fuels remained one of the firm clients.
the letter asserted a conflict of interest based on whitaker association with sc fuels,but also explained whitaker was mistaken in assuming a connection between sc fuels debtor and all towing.the letter explained the debtor on the sc fuels lien,american all star towing,was not the same entity as all towing,which was only doing business as american all star towing.counsel explained in a subsequent letter that the original american all star towing had gone out of business in,and all towing simply purchased its assets at that time,but was not liable for the sc fuels debt.
all towing letters also explained that purported concerns raised at the city council meeting about the financial condition of all towing owners were similarly misplaced.while an owner of the original american all star towing company,naji nick feghali,was now a manager at all towing,a bankruptcy court discharged any individual liability he had on the sc fuels debt,and all towing owners and all towing itself were financially strong.all towing declared the personal bankruptcy of its manager was not a reason to disqualify the company.
all towing also complained that a t least councilmembers received campaign contributions from other towing companie s who were applying for the contract.all towing claimed the unnamed councilmembers should not have participated in the voting.
based on all towing complaints,the city council agreed to revisit the opts contracts.the city attorney notified the tow operators that had been approved in the previous hearing that the city council would be reconsidering its january,decision to not include all towing on the list of tow contractors at a new hearing on february.the letter advised that while the city council may limit its discussion to consideration of all towing,it is not required to do so.you may want to have a representative attend the meeting,as the ultimate decision of the city council may have an impact on your operation.
whitaker recused himself at the february city council hearing to avoid any appearance of a conflict involving one of my firm clients,cardlock fuels,a member of the fuels companies counsel for all towing reiterated at the hearing the concerns all towing expressed in its letters,explaining again that all towing was not the same entity as the former american all star towing all star.in effect,counsel explained whitaker had no actual conflict of interest with all towing based on his association with sc fuels,since all star and not all towing had failed to pay sc fuels fuel bill,resulting in the lien.all towing was a different entity that had simply purchased all star assets and,since all towing had new and different owners who were financially sound and validly organized as a new limited liability company,all towing was not merely a continuation of all star under a different name.but all towing did not request that whitaker,now apprised of the true facts,withdraw his recusal and participate in the hearing.
all towing and two of the tow operators who were awarded opts contracts at the january hearing suggested rescinding some of the contracts so that only a total of four tow operators would tow for the police.each asserted they should be among the four.
after considering the matter,the four remaining city council members decided not to eliminate any of the five previously approved companies from the opts program.one of the council members then made a motion to include all towing in the program,and he was joined by another council member,but council members bilodeau and dumitru voted against expanding the program to six tow operators.accordingly,the motion to include all towing failed on a vote.though all towing had not wanted whitaker included in the vote,all towing complained that with only four members left to vote at the rehearing,all towing labored under the burden of securing percent approval a vote to secure an opts contract,while the other companies at the january hearing only required a vote,or percent approval.
within a month of the february rehearing,all towing filed the present lawsuit seeking to void the opts contracts and enjoin whitaker,bilodeau,and dumitru from participating in any rehearing.the complaint asserted four causes of action.the first cause of action against whitaker and the city asserted whitaker participation in the initial hearing in january violated the political reform act of,et hereafter pra all further undesignated statutory citations are to this code based on whitaker alleged financial interest in the awarding of the opts contract.
the second and third causes of action similarly asserted the city,bilodeau,and dumitru violated the pra provisions against financial conflicts of interest because bilodeau and dumitru each received campaign contributions of or more from at least two of the six companies other than plaintiff vying for the opts agreement within just a few months less than a year before the initial january hearing.according to the complaint,these campaign contributions signify that bilodeau and dumitru each had under the pra a prohibited per se financial interest in the awarding of the opts contract.
the fourth cause of action asserted whitaker,bilodeau,dumitru,and the city violated a general common law conflict of interest prohibition based on the same allegations underlying the first three causes of action.all towing alleged under the fourth cause of action damages in excess of two million dollars.
the trial court granted all towing initial ex parte request for a temporary restraining order in march but,after a hearing and briefing by the parties,subsequently denied all towing request for a preliminary injunction,finding it was unlikely to prevail on the merits.
defendants in january filed their motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication.they asserted in their motion they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because it was not foreseeable that a decision on the opts contracts would affect whitaker financial interest in any manner any conceivable conflict was rectified by his subsequent recusal and the campaign contributions bilodeau and dumitru received and reported in a previous election cycle did not constitute a conflict of interest under the pra or common law 
all towing filed its opposition to summary judgment and a cursory separate statement of facts at the hearing on the motion in april,without any advance notice to defendants or leave from the court to file a late opposition.the opposition conceded defendants basic factual presentation in its summary judgment motion was correct,with unimportant quibbles.all towing opposition did not address whitaker at all and instead focused on bilodeau and dumitru,arguing the undisputed campaign contributions they received constituted a conflict of interest.
the trial court granted defendants summary judgment motion on the merits instead of faulting all towing for its late opposition.the court concluded all towing failed to raise a triable issue of fact that any of the council members had a conflict of interest under the pra or common law and all towing was required to raise its common law conflict of interest claim by a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus,which it failed to do.in any event,the trial court concluded a mandate petition would have failed because there was no material conflict of interest for any of the council members and the city council acted reasonably in awarding the opts contracts.all towing now appeals.

first cause of action whitaker alleged financial conflict of interest 
all towing alleged in its first cause of action that whitaker had a financial conflict of interest that precluded him under the pra from participating in the towing contract vote.the pra precludes an elected official from participating in a decision in which he has a financial interest,woodland hills residents,city council cal d,woodland hills.the parties stipulated for summary judgment purposes that cardlock fuels cardlock and its associated distribution company,sc fuels,were clients of whitaker law firm,and therefore constituted a source of income for whitaker,thus affecting his financial interests.
but whitaker and the city carried their initial burden to show they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because no evidence suggested that denying or awarding all towing any share of the police towing contract would have any effect on sc fuels or cardlock financial interests,and therefore the contract award had no discernible ripple effect on whitaker financial interests.all towing in its opposition to summary judgment made no argument and presented no facts,disputed or undisputed,to suggest the towing contract would affect sc fuels or cardlock in any manner.neither fuel company owned,operated,or had any discernible financial interest in any of the towing companies under consideration for the towing contract.and by failing to mention any particulars concerning whitaker in its summary judgment opposition,all towing failed to even suggest any factual basis implicating whitaker in a conflict of interest arising from the towing contract vote.instead,all towing opposition focused on bilodeau and dumitru alleged conflicts of interest based on receipt of campaign contributions.but this did not implicate whitaker in any pra violations that all towing alleged generally in its first cause of action.
noting all towing did not use sc fuels or cardlock to fuel its tow trucks,all towing now argues on appeal that if the companies approved for the opts a instead of plaintiff use d sc fuels or cardlock for their fueling needs,sc fuels cardlock would lose the opportunity for increased fuel sales if plaintiff were assigned the opts a,another fact to be proven at trial.italics added.such speculation,however,comes far too late and in any event is insufficient.on appeal,we must take the facts from the record that was before the trial court when it ruled on the summary judgment motion.wilson century ins.cal th.moreover,substantial responsive evidence is required to oppose summary judgment and mere speculation is insufficient to establish a triable issue of fact.sangster paetkau th.accordingly,we find unavailing all towing further speculation on appeal that i t is also possible that whitaker accepted contributions from sc fuels to keep plaintiff from the opts a and that whitaker in an unspecified manner intended his towing vote to curry favor with sc fuels or cardlock.
all towing on appeal blames its trial attorney for its inadequate summary judgment opposition.all towing asserts the dearth of any facts or argument concerning whitaker in its opposition is of little import.according to all towing,when a party opposes a summary judgment motion,all that needs to be done at this juncture is allege that certain facts took place that were illegal,show harm done to the plaintiff,and ask the court for relief.all of those things have been done here.it is of no concern whether plaintiff has any evidence at this point.according to all towing,it simply needs to go through the discovery process in order to get that proof.
all towing displays a poor grasp of summary judgment practice.far from ancillary,evidence could not be more central to summary judgment proceedings.allegations alone are not sufficient.the moving party bears an initial burden to move beyond mere allegations and present evidence sufficient to show it is entitled to summary adjudication as a matter of law.code civ,subds.c f.once the moving party meets that burden,the party opposing summary judgment must produce admissible evidence raising a triable issue of fact.citation.citation.dollinger,supra,th at.the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.p.
defendants did not move for summary judgment until almost a year after all towing filed its complaint,the parties had ample time to conduct discovery,and all towing never sought a continuance to conduct further discovery.the trial court has no discretion to refuse summary judgment when the evidence before it raises no triable issues of fact krasley superior court d,and all towing challenge on appeal concerning its first cause of action therefore fails.the trial court properly resolved the first cause of action on summary judgment absent any facts in all towing opposition to suggest whitaker had a conflict of interest under the pra.
second and third causes of action bilodeau and dumitru receipt of campaign contributions allegedly violating the pra 
all towing alleged in its second cause of action that bilodeau receipt of more than in campaign contributions in an earlier election cycle from a company vying for the towing contract violated the pra.all towing alleged the same against dumitru in its third cause of action.all towing contends recent campaign contributions furnish a basis to state a claim under the pra against a public official sufficient to withstand summary judgment.all towing relies on a statement in breakzone,supra,th at,that declares categorically the political reform act,et creates a statutory obligation on the part of a public official to whom that act applies not to vote on a matter if he or she has received campaign contributions from a donor aggregating or more within months prior to the time the decision is made.
defendants contend this statement is dictum because no party in breakzone alleged a violation of the pra stemming from campaign contributions.rather,the breakzone plaintiff claimed that campaign contributions totaling given to council members considering the plaintiff request for a variance conditional use permit violated the plaintiff due process right to a fair hearing because the contributors opposed the variance.the breakzone plaintiff did not mention the pra,perhaps because as a statutory enactment,the pra does not necessarily follow or define the contours of constitutional due process.
on the other hand,the reviewing court in breakzone presumably turned to the pra for a sense of what constitutes fair play in political decisionmaking,and therefore its discussion of the pra was relevant to its due process inquiry.but the breakzone court devoted little analysis to the pra,quickly passing over it in a footnoted conclusion that the act did not apply because the contributions in that case occurred months before the variance hearing,outside the threshold for application of section within months prior to the vote in question.breakzone,supra,th at,fn.such cursory treatment affords little confidence in the pronouncement about the pra on which all towing relies.see people mendoza cal th,courts must view with caution seemingly categorical directives not essential to earlier decisions d courts,same.
whether the statement in breakzone that campaign contributions require recusal under the pra is dictum or not,it is wrong.the supreme court in woodland hills recognized that while the pra precludes an elected official from participating in a decision in which he has a financial interest citation,it expressly excludes from the definition of financial interest the receipt of campaign contributions.woodland hills,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted,italics added.it appears breakzone assumed in its brief,footnoted discussion of the pra that the definition of financial interest in section included campaign contributions as a gift or income requiring recusal for amounts more than within months of a challenged decision.to the contrary,however,the pra definitions of gift and income now and at the time breakzone was decided expressly exclude campaign contributions,subd.b the term gift does not include campaign contributions required to be reported under chapter of this title,subd.b income also does not include campaign contributions required to be reported under chapter of this title.as the supreme court explained,the pra provides for disclosure of campaign contributions by recipients of contributions rather than disqualification of recipients from acting in matters in which the recipient is interested.woodland hills,at.
the supreme court also explained that the pra exclusion for campaign contributions serves both practical and constitutional ends.as a practical example,the court noted if a political contribution automatically disqualifies the recipient after his election from considering and acting on matters in which the contributor has an interest,the enterprising developer could disqualify all known environmentalists who are running for municipal office by making nominal contributions to the campaign committees of such persons.future applications of the developer could then be judged by a panel from which all known environmentalists have been disqualified.woodland hills,supra,cal d at,fn.
the supreme court further explained that t o disqualify a city council member from acting on a development proposal because the developer had made a campaign contribution to that member would threaten constitutionally protected political speech and associational freedoms.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.for instance,it would curtail the right of contributors such as developers,builders,engineers,and attorneys who are related in some fashion to developers to participate in the electoral process.id.at.accordingly,the high court concluded that the pra in dealing comprehensively with problems of campaign contribution and conflict of interest does not prevent a city council member from acting upon a matter involving the contributor.id.at.
all towing relies on the fact breakzone was decided years after woodland hills and has met no published disagreement.neither of these features rehabilitates breakzone erroneous disqualification statement.the practical and constitutional considerations the supreme court noted in woodland hills still apply.moreover,the pra express exclusions for ordinary campaign contributions remain unchanged,subd.b,subd.b.we may not ignore the express language of a statute.california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d,court may not add to or alter the words of a statute.
significantly,the terms of the pra reflect the legislature knew how to specify it applied to campaign contributions involving public agencies,but not to decisions by officials in their elected office.specifically,section provides,no officer of an agency shall accept,solicit,or direct a contribution of more than two hundred fifty dollars from any party while a proceeding involving a license,permit,or other entitlement for use is pending before the agency but section,subdivision a,specifically excludes from the pra definition of agency those local governmental agencies whose members are directly elected by the voters,which indisputably is the case for city council members like bilodeau and dumitru.as the supreme court in woodland hills e
