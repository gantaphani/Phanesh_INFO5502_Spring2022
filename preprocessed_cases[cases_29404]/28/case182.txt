as my colleagues opinions for the court appear to me to be a bit succinct,i write to provide some additional facts and reasoning in support of the same result.
ralph nader ran for president of the united states in.under ohio law,he needed to collect signatures on his nominating petition to be placed on the ohio ballot.circulators of nader nominating petitions collected over signatures,but local election boards invalidated approximately of them,leaving signatures.kenneth blackwell,then ohio secretary of state,certified nader for placement on the ballot.however,a group of ohio democratic voters challenged nader signatures,and blackwell directed an attorney in his office to hold a hearing regarding the validity of the remaining signatures.after considering testimony and other evidence,the staff attorney invalidated more signatures.after these invalidations,nader had fewer than valid signatures,and blackwell removed him from the ballot on september.in october,a federal district court denied nader request for injunctive relief,the state courts denied his request for mandamus relief,and this court denied his emergency appeal.in november,we dismissed his regular appeal as moot.
in this case,filed in september,nader sued blackwell in his personal capacity for allegedly violating nader first amendment rights.according to nader,blackwell violated his rights when he applied ohio revised code,which requires that petition circulators reside and be registered to vote in ohio,to nader nominating petitions.the district court dismissed nader suit,holding that nader lacked standing and,alternatively,that blackwell enjoyed both qualified and absolute immunity.we hold that nader has standing to bring this suit,but we affirm the district court holding that blackwell enjoys qualified immunity.
on august,nader and his running mate,peter camejo,filed a joint statement of candidacy and nominating petition with the ohio secretary of state election division.see ohio ann.west.under ohio law,signatures are required for an independent candidate to be placed on the ballot.ohio ann.a west.the nominating petition appeared to have signatures.
the secretary of state election division processed the nominating petition and directed the individual ohio county boards of elections to determine the validity of a petition,the individual petition sheets that are circulated for signatures,and signatures.on september,after reviewing the findings of the county boards,the elections division determined that only signatures on the petition were valid.that day,of state blackwell certified nader candidacy for president,meaning that nader name would appear on the ohio ballot.on august,thirteen ohio electors the protestors filed a protest with the secretary of state challenging the validity of many of the remaining signatures.see ohio ann.west written protests against such nominating petitions may be filed by any qualified elector eligible to vote for the candidate whose nominating petition he objects to.
in response to the protest,a hearing was held at the office of the secretary of state on september.see ibid.upon the filing of such protests,the election officials with whom it is filed shall promptly fix the time and place for hearing it ibid.at the time and place fixed,such election officials shall hear the protest and determine the validty sic or invalidity of the petition.blackwell designated gretchen quinn,a staff attorney in his office,as the hearing officer,and she conducted the hearing.both the protestors and nader and camejo were represented by counsel at the hearing.both were given the opportunity to offer evidence including affidavits and documents and make statements.testimony was limited to information about the signatures validated by the boards of elections.the protestors challenged signatures gathered by fourteen petition circulators,based on various alleged violations of ohio law that would invalidate the signatures that they had collected.
on september,quinn issued and sent to blackwell a page memo of findings of fact and conclusions of law.quinn concluded that there were a number of significant problems relating to the petition,particularly in regard to the people who purportedly had circulated many of the that were subject to the protest.we now detail quinn findings,moving in order from the uncontroversial findings to those findings that are the basis of this lawsuit.
first,nader has never challenged quinn invalidation of signatures because they were not dated.neither has he challenged quinn finding that the election board of hamilton county made an arithmetic error,the correction of which reduced the number of signatures by.accordingly,excluding these signatures reduced nader signatures to.
second,quinn made several findings that prompted the parties to stipulate to the invalidation of many signatures.those findings were 
jill lane allegedly circulated with signatures.lane testified that she had signed some of the circulator statements on some of the,that her signature on others had been forged,and that she could not tell if her signature was forged on yet others of the.she also testified that never personally circulated any nader and that she never witnessed the affixing of any signatures to the.in fact,lane testified that her cousin,who was not an ohio resident,had told her he was circulating petitions against marriage and asked her to sign the circulator statements.ohio revised code e states that petition circulators must personally witness the affixing of every signature,otherwise an entire is invalid.the parties stipulated that the signatures on bearing lane name as circulator would be invalid.
michael cottrell testified that he never actually circulated five bearing signatures.the parties stipulated that those signatures were invalid.
melody hudson,jill lane daughter,testified that she never circulated bearing her name and containing signatures.the parties stipulated that those signatures were invalid.
richard hudson,jill lane son,testified that he signed the statements on six containing signatures,but that he had not acted as a circulator and had not witnessed any signatures.the parties stipulated that those signatures were invalid.
one bearing one signature was allegedly circulated by a michael dowham,but a michael bonham testified that he,not any michael dowham,lived at the address given for dowham.the hearing officer concluded that there was no such person as michael dowham,and the parties stipulated the signature was invalid.
in total,the parties stipulated that signatures were invalid.excluding those signatures from the tally of signatures,nader still had signatures.
third,quinn invalidated other signatures based on findings that are not being challenged here.those findings were 
greg reese testified that he personally circulated and witnessed only eight of the bearing his name.reese was unable to distinguish which he had or had not actually circulated.accordingly,quinn invalidated the signatures on the from reese that the local election boards had found valid.
antoine jackson allegedly circulated containing signatures.jackson testified that he did not personally circulate,and thus did not witness the signatures on,to of the petitions bearing his name.jackson could not distinguish between the he circulated and those he did not.accordingly,quinn invalidated the signatures.
ronald waller allegedly circulated containing signatures.he attested under penalty of election falsification that he resided in cincinnati.waller mother swore in an affidavit that he had not lived at the given address since march.one individual whose name was on the petition swore that he signed a petition circulated by a white man and a white woman.waller is a black man.quinn found that the evidence did not show that waller was not an ohio resident,merely that he was not resident at the address listed on the.quinn found that the evidence supported a finding of election falsification on two because they were circulated by persons other than waller,see ohio ann.west,and invalidated signatures from those two.
robert ellis allegedly circulated containing signatures.ellis stated on the,under penalty of election falsification,that he resided at an address in cincinnati,ohio.however,the process server for the hearing could not locate ellis at the address listed on the petitions,and the resident of that address provided an affidavit stating that ellis did not live there in summer.the management company for the apartment ellis listed also swore that ellis did not reside there and only other people had lived there since.on a separate petition regarding marriage,ellis had listed his circulator address as being in illinois.ellis provided a voter registration card with an ohio address,but that address proved to be a hotel,and the desk clerk indicated that ellis was no longer a guest.citing ohio revised code,quinn stated that only a qualified elector of ohio may circulate a nominating petition,and that qualified electors must reside in ohio.quinn found that ellis did not reside at any of the addresses he provided,and therefore was improperly registered to vote at those addresses.accordingly,the signatures on the he circulated were invalid on the separate grounds that he swore to a false residence address,and he is not a qualified elector of ohio.
curtis warner allegedly circulated containing signatures.on his,warner stated under penalty of election falsification that he resided at an address in cincinnati.warner signed a voter registration card using the same address on august.sworn statements from the current resident and property manager of the address indicated that warner had not lived there at least since.petitions that warner circulated at the same time showed that he had a california address.quinn found that warner were invalid because he swore to a false address and is not a qualified elector of ohio and invalidated all signatures,albeit without citing.
thus,quinn invalidated an additional signatures because certain circulators,jackson and reese could not tell which petitions they had actually circulated,because one circulator,waller had not actually circulated certain,and because she explicitly found that certain circulators,ellis and warner had sworn to a false address.nader does not challenge ohio requirements that circulators witness all signatures and list their true residence.see ohio ann.e.excluding these signatures,nader still had signatures,enough to qualify for the ballot.
fourth,quinn last set of findings relate to the focus of this lawsuit.her remaining findings were as follows 
daryl oberg allegedly circulated containing signatures.as with ellis and warner,the manifest weight of the evidence indicated that oberg did not reside at the address he provided on his at the time he circulated the petitions.he stated under penalty of election falsification that he resided at an address in north royalton,ohio.the landlord at that address stated that oberg had moved out in july.oberg had registered to vote in california in september.other addresses for oberg on different were also false.nader counsel produced affidavits from oberg stating that he was an ohio resident,but quinn accorded no weight to these affidavits,which were faxed from a nevada motel and which did not state where in ohio oberg purported to permanently reside.accordingly,quinn found that oberg had moved out of ohio and lost his ohio residence when he moved to california.accordingly,quinn invalidated signatures collected by oberg.however,unlike her findings regarding ellis and warner,quinn did not explicitly state that she found that oberg had listed a false address.rather,she justified her decision to invalidate the signatures only on the ground that oberg was not an ohio resident or voter,and we will assume that is the reason she invalidated the signatures he collected.
george woods allegedly circulated seven bearing signatures.he stated under penalty of election falsification that he resided at an address in dayton.the actual resident of that address,woods nephew,swore that woods had visited him in july but actually resided in texas.records indicated that woods had registered to vote using the ohio address in,but had registered to vote in texas as of february.explicitly finding that woods could not meet the requirements under because he was not an ohio resident,quinn invalidated his signatures.
john laws allegedly circulated containing signatures.laws stated under penalty of election falsification that he resided in lorain,ohio.the process server found the address vacant and was told by a neighbor that laws no longer lived there.laws wife swore that laws had moved out of the house in fall of.a foreclosure report indicated that the house was vacant between january and june.in august,laws registered to vote in los angeles,california,and his registration form listed his prior address as another address in california,not lorain,ohio.on july,laws circulated nader petitions in nevada.on those petitions,under penalty of perjury,laws swore that he resided in las vegas,nevada.quinn found that laws was not a resident of ohio,and hence could not be an ohio elector.accordingly,she invalidated the signatures he had gathered.in addition,quinn noted that numerous affidavits from purported signers of laws indicated that the individuals had never signed the petition or were told they were signing a petition for the gay marriage amendment.
steven larry laws allegedly circulated containing signatures.he stated on the that he resided in lorain,ohio.the process server found that laws sister lived there and left process with her.the sister commented that steven laws was in nevada.laws registered to vote in las vegas in january,and he stated under penalty of perjury that his nevada address he provided was his sole legal place of residence.the nevada form listed his prior address as being in los angeles.in,he registered to vote in carson,california.one month later,he registered to vote in los alamitos,california.in,he registered in hollywood,california,and he voted in a california statewide special election for governor.ohio law provides that a person who goes to another state and votes there loses his residence in ohio.ohio ann.h west.since he had ceased to be an ohio elector by operation of law,laws could not be an elector of ohio unless he reestablished ohio residence,which quinn found he had not.in addition,laws was convicted of criminal in california,found guilty,and stated at his sentencing hearing that he was a california resident.the same lawyer who represented laws at that sentencing submitted affidavits to quinn stating that laws was an ohio resident.quinn gave no weight to the affidavits.quinn invalidated the signatures.
thus,quinn invalidated an additional signatures because the circulators were not ohio residents and electors as required by quinn findings that none of these men was an ohio resident necessarily means that the men were not correct when they claimed to reside at ohio addresses.however,since quinn did not explicitly base her decision on the grounds of election falsification,our analysis below will proceed on the basis that she invalidated their signatures for failure to comply with ohio residence and registration requirements,as codified in excluding these signatures gathered by oberg,woods,john laws,and steven laws,nader had only valid signatures,well below the threshold.notably,the invalidation of oberg and woods signatures,taken together,still left nader with signatures,and thus quinn findings about their signatures were legally insufficient to invalidate nader candidacy.by contrast,quinn findings regarding either john or steven laws would be sufficient to invalidate nader candidacy invalidation of either john laws signatures or steven laws signatures would have reduced nader total valid signature count below the signatures required.
on september,blackwell formally accepted quinn report,stated that nader had only valid signatures,and ordered the boards of elections to remove the joint candidacy from the ballot or otherwise notify voters that a vote cast for would not be counted.under ohio law,election officials determinations are final.ohio ann.west.
on october,five ohio residents who served as members of a committee to qualify nader and camejo for the ohio ballot the relators filed an action in the supreme court of ohio seeking 
a writ of mandamus to compel the secretary of state to order ohio county boards of elections to update their voter registration records,the based on updated records,validate previously invalidated signatures on that were improperly invalidated because of outdated records,and review unreviewed signatures on totally invalidated where updated records show that the circulators are duly registered voters.in addition,relators seek a writ of mandamus to compel the secretary of state to count as valid those signatures on that were invalidated because of the requirement of.finally,relators request a writ of mandamus to compel the secretary of state to certify as valid nader candidacy upon a finding,following the boards review of updated records,that at least signatures previously invalidated are in fact valid.
blankenship blackwell,ohio,per curiam.this suit challenged only the actions of the local elections boards in invalidating of nader signatures.ibid.the relators also claimed that the residency requirement in ohio revised code and for circulators of nominating petitions violated the petition signers free speech rights under the first amendment.more specifically,relators complaint challenges the requirement that petition circulators be residents of the state of ohio.ibid.on october,the ohio supreme court denied the requested relief on the ground of laches,because the relators had waited until four months after they had begun circulating petitions to challenge the requirement and days after the local election boards had invalidated the signatures before raising their claims about stale voter registration information.id.at.the ohio supreme court also found that the delay had prejudiced the secretary of state and would endanger ohio election preparations.id.at.finally,the ohio supreme court held that the action must be dismissed because relators failed to bring this action in the name of the state on their relation.id.at.since the objection was raised and the relators failed to seek leave to amend the case caption,relief was denied for failure to comply with the rule.ibid.
on october,while the state mandamus action was pending,the relators filed suit in federal district court seeking a temporary restraining order barring blackwell from removing nader name from the ohio ballot,an injunction compelling blackwell to count as valid the nominating signatures of qualified electors previously invalidated due to the circulators failure to meet the residency requirement,and a declaratory judgment that ohio residency requirement for circulators violated the first and fourteenth amendments.see blankenship blackwell,d.
on october,the district court denied the motion and dismissed the case.after declining to abstain from hearing the case,the district court focused on the supreme court decision in buckley american constitutional law foundation,d.the district court noted that the buckley court held that a requirement that circulators of initiative petitions be registered violated the first amendment,but had declined to address whether a law requiring circulators to reside was constitutional.see blankenship,d at discussing buckley,at.the district court concluded,in view of the buckley decision,it appears clear that the requirement of ohio law that circulators be registered voters is unconstitutional.id.at.however,the court stated that lack of registration was not the primary basis upon which blackwell invalidated the signatures since blackwell and quinn had emphasized the failure to meet the residency requirement.see id.at noting also that under ohio severability law,the patent unconstitutionality of the registration requirement did not automatically invalidate the residency requirement,quoting ohio ann.the district court held that,although buckley had not addressed the constitutionality of state residency requirements,the district court had every reason to assume that the decision applies to this case.id.at.the district court applied strict scrutiny review,concluded that the state had a compelling interest in preventing election fraud,and concluded that the quinn report provided ample evidence of actual fraud in this case.see id.at.
in light of this actual fraud,the court declined to decide the constitutionality of residency requirement.see id.at.regardless of how the court would resolve the question of whether a state law requiring circulators to be state residents is constitutional,the fact remains that the signatures would be excluded on the grounds of several forms of fraud on the part of circulators.thus,the court finds that plaintiffs have failed to meet a threshold requirement for this court to even consider the constitutional issue.ibid.citing the canon that courts should avoid deciding constitutional issues unnecessarily,the court held that because blackwell invalidated the challenged names on the independent basis of fraud,this court declines to address plaintiffs constitutional challenge to.id.at the district court further held that the doctrine of unclean hands precluded injunctive relief for nader,because the magnitude of the fraud described in quinn report are sic far too great for this court to consider granting the equitable relief in the plaintiff favor.ibid.
the day of the district court decision,the relators filed for an emergency injunction and expedited appeal in the sixth circuit.a panel of this court held that the relators claim fails primarily because they can not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.blankenship blackwell,wl,at cir,per curiam.blackwell had state statutory grounds independent of the registration and residency requirements to reject the disputed circulators petitions election falsification,a felony in ohio.ibid.citing ohio ann.a.given the evidence of fraud,the panel declined to address the first amendment challenge.
the relators then filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court judgment on october,and that appeal was submitted on october,and decided on november.in their appeal,the relators asked this court to vacate the district court judgment dismissing their case and to grant them a declaratory judgment that ohio residency and registration requirements for circulators violate the first amendment.see blankenship blackwell,cir.the relators admitted that their request for an injunction to get nader on the ballot was moot,since the election had already occurred.see ibid.they argued that their request for declaratory judgment was not moot,but judge batchelder,writing for the panel,with judges keith and oberdorfer concurring,held that because the district court dismissal of the declaratory judgment claim was based on its resolution of the ballot access claim,the only way the panel could address the declaratory claim was to vacate the district court now moot judgment solely for the sake of reviewing the relators declaratory judgment claim.see ibid.the court declined to grant the relators the extraordinary equitable remedy of vacatur and noted that the relators had chosen to test the limits of the residency requirement by employing circulators who misstated their residencies rather than challenging the residency requirement as unconstitutional from the very start.id.at.the appeal was held to be moot and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.see id.at.
the case now pending before us began when nader himself filed suit against blackwell on september.nader sought nominal damages from blackwell,in his individual capacity,for blackwell violation of the first and fourteenth amendments.nader alleged that blackwell application of ohio revised code to his petition violated the federal constitution,and that blackwell was liable under for actions taken under color of ohio law for nominal damages in the sum of one dollar,costs,attorney fees,and any additional relief the court deemed just.
the district court granted blackwell motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on september.first,the district court questioned whether nader had standing to sue under article iii.given the passage of time since blackwell removed nader from the ballot,the court is not convinced that plaintiff has articulated the sort of injury in fact sufficient to confer standing for purposes of article iii.the court noted that although nader sought nominal damages,the real relief that plaintiff seeks is that the court find unconstitutional.the district court then referenced its earlier discussion regarding constitutional avoidance from its decision denying blankenship request for injunctive relief and stated that it found no reason to depart from this analysis simply because plaintiff nader seeks to hold the former secretary of state individually liable for the action of removing plaintiff from the ballot in.thus,the court held that nader had failed to satisfy article iii standing requirement.
second,the court held that even if nader had standing,blackwell enjoyed qualified immunity.the district court reiterated the finding from the prior litigation that the decision to remove plaintiff from the ballot in was based upon a finding that plaintiff petition circulators had committed massive fraud by lying about their residency status the district court adhered to its view that blackwell had not relied on in invalidating nader signatures.therefore,the court held that nader had not shown a violation of his constitutional rights.
third,the court held that blackwell was entitled to absolute immunity.the court held that absolute immunity applied because the quinn hearing was sufficiently adjudicative in nature to confer absolute immunity.the court noted that the hearing included presentation of evidence and testimony,that quinn issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law,and that the relators had the right to,and did in fact seek,a writ of mandamus in response to blackwell decision.
accordingly,the district court dismissed nader complaint and entered judgment in blackwell favor.nader timely appealed that judgment,and the case is now before this panel.
we review de novo the district court decision to grant defendant blackwell motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.see lambert hartman,cir.a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is a test of the plaintiff cause of action as stated in the complaint,not a challenge to the plaintiff factual allegations.golden city of columbus,cir.accordingly,we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the party,nader,and accept all of his factual allegations as true.see dubay wells,cir.the factual allegations in a complaint need not be detailed they need only give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.erickson pardus,d internal quotations and citations omitted.
this suit is a civil action for money damages against blackwell in his personal capacity.it is not another chance for nader to litigate the constitutionality of,the constitutionality of which is being challenged directly in other cases nor is it a chance for nader to relitigate quinn factual findings.the district court gave three independent reasons for dismissing nader of standing,qualified immunity,and absolute immunity.because we hold below that nader has standing to bring this suit,we must decide whether blackwell has qualified immunity,and as part of that analysis,we must decide whether blackwell violated nader rights when he applied to nader petition circulators.
a plaintiff seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts must satisfy the threshold requirement imposed by article iii of the constitution by alleging an actual case or controversy.city of los angeles lyons,d.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three requirements injury in fact,causation,and redressability.steel citizens for a better environment,d see also lujan defenders of wildlife,d.i njury in fact is a harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.steel,at.citation and quotation marks omitted.causation is a fairly traceable connection between the plaintiff injury and the conduct of the defendant.ibid.redressability is a likelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged injury.ibid.
in this case,there is little argument that nader removal from the ballot constitutes an and that blackwell conduct caused the alleged injury to allege a sufficient injury under the first amendment,a plaintiff must establish that he or she is subject to a government power that is regulatory,proscriptive,or compulsory in nature.laird tatum,d.here,blackwell regulated and proscribed nader when he applied to nader petitions,invalidated signatures because circulators failed to comply with,and then removed nader from the ballot.removal from the ballot surely constitutes a cognizable.see duke cleland,cir kay austin,cir.
in addition,we find the seventh circuit analysis in a similar election case,krislov rednour,cir,particularly persuasive.the seventh circuit held that the plaintiffs,who were political candidates,had standing to challenge illinois circulator registration and residency requirements,even though the candidates had actually acquired enough valid signatures to appear on the ballot.see id.at.the court reasoned that the candidates had been injured in two ways.first,being denied use of,circulators,they were required to allocate additional campaign resources to gather signatures and were deprived of the solicitors political advocates of their choice.this in itself can be an injury to first amendment rights.krislov,at citing meyer grant,d.second,because they were prohibited from using and circulators,they were limited in the choice and number of people to carry their message to the public.ibid.as meyer makes clear,limiting the size of a candidate audience and reducing the amount of speech about his views that he can generate is a cognizable injury.see meyer,at.
turning to nader case,he too has standing.as noted above,removal from the ballot certainly constitutes a cognizable injury.moreover,like the plaintiffs in krislov,nader was denied the use of the circulators of his choice,and nader potential audience and the amount of speech about his views that he could generate was limited when blackwell applied to his petitions.it is also clear that nader alleged injury is fairly traceable to blackwell conduct.indeed,but for blackwell decision to apply and invalidate of nader signatures,nader would have remained on the ballot.finally,monetary damages against blackwell would compensate nader for his past injury.lyons,at.distinguishing between standing to pursue prospective and retrospective relief.to survive a rule b motion,factual allegations must be enough raise a right to relief above the speculative level.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,ed.in his complaint,nader sought nominal damages and any additional relief the court deemed just.nominal damages suffice to redress a claim.see carey piphus,d holding that,absent evidence of actual injury,a plaintiff may recover nominal damages under.in his briefs to this court,nader goes one step further and states that he also intends to seek compensation for the extra expenses he incurred in a late bid to comply with and for emotional harms he suffered as a result of blackwell conduct.such damages would redress at least some of nader alleged injuries.
in discussing standing,the district court stated that the passage of time between the election and this suit had weakened nader articulation of an injury in fact.we disagree with this analysis.in this case,the passage of time may preclude nader from being placed on ohio election ballot,but it does not mean that nader may not seek compensation for past injuries.thus,despite the district court doubts,we hold that nader has standing to pursue this civil suit for money damages against blackwell.
qualified immunity 
given our holding that nader has standing to sue blackwell,we turn to the question of whether blackwell nevertheless enjoys qualified immunity from suit.we hold that the application of to nader petition circulators violated nader first amendment rights and that blackwell is chargeable with having enforced the law.however,we also hold that the right was not clearly established when blackwell acted.accordingly,blackwell is immune from suit 
government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.qualified immunity involves a inquiry.see saucier katz,d bouggess mattingly,cir.first,the court must ask whether,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the official conduct violated a constitutional right saucier,at.if the answer is yes,then the court must go on to ask whether the right was clearly established the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable official that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.see also dominque telb,cir stating that qualified immunity applies unless any officer in the defendant position,measured objectively,would have clearly understood that he was under an affirmative duty to have refrained from such conduct emphasis added.
the first part of our blackwell violated nader first amendment rights when he applied to nader an examination of the statute itself.at the time blackwell acted,stated 
no person shall be entitled to vote at any election,or to sign or circulate any declaration of candidacy or any nominating,initiative,referendum,or recall petition,unless the person is registered as an elector and will have resided in the county and precinct where the person is registered for at least thirty days at the time of the next election.
ohio ann.west.thus,imposes both a residency and a registration requirement.the two requirements are separate,but the registration requirement is related to the residency requirement one must have been a resident for thirty days in the precinct where one is registered.
quinn findings,which blackwell adopted,reflect her application of both the residency and registration requirements to nader circulators.in discussing daryl oberg status as an ohio resident and elector,quinn determined that oberg lacked a qualifying voting residence and invalidated the signatures that he collected.regarding george woods,quinn determined that he had been registered to vote in texas since february,concluded that he is not an ohio resident,and invalidated the signatures that he collected.regarding john laws,quinn noted that he had registered to vote in california and cited this court case law for the proposition that persons who were not legitimate residents at their stated address were improperly registered and ineligible to vote.quinn concluded that john laws is not an ohio resident,and thus lacks a necessary qualification to be an ohio elector.she invalidated signatures that he collected.finally,quinn findings regarding steven laws also reflect the dual requirements of residency and voter registration under.quinn found that steven laws had registered to vote in california,and that by voting in california,he ceased to be an ohio elector by operation of law.therefore,she concluded,he could not be a qualified elector of ohio unless he a qualifying voting residence in ohio,registered to vote at that ohio address,and otherwise satisfied ohio voter eligibility requirements.emphasis added.
although nader argues that blackwell application of residency requirement is the problem,both the law text and quinn application of the law,which blackwell adopted,make it clear that is more correct to say that imposes both a registration and a residency requirement.no circulator was rejected for being a legitimate resident,but not a registered voter.thus,the question before us is whether blackwell application of the two requirements violated nader first amendment rights.we conclude that it did.
the most relevant case is buckley american constitutional law foundation,d,in which the supreme court held that colorado requirement that circulators of initiative petitions be registered colorado voters was unconstitutional the court reiterated that petition circulation is core political speech,because it involves interactive communication concerning political change.id.at.quoting meyer grant,d.first amendment protection for such interaction is at its zenith.see also mccloud testa,cir political association is at the core of the first amendment,and even practices that only potentially threaten political association are highly suspect.the court found that a registration requirement drastically reduces the number of persons,both volunteer and paid,available to circulate petitions.id.at.applying strict scrutiny,id.at,the court concluded that colorado registration requirement cuts down the number of message carriers in the arena without impelling cause,id.at,and held that the requirement was unconstitutional.
we hold that blackwell violated nader first amendment rights when he enforced ohio registration and residency requirements against nader circulators.we are mindful that the distinction between legitimate ballot access regulations and improper restrictions on interactive political speech is not subject to a test.anderson celebrezze,d.instead,a particularized assessment of the restriction and the burden it imposes is required.in this case,as in buckley,nader petition circulation activity constitutes core political speech,and any regulation of that speech is subject to exacting scrutiny.see buckley,at.id.at.thomas,concurring applying strict scrutiny because registration requirement impacted core political speech.because of the unusual posture of this case,the record and briefs do not contain the usual evidence and arguments about whether ohio law is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest however,it is undisputable that blackwell conduct sharply limited nader ability to convey his message to ohio voters and thereby curtailed nader core political speech.under blackwell application of to nader petitions,nader could only use circulators who resided in ohio and were properly registered to vote in ohio.in requiring such from nader,blackwell violated nader right to use petition circulators who were not ohio residents and registered ohio voters.see also nader brewer,cir noting that arizona residency requirement for circulators excludes from eligibility all persons who support the candidate but who live outside the state of arizona.such a restriction creates a severe burden on speech,voting and associational rights.
we must decide the extent to which the principles that buckley established regarding circulators and registration requirements may be extended.there appears to be little reason to limit buckley holding to circulators.as the supreme court noted circulators also resemble signature gatherers for both seek ballot access.buckley,at.indeed,common sense suggests that,in the course of convincing voters to sign their petitions,circulators engage in at least as much interactive political speech if not more such circulators.some of our sister circuits have concluded the same and have applied buckley to invalidate state laws requiring that circulators be registered voters.see lerman bd.of elections,cir stating that there was no basis to conclude that the level of interactive political speech of candidate and circulators differed krislov,at noting that the burden on candidates is even greater than the burden on initiative proponents because a candidate circulators must speak to a broader range of political topics see also nader,at applying buckley to case involving circulators.we agree with these courts that we should not categorically exclude circulators from buckley analysis of registration requirements.thus,we hold that blackwell enforcement of the registration requirements against nader circulators violated nader first amendment rights.
looking then to the residency requirements,which would be implicated to the extent that circulators had not registered to vote and were not residents of ohio,we see little reason to uphold the exclusion of such persons from the ranks of circulators.the interest in permitt
