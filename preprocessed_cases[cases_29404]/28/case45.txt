the background to this litigation under section is easily recounted.in,dorcas began work as an employee with the rank of employee i in the puerto rico department of labor and human resources dlhr.she earned career status as an information representative and was rather quickly promoted to a trust,political position in.at that time,the governorship was held by the new progressive party npp with which is associated.
in november,a new governor was elected representing the popular democratic party pdp.as permitted by puerto rico law,laws ann.a,then exercised her option to resume her earlier status as a career employee effective december,shortly before the new administration took power in january.when the new governor took office,she appointed,as secretary of the dlhr,victor,who was later succeeded by roman velazco.in the new administration,carmen was assistant secretary for human resources she was later replaced by gladys rivera.
according to,she was made a target of harassment after the new pdp administration came to power.she said that her duties were reduced and given at least in part to a former subordinate,maira gonzalez,a member of the pdp that she was harassed by gonzalez and by another,angel agosto and that her entire office was abolished in october.although was initially given an equivalent job in another part of the dlhr,she was discharged in march.
the discharge,which is a central issue in the present appeal,occurred after an audit in studied transfers within the department that had occurred during a freeze period surrounding the election.the audit was conducted under the supervision of gladys rivera and it concluded,as to,that there were irregularities in her original appointment to the career position of information representative that rendered the appointment a nullity.gladys rivera report led to discharge by.
following the discharge,brought the present suit in april.along with claims under puerto rico law,the complaint asserted a federal claim under,based on two different theories first,that the alleged harassment and the discharge were politically motivated in violation of first amendment rights,and second,that her discharge without a prior hearing violated fifth amendment due process rights,given that her career position is a protected property right.
the defendants named in the suit were,gonzalez and agosto velazco,who succeeded as secretary of the dlhr,was later added for purposes of reinstatement relief.gladys rivera was not named as a defendant.sought huge damages against all four in their personal capacity damage claims were made but are barred and reinstatement as information representative.she requested a preliminary injunction to restore her to her position pendente lite this was denied by the district court but this court vacated and remanded the matter for further proceedings,cir.
in june,the district court granted pending motions to dismiss the personal capacity damage claims against all defendants based on qualified immunity.on june,the court held a bench trial on the request for reinstatement,which it granted on the ground that termination without a prior hearing was impermissible because the department had not shown that career appointment was void.in august,the district court issued a final judgment.
these cross appeals followed to contest the dismissal of her damage claims and the secretary to contest her reinstatement.on the former,resolved on summary judgment,our review is plenary,carmona toledo,cir on the latter,which followed a bench trial,are reviewed for clear error and legal determinations de novo save that some deference may be shown to rulings that effectively apply abstract rules to specific events.a wright miller,federal practice procedure civil at.
we begin with damage claims against the defendants,which the district court dismissed based on qualified immunity.the underlying substantive law protects government employees from adverse action or harassment against them motivated by hostility to their political views or affiliation.guillermo rodriguez,cir.defendants did not assert that held a position for which her political opinions could be treated as pertinent instead,they denied any violation and,in the alternative,said that qualified immunity protected them.
we may affirm the district court dismissal if the claims fail on their merits at the summary judgment stage or if,on this record,qualified immunity has been made out.indeed,the two inquiries now overlap in part due to the supreme court direction in saucier katz,d,that qualified immunity determinations begin with an inquiry into whether the right asserted exists at all in relation to the facts.the individual defendants are charged with distinct acts performed by each and,in addition,with a joint and general effort to drive from her post.
was deprived of her position by a single decision to terminate her employment on the professed ground that her original career appointment as information representative was flawed in its inception.asserts that was wrongfully motivated by her party affiliation if so,he would presumptively be liable,at to qualified immunity or other possible defenses,see,healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.
there is no evidence that action was politically motivated.he received a report,resulting from gladys rivera audit,colorably asserting that was holding a career position to which she was not entitled.he has denied a political motive in his deposition,he identified others who were terminated as a result of the audit.has pointed to nothing to show political motivation on part.
if anything,brief on this issue tends more to undercut her position than to support it.in a short mustering of evidence against,the brief says he admitted considering party membership so he did,saying that it made him hesitate,in her favor when confronted with the recommendation against her.the brief also conjures up an imaginary conflict between statements that he questioned gladys rivera actively as to the recommendation and his eventual reliance on the audit recommendation.
there are four charges against that she deprived of prior duties,assigned gonzalez to the same office with some of those duties,transferred all of the personnel of office incident to its closing,and ordered an earlier audit of personnel transactions occurring in august before the freeze became effective.the earlier audit had no effect on the other three charges pose the only issue of general importance in this case.
does not claim that is responsible for her termination this occurred as a result of actions taken by gladys rivera and after left the department at the end of.instead,the three incidents involve reassignments of duties and of personnel to different offices.none of these changes resulted in discharge or reduction in salary.two of them,perhaps all three depending on what duties retained,are commonplace personnel decisions likely to be shielded by qualified immunity if objective reasonableness overcomes imputed motive.
this is the rub.and seizure is the best supreme court has said that private motive is irrelevant if the defendant had objective probable cause or,for qualified immunity purposes,a reasonable officer might have so believed,even if wrongly.harlow fitzgerald,d.by contrast,in cases involving first amendment rights,some of our decisions have left open the possibility that an objectively reasonable action could still be denied qualified immunity if improperly motivated.see mihos swift,cir tang rhode island,cir 
in all events,even if the existence of a political motivation underlying an objectively reasonable employment decision were enough to preclude qualified immunity,must make a threshold showing that she was adversely affected by these personnel decisions,at.employment actions short of outright dismissal or demotion are redressable if improperly motivated,rutan republican party of,d,but only if the employment action resulted in conditions unreasonably inferior to the norm for that position,cir en banc 
the personnel decisions of which complains do not rise to this level.gonzalez once had an altercation with allegedly gonzalez had thrown food at when the la
