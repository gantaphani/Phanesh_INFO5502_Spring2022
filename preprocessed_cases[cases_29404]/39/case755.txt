the contract 
the department and kern entered into a contract for hospital inpatient services contract.amendment to the contract,effective february,provided that the department would pay kern the rate per patient per day of for inpatient services provided to beneficiaries.as an exception,amendment provided that f or inpatient neonatal intensive care services provided to beneficiaries in kern licensed neonatal intensive care unit and billed under universal billing code,the department would pay the rate per patient per day of.amendment was in effect until it was supplanted by amendment in.
the contract provided that it shall be governed and construed in accordance with part,division of the welfare and institutions code divisions and of title of the california administrative code all other applicable state laws and regulations titles and of the code of federal regulations and all other applicable federal laws and regulations.
the audit adjustments 
on april,the department issued an audit of kern cost report.the department concluded that kern had been overpaid during three fiscal years for service provided in the neonatal intensive care unit because it did not meet the staffing requirements in title california code of regulations,section d a ratio of one registered nurse to two or fewer intensive care infants shall be maintained.
the administrative appeal 
kern requested a formal hearing with respect to the department audit adjustments.
at the hearing,byron chell chell testified.before he retired,he worked as general counsel and then executive director for the california medical assistance commission commission.the commission negotiated contracts with hospitals that provided inpatient services to medical beneficiaries.when he negotiated and recommended amendment,he had no concern for the nurse staffing ratio.in his view,the commission intended that the rate in amendment would apply to inpatient neonatal intensive care services regardless of the nurse to patient staffing ratios.
the administrative law judge issued a proposed decision denying the appeal.in its summary,the proposed decision stated that where a contract allows a higher rate of reimbursements for inpatient services provided in the neonatal intensive care unit,that rate is payable only for those infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit that receive services based upon a ratio of one registered nurse to two or fewer infants.to support this conclusion,the administrative law judge cited the california code of regulations and sierra vista.
regarding the calculation of nurse staffing ratios,the proposed decision stated the department audit adjustments were based upon a review of kern staffing assignment sheets.the department excluded the charge nurse and charge nurse from the registered nurse count unless these nurses had one or two patients specifically assigned to their care on those assignments.even though the assignment sheets did not often reflect the specific patient assignments for the charge nurse charge nurse,it proffered the testimony of a charge nurse to establish that,regardless of those sheets,she spent most of her time providing direct patient care to patients in the neonatal intensive care unit.the testimony did not bear this out.between to percent of her time was not even spent in the neonatal intensive care unit,but,rather,in the labor and delivery room assisting in the delivery of babies.of the remainder of her shift when she was actually in the neonatal intensive care unit her duties were split between providing administrative and supervisory functions and providing direct patient care.in determining the extent of that direct patient care,the department reasonably relied on the assignment sheets.they were made at or near the time that the services were provided,and reflect the best evidence as to whom the services were provided.in those instances that clearly established that the charge nurse or charge nurse was directly assigned to a patient care,kern received the proper reimbursement.
the department adopted the proposed decision.
trial court proceedings 
kern filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the department audit adjustments.the petition alleged kern operates a neonatal intensive care unit which provides the high level of care needed by seriously ill newborns.the newborns treated in the neonatal intensive care unit have medical conditions that mandate their placement there,and none of these patients can or should be treated outside of the neonatal intensive care unit,such as in kern normal newborn nursery.for years,the department paid the kern at the rate of per day for all neonatal intensive care unit services without any reference to nurse staffing ratios.the audit report issued on april,contained adjustments for fiscal years ending june,june,and june.for a substantial number of days,the department reduced the payment rate from the neonatal intensive care unit rate of per day to the general inpatient rate of per day.the department based its audit adjustments on the conclusion that kern was not entitled to per patient day unless it had or nurse to patient ratio.kern alleged that the department misinterpreted the contract as requiring specific staffing.alternatively,it alleged that the department failed to include the time worked by the charge nurses and charge nurses when calculating the nurse staffing ratios.
the trial court denied the petition.following sierra vista,it confirmed the department interpretation of the contract.regarding staffing ratios,the trial court stated the contract requires kern to maintain records of all direct and indirect costs for audit it can not rely on unauditable and unverifiable charging nurse testimony to support its position.
judgment was entered in favor of the department.
this timely appeal followed.

discussion 
i.the department properly interpreted the contract.
the primary issue in this appeal is whether kern was entitled to payment at the neonatal intensive care unit rate for services provided with a nurse staffing ratio greater than or.based on sierra vista,the answer is no.sierra vista is from another district,so we are not bound by it.but we generally follow the decisions of other appellate courts unless there is good reason to disagree.fire ins.exchange abbott d.as we discuss below,we have no reason to depart from precedent.
the hospital in sierra vista provided four levels of care in its neonatal intensive care unit.under the hospital policies and procedures,the nursing ratios were level ratio level ratio level ratio level ratio.the auditor concluded that levels one and two were subintensive care units that were part of ro
