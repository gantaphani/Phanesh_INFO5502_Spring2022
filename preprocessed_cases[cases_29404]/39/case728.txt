background 
we obtain the background facts from the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.navellier sletten cal th.
the present action arises from appellants approval of a city contract granting arakelian enterprises,dba athens services athens an exclusive right to provide commercial waste hauling services in montebello.athens is a waste collection and recycling service that has had an exclusive contract to provide residential waste hauling services in montebello since.
sometime in,while running for city council,urteaga approached athens and suggested it submit a proposal to the city council to become the exclusive commercial and industrial waste hauling service in montebello,in addition to being the city exclusive residential waste hauling service.athens later contributed to urteaga campaign,and he was elected to the city council.
in,torres,the city administrator,worked with athens to negotiate the terms of an exclusive contract,under which athens would provide improved residential trash hauling services at no increased price and also become the exclusive commercial and industrial waste hauling service beginning in.in exchange for this exclusivity,athens agreed to make a cash payment to the city.
athens then submitted a proposal to the city council to become the exclusive provider of commercial waste hauling services,and requested approval of the negotiated contract.on july,the city held a public hearing at a city council meeting regarding the city waste collection services.at the hearing,a number of speakers opposed athens proposal.
athens proposal was again addressed at a city council meeting on july.more than twenty people spoke in opposition to the exclusive contract during four hours of discussion.vasquez and urteaga then moved to approve the contract,and it was approved by a vote,with vasquez,urteaga,and salazar in favor of the contract and the mayor and another council member against it.
once approved,the contract required the mayor signature to effectuate it.the mayor,however,refused to sign the contract for over six weeks,stating he was attempting to verify its terms and ascertain the legal effect of a pending referendum effort by independent waste haulers in opposition to the athens contract.on september,the contract was still awaiting the mayor signature.vasquez then signed the contract as montebello mayor pro,stating she was authorized to do so because the mayor refusal to execute the contract rendered him absent for purposes of the agreement.
vasquez ran for reelection in november and athens contributed to her campaign.she was not reelected.athens also contributed to efforts to defeat the mayor reelection campaign,but the mayor was reelected.after the november election,city voters qualified a special election to recall urteaga and salazar.athens sponsored a say no to recall campaign to which it contributed.the campaign was unsuccessful,and both urteaga and salazar were recalled.during the same election cycle,athens contributed no more than to any city council campaign in any other city.
the city lawsuit against appellants 
on july,the city sued appellants,alleging they had violated government code section,which prohibits city officers from being financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity,or by any body or board of which they are members.the city alleged vasquez voted to approve the athens contract with the expectation that athens would financially support her reelection campaign,and urteaga and salazar voted to approve it with the expectation that athens would financially support their future campaigns.the city sought a judgment declaring the contract void because at least one official or employee of the city was financially interested in it.the city also sought an order requiring any appellants found to be financially interested in the athens contract to disgorge to the city any money they received from athens.athens successfully intervened in the litigation.
the anti slapp motion 
on september,appellants filed an motion to strike the city complaint on the grounds that appellants legislative actions were protected activity and the city could not establish a probability of prevailing on the merits.in support of their motion,appellants declared they had no financial interest in the athens contract.vasquez,urteaga,and salazar each declared they voted for the contract because they thought it best for the city of montebello,its residents,and its businesses,not because they anticipated athens would financially support their future election campaigns.athens executive vice president declared athens made no promise to contribute to any city council members in exchange for their votes.
in opposition to appellants motion,the city argued the lawsuit was exempt from the statute pursuant to section,subdivision d,which states the provisions do not apply to any enforcement action brought in the name of the people of the state of california by the attorney general,district attorney,or city attorney,acting as a public prosecutor.alternatively,the city argued appellants act of voting was not protected activity within the meaning of section.
the trial court found the public enforcement exemption under section,subdivision d did not apply.the court then determined appellants legislative actions and votes qualified as protected activity,but found the city established a probability of prevailing on the merits because the evidence that athens had contributed to some of appellants campaigns substantiated the city claim that appellants violated government code section.the court denied the motion,and appellants timely appealed.
