the oscar renda contracting,and john beck,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment against their claims against the city of lubbock,texas.renda claims that lubbock violated its constitutional right of free speech in denying it a construction contract renda joins the claim of beck,a lubbock taxpayer,that lubbock failure to award the contract to renda unlawfully deprived taxpayers of the benefit of renda lower bid in violation of the texas local government code.
the south lubbock drainage main trunk line involved the installation of approximately ten miles of pipe at depths of up to feet,improving the city storm water drainage.the lubbock city council considered it a high profile project,requiring attention to safety as well as adroit coordination of construction activities with environmental and regulatory authorities,affected landowners,and the public.the council set a budget and solicited bids from contractors pursuant to texas law.under this law,the council was obliged to select a winning bid from the lowest responsible bidder or the bidder who provides goods or services at the best value for the municipality,basing the assessment on enumerated factors,including price,reputation,and quality 
renda is a contractor based in roanoke,texas.its bid on the south lubbock drainage improvement project of million undercut the next lowest contractor,utility contractors of america,by million.
in order to determine whether lubbock should accept renda offer,lubbock city utility engineer marsha reed began an investigation into renda,using information provided in its bid form as well as public records.she made inquiry with organizations that had dealt with renda.they offered mixed reports on renda performance.an august,memorandum to lubbock mayor and city council discussed the issue and summarized the information she had received about renda and the bidder,utility contractors of america.utility contractors fared much better in every category of concern that the inquiry forms addressed.among other problems with renda history,reed specifically cited a contract dispute in arlington,texas,resulting in a lawsuit initiated by renda,and an action brought by the occupational safety and health administration against renda for alleged safety violations.her memo mentioned no other litigation.she emphasized serious safety and environmental concerns and public relations concerns,noting that there will be city employees down in these trenches and in the pipe not to mention the amount of public contact involved with this project.by contrast,she pointed out that her research into utility contractors found a much better track record in working with the public and there were no safety or environmental issues cites by any of their references.
in a chart attached to her report,out of a total of boxes with responses concerning renda,many of them tepid at best,only one box referenced the lawsuit against the el paso municipal utility district that renda now argues was the grounds for lubbock unconstitutional retaliation against it.reporting information apparently from el paso officials,the box indicates that renda was v ery lawsuit water district for mill on a mill project.another box reports from a different renda customer has both positives and negatives about them.owner has been threatened with lawsuits several times during job when things did not go their way.two other boxes,neither apparently reporting el paso feedback,answer the questions were there any claims were they justified with differing conditions claim,and.only one out of four boxes with answer to these questions said no.by contrast,all four of utility contractors respondents answered no to this query about litigiousness and construction as noted,this was only one of many areas of information sought about the project bidders,and only one area of concern about renda that would naturally arise from a perusal of the feedback chart.
a memo from reed reiterates safety and environmental concerns as well as community concerns over traffic control and access.the memo recounts a september,meeting in which renda sought to reassure the city as to some of the safety concerns,but the memo notes that lubbock research suggested that renda was not completely honest with us in our meeting when specifically asked about th e issue of whether it bore some responsibility for fines issued by the texas commission on environmental quality on a project.ultimately,reed concludes that while she still has reservations,her final recommendation is that renda should be awarded the contract.she conditions this finding on renda executing an affidavit affirming its understanding of a number of the contractual terms and lubbock expectations.the affidavit emphasizes the contingencies for cost overruns,the necessity of safety and regulatory compliance,and renda performance of due diligence in preparing the project.
despite the recommendation and the affidavit,the city council decided at its september meeting to award the contract to utility contractors instead of renda,by a narrow majority.discussion focused on reputation,safety,and reliability concerns and on whether doubts about renda could justify spending over million more on the project.although not discussed in any detail,renda possible litigiousness came up as well with the council focused on the fact that it was already having to contend with a million contract dispute on an unrelated project 
one month later,renda was back before the council,attempting to convince it to change its mind.its effort did not take a form likely to persuade that it was not litigious.rather the opposite,as renda made it a point to lift up the el paso suit in a thinly disguised effort to infect the award decision.in the hearing,renda representatives,including its lawyer terry salazar,attacked the council decision not to award the job to renda and attempted to plant public seeds to aid a retaliation claim.a representative of renda announced 
i want to just make sure this goes on the record,that we know the decision that was made by the majority was against the law.we know,we been told and informed by the city staff,that the motivating factor was this lawsuit out in el paso but we gave you a copy of that.so you know that your motivating factor was a lawsuit that they filed to address a violation of their first amendment sic.you ca use that to hold against them,and yet you do.
this was the first mention of the el paso suit in the council proceedings and came after the council had awarded the contract to renda competitor.the representative went on to warn the council that its actions would end up costing lubbock five million dollars,apparently suggesting that this would be the sum of the litigation costs and damages that would be owed renda.councilmember martin countered the renda version of events by reasserting that the decision was lawful and emerged from an informed view that renda is not a responsible bidder.he cited much of the material discussed above and offered no comment on trusevich accusations regarding the el paso litigation.the council affirmed its initial vote.
less than a month later,renda brought suit against lubbock and its officials in state court,but when that court refused to grant a temporary restraining order,it nonsuited that action and filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of texas,alleging constitutional and state statutory violations and seeking damages and attorney fees in addition to declaratory and injunctive relief.
after the district judge dismissed the federal law matters for failure to state a claim and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the texas claims,this court reversed and remanded,holding that renda had stated a first amendment claim back before the district court,lubbock sought summary judgment,which the district court granted on april.renda timely appealed.
renda argues that lubbock retaliated against it because of its previous litigation against the el paso county lower valley water district it characterizes this litigation as constitutionally protected speech on matters of public concern.the el paso dispute i
