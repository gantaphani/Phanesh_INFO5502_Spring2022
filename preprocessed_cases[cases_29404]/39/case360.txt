the treasury department bureau of engraving and printing retained aspen personnel services,to provide tour services at the bureau.in july aspen hired trayon redd as a tour guide.in march aspen removed redd from her job at the bureau.when redd complained to aspen about her dismissal,aspen rehired redd and attempted to reinstate her at the bureau.the bureau refused.
redd,who is tall and weighs about pounds,perceived the bureau behavior in these affairs as a response to her weight.so far as appears,redd weight did not change between her hiring in and her dismissal in.she has brought claims against the bureau under and of the rehabilitation act of rha.section provides for interagency coordination relating to federal employment of persons with disabilities,and although it does not explicitly either prohibit federal government disability discrimination in employment,or authorize prohibitory regulations,it is understood to support the equal opportunity employment commission adoption of regulations that do so.see b.these regulations alone established the law on disability discrimination in federal government employment until an rha amendment in allowed private litigants to enforce rights under in suits employing the remedies,procedures,and rights set forth in the civil rights act of.a.in congress again amended the rha to provide that the standards used to judge nonaffirmative action employment discrimination under shall be the standards applied under the americans with disabilities act of,et and and.g.see generally barth gelb.section of the rha addresses federal disability discrimination in a different administration of a federal program or activity.a.redd brought claims against the bureau under both provisions,claiming for purposes of that it was in truth her employer.her claims against aspen under the human rights act are not before us,as she has not appealed the district court grant of summary judgment on those claims.
the bureau sought and the district court granted summary judgment on all counts.because redd was never an employee of the bureau,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on redd claims.as to the claims,we reverse and remand the case,as the district court rejection of redd claims was based on a misunderstanding of the relation between and.
under the contract between aspen and the bureau,aspen was responsible for training all tour guides,paying guides wages and providing benefits,including annual leave.aspen and the bureau each had a representative to handle their the bureau case a liaison officer,the contracting officer technical representative,and in aspen an supervisor for its workers,the lead tour guide.the technical representative and her supervisor at the bureau had the right to reject any tour guide,but aspen did all the hiring and firing.the bureau appointed antoinette banks as technical representative,and aspen appointed henrietta walls as the lead tour guide.
redd complaint against the bureau stems from five episodes involving banks and redd between june and march.first,redd alleges that on the occasion of her hiring banks told redd and her mother that the tour guide job required a lot of walking in the sun,drinking water and limiting one consumption of milk.redd regards these remarks as aspersions on her ability to guide tours.second,redd finds another aspersion in banks remark to redd mother,in december,that with all the walking the tour work required redd would surely lose some weight.
third,redd says that on march,banks and walls said that redd tour spiel was deficient and temporarily suspended her from guiding tours.in the next few days walls and banks tested the guides on their spiels and criticized redd for her pronunciation on march,banks accompanied redd on a tour and evaluated her performance.redd evidently sees the scrutiny as derived from banks perception of her obesity.
fourth,redd alleges that in a phone conversation on march,redd mother asked banks if the latter concerns with redd performance were related to banks comments in june referring to walking in the sun,and drinking water but not much milk,which redd perceived as relating to obesity.in the phone call redd mother told banks that women are not unable to perform the job of a tour guide.redd alleges that later that day,after a conversation with banks,walls told redd that her evaluation was and that she would be terminated.redd view is that banks opposition was behind the termination,and was driven by obesity concerns a desire to retaliate for redd mother remarks.
finally,redd wrote to aspen on april,complaining at length about what she saw as her mistreatment by aspen and the bureau.aspen rehired her on june,but the bureau refused to allow her reinstatement as a bureau guide.redd alleges that banks superior,teresa brooks,who had the authority to reject redd,made her decision solely on the advice of banks.again,redd infers that banks alleged advice was obesity motivated and retaliatory both for the mother remarks about women and for the protests in the april letter.
aspen suggested that redd fill out applications for jobs on other aspen contracts,but she did do so and was terminated by aspen in july.
the parties agree that applies only to disability discrimination in federal government employment,while addresses discrimination in any program or activity conducted by any executive agency.a.as redd was undoubtedly an employee of aspen,she seeks to bring herself within on the theory that treasury and aspen are her joint employers.she treasury we should apply the test stated in spirides reinhardt,a case considering whether the plaintiff was an employee or an independent contractor.
despite the parties agreement,we doubt whether the spirides test is suited to this case.where the plaintiff is herself either an employee of only one employer or an independent contractor,see id.at,classification as the latter leaves her with no protection against employment discrimination.but redd,even if not an employee of the bureau,clearly enjoyed protection against employment discrimination by aspen,which was indisputably her employer.here,of course,redd claims against aspen lost,in part on statute of limitations grounds,in part on the merits.but her classification as aspen employee leaves no suggestion of a gap in the congressionally intended protection against employment discrimination.
this court has never invoked spirides to resolve an issue of joint employment,although the fifth circuit has done so,see fields hallsville independent school district,cir.for a joint employment test,a fairly standard formulation is that of the third circuit,namely,whether one employer,while contracting in good faith with an otherwise independent company,has retained for itself sufficient control of the terms and conditions of employment of the employees who are employed by the other employer.nlrb industries of pennsylvania,cir.because the parties have not argued the issue we will not try to resolve which test is applicable or indeed whether there is a material difference between the two,but simply note the possibility of arguments on the point.
accepting the parties assumptions arguendo,we proceed to apply spirides.the decision identifies one putative employer right to control the means and manner of the worker performance as central to classification as an employee or independent contractor.at.elaborating,it observes that if the putative employer has the right to control and direct the work of an individual,not only as to the result to be achieved,but also as to the details by which that result is achieved,an relationship is likely to exist.id.at.it then proceeds to list eleven a dditional matters of fact that may be relevant.id.at.while the eleven factors should ideally be used to address the question of both control and the eleven factors being evaluated consider the two in succession.
we take the control test first.in the nine months redd worked at the bureau,there was only one short period in which banks involved herself in the means and manner of redd tour presentation.that involvement occurred just nine days before redd termination.on march,banks and walls met with r
