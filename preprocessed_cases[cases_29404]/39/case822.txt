these consolidated appeals arise from plaintiffs and respondents jacquelyn giles,ardelia mcclure,amelia rivera,mary harrigan,maria franco and sara sandez collectively plaintiffs suit against defendants and appellants bill horn,greg cox,dianne jacob,pam slater and ron roberts,in their collective official capacity as the san diego county board of supervisors,and against the san diego county welfare director and robert ross,in his official capacity as director of the san diego county health and human services agency collectively defendants,alleging that defendants hiring of private contractors to provide certain services under san diego county implementation of california program,known as calworks,violated both the san diego county charter county charter and state law.the court agreed,ordering the agreements entered into between san diego county the county and the private contractors terminated because the county did not make a finding that the contractors would provide services more economically and efficiently than county civil service employees as required by the county charter and welfare and institutions code section forbids the county from contracting out to private contractors case management services under the calworks program.
defendants contend that the court erred in terminating the contracts because the issue of whether a finding of efficiency and economy is required prior to contracting with employees is now moot because the pertinent contracts have been performed and have expired,and the county made efficiency and economy findings before entering into new contracts with the private contractors.defendants also assert that they were not required to make an economy and efficiency finding here because the county was hiring individuals to perform services not already performed by civil service employees time was of the essence and independent contractors could provide the services more swiftly and the county charter only required economy and efficiency determinations where the services could be performed by existing civil service personnel.defendants also contend that the county has authority under both state and federal law to contract out welfare services to private contractors.
we conclude that the county was required,pursuant to the county charter,to make a determination that it was more economical and efficient to contract out case management services under the calworks program to private contractors than to have those services performed by county civil service personnel prior to entering into such contracts.however,we reverse as moot the court ruling that the county violated applicable county charter provisions in failing to make such a determination,as the relevant contracts have been performed and have expired.we therefore order the court to dismiss that claim.further,we remand the action for a determination of plaintiffs claim that the county contracts with private contractors are in fact not more economical and efficient than having those functions performed by civil service personnel.the present contracts expired on june,and the county is in the process of making or has already made an economy and efficiency determination for contracts with private contractors following that date.therefore,if the county relies upon the determinations made for the expired contracts in finding any new contracts beginning after june,are more economical and efficient,then plaintiffs may challenge those original findings.however,if new findings of economy and efficiency are or have been performed for contracts after june,plaintiffs challenge in this litigation would have to be as to the new findings as,since the current contracts have expired,any challenge to the original findings will be moot.we also reverse the court ruling that the contracts violated state and federal law and reverse the court award of attorney fees to plaintiffs.
factual and procedural background 
federal welfare reform 
in,the federal government enacted what is known as the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of prwora,united states code section et,which authorized funding to states for programs.prwora replaced two federally funded welfare programs,aid to families with dependent children afdc,which provided monetary assistance to eligible families,and job opportunity and basic skills jobs,which provided employment assistance to adults in families that were receiving afdc benefits.in california,the jobs program was known as gain.
california implementation of prwora 
in,the california legislature implemented prwora by amending section et and replacing california afdc and gain programs with the california work opportunity and responsibility to kids act calworks.calworks consists of two welfare services cash aid to parents and children and the program,which seeks to end families dependence on welfare.
the calworks program took effect on january.participants in the program were to be enrolled beginning in april,with all eligible participants required to be enrolled by december of that year.if a county failed to meet these deadlines,it faced financial penalties and program participants could be penalized because they were to receive only to months of services regardless of whether such services were available.
regarding the contracting out of functions under calworks,section provides 
a public agency shall,in implementing programs affected by the act adding this section to the welfare and institutions code,perform all program functions exclusively through the use of merit civil service employees of the public agency,except to the extent permitted by provisions of state and federal law governing the affected program that were in effect on august.italics added.
c.the county implementation of calworks 
anticipating california pending adoption of the calworks program,in june the county sought community input on maximizing the county capacity to serve calworks recipients through a combination of county staff and community based organizations.by december,county staff developed a calworks plan,which divided case management functions for calworks participants into six geographical regions within the county.further,the county plan provided for contracting out calworks case management services in four of the six regions to private contractors 
to maximize competition,privatization and creativity in an incentivised system,the county will procure case management services for four of the six regions with the goal of selecting up to two regional contractors from private for profit agencies and up to two regional contractors from nonprofit agencies.county staff will be responsible for case management in the two remaining regions.
the county contends that it decided to contract out a portion of the case management function of calworks to private contractors because calworks increased both the number of participants and functions of case workers the county would need to hire up to new case workers and acquire additional facilities and equipment and due to the time limitations of the benefits under the program,the caseloads would decrease significantly after the first two years,leaving a surplus of civil service workers if the functions were performed by county employees.the county believed that private contractors would be able to hire employees and procure facilities and equipment more quickly than the county,and thus comply with the deadlines of calworks and avoid any delay in implementing calworks services.
in february,the county chief administrative officer cao sent a letter to the board of supervisors,requesting approval for the issuance of requests for proposals rfp.the letter stated the requirements of calworks were expected to increase the number of county welfare recipients who must engage in work activities from approximately to individuals.the letter also stated that any selection would depend upon a finding of economy and efficiency per board policy a.the board of supervisors approved the issuance of the rfp on the same day.the purchasing and contracting director was authorized to issue the rfp and negotiate and award contracts for these services subject to the cao making a determination of economy and efficiency.in march,the county issued an addendum to the rfp,stating that i n accordance with county of san diego charter section,award of contracts shall be subject to the cao determination regarding economy and efficiency.
county charter,article ix,section county charter section,as amended in,and as it reads today,provides 
section independent contractors.nothing in this article governing civil service employees prevents the county from employing an independent contractor when the board or purchasing agent determines that services can be provided more economically and efficiently by an independent contractor than by persons employed in the classified service.italics added.
county charter,article vii,section county charter section states 
in cases where the county intends to employ an independent contractor,the cao shall first determine that the services can be provided more economically and efficiently by an independent contractor than by persons employed in the classified service.italics added.
county board of supervisors policy no.a board policy a provides for the procedure in making an economy and efficiency determination.however,board policy a also provides certain exceptions to the requirements of county charter sections and that an economy and efficiency determination be performed before the county contracts with private contractors 
service contracts that meet one or more criteria need not be reviewed by the cao for a determination regarding economy and efficiency.the department request to contract,however,will include justification for requesting an exception under the criteria.the justification shall be reviewed for sufficiency by the cao prior to submitting the request to contract to the board of supervisors or the director,purchasing and contracting for action.the criteria are.the service is of a highly specialized or technical nature and is intermittent or irregular.the service is so urgent,temporary,special and highly technical that the work could not be properly performed by civil service employees.the work is of a character that it is impossible to have it performed by civil service employees.the service depends in part on the use of equipment and material not possessed by the county at the time and place required and the cost to the county of procuring such equipment and material would be disproportionate for the result obtained.the entire service will be funded by a state or federal funding source that requires the county to contract out for the service.this includes renewals and extensions of such contracts.
in june,the director of the county health and human services agency wrote the cao that county counsel has analyzed the services to be provided and concluded that these services fall within the parameters of one or more exceptions specified in board policy a.therefore,it is not necessary for you to make a determination of economy and efficiency prior to contracts being awarded.in june,the cao wrote the board of supervisors,stating 
contract awards were to be subject to a finding by me of economy and efficiency in accordance with board policy a county counsel has analyzed the services to be provided and concluded that they fall within one or more of the exceptions specified in board policy a.therefore,it is not necessary for me to make a determination of economy and efficiency.
nowhere in the record is there any indication as to what exception or exceptions under board policy a county counsel believed applied to relieve the county from making an economy and efficiency determination before contracting out calworks case management functions to private entities.it also is undisputed that prior to contracts being signed with private contractors to perform case management functions under the calworks project,no economy and efficiency determination was made by the cao pursuant to county charter sections and.
in june and july,the county entered into contracts with three entities,maximus,lockheed martin and catholic charities,for provision of case management functions in four of six administrative regions in san diego.the remaining two administrative regions were to be served by civil service employees of the county.
nature of calworks functions administered by private contractors 
calworks replaced the gain program,where county civil service employees in the health and human services agency provided work services for welfare recipients.however,no civil service employees were terminated or laid off as a result of the private calworks contracts.rather,persons previously filling the positions for the county under the gain program were either employed by the private contractors or transferred to other county positions.
the calworks program also increased the scope of services for the program from that previously provided by the county under gain and mandated several services not previously provided.case management workers are required to increase their monitoring of participants attendance in the program and record that attendance as well.caseworkers also provide services beyond those previously provided by the county under the gain program,including postemployment services.
in providing case management services for participants under calworks,private contractors are not authorized to make policy or program decisions.county civil service employees make the initial determination of eligibility for applicants for benefits under calworks.the private contractors are not authorized to impose sanctions for violations of calworks rules.rather,only county civil service employees impose sanctions.pursuant to the contracts with the private contractors the case management functions are described as 
t he coordination of services and activities,beginning with job search,and including but not limited to assessing the participant employability and need for support services developing the plan with the participant tracking and evaluating the participant attendance and progress in work activities identifying and authorizing supportive services making a determination of cause for failure to participate referring the participant to community resources for work activities,counseling and assisting in accessing community resources and resolving problems documenting in the physical and electronic case file,and completing other required documents.
the private contractors conduct the appraisal and assessment of the recipient.the assessment includes the development and execution of the plan between the county and the welfare recipient.
the private contractors also determine what,if any,supportive services are needed by the calworks participant.supportive services may include child care,transportation,and ancillary expenses.private contractors are required to assess social,economic and employment situations,and must have the ability to apply judgment in determining appropriate activities and services for the participant to become.the private contractors make good cause recommendations,such as whether there is good cause for a participant failure to comply with the requirements of participation.the private contractors develop compliance plans with individual participants.
the county mandates that the contractors use the calworks program guide developed by the county,which provides uniform instructions to all case managers to ensure consistent application and administration of the calworks program.under their contracts,the private contractors must comply with the criteria for case management set forth in the program guide.
approval of calworks plan by state 
the county submitted its implementation plan for the calworks program to the california department of social services dss in january.the plan set forth the county intention to contract with private entities to provide case management services in four of the six administrative regions of the county.in february,the dss approved the county plan.
f.this action 
in august,plaintiffs brought this action to enjoin expenditure of public funds to provide calworks case management services through private contractors.the first cause of action sought a declaration that the expenditure of funds was illegal because no economy and efficiency determination was made and because civil service employees could adequately,competently and more efficiently perform the services.the first cause of action further sought a declaration that expenditure of public funds was illegal because the service can not be provided more economically and efficiently by the contractors than persons employed in the classified service.the second cause of action sought a declaration that the county delegation of certain discretionary functions under the calworks program to private contractors was illegal under state and federal law.plaintiffs thereafter filed an amended complaint that added third and fourth causes of action for writ of mandate to stop the alleged violations of law identified in the first two causes of action.
the action proceeded to a bench trial in june.the court heard testimony,received exhibits and received a lengthy stipulation of facts entered into between the parties.in july,the court issued a tentative statement of decision,which it subsequently revised.
in its tentative statement of decision,the court considered the county charter provisions requiring a finding of economy and efficiency before hiring independent contractors.the court first found that board policy a,purporting to create exceptions to the required economy and efficiency requirements,was an unlawful attempt to modify or amend the county charter,as such action could only be taken through a vote of the electorate.the court also found that there was no basis in law to create an exception to the required economy and efficiency determination based upon an emergency or specialized task to be performed.the court also found that,assuming board policy a was proper,the facts of this case did not meet any of the listed exceptions contained therein.the court also found that there was no exception to county charter sections and based upon the fact that new services were being provided.the court further found that the case management functions under calworks were not new services,but that they only required more tracking and postemployment job retention services than under the gain program.the court also noted that while under the common law such an exception might exist for new services if no civil service employees were displaced,civil service employees were displaced because they were moved to other positions within and outside of the county.
the court found that contracting out case management functions to contractors violated the terms of section because the contracting out of such functions was barred by both california and federal law as it existed in.in making this finding the court relied upon a dss letter sent to counties that described what functions could be contracted out under the prior gain program.the court also relied upon federal regulations in place in that described what program functions could be contracted out.
after receiving objections from counsel,the court confirmed its statement of decision.the court set oral argument for september.following oral argument the court found the contracts to be unlawful and issued a writ of mandate terminating the contracts entered into with the private contractors and permanently enjoined the county from expending further public funds on contracts with private contractors for the provision of case management services under the calworks program.however,the court stayed enforcement of its order and resulting judgment pending the appeal of this matter.
subsequent to the judgment being entered,plaintiffs brought a motion for attorney fees,arguing that they were entitled to an award of fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section because the judgment they obtained enforced an important right affecting the public interest,conferred a substantial benefit on the public,and the necessity and financial burden of the litigation made an award of fees appropriate in march the court granted plaintiffs motion,awarding attorney fees in the amount of.
matters occurring postjudgment 
following the court entry of judgment and the filing of this appeal,defendants filed a motion requesting judicial notice of certain facts with this court.in the motion,the defendants requested that this court take judicial notice of the fact that in december,when the county extended its contracts with maximus,lockheed martin and catholic charities,the cao for the county made a finding that contracting out the case management functions for the calworks project to those entities was more economical and efficient than to have those services provided by civil service employees.defendants further sought judicial notice of the fact that in,the san diego county taxpayers association awarded the county health and human services agency the golden watchdog award for its calworks program.in support of the request that this court take judicial notice of the december economy and efficiency determinations,defendants attached the cao findings of economy and efficiency as to the extension of the county contracts with maximus,lockheed martin and catholic charities.
plaintiffs did not oppose defendants request for judicial notice.in september,we granted defendants request for judicial notice.

standard of review 
because the pertinent facts are not in dispute,and we are applying these facts to statutory and local charter provisions,we review the court legal findings that the county contracts with independent contractors to provide case management functions under the calworks program violated the county charter and state and federal law under the independent de novo standard of review.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.under this standard,we are not bound by the findings of the trial court and review the facts and law anew.ibid.

iii.alleged violation of county charter sections and 
defendants first contend that the court erred in finding that the county violated the terms of county charter sections and by failing to perform a determination that the contracts it entered into with private contractors for the provision of case management services under the calworks program were more economical and efficient than having county civil service personnel perform those same functions.specifically,defendants assert that they were not required to make an economy and efficiency finding here because the county was hiring individuals to perform services not already performed by civil service employees time was of the essence and independent contractors could provide the services more swiftly and the county charter only required economy and efficiency determinations where the services could be performed by existing civil service personnel 
we conclude that the court did not err in finding that the county violated county charter sections and.however,because the contracts sued upon have been fulfilled and have expired,plaintiffs claim that the county violated county charter provisions has been rendered moot.accordingly,we reverse the judgment on plaintiffs claim alleging a violation of county charter provisions and order the court,on remand,to dismiss that claim as moot.however,because plaintiffs have also pleaded a claim that the contracting out of case management functions is not in fact more economical and efficient than if those services were performed by civil service personnel,we remand this matter to allow that claim to proceed to a determination,as detailed,post.
applicable charter provisions 
as detailed above,section of the county charter provides that where the county intends to employ an independent contractor,the cao shall first determine that the services can be provided more economically and efficiently by an independent contractor than by persons employed in the classified service.san diego county charter,italics added.however,it is undisputed that the county did not make such a determination before it entered into contracts with the independent contractors to perform case management functions under the calworks program.by the clear and unambiguous language of the applicable charter provisions,unless some exception applies,the county violated county charter sections and when it entered into those contracts by neglecting to first determine that the functions to be performed could be done more economically and efficiently than by civil service personnel.we address in order the county assertions that exceptions applied to relieve them of that duty.
exception for services not previously provided by the county 
defendants first assert that the county did not need to perform the economy and efficiency determination because the calworks program required the provision of services not previously performed by civil service personnel.in support of this contention they rely primarily upon the decision in california state employees williams d.williams.in williams,the court of appeal noted the longstanding rule that the state civil service system did not prohibit the contracting out of services that can not be performed adequately or competently or satisfactorily by civil service personnel.id.at.the issue there was whether the state could hire an independent contractor to perform administrative tasks for the medi cal program,rather than hire additional civil service employees to perform those tasks.id.at.the court concluded that the state constitutional policy protecting the civil service system only applies to existing civil service personnel,not to a situation where the state is delivering a new service.id.at.
defendants argue that here,as in williams,the county was not subject to the requirements of hiring civil service personnel because the calworks program required expanded and new services never provided by the county in the past.however,defendants ignore one fundamental difference between the situation presented here and that in williams.the court in williams was not presented with a specific charter provision that required certain findings to be made before services were contracted out to private contractors.local charter provisions supersede conflicting state law as to matters that are within county operation.dibb county of san diego cal th,d,dibb p owers and duties legitimately conferred by charter on county officers supersede general law.thus,general state law allowing contracting out of services that can not be performed adequately,competently or satisfactorily by civil service personnel can not supersede the county charter provisions that require,on their face,an economy and efficiency determination anytime the county desires to contract out services that it is charged with providing.if the county wishes to create an exception to this requirement for certain situations,its recourse is to propose a ballot initiative to amend this charter mandate and create exceptions for certain situations.as county charter sections and presently read,however,economy and efficiency determinations must be made anytime the county wishes to employ an independent contractor,as opposed to someone employed within its civil service ranks.there is nothing in their language exempting economy and efficiency determinations where the services are going to be new and different from those previously performed by civil service personnel.
exception for situations where time is of the essence 
defendants next assert that case law provides for an exception to the requirement of hiring civil service personnel where time is of the essence and independent contractors can provide the services more swiftly.see darley ward d.darley people ex rel.of fish game attransco,th,d attransco.however,as with the previous contention,defendants ignore the fact that the county charter economy and efficiency provisions supersede more general state law that allows exceptions to general civil service hiring requirements.dibb,supra,cal th at,d.there is nothing in the county charter that provides for an exception to the economy and efficiency determination where the services need to be provided on a basis.
moreover,the darley and attransco decisions cited by defendants have no application here.in darley,the county had a charter provision that specifically allowed for the contracting out of special services.darley,supra,d at.the court found that the ability to perform the task more swiftly made it a special service within the charter.ibid.here,by contrast,the county charter does not exempt from economy and efficiency determinations those services that could be performed more swiftly by independent contractors.
similarly,in attransco,the particular service to be provided,the hiring of a private attorney to represent the department of fish and game,was allowed under a state statute that permitted such contracting out where the services are of such an urgent,temporary,or occasional nature that the delay incumbent in their implementation under civil service would frustrate their very purpose.attransco,supra,th at,d,quoting,subd.b.here,however,county charter provisions do not provide for an exception to the economy and efficiency determination where time is of the essence.
language and statutory history of the county charter sections 
finally,defendants contend that the language of county charter section and a review of its history demonstrate that it was never intended to apply to situations where the services require hiring personnel in addition to those already employed in the civil service system.specifically,defendants point to the fact that in county charter section the predecessor to county charter section was amended to delete a reference to a required economy and efficiency determination for situations where the person was to be employed in the civil service system.former county charter section,as it read before the amendment,provided that 
nothing in this article shall prevent the county or any officer,board,commission or agency of the county from employing an independent contractor to provide services of a professional,scientific or technical nature where the civil service commission has determined that it is impractical to have such service furnished by a person employed or to be employed in the classified service and the employment of such independent contractor will not require the removal,suspension,layoff or transfer of any employee in the classified service.conc.res,stats.reg.sess.res.ch,italics added.
in,the voters approved an amendment to county charter section that,among other things,eliminated the phrase or to be employed from its language 
nothing in this article shall prevent the county or any officer,board,commission or agency of the county from employing an independent contractor to provide services of a professional,scientific or technical nature to the county where the civil service commission has determined that it is impractical to have such services furnished by a person or persons employed or to be employed in the classified service and the employment of such independent contractor will not require the removal,suspension,layoff or transfer of any employee in the classified service.conc.res,stats.reg.sess.res.ch.
the current version of county charter section and county charter section provides that the county may employ an independent contractor where it is determined that services can be provided more economically and efficiently by an independent contractor than by persons employed in the classified service.italics added.defendants assert that the deletion of the words or to be employed means that the county need not perform an economy and efficiency determination where the services could not be provided by persons already employed in the county civil service system.this contention is unavailing.
first,the language of county charter sections and does not provide that these sections are inapplicable to situations where the county would need to hire additional civil service personnel to perform the particular function.if the authors of the county charter had intended such a result,they would have plainly so stated.rather,a plain reading of county charter sections and reveals that they are intended to apply any time the county is considering hiring an independent contractor,not merely on those occasions where sufficient county employees are already in place to perform the desired function.these sections do not state that they limit the economy and efficiency determination where the services would be performed by individuals already employed in the classified service.rather,a plain reading of the charter provisions indicates that the phrase employed in the classified service merely refers to the class of individuals as to whom the county must determine whether it is economical and efficient to assign certain functions.
further,contrary to defendants assertion,there is nothing in the legislative history of county charter section that supports their interpretation.although defendants point to various amendments to county charter section over the years,they do not rely upon any legislative history for the particular amendment that deleted the phrase or to be employed.that legislative history provides no support for defendants contention.
the ballot pamphlet for the amendment focused upon the deletion of the requirement that only professional,scientific or technical services could be contracted out.ballot,san diego county,analysis of proposition a by county counsel.the only reference to the deletion of the words or to be employed and the other minor changes in the amendment is the phrase minor changes for clarity are also proposed in other parts of section.ibid.thus,the amendment deleting the phrase or to be employed was only to make the text more clear,not to substantially limit the reach of this county charter provision.it is extremely unlikely that such as a major limitation on the required economy and efficiency finding would be added by use of such a phrase and without any discussion in the ballot pamphlet.
defendants also assert that other amendments to county charter section evidence a broadening of the ability to contract out for services that supports their interpretation of county charter sections and.it is true that the circumstances under which the county may contract out for services has been broadened over the years through amendments to county charter section.as mentioned,ante,in the amendment,the limitation on contracting out for services only for professional,scientific or technical positions was eliminated.further,in,former county charter section requirement that it be impractical to have civil service personnel perform the required tasks was deleted and replaced with the present language requiring that an assessment of economy and efficiency be performed.conc.res,stats.reg.sess.res.ch.further,that amendment eliminated the restriction preventing hiring of independent contractors if it would cause the transfer of an existing civil service employee.ibid.in former county charter section was again amended,removing the requirement that contracting out services would not cause the removal,suspension,or layoff of civil service personnel.county charter.in,after section was renumbered section,this charter provision was amended again to eliminate the civil service commission role in making the economy and efficiency determination.under that amendment,it is now the cao responsibility to perform that assessment.county charter.
however,although the situations in which the county could contract out services were expanded,none of the foregoing amendments expressly or impliedly evidenced an intent that the economy and efficiency determination should only be performed where the functions could all be performed by existing civil service personnel.in sum,the language of county charter sections and and the legislative history of county charter section do not support the county claim that it was only required to make a finding of economy and efficiency where the tasks could be completely performed by existing civil service personnel.we thus conclude the court did not err in finding that the county violated the terms of county charter sections and when it originally contracted out case management services for the calworks project.
iv.mootness of charter violation claim 
it is well settled that an appellate court will decide only actual controversies.consistent therewith,it has been said that an action which originally was based upon a justiciable controversy can not be maintained on appeal if the questions raised therein have become moot by subsequent acts or events t he appellate court can not render opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions,or to declare principles or rules of law which can not affect the matter in issue in the case before it.it necessarily follows that when,pending an appeal from the judgment of a lower court,and without any fault of the defendant,an event occurs which renders it impossible for this court,if it should decide the case in favor of plaintiff,to grant him any effectual relief whatever,the court will not proceed to a formal judgment,but will dismiss the appeal.citations.finnie town of tiburon d.finnie.as the court of appeal stated in wilson county civil service com.d,although a case may originally present an existing controversy,if before decision it has,through act of the parties or other cause,occurring after the commencement of the action,lost that essential character,it becomes a moot case or question which will not be considered by the court.
this rule has been regularly employed where injunctive relief is sought and,pending appeal,the act sought to be enjoined has been performed.for example,in finnie,supra,d at page,the plaintiff brought an action seeking an injunction preventing a special election from occurring.the trial court denied the plaintiff application,and the plaintiff appealed.id.at.however,during the pendency of the plaintiff appeal,the election took place.the court of appeal held the plaintiff action was moot and dismissed the appeal.id.at.
similarly,in jennings strathmore public.dist.d,the plaintiff sought to enjoin and declare invalid a public utility district contract after the contract had been let and work was well under way.after the trial court dismissed the action as moot and based upon the plaintiff lack of standing,the plaintiff appealed.by the time the appeal was heard,the work was fully completed.the court of appeal again dismissed the case as moot.id.at.
in childress dinkelspiel,cal,the plaintiff obtained an order enjoining a special meeting to elect an additional corporate director.the appeal was dismissed as moot by virtue of the fact that a subsequent annual board meeting had by then been held,and an entirely new board elected.in hidden harbor amer.fed.of musicians d,an appeal from a preliminary injunction against interference with the plaintiff employment contract was declared moot where the employment agreement was fully performed and had expired.
here it is undisputed that the original contracts,which were the subject of plaintiffs claim that they violated the county charter provisions requiring findings of economy and efficiency,have been fully performed and expired in.the county was given the option to extend the contracts each year for three years thereafter.before the county exercised its option to extend the contracts in,the cao made findings that the calworks case management functions could be performed more economically and efficiently by maximus,lockheed martin and catholic charities than by civil service workers.
thus,plaintiffs claims seeking a writ of mandate and injunction to set aside the contracts and enjoin expenditure of public funds under the contracts are moot to the extent they are based upon a failure by the county to make a finding of economy and efficiency before entering into the original contracts.the contracts have been fully performed and have expired.plaintiffs claim that defendants violated the county charter provisions requiring a finding of economy and efficiency before contracting with contractors has lost its essential character and therefore we can not consider it upon this appeal.wilson county civil service,supra,d at.
plaintiffs attack defendants request for judicial notice on the basis that the fact of which judicial notice is requested is subject to dispute and not capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.however,plaintiffs have waived any such challenge by failing to oppose defendants request for judicial notice.cal.rules of court,rule c sharp union pacific th,d.moreover,based upon the documents provided to this court,it can not be disputed that in fact the county cao did make a finding of economy and efficiency as to the calworks contracts in december.
plaintiffs assert that even if the issue concerning violation of the county charter has been rendered moot,the court should nevertheless exercise its discretion to review the matter on the merits because it poses an issue of broad public interest that is likely to recur.see in re william cal d.this argument is unavailing.plaintiffs claim concerns whether,on the facts peculiar to the particular contracts at issue here,and the services to be performed,the county was required to make a finding of economy and efficiency.because plaintiffs claim is a particularly factual determination that must be resolved on a basis,dependent upon the specific facts of a given situation,it is not one on which we would exercise our discretion to address on the merits,despite the fact that it is moot.
plaintiffs also argue that the county is merely attempting to avoid the court order by belatedly conducting an economy and efficiency determination in order to render the decision moot and that it will be encouraged to take the same tack in the future as to other challenges.this argument is also unavailing.first,the county is not avoiding the court order,but complying with it.based upon the court determination,the county could not have renewed the subject contracts without first conducting an economy and efficiency determination.cases are often found moot when a party has complied with a court order before an appeal has been decided.see callie board of supervisors d.appeals moot because county amended ordinances invalidated by the court.further,as discussed,ante,there is no danger of the county only making such a determination after the fact as this case revolves around facts peculiar to the contracts at issue here.further,as we discuss,post,whether the contracts are in fact more economical and efficient is a subject that is still open to challenge.
where an appeal is disposed of upon the ground of mootness and without reaching the merits,in order to avoid ambiguity,the preferable procedure is to reverse the judgment with directions to the trial court to dismiss the action for having become moot prior to its final determination on appeal.citations.citations.county of san diego brown th,d.therefore,we reverse that portion of the judgment that is based upon the county failure to make a finding of economy and efficiency and direct the court to dismiss that portion of plaintiffs claim as moot.
plaintiffs claim that contracts are not in fact more economical and efficient 
in addition to alleging that the county failed to make an economy and efficiency determination prior to contracting out calworks case management functions,plaintiffs complaint also alleges that the contracts were improper because the services can not be provided more economically and efficiently by the contractors than persons employed in the classified service.however,the court never resolved this claim,perhaps because it may not have been ripe for adjudication at the time this matter originally went to trial and because the court determined that the calworks case management functions could not ever be contracted out under state and federal law.although the court order is unclear,a fair reading of its text indicates that the court determination that the contracts were unlawful,and the grant of a writ of mandate and permanent injunction prohibiting expenditures of public funds under the contracts between the county and private contractors,was based upon the court finding that such functions could not be contracted out under state and federal law.a violation of the county charter would only require an order that the county comply with its provisions enjoining expenditure of public funds until such action was taken.
now that the county has made a finding,obviously in response to the court ruling,that contracting out case management functions is more economical and efficient than having those services performed by civil service employees,plaintiffs claim that the contracts are in fact not more economical and efficient is now ripe for adjudication.while such a claim could also be brought in a separate action,because plaintiffs have asserted it in this matter,and in the interests of judicial economy and to give both sides some finality to this matter,we order this action remanded for a determination of plaintiffs claim that the contracting out of case management functions under the calworks program is not more economical and efficient than having those services performed by civil service personnel see burden snowden cal th,d,case remanded with directions to allow further proceedings on issue not resolved by trial court.
in a letter brief submitted by the county in response to our request,it has indicated that the current contracts between the county and contractors for which it made economy and efficiency determinations expired june.the county asserts that it is in the process of conducting economy and efficiency determinations,or has already done so,for new contracts set to begin july.if the county relies upon the determinations made for the expired contracts in finding any new contracts beginning after june,are more economical and efficient,then plaintiffs may challenge those original findings.however,if new findings of economy and efficiency are performed for contracts set to start after june,plaintiffs challenge in this litigation would have to be as to the new findings as once the current contracts expired any challenge to the original findings would be moot.
vi.alleged violation of section 
defendants assert that the court erred in finding that they were in violation of section because state and federal law in place in did allow counties to contract out case management functions for calworks programs.we agree and reverse that portion of the judgment based upon the county alleged violation of section.
section and other relevant statutes 
government code section gives counties general statutory authority to appropriate and expend funds on welfare programs and authorizes counties to contract with private agencies or individuals to operate those programs 
further california statutory scheme for the calworks program directs counties to use all available resources,both public and private,to provide services 
it is the intent of the legislature that,in developing the plan required by this chapter,counties shall make an effort not to duplicate planning processes that have already occurred within the county,but rather to build upon,and incorporate where appropriate,existing local plans that provide for a collaborative approach to employment services,economic development,and family and children services.
the legislature clearly envisioned that counties,in adopting plans to provide calworks services,would be contracting out some of those services to private entities 
each county shall develop a plan consistent with state law that describes how the county intends to deliver the full range of activities and services necessary to move calworks recipients from welfare to work.the plan shall be updated as needed.the plan shall describe 
a how the county will collaborate with other public and private agencies to provide for all necessary training,and support services.
however,section specifically limits the contracting out of functions under the calworks program as follows 
a public agency shall,in implementing programs affected by the act adding this section to the welfare and institutions code,perform program functions exclusively through the use of merit civil service employees of the public agency,except to the extent permitted by provisions of state and federal law governing the affected program that were in effect on august.
the question presented here is whether the county violated state or federal law as it existed in when it contracted out case management services under the calworks program.after reviewing applicable authority and persuasive direction from the dss,we conclude that the county did not violate either state or federal law by contracting out these functions to private entities.
legislative history of calworks 
the legislative history of the state calworks program provides support for the defendants contention that the nature of services contracted out under the county calworks program complied with state law as it existed in.the concurrence in senate amendments for assembly bill,the bill for the state calworks program,provides as follows regarding contracting out functions 
contracting out and civil service retains existing law and specifies that the counties shall remain responsible for performing program functions eligibility functions through merit civil service employees,and may contract out other services only to the extent allowed under state and federal law as of august.legis.counsel,conc.amends.to assem.bill reg.sess,italics added.
in a report on assembly bill prepared by the dss,the dss describes the functions that may not be contracted out under calworks 
requires program functions to be performed exclusively by merit civil service employees of the public agency,except as permitted by state and federal law governing the program on.this allows only limited functions to be contracted out.discretionary activities,those relating to determining eligibility or imposing sanctions,can not be contracted out.cal.of social services,major items of welfare reform contained in ab reg.sess,italics added.
thus,the legislative history of calworks envisions that discretionary functions such as eligibility and imposition of sanctions can not be contracted out.the parties stipulated that the county did not contract out eligibility determinations and imposition of sanctions to private contractors.county civil service personnel perform these functions.further,as we discuss in more detail,post,the term discretionary functions in the context of contracting out welfare services refers to policy level and administrative functions and ultimate decisions that affect a party right to aid or to participate in the calworks program,none of which are performed by the private case management workers with whom the county contracted.
the dss determination the county was in compliance with applicable law 
pursuant to the calworks legislation,the dss was directed to determine whether a county proposed plan to implement that program complied with state and federal law 
the dss and the counties shall implement the provisions of the calworks program in the following manner b within days of receipt of a county plan,the dss shall either certify that the plan includes the description of the elements required by section and that the descriptions are consistent with the requirements of state law and,to the extent applicable,federal law or notify the county that the plan is not complete or consistent stating the reasons therefor,subd.b,italics added.
as discussed,ante,the county submitted its proposed plan to implement the calworks project to the dss in january.in that plan,the county detailed the fact that it was planning to contract out case management functions to private contractors 
t he county will procure case management services for four of the six regions with the goal of selecting up to two regional contractors from private for profit agencies and up to two regional contractors from nonprofit agencies.county staff will be responsible for case management in the two remaining regions.
in february,the dss approved the county plan,certifying that it met the requirements of section.as the dss is charged with determining that a county proposed plan to implement the calworks is consistent with state and federal law under section,its approval of the county plan is persuasive evidence that it was not in violation of section.judson steel,supra,cal d at.
plaintiffs assert that the dss did not approve the county contracting out case management functions,arguing that the plan was submitted in january,but the rfp for contracting out case management functions and describing the scope of services to be contracted out was not submitted to the board of supervisors until february.however,plaintiffs have their dates wrong.the county submitted its proposed plan to the dss in january.moreover,plaintiffs do not explain why the date the plan was submitted to the state versus the date the rfp were submitted to the board of supervisors is relevant to this appeal.
plaintiffs also argue that the dss certification only concerns the scope of activities and services to recipients,not the manner of performing case management,citing section.however,the certification by the dss,as discussed,is governed not by section,but by section,which requires the dss to determine that the county plan complied with state and federal law.
as the following discussion will show,the dss approval of the county contracting out case management functions under the calworks program was not clearly erroneous,and therefore it is entitled to great weight.judson steel,supra,cal d at.
the dss all county letter 
section,subdivision a provides that the dss shall issue a planning allocation letter and county plan instructions to the counties within days of the enactment of the calworks program.the historical and statutory notes for the calworks legislation contained in the historical and statutory notes for education code section provide that the dss may implement the applicable provisions of this act through all county letter or similar instructions from the director.historical and statutory notes,west ann.supp.foll.
in august,the dss issued a report summarizing the major changes between gain and calworks.in that report,the dss explained as to contracting out services that f ederal and state law on prohibited the contracting out of discretionary functions,those related to determining eligibility or imposing sanctions.
in october,the dss issued an all county letter the all county letter,providing guidelines or implementation instructions to counties for the calworks program.with regard to employing civil service or contracting out to private entities,the dss states that a public agency shall,in implementing programs affected by the act adding this section to the welfare and institutions code,perform discretionary program functions exclusively through the use of merit civil service employees of the public agency.italics added.
thus,the dss takes the position that as of,both state and federal law prohibited the contracting out of discretionary functions in implementing the calworks program.further,the dss identifies discretionary functions as such things as determining eligibility or imposing sanctions.this determination,as well as the dss approval of the county plan and its report discussing the functions that could not be contracted out under calworks,is entitled to great weight.judson steel,supra,cal d at.again,the parties stipulated prior to trial that the county has not contracted out these services.they are performed by civil service employees.
plaintiffs completely ignore the all county letter and the dss august report.plaintiffs argue,as the trial court found,that a dss all county letter is applicable and dictates that the county could not contract out case management functions under calworks.that all county letter provided guidelines for contracting out functions under the prior gain program.it provides that counties may not contract out for the execution of the participant contract,the determination of eligibility,or actions related to the granting,termination,or modification of aid payments.specific examples of activities that the county may not contract out include registration,determining deferral status,appraisal except for the remedial education screening test,cause determinations,conciliation,and imposing money management or sanctions.
however,there is no evidence that this letter issued years prior to the enactment of calworks,and applicable to the gain program,reflected the dss position on the law for contracting out welfare functions in.moreover,the functions identified in the all county letter either do not exist under calworks or are performed by civil service personnel.there is no participant contract under calworks.a county eligibility technician et,a civil service employee,determines eligibility.there are no deferrals under the calworks program.registration of beneficiaries is performed by et.
while there is an appraisal process under calworks performed by the private contractor employees,it consists of functions akin to a remedial screening test,which could be contracted out according to the all county letter.in the appraisal process,the case management worker assesses the beneficiary education,work history,and supportive service needs.the case management worker assists the beneficiary in completing forms,and reviews and approves training and education programs.
further,when a beneficiary fails to participate in the program without good cause,a case management worker can recommend a sanction to county personnel.however,private case management workers are not authorized to make the determination to sanction a beneficiary.only county civil service employees may impose sanctions on a beneficiary.thus,even if the all county letter reflected the status of the law on contracting out welfare services as of,the county calworks project was in compliance with that law.
case law demonstrates the county was in compliance with state law 
in ramos county of madera cal d,ramos,the california supreme court was presented with the issue of what functions performed by county employees were discretionary in order to determine if the public entity immunity for discretionary decisions applied to their determinations related to the plaintiffs eligibility under the prior gain program.id.at.the high court held that the county defendant was not immune from liability because it and its employees did not exercise discretion when making determinations regarding eligibility for welfare benefits.id.at.because the legislature had provided standards of eligibility under gain,county employees exercise of judgment in determining if a recipient met those requirements did not constitute an exercise of discretion.ibid.the court determined that it is only actual policy level determinations that amount to an exercise of discretion.id.at.policy decisions are those such as planning as opposed to the operational level of decisionmaking.id.at.the county actions in making eligibility determinations under the guidelines provided by the legislature amounted to only ministerial acts that were not immune from liability.id.at.
likewise in our case,the private case management contractors are operating under strict guidelines set forth in the calworks program guide.as discussed,ante,policy level decisions such as eligibility and sanctions are made by county employees.the private contractors case management functions,therefore,even though they may involve some judgment,are considered ministerial,not discretionary.
plaintiffs attempt to distinguish ramos on the ground that it involved the issue of governmental tort immunity,not what functions might be contracted out to employees under welfare programs such as the calworks program.however,plaintiffs do not attempt to explain why these different legal settings should cause us to ignore the ramos court holding.ramos is persuasive because the legislative history of the calworks legislation and the all county letter both indicate that the legislature intended that counties could contract out any functions that were not discretionary.these items also demonstrate that the legislature intended the term discretionary to have the same meaning as applied in the ramos case,policy and administrative level decisions such as those that effect determinations as to eligibility and loss of benefits.ramos provides additional support for the conclusion that state law in effect in did not prohibit counties from contracting out nondiscretionary,ministerial functions,even if they involved the exercise of some judgment.in sum,the county did not violate california law when it contracted out case management functions to private entities under the calworks program.
federal law 
former united states code section,repealed with the enactment of the prwora in,provided for contracting out of welfare services through private organizations as follows
