this is a bid protest case.the principal issue is whether the contracting officer applied the proper standards when evaluating bids in a best value procurement.the case turns on the correct interpretation of a solicitation issued by the united states postal service usps for the printing,finishing,and packaging of united states postage stamps.guilford gravure,guilford,one of the unsuccessful bidders,appeals the judgment of the united states court of federal claims in the government favor.we disagree with guilford interpretation of the solicitation and conclude that the contracting officer acted within the scope of his discretion by not awarding a contract to guilford.we have considered and reject guilford other arguments,and we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of federal claims.
background 
the solicitation for this procurement,referred to as iii,stated that the usps intended to award no more than three contracts.bidders were instructed to submit proposals for printing various stamp products using one or more of the following printing methods gravure,intaglio,offset,or a combination of offset or gravure with intaglio.the solicitation did not require offerors to possess or propose to use all of the printing methods and did not indicate that any method was preferred over the others.
as indicated in two separate sections of the solicitation,contract awards would be based on a best value determination.first,section entitled evaluation in the body of the solicitation reads 
the postal service will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is deemed to offer the postal service the best value,price and other factors as specified considered.the following factors will be used to evaluate offers 
in an attachment to the solicitation labeled instructions to offerors,a section entitled contract award and proposal evaluation reads 
as stated in section of this solicitation,award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the postal service,a combination of price,factors,other factors.the primary areas to be used in determining which proposal offers the best value to the postal service are listed below in descending order of importance 
past of the overall organization is weighted as more important than any other individual factor.supplier capabilities and supplier capabilities are weighted equally.
will be considered in the award decision,although the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price.
after receiving proposals from five prequalified contractors guilford,banknote corporation of america bca,sennett security products,llc sennett,avery dennison corporation avery dennison,and usa,the usps awarded contracts to sennett,avery dennison,and.the contracting officer issued an awards memorandum in which he explained the basis for the award decision.according to the awards memorandum,the five contractors were ranked in two categories aggregate price analysis and technical evaluation,the latter prepared by a technical evaluation committee based on a point system.the contracting officer then performed a best value determination in accordance with section.d of the usps purchasing manual,entitled best value determinations.
in explaining the results of his best value analysis,the contracting officer indicated that two of the successful bidders were strong best value selections.a third successful bidder was described as a good best value selection and a solid fit with the two preceding selections.while the third bidder lacked immediate capability in the gravure printing method,the technical evaluation committee believed that capability would improve after the first year once the bidder developed a relationship with its proposed subcontractor.this bidder also had proven capability in the offset printing method.
with respect to guilford proposal,the contracting officer recognized guilford strong ranking in the technical evaluation,but noted that guilford maintained a rather high pricing profile,which was only modestly improved after discussions.in concluding that guilford should not be awarded a contract,the contracting officer explained in a reasonable judgment,the additional cost does not offset the offered capacity and capability.given the strong gravure capability and capacity at both the two strongest bidders,the program is not compelled to accept added similar capability at a higher cost.
while the awards memorandum did not indicate the relative weights given to the technical and pricing evaluations,the contracting officer stated during a debriefing following the contract award that he placed the pricing and technical evaluations in buckets of equal weight.he further commented that the best value determination was a subjective judgment on his part with no specific formula.
guilford and bca filed separate complaints in the court of federal claims challenging the usps decision to award contracts to the three successful,and.the trial court consolidated the two actions and granted motions by the three contract awardees to intervene.the parties filed for judgment on the administrative record.
following oral argument,the trial court addressed plaintiffs numerous arguments in a thorough opinion.banknote of,united states,fed.cl.guilford appeal challenges only some of the trial court rulings.with respect to the primary focus of guilford contracting officer best value trial court concluded that the contracting officer properly accorded equal weight to the technical and pricing evaluations and therefore the contract award decision was not arbitrary or capricious.the trial court also rejected guilford contentions that the usps failed to conduct meaningful discussions,relied on unstated evaluation criteria in rating the contractors proposals,and failed to properly document the rationale for its decision.the trial court denied plaintiffs motions for judgment on the administrative record and granted the government for judgment on the administrative record.
guilford appeals the judgment of the court of federal claims.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
legal standardsa.bid protests under the administrative dispute resolution act 
the court of federal claims has jurisdiction to review both and bid protests pursuant to b,enacted as part of the administrative dispute resolution act of adra,stat.that provision allows an interested party to file an action in the court of federal claims objecting to a solicitation by a federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.b.when the adra first took effect,it provided the court of federal claims and the district courts of the united states with concurrent jurisdiction over such actions.the jurisdiction of the district courts subsequently terminated on january,pursuant to a sunset provision in the adra,d,stat.at.this action was brought in the court of federal claims in april.
under the adra,the court of federal claims review s the agency decision pursuant to the standards set forth in section of title,the standards found in the administrative procedure act apa.b.among the various apa standards of review in section,the proper standard to be applied in bid protest cases is provided by a a reviewing court shall set aside the agency action if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.advanced data concepts,united states,noting that bid protests do not present an agency record derived from a hearing and thus the substantial evidence standard of e does not apply.in bid protest cases filed under the adra,the court implements this apa standard by applying the standard as previously interpreted by the district courts in the scanwell line of cases,referring to the case upholding district court apa review of government procurement decisions.impresa construzioni geom.domenico garufi united states,citing scanwell,shaffer,and explaining the history of judicial review of government procurement decisions.
under the apa standard as applied in the scanwell line of cases,and now in adra cases,a bid award may be set aside if either the procurement official decision lacked a rational basis or the procurement procedure involved a violation of regulation or procedure.id.at.when a challenge is brought on the first ground,the test is whether the contracting agency provided a coherent and reasonable explanation of its exercise of discretion,and the disappointed bidder bears a heavy burden of showing that the award decision had no rational basis.id.at citations omitted.when a challenge is brought on the second ground,the disappointed bidder must show a clear and prejudicial violation of applicable statutes or regulations.id.at.to establish prejudice under this second ground,a protester must show that there was a substantial chance it would have received the contract award absent the alleged error.emery worldwide airlines,united states,alfa laval separation,united states.
when the agency involved is the usps,there is some question whether the above standard applies to its bid protests.this is because actions by the usps are not normally subject to apa review.see a emery,at.in emery,we held that the court of federal claims possesses jurisdiction over bid protest actions involving the usps,id.at,but we declined to decide whether a trumps the adra mandate to apply the apa standard of review.id.at.neither party in that case contested the application of the apa standard if we held that the court of federal claims had jurisdiction over the suit under b,the parties assumed apa review applied.because the judicial review provisions of the apa are not jurisdictional,both parties were deemed to have waived any arguments concerning the effect of a on apa review.accordingly,we decided that case by applying the apa standard of review as described above.id.we shall do the same in the case before us because the parties do not contest the applicability of the apa standard.
the reference to the apa standard of review in b,quoted at the beginning of this discussion,has given rise to a related the adra also adopts the apa requirements for standing according to b,a bid protest suit may be brought by an interested party.the statute provides no definition of the term interested party,but the term appears in another statute that applies to government contract disputes.under the competition in contracting act cica,which governs the bid protest jurisdiction of the general accounting office gao,a protest may be filed by an interested party.the cica explicitly defines the term as an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract.
in american federation of government employees,united states,this court addressed whether the apa standing requirement or the cica standard should apply to adra bid protests.under the more liberal apa standard,parties other than actual or prospective bidders might be able to bring suit.id.at.after reviewing the legislative history,we concluded that congress intended standing under the adra to be limited to disappointed bidders.id.at.we further noted that congress decision to use the same term in the adra as it did in the cica supports that interpretation.id.at.we therefore construed the term interested party in accordance with the cica definition and held that standing under the adra is limited to actual or prospective bidders or offerors whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by failure to award the contract.id.
motion for judgment on the administrative record 
rule of the rules of the court of federal claims rcfc provides for judgment on the administrative record,a procedural tool unique to the court of federal claims.the rule was added to the rcfc in there is no counterpart in the federal rules of civil procedure.rule a specifies that a motion for judgment on the administrative record shall be treated in accordance with the rules governing motions for summary judgment,with the exception that any supplementation of the administrative record shall be by stipulation or by court order only.see rose united states,fed.cl,nickerson united states,aff,summary disposition.thus judgment on the administrative record is appropriate when there are no issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.rose,fed.cl.at.
as the court of federal claims has observed,a motion for judgment on the administrative record is often an appropriate vehicle to scrutinize an agency procurement actions because such cases typically involve interpretation of contract documents or regulations,thereby presenting no disputed issues of material fact.see seattle sec,united states,fed.cl.indeed,the central issue raised in the bid protest case before us relates to the correct interpretation of the solicitation issued by the usps,which is a question of law.see grumman data.dalton.
since the court of federal claims decides a motion for judgment on the administrative record by applying the summary judgment standard,it follows that we review the court grant of that motion as we would a grant of a motion for summary judgment.in other words,assuming no disputed issues of material fact,we reapply the summary judgment standard in an independent review to determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see jwk int l united states.thus,when reviewing a judgment in a bid protest case,our task is to address independently any legal issues,such as the correct interpretation of a solicitation,and then to determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact as to whether the agency decision lacked a rational basis or involved a prejudicial violation of applicable statutes or regulations.
ii.the usps best value decision 
the central issue in this case is whether the contracting officer applied the correct standards when evaluating the submitted bids to determine which of them provided the best value to the government.guilford contends the solicitation required the contracting officer to place greater weight on technical factors than on pricing factors therefore,according to guilford,the contracting officer erred by placing equal weight on the two evaluation categories.the government,apparently believing that the usps is bound by an unrelated usps bid protest decision,agrees with guilford interpretation of the solicitation,but nevertheless argues the government should prevail because any error committed by the contracting officer did not prejudice guilford.the three intervenors maintain that the solicitation did not address the relative weight to be given to the technical and pricing categories,and therefore,in accordance with several gao bid protest cases,the two categories should receive approximately equal weight.
interpretation of the solicitation is a question of law over which we exercise independent review.see grumman data,at.we begin with the plain language of the document coast fed.bank,fsb united states,en banc.the solicitation is ambiguous only if its language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.see grumman data,at.if the provisions of the solicitation are clear and unambiguous,they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning we may not resort to extrinsic evidence to interpret them.coast fed.bank,at.finally,we must consider the solicitation as a whole,interpreting it in a manner that harmonizes and gives reasonable meaning to all of its provisions.id.
we begin by examining the language of the two provisions that describe the best value evaluation process.section of the solicitation states that the usps will award a contract to the offeror whose proposal offers the usps the best value,price and other factors as specified considered.a list of several technical evaluation factors follows,with no mention of price.understood in its proper context,the list of technical factors represents the other factors as specified the absence of pricing factors from the list does not mean price is not to be considered or is to b
