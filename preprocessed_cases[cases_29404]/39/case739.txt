facilities management west,and oc fair and event center,
introduction 
in the legislature passed section of the food and agricultural code providing for the sale of the orange county fairgrounds the fairgrounds.in november,the executive branch department of general services the department accepted the bid of facilities management west facilities management to buy the fairgrounds for million,consisting of million down,with the remaining million to be paid off over the course of years.
a disparate group consisting of rival bidders,friends of the orange county fair,a state senator,an assembly member,and a costa mesa council member brought this suit to stop the sale.the trial court issued a temporary restraining order on november,precluding any further action on the part of the department to consummate the sale of the fairgrounds.however,the trial court ordered the temporary restraining order lifted on december,which would have allowed the sale to go through.on that day,in response to a petition for a writ of supersedeas from the opponents of the sale,this court stepped in and issued a stay,stopping the sale from going forward until we could consider the issues raised.
having heard oral argument and having considered the issues,we now grant the requested writ of supersedeas.in a word,this sale can not go forward.there are two main reasons.
first,the legislature required the department to provide the legislature with an explicit comparison between the fairgrounds fair market value and any deal which the department proposed to make.food,subds.d and d all undesignated statutory references in this opinion are to that code.the department,however,neglected to provide that comparison.indeed,the department claim that the deal it made automatically equaled the fair market value of the property contradicted the position it had taken only a few months earlier in a previous round of bidding.in that round,the department apparently had a good idea of the fair market value of the property,and decided that none of the bids it had received had come sufficiently close to be accepted.
second,the bidding process itself was flawed by the total absence of any bid protest procedures.in section,subdivision c the legislature had required the sale of the fairgrounds be pursuant to a public bidding process designed to obtain the highest,most certain return for the state from a responsible bidder.italics added.here,however,the department implemented a bidding system that contained no safeguards to ensure responsibility,or even that bids be materially responsive to the department own request for proposals.
these two flaws in the procedure by which facilities management was awarded the sale particularly the failure to provide the legislature a comparison between the fair market value of the property and the terms actually proposed by the winning bidder mean that the proposed sale can not be consummated.while the second flaw the absence of a bid protest mechanism might,in theory,be cured by simply sending the matter back to the department to allow for administrative challenges to the bids received,the first flaw failure to give the legislature the comparison it wanted is necessarily fatal.the legislature reserved for itself the opportunity to veto the sale if it was not satisfied with the terms of the sale in comparison with the fair market value of the fairgrounds.it never got that opportunity.
we therefore grant the requested writ of supersedeas.in practical terms,the result of our decision is to void the proposed sale and require the department to start all over again,if the governor so chooses.
the legislation 
in the legislature passed,and schwarzenegger signed,assembly bill,which provides for the sale of certain items of real estate owned by the state of california,with the proceeds to end up in the state general fund.one of the items of real estate to be sold is the land currently being used as the orange county fairgrounds.
assembly bill added several new statutes to both the government code and the food and agricultural code.the provisions specifically covering the fairgrounds were new sections and to the food and agricultural code.subdivision c of section directs the department to conduct the sale of the fairgrounds pursuant to a public bidding process designed to obtain the highest,most certain return for the state from a responsible bidder.
the bidding 
the first request for proposals 
a initial request for proposal was issued by the department in september and provided for a public auction after bids were opened.facilities west was the high bidder at million,but,in the auction held in january,another firm,craig real estate,presented the highest bid at million.however,in march,the department rejected the million bid as being,in the words of one of its senior real estate officers,not the highest and most certain return,too low.
one should bookmark that fact the department at the time obviously had a good idea of the fairground fair market value independent of whatever bid happened to be the highest.
a possible private deal 
so,in the spring of,the city of costa mesa began efforts to put its own deal together.those efforts resulted in proposed deal between facilities management,the department,and a joint powers authority controlled by the city of costa mesa.facilities west would provide the money and obtain a lease on the property from the joint powers authority the price was million,and the deal provided for a minimum down payment of million,a promissory note for the balance,installment payments not to exceed years,a fixed payment schedule for those installments,sale of the property as is,and though this would go without saying given the private nature of the deal,no auction.however,since the transaction was obviously being concluded without a public bidding process as required by section,the agreement also recognized that the legislature would need to enact further legislation.
the second request for proposals 
the legislature did not take any action on the privately negotiated sale,so in august the department issued a second request for proposals.the salient points of the department request for proposals are these the department reserved the power not to accept any bid.unlike the first request,there would be no auction after the bidding.the bid deadline was september.the final selection would be made october.the legislature was to receive notice within the week,by october.the minimum terms were a down payment of million,any installment payments were not to exceed years pursuant to a fixed payment schedule so,for example,a bidder could not vary its payments depending on how much money the property was earning.also,the net present value of any stream of installment payments was to be equal to the face value of any promissory note given by the bidder,using a discount rate of percent.and there was to be no contingent financing.the second request also required information about the responsibility and strength of each financial principal of each bidder.
the timeline set forth by the second request for proposals is also worth noting the request itself was issued august.bidders could ask questions up to september,and would receive responses to those questions postmarked no later than september.the final bid submission date was september.the final selection and notice to bidders was to be sent out october.the successful bidder execution of purchase contract was to be a week later,on october.and on that date notice was to be given to the legislature.for its part the department itself was scheduled to execute the contract one month later,on november,which would be the date escrow would be opened.escrow was to close december.
an addendum to the second request changed a few dates in this timeline basically hurrying things up instead of the department final selection being made on october,the date was moved up to october.and instead of escrow being opened on november,it was moved up more than a month to october.also,the department own execution of the contract was moved up from the original november to november.escrow was still to close december.likewise the buyer execution,originally slated to be november,was moved up to november.
the bids on the second request 
bids were received from four entities american fairs and festivals million,advanced real estate services million,facilities management million,and city ventures million.each of the four bids consisted of a million down payment,but proposed somewhat different terms for the balance to be paid via a promissory note.we may skip detailing the losing bids of american fairs and city ventures,as those bids would not figure significantly in the course of the litigation to come.
we do note,however,some differences in the two bids proffered by advanced real estate and facilities management.advanced real estate proposed to give a million note,not an million one as proposed by facilities management.we recognize the anomaly that with a million down payment,the purchase price was still ostensibly million,not million.advanced real estate note was to be for years,while facilities management note was for years.and advanced real estate schedule of payments was different advanced real estate proposed to give itself eight years of zero payments,while facilities management proposed only one year.
on the other hand,advanced real estate proposed to pay significantly more beginning in year million,with payments then to steeply rise until it would be paying million per year in years through.by contrast,facilities management bid contemplated payments of million in years through,and payments of about million for the rest of the year note.facilities management offer had no balloon payment at the end of the year term of the note,while advanced real estate note would require a balloon payment,after the year term of the note,of million.and that no typo.advanced real estate would owe the state more than a half a billion dollars at the end of the term.
despite the longer term of advanced real estate note,and its balloon payment,a summary and analysis prepared in october by the department itself concluded that the net present value using a percent interest rate of advanced real estate offer was million more than the net present value of facilities management offer.in specific terms,the department assigned a net present value of million to advanced real estate offer,and assigned a net present value of million to facilities management offer.
no bid challenges allowed 
attorneys for parties who would later challenge the sale in court including advanced real estate submitted two letters protesting the bid process as it was being conducted by the department.the first letter was sent september,and made the point that the second request for proposal violated section of the public contract code by containing material key terms that were the same or nearly the same as those contained in the deal privately negotiated in the spring between facilities west and the department.the letter drew a response on october the day after the final selection under the revised timeline,asserting that the department does not legally possess the jurisdiction to hear protests in connection with sale of real property pursuant to food and agricultural code section.
the second letter was sent october,directly protesting the award to facilities west just days before.the letter was short,and made general legal arguments the department had not complied with applicable law or its own request for proposals,and had discriminated against other bidders.
this second letter drew a response on october,substantively identical to the department response to the earlier protest letter,including the assertion of no jurisdiction to hear bid protests and the unctuous,your interest in the business transactions of the state of california is appreciated,and it is hoped that you will be successful in future dealings with the state.
selection and notification to the legislature 
despite the higher net present value of advanced real estate bid but clearly because of the large balloon payment proposed at the end of the year term of its note the department choose facilities west offer.what the senior real estate analyst in the department thought most dispositive was that the risk of default on advanced real estate obligation would seriously increase along with the dramatic increase in the balance of the loan during its term.that would not be the case with facilities management bid,which would be all paid off by the end of years.
on october,the date of the final selection according to the revised timeline,the department sent denise moreno ducheny,chair of the joint legislative budget committee,a short letter describing the acceptance of the bid of facilities west.the cover letter included an attachment a giving the terms and conditions of facilities west proposal in a word,a purchase price of million with a down payment of million,the balance to be repaid back in years,interest at percent.
but what was in the notice was a comparison of fair market value with the terms submitted by facilities west.the total language on the topic of fair market value was this a statement that simply equated the accepted bid with fair market value fair market value purchase price and terms presented represent the fair market value as per food and agricultural code c.
the litigation 
on november three days before the department was scheduled to execute the transaction with facilities west a group of individuals and entities filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking to stop the deal in the superior court.
a word on who who in the litigation the challengers to the sale the petitioners in this writ proceeding are a diverse group of parties,united by an opposition to the sale to facilities west.these parties are 
advanced real estate services,a possible buyer of the fairgrounds,one of the disappointed bidders 
tel phil enterprises,a company that currently operates a swap meet on the fairgrounds when the fair is not in session,and its affiliated corporation,american fairs and festivals,another disappointed bidder,and their owner,jeffrey phil 
the orange county fairgrounds preservation society 
state senator lou correa,state assembly member jose solorio,and mesa council member katrina foley.technically,senator correa,assembly member solorio,council member foley,and the orange county preservation society together filed a separate action,which was soon consolidated with the action brought by advanced real estate services and the other disappointed bidders.hence our caption mentions two consolidated trial court actions.
the defenders of the sale real parties in interest in this writ proceeding are the buyer,facilities west,and the department.
the trial court judge frederick horn issued a temporary restraining order on november,precluding any further action on the part of the department to consummate the sale of the fairgrounds.the hearing on the preliminary hearing was set for december.in the interim,facilities west was allowed to intervene in the case.
at the december hearing,a new trial judge judge michael brenner,a retired judge sitting on assignment denied the request for a preliminary injunction,but extended the duration of the restraining order until december.that day,the challengers filed this writ proceeding in our court.this court granted the challengers request for an immediate stay which has continued to be in effect until further order of this court preventing the department from taking any further steps to sell the fairground,and set an expedited briefing schedule.
discussion 
two of the issues raised in the petition for writ of supersedeas are meritorious.indeed,as noted above,one of those issues necessarily prevents this proposed sale to facilities management entirely.whether the governor will wish to proceed with a new sale is a matter on which we need not speculate.
there was a failure to inform the legislature of the 
fair market value of the property in comparison 
to the bids received 
the governing statute is section.it contains three distinct references to the concept of fair market value one in subdivision c,one in subdivision d which syntactically must be read in conjunction with subdivision d,and the other in subdivision d.
here are those three references 
subdivision c the sale of the real property authorized by this section shall be pursuant to a public bidding process designed to obtain the highest,most certain return for the state from a responsible bidder,and any transaction based on such a bidding process shall be deemed to be the fair market value for the property.italics added.
subdivisions d and d thirty days prior to executing a transaction for a sale of real property authorized by this section,the director of general services shall report to the chairs of the fiscal committees of the legislature all of the following the financial terms of the transaction.a comparison of fair market value for the real property and the terms listed in paragraph.italics added.
subdivision d thirty days prior to executing a transaction for a sale of real property authorized by this section,the director of general services shall report to the chairs of the fiscal committees of the legislature all of the following 
any basis for agreeing to terms and conditions other than fair market value.italics added.
the department,in its letter of october to the chairs of the legislature fiscal committees,took the position that it was enough to send the terms of the proposed transaction with facilities west,because,said the department,under subdivision c,those terms were ipso facto the fair market value.
the department october position equating the facilities west proposal with ultimate fair market value directly contradicted the department previous position in the first round of bidding.in that first round,the department apparently had its own independent idea of the fairgrounds fair market value and thought that the highest bid of million did not measure up to that fair market value.
the october letter to the fiscal chairs of the legislature made no reference to subdivision d.said the letter purchase price and terms presented represent the fair market value as per food and agricultural code c.
the assumption that the deal itself established fair market value as required in the report to the fiscal chairs of the legislature is untenable because it creates an internal contradiction within section.or put another way,the department interpretation of fair market value reads subdivision d out of existence and presumes the legislature was engaging in an idle act.
subdivision d plainly requires that the department provide its own ascertainment of fair market value to the fiscal chairs of the legislature,so the legislature,if it so chooses,has at least a little time to derail any deal.and even more strongly,subdivision d expressly contemplates the possibility that the terms and conditions of the sale of the fairgrounds might not be fair market value.
there is thus no way the department isolated reading of subdivision c can be reconciled with subdivision d.under the department reading,the statute would be providing for the possibility that fair market value was both equal to and not equal to the proposed terms of the sale.it would make the statute go tilt.
to be sure,for the department to give the legislature a comparison of the fair market value of a given property so as to be able to compare it with a proposed sale necessarily entails some sort of estimate of fair market value.but then,as every homeowner who ever applied for a loan on his or her house knows,everything short of an actual sale must necessarily be an estimate.coming to such an estimate is the sort of thing real estate appraisers do all the time,including properties like the fairgrounds where such an estimate based on,say,a future income stream or projected resale prices if and when the property is ever developed can be complex.
we should point out that the three provisions are easily reconciled simply be recognizing they refer to different points in time.subdivision c speaks from a time after the transaction has been consummated hence it is merely declarative.in subdivision c,no one actually has to do anything.the operative words in subdivision c are based on past tense.so,indeed,after the bidding process required in the first sentence has resulted in a transaction,no one,a taxpayer challenging the transaction after completion,or a tax assessor will be able to claim that the fairgrounds was not sold for fair market value.such protection would,of course,be reassuring to any potential buyer before the transaction no need to worry about a taxpayer alleging that the buyer got the proverbial steal.
by contrast,subdivisions d and d address the point in time when the department has made a selection which it proposes to consummate,but must first give notice to the legislature.
timing is key days prior to the department actually completing a proposed transaction,members of the legislature,in a position to initiate legislation to stop the proposed transaction,were to be given a comparison of the transaction with the fair market value of the property.
subdivisions b and f confirm our reconciliation of subdivision c with subdivision d,that the legislature wanted an estimate of fair market value days before the department agreed to any transaction.subdivision b puts a limit on any contracts like a lease that could affect the use or operation of the fairgrounds,and subdivision f requires the department to report to the legislature on or before june of each year on the status of the sale.the implication is that the legislature contemplated a much more leisurely timeframe than a quick,fire sale style disposal of the fairgrounds that is,a timeframe in which the department would have plenty of time to prepare its own estimate of fair market value.
the administrative deference argument 
the argument based on administrative deference does not work in the case of section.counsel for the department at oral argument ended his defense of the sale by asserting the department acted wholly within its discretion in awarding the sale to facilities management.the language of subdivision d is too plain to excuse noncompliance with section under the cover of administrative discretion.see bonnell board cal th,applying these basic principles of judicial review,our deference is unwarranted here.the board interpretation is incorrect in light of the unambiguous language of the statute.we do not accord deference to an interpretation that is clearly erroneous.
the problem of disclosure 
we do understand that the department might be reluctant to disclose its own,internal,estimate of fair market value.but we note that subdivision d requires a report to only the chairs of the fiscal committees,not the entire legislature the analog that comes to mind is when only certain members of the intelligence committees of congress are privy to some clandestine operation.nothing in subdivision d or in the rest of section requires the department to publicly disclose its evaluation of the fairgrounds fair market value.but it must be disclosed in any event.
the award here was not pursuant to a public bidding process 
designed to obtain the highest most certain return 
from a responsible bidder 
a second reason this sale did not comply with section was the absence of any bid protest mechanism at all.without such a mechanism,we can not say that the process by which the department awarded the sale to facilities management was designed to obtain the highest and most certain return from a responsible bidder.
preliminarily,the department argument that general principles of public contracting law should not apply in this case,because it involves the sale of property as distinct from the procurement of goods or services,is untenable.the text of section plainly says that the sale of the fairgrounds will be conducted pursuant to a public bidding process and nothing is more concerned with public bidding processes than public contracting law.
interestingly enough,the phrase public bidding process appears rather sparsely in the california codes,and is nowhere specifically defined.an analog phrase,competitive bidding process,appears much more frequently in the codes.it is to be found in such disparate places as the health and safety code,authorizing solicitation for environmental insurance
