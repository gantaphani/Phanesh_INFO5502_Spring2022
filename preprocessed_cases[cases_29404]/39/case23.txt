international salt company,llc international salt appeals from the district court entry of judgment for the city of boston city in a dispute over payment for road salt that the company supplied during the winter of.the city awarded a contract to international salt to supply tons of road salt for that winter,but its supply dwindled midway through the season after several unusually heavy snows hit the area.in early february,the city demanded another tons of salt,which international salt said it could provide but at a higher price because its shipping costs had risen.the city was insistent in its demand but did not agree to pay more than the original contract price.international salt supplied the additional salt after the city characterized the situation as a public safety issue for which it would hold the company responsible,but the company reserved the right to litigate the price.true to its word,the city paid the same rate per ton as it had under the contract,and this suit followed.the district court entered judgment for the city of boston following a trial.international salt appeals,arguing the parties failure to comply with the massachusetts uniform procurement act was excused under the act emergency provisions the district court erred in holding that international salt claims are barred by its failure to show that it strictly complied with the boston city charter and it should be permitted to assert equitable estoppel against the city.we will affirm the judgment.
the parties largely stipulated to the relevant facts.international salt was the successful bidder to supply the city with tons of road maintenance salt for the period between october,and june.the contract received both the written approval of the mayor of boston and approval by a city official that appropriations were available.from november to march,boston received more than inches of snow,with roughly half falling in january.road salt is critically important during winter snow and ice storms,and its absence poses a significant threat to public health and safety.without it,the city streets become dangerous to vehicles and pedestrians.effective use of road salt requires that the city apply it to streets and highways before,during,and after storms.
the city wrote the contract at issue.the only provision over which international salt had any control was the bid and ultimately,the contract price.this lawsuit arose because the parties could not agree on an interpretation of certain contract language.the first dispute is over an incorporated contract provision of the city invitation for bids,which reads price will be held for the term of the contract and shall not be limited to the estimated number of items.however,the city did not use the word estimated anywhere else in the contract documents.
in addition to uncertainty over the word estimated,the contract contains other ambiguities.the signature page of the contract,in listing the terms,states that the total amount of the contract is not to exceed.that figure is derived from multiplying tons by,the price bid per ton.the bid response form contains two additional pertinent statements.first,in the space allotted to the total bid price for the contract,international salt recorded it as a ton,for a total of.second,where asked to list the price components of the bid price,international salt wrote total contract.based upon tons.
as of the first week of february,international salt had delivered tons of salt to the city,and the city had approximately tons remaining in its storage yards.much of the winter was yet ahead,and the city public works superintendent,joseph canavan,liked to keep the reserves above tons because of the uncertainty of weather and the problems caused by running out of salt.
on february,daniel thompson,vice president of government sales for international salt,faxed a letter to vincent caiani,an assistant purchasing agent for the city,informing him that an increase in ocean freight rates would cause international salt to increase its price of salt from a ton to a ton,effective with any shipments above the tons specified in the contract.that same day,caiani telephoned thompson to ask that international salt provide the city with additional salt in excess of tons,but at the contract price of per ton.they disagreed over whether international salt was obligated to provide it.the next day,thompson spoke with william hannon,the city purchasing agent.hannon said that the city was precluded by massachusetts general laws chapter from agreeing to pay more than per ton,and thompson took the position that international salt had fulfilled its obligations under the contract by supplying the city with tons of salt and that it could not supply additional salt at the same price because shipping costs had increased.as these conversations were taking place,the city was applying salt to its streets,and its supply diminished by nearly tons in one day.
the parties continued to discuss this issue,with each side holding fast to its position.ultimately,on february,the boston commissioner of public works,joseph casazza,telephoned international salt chief executive officer,robert jones,to demand written assurance that the company would continue to supply the city with salt.the commissioner presented his demand as a safety issue it was the middle of winter,in emergency conditions,and he did not want the city to be shut down or to face problems with unsafe streets or with police and fire vehicles being unable to move about.casazza threatened to hold international salt responsible for streets rendered unsafe by lack of salt.he deflected any talk of price as not his responsibility.
following this february conversation between the commissioner and the company ceo,hannon sent jones a letter setting forth the city expectation that international salt would honor its contract and provide additional road salt at the same price.jones also sent casazza a letter informing him that international salt would continue to supply salt even though it had fulfilled its obligations under the contract,and that if the parties could not agree on a price,international salt would seek fair market value as determined by a court or through mediation.international salt attorney sent hannon a letter the following day reiterating the company position and refuting the city contract interpretation.
on february,international salt completed delivery of tons of road salt to the city,all of which came from inventory at its facility in charlestown,massachusetts.the city issued three more purchase orders for salt february tons,march tons,and april tons.from february to march,international salt made an additional eighteen deliveries of salt,totaling tons.for those deliveries,international salt turned to the ocean freight spot market and paid higher shipping rates.the city,however,continued to pay international salt a constant rate of per ton for the additional shipments.
on april,international salt counsel wrote in a letter to hannon that the company viewed the city lack of response to its previous correspondence about pricing and its additional orders as an implicit agreement to pay fair market value,which it determined to be per ton.the letter concluded that the city owed international salt an additional.hannon replied five days later and said that the city had been consistent in its view that the contract allowed the city to buy quantities of greater than tons of salt at the contract price,and that massachusetts law and the city charter did not permit the city to pay a higher price.
international salt filed this action in three counts breach of contract,quantum enrichment,and declaratory judgment.the district court conducted a trial and entered judgment for the city,finding that international salt had no viable claim of recovery.this appeal followed.
although the city once took the position that the parties contractual relationship continued to exist after international salt had completed delivery of tons of road salt,it does not make that argument on appeal.the city does not take exception to the district court ruling on the first day of trial that the city interpretation of the o
