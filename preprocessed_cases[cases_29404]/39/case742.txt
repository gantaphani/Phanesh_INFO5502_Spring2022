ii.factual and procedural background 
a.the lausd project stabilization agreement and california certified payroll record.the lausd project stabilization agreement 
the los angeles unified school district lausd or the district and numerous unions are signatories to the project stabilization agreement psa,which is a construction labor agreement that is intended to promote the timely completion of lausd public works projects.the agreement is binding on contractors who enter into construction contracts with the lausd and mandates that they pay their laborers the prevailing wage rate set by the department of industrial relations.in addition,contractors are required to provide contributions for employee fringe benefits,which are paid directly to various trusts that administer the employee benefits programs.the trusts,in turn,are responsible for allocating the benefits to the contractors employees.
california certified payroll records requirements 
california labor code section,subdivision a requires contractors who enter into public works contracts to maintain certified payroll records cprs that show,among other things,the name,address,social security number,work classification and hours worked for each employee,subd.a.contractors are required to make copies of cprs available to their employees,the body that awarded the public work project the awarding agency and various california labor agencies,subds.b.section further provides that the public may inspect the awarding agency copies of contractor cprs,subd.b,but directs that such copies shall be marked or obliterated to prevent disclosure of an individual name,address,and social security number,subd.e.
summary of the proceedings below 
on april,the trustees of the southern california pension plan and various other collectively trustees filed a complaint against the lausd and integrated.the complaint alleged that integrated,which was a construction contractor working for the district,violated the terms of the psa by failing to pay the trustees approximately in employee fringe benefits.the complaint also sought an order directing the lausd to withhold funds from integrated in an amount equal to the unpaid fringe benefits.
shortly thereafter,on june,the lausd filed a for declaratory relief against the trustees seeking a declaration that section,subdivision e prohibited the lausd from producing personal employee information contained in integrated cprs,including the employees names,social security numbers and addresses personal employee information.the declaratory relief claim was intended to resolve an ongoing dispute with the trustees regarding the effect of section,subdivision e.in numerous prior law suits involving unpaid fringe benefits,the trustees had filed document subpoenas against the lausd requesting unredacted contractor cprs that showed the personal employee information.the trustees contended that this information was needed to properly allocate fringe benefits to the contractors employees.in each case,the lausd unsuccessfully argued that,pursuant to section,subdivision e,the personal employee information was privileged and could not be produced.the lausd declaratory relief claim in the current litigation was brought to clarify whether the personal employee information contained within its cprs was privileged pursuant to section,subdivision e,and therefore not subject to discovery.
after the lausd filed its,the trustees obtained payroll information that enabled it to determine the specific amount that integrated owed for unpaid employee fringe benefits.integrated subsequently agreed to pay the outstanding benefits contributions and the trustees dismissed their complaint against both the lausd and integrated.the lausd,however,declined to dismiss its declaratory relief action,arguing that the parties needed to determine the effect of labor code section,subdivision e to avoid future discovery disputes regarding the production of unredacted cprs.in support,the lausd identified eight lawsuits filed by the trustees since in which the parties had litigated the identical discovery issue.the trial court decided to proceed with the declaratory relief action and held a bench trial to resolve whether california discovery statutes required the lausd to produce unredacted copies of cprs.
the only witness called to testify at trial was joanne keller,who was responsible for overseeing the collection and allocation of employee fringe benefits for the southern california pension plan pension plan.keller began her testimony by explaining that contractors would typically submit contribution reports to the pension plan that included the name,social security number,and hours worked for each of the contractors employees.the pension plan used those reports for two purposes to calculate the amount the contractor owed for employee fringe benefits,and to allocate those benefits to plan participants.
if a contractor failed to provide a contribution report,the pension plan would attempt to collect the employee information by requesting cprs directly from the contractor.if a contractor refused or was otherwise unable to provide copies of its cprs,the pension plan would typically seek unredacted versions of the records from the awarding agency.however,as a result of section,subdivision e,in many cases,the awarding agency would only agree to produce redacted cprs that withheld the personal employee information.keller stated that although the pension plan could use redacted cprs to calculate the amount that a contractor owed for fringe benefits,the redacted records did not provide sufficient information to allocate the benefits to plan participants.
keller further testified that if a contractor could not produce payroll records,it was possible for the pension plan to collect the personal employee information without acquiring the awarding agency unredacted cprs.specifically,keller explained that the pension plan had the authority to audit contractors,which enabled it to review pay stubs,pay checks and other documents containing the employees personal information according to keller,the pension plan generally tried to avoid conducting audits,explaining that 
in most instances you try to use the most expeditious manner in terms of getting the information so you can apply the monies and the credits to the employees as quickly as possible.an audit of an employer is a much more labor intensive,longer in duration period to extract that same information which we know is readily available through the awarding agency.
following the trial,the court issued a statement of decision ruling that i f section e is enforceable in accordance with the plain meaning and legislative intent of the statute,the district would be compelled to redact certified payroll records produced to the trustees such that the names and social security numbers of the individual workers would be deleted.the court further concluded,however,that the trustees need for unredacted certified payroll records from the district outweighs the workers constitutional privacy interests in the personal information contained in the cprs.as a result,the court ruled that,despite the language of section,subdivision e,the lausd was required to produce unredacted versions of cprs 
iii.discussion 
personal employee information contained within an awarding agency copies of certified payroll records is subject to a conditional privilege 
the purpose of this appeal is to resolve a recurring discovery dispute regarding the effect of section,subdivision e.the lausd contends that subdivision e,in conjunction with evidence code section,creates an absolute privilege that permits the district to redact person
