appellant craig mobley brought suit against the los angeles unified school district lausd,the department of industrial relations,division of labor standards enforcement dlse,and five individuals in a dispute arising out of his alleged failure to pay prevailing wages to his workers in connection with a school construction project.demurrer was sustained on the ground that the petition was barred by a day statute of limitations,other claims were barred by a statute of limitations,and the individuals were immune from suit.we conclude that dlse failed to afford appellant the hearing to which he was entitled and that the claim was not barred by the statute of limitations,and therefore reverse as to dlse.we affirm as to all other parties.
factual and procedural background 
the subcontract 
in april,appellant entered into a subcontract with general contractor lewis jorge construction management,the contractor to perform,in the words of the subcontract,all lath plaster system work on the queen anne place elementary school project for lausd.under the contract,every worker was to be paid not less than the prevailing wage rate for this area this is a requirement of state law and must be included in any public works contract.
the february letter 
in january,appellant wrote to the department of industrial relations,division of labor statistics and research requesting prevailing wage information.in response,appellant received correspondence from dorothy vuksich dated february.the letter stated that it was enclosing copies of the general prevailing wage determinations made by the director of industrial relations for all crafts within the county.the letter further provided when referencing our prevailing wage determinations,please note that if the prevailing wage determination which was in effect on the bid advertisement date of a project has a double asterisk after the expiration date,the rate must be updated on the following date to reflect the predetermined rate change s.however,if the prevailing wage determination which was in effect on the bid advertisement date of a project has a single asterisk after the expiration date,the rate will be good for the life of the project.
the letter went on to state for purposes of public works projects,prevailing wage rate requests should include the bid advertisement date,craft s classifications s,and location of the project.since your letter does not provide us with the exact bid advertisement date,nor the appropriate craft s classification s,we must stress that the enclosed determinations are strictly for informational purposes only.
prevailing wage dispute and request for hearing 
on june,a notice to withhold was issued by lausd signed by contract compliance officer milton frazier,directing the contractor to withhold from amounts payable to appellant,representing in wages and in penalties.on june,a letter was sent to the contractor,also signed by frazier,warning that a prevailing wage violation complaint had been filed for failure to pay the correct prevailing wages.a conference to afford the opportunity to introduce any mitigating factors was scheduled for june.
the contractor sent a letter to appellant notifying him of the hearing scheduled with lausd.the letter explained that there appeared to be a problem regarding misclassification and also overtime pay and i t appears they are questioning the trainee pay rate,the mix of journeyman apprentices,and the pay rate of some saturday work.
the june,meeting between lausd and appellant apparently went forward without resolving the dispute.on august,after much further correspondence,appellant requested a formal administrative hearing pursuant to title of the california code of regulations,section,which provides that upon request of a party,a hearing will be conducted by dlse to determine whether or not reasonable cause exists for the retention of funds set forth in a notice to withhold.section is part of a set of emergency regulations which took effect on february.
lausd protested that at the time the notice to withhold issued,the regulations were not in place and that,therefore,appellant situation was not covered.lausd also argued that appellant had been afforded the necessary due process intended by the emergency regulations at the june meeting.appellant,who was at that time represented by counsel,argued in response that he had not been given an opportunity to produce evidence or witnesses at the june meeting,and that it was not appropriate for lausd,the party that withheld the funds,to have the final say on whether the retention was reasonable.the hearing officer,julie macey,decided to go forward with the administrative hearings based in part on the understanding that the project has not been completed or formally accepted,and lausd continues to withhold funds based on the alleged prevailing wage violations.
administrative hearing 
the hearing was held on october.the hearing officer stated at the start that the purpose of the hearing was not to reach a final determination as to whether or not prevailing wages were properly paid,but rather whether or not there was reasonable cause to withhold sums set forth on a notice to withhold pending a final determination.charla curtis,the labor compliance coordinator who had replaced milton frazier,and tybouy,a labor compliance technician,appeared on behalf of lausd.
curtis testified that the bid advertisement dates were december,and december,which meant that the wage determinations for august,were in effect.she testified that all of appellant laborers were being paid the wage rate although,under the wage determination,there should be a certain number of journeyman laborers when laborers were employed.she further testified that the payroll records showed appellant journeyman employees were being paid at the lather and drywaller rate rather than the plasterer rate.she believed appellant journeyman employees were properly classified as plasterers because,according to a subcontractor list prepared by the contractor,appellant had contracted to perform plastering and a different subcontract was contracted to perform drywall work.curtis further testified that the journeyman employees were shown as working on saturday without overtime compensation,although there was no inclement weather clause in effect for plasterers or laborers 
curtis explained that the notice to withhold was filed as a result of an audit conducted by the labor compliance unit of the equal opportunity section for lausd.she believed that the review was initiated because noticed some inconsistencies while engaged in a routine review of appellant certified payroll records.curtis put into evidence the audit and the certified payroll records on which it was based.she understood that former labor compliance coordinator frazier had placed calls to appellant and had discussions with him about the inconsistencies noted by frazier reportedly was told by appellant that the journeyman employees shown on the payroll were plasterers.frazier reportedly advised appellant that the lack of journeyman laborers was a problem.
curtis was asked by appellant counsel why he was charged the highest possible penalty of per day.she responded because generally the labor commissioner does give us that kind of leeway.if it going to be less,then we have to submit additional documentation to prove that it was a mistake or that it was inadvertent.and in this particular case,i did think that it would be applicable because my predecessor contacted appellant a couple of times to let him know that in the certified payroll records there were possible violations.she further testified that to her knowledge,no one had received a lesser penalty on the sliding scale.
testified that when she reviewed appellant certified payroll records,she noticed that journeyman was listed but not what category.she brought it to frazier attention.later,frazier told her that he had spoken to appellant and was told that they were plasterers.frazier also told that he had tried to discuss the ratio with appellant,but that he did not get to finish the conversation.
appellant denied telling frazier that his journeyman employees were plasterers.he testified that most of his people were and were likely to be doing different things on different days or at different times during the day.he believed that the journeyman workers he employed for other categories satisfied the wage determination requirement for a certain number of journeyman employees for every laborer.he testified that he followed the wage determinations for august received in conjunction with the february letter from vuksich.
wage determinations 
the wage determination for laborers issued august,put into evidence at the hearing,provides saturdays in the same work week may be worked at if job is shut down during work week due to inclement weather.it further provides the ratio of trainees will be one trainee for one journeyman laborer up to four journeymen laborer and one trainee for every four journeymen laborer thereafter.the wage determination for drywall issued august,provides saturdays in the same work week may be worked at if job is shut down during the normal work week due to inclement weather.both wage determinations state that they are set to expire june.the date is followed by a double asterisk,and the wage determinations go on to say the rate to be paid for work performed after this date has been determined.if work will extend past this date,the new rate must be paid and should be incorporated in contracts entered into now.
the wage determination for laborer issued august,has an expiration date of june,followed by a single asterisk.it states that it is effective until superseded by a new determination issued by the director of industrial relations.the august wage determinations for laborer and drywall also reflect an increase in the hourly wage.otherwise the wage determinations issued in august are essentially the same as the ones issued in august,including the ratio requirement for laborers versus journeyman laborers.
we can find no separate wage determination for plasterers in the record which has been provided to us.the only document referencing plasterers appears to be a summary of all wage determinations for the to period and shows the salary payable to plasterers and various other crafts but nothing more.the hourly rate shown for plasterers is about more than the rate for drywall shown on the wage determinations.
findings of hearing officer 
the hearing officer issued a written decision and order making the following findings on december,and again on december,lausd advertised the queen anne place school project for bid.appellant entered into a contract to perform plaster work on such project.lausd conducted an investigation,obtaining certified payroll records from appellant company.the records identified two classifications of and the hourly wages indicated that the journeyman employees had been classified as lathers and that the laborers were entry level.performed an audit using wage determinations issued in august based on reclassifying the journeyman workers as journeyman plasterers and the workers as journeyman laborers.the journeyman plaster er was determined to be appropriate based on the scope of work appellant contracted for and the fact that another contractor had contracted for the lathing work.the classification of journeyman labor er was used in that the wage determination requires that there be a specific ratio of entry level laborers to journeyman.the certified payroll records did not set forth any journeyman laborers.accordingly,determined the entry level laborer classification had been used incorrectly.
the hearing officer considered and rejected appellant arguments that the wage determinations issued in rather than the ones issued in august should have been used to calculate proper wage levels and that under the wage determinations,work could be performed on saturdays without payment of overtime if necessitated by bad weather that the journeyman employees were lathers not plasterers and that the presence of journeymen of any trade could meet the requirement for a certain ratio of journeymen to laborers.the hearing officer concluded that reasonable cause exists for the withholding or retaining of the sum set forth in the notice to withhold.
original petition and complaint 
a notice of the findings and the decision and order thereon was served on appellant on october.on january,appellant,acting in pro,filed a pleading which he entitled petition for administrative mandamus ccp section,attorney fees,and damages ccp section complaint for declaratory relief,damages,attorney fees uscs section.the named defendants were lausd,dlse,kirk rascoe,curtis,frazier,and macey.as we have seen,curtis,and frazier were lausd employees involved in the investigation of the wage violation and macey was the hearing officer.rascoe was alleged to be the director of the equal opportunity section in which the lausd employees worked.
appellant claimed to be seeking relief under title of the california code of regulations,the administrative procedure act,and united states code section hereafter section.he alleged that he paid laborers based on the wage designation received in,which he believed was correct,and that inclement weather caused the saturday work.he further alleged that his workers performed both lath and plaster work and that the journeyman laborer to entry labor ratio was misapplied.he accused the individual defendants of testifying falsely or withholding information at the hearing.in the prayer,appellant asked the court to set aside the decision of the hearing officer and independently evaluate the evidence or order a new trial.he also asked for attorney fees and for compensatory and punitive damages.
respondent lausd demurred to the petition contending that the writ was barred by the statute of limitations derived from government code sections and lausd could not be held liable for the torts of its employees under section a section claim could not be based on negligence and the pleading was uncertain,ambiguous,and unintelligible.the demurrer also made the point that lausd was not a proper subject of a writ because it did not conduct the administrative hearing.in a separate motion,lausd moved to strike appellant request for punitive damages on a section claim under the holding in newport fact concerts,d the lausd employees demurred separately,asserting essentially the same grounds,and further asserting that they were entitled to absolute immunity from any claim based on their testimony as witnesses in a judicial or proceeding.
dlse and macey demurred on the ground that the petition was untimely that it sought section damages without alleging a violation of official policy or custom that macey was immune from suit as a officer and that the pleading was vague,uncertain,and ambiguous.
the court ruled that the demurrers and motion to strike as well as a motion to transfer filed by appellant were moot because,while they were pending,appellant submitted a first amended complaint.the court instructed appellant to file and serve a second amended complaint specifying the causes of action,stating which cause of action was alleged against which party,and otherwise complying with the procedural rules.
second amended complaint and writ petition 
appellant filed a second amended complaint.the first cause of action for relief under section against all respondents alleged that a violation of appellant constitutional rights occurred on june,when frazier and rascoe signed the notice of withholding without prior hearing.it further alleged that the individual respondents ignore d printed determinations and immediately charge d wage violations at the highest penalties and with erroneous assumptions.
appellant filed a separate pleading for administrative mandamus,which also included claims for breach of duty,malicious interference of economic capacity,negligent interference,prejudicial abuse of discretion,constitutional misconduct,intentional interference,and negligence.in support of the mandamus request,appellant alleged that respondents wrongfully decided that reasonable cause existed to withhold funds from appellant,failed to grant him a fair trial and meaningful opportunity to be heard,and deprived him of an opportunity to rebut the evidence offered by lausd witnesses.appellant further alleged that respondents failed to provide adequate notice of charges or provide sufficient information prior to the hearing to allow appellant to present his defense,citing government code section.
motion to strike and demurrers 
the lausd respondents moved to strike on the ground that the court had not given permission to file two separate pleadings.these respondents also demurred,raising all of the grounds previously argued.in addition,respondents contended that the section claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations that the lausd employees had absolute immunity from claims derived from their participation in the administrative hearing that appellant was wrongly attempting to base claims on settlement documents that appellant failed to submit a claim under the california tort claims act prior to filing the lawsuit that appellant failed to identify any duty breached and that appellant claims were otherwise not based on any cognizable legal theory.
dlse and macey demurred on the grounds that the statute of limitations in government code sections and precluded consideration of the writ the failure to file a claim under the california tort claims act precluded recovery macey was entitled to immunity in her role as a officer and the pleading was vague,ambiguous,and uncertain.
the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend on the ground that appellant claims were by a statute of limitations for section claims and a statute of limitations to seek judicial review of administrative decisions.the court further ruled that the individual defendants were immune from personal liability.
appellant moved for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section.the court denied the motion.this appeal followed.
discussion 
before we can reach the issues raised in the briefs concerning the trial court ruling,we must discuss lujan g g fire sprinklers,d,a united states supreme court opinion filed while this appeal was pending,after briefing had concluded the supreme court tentative ly upheld the validity of the statutory scheme governing prevailing wage disputes,subject to its understanding as to how certain issues would be resolved by california courts in the future.id.at.at.to understand the impact of the holding on the present case,we start with a discussion of the ninth circuit decisions which preceded it.
the original ninth circuit decision,and the apparent impetus for the promulgation of the emergency regulations under which the administrative hearing here was held,was g g fire sprinklers,bradshaw cir,judgment vacated and cause remanded for reconsideration in bradshaw g g fire sprinklers,d.in g g fire sprinklers,the court held that the state longstanding practice of withholding payments and penalties from amounts owed to subcontractors for alleged prevailing wage violations without notice or hearing constituted deprivation of a protectible property interest without due process of law.at.
in declaring the procedure violative of due process,the ninth circuit gave its understanding of the procedures being followed by state agencies at the time,which we quote at length because it accurately summarizes the procedures in effect when the notice to withhold sums from amounts payable to appellant was issued the california labor code requires contractors and subcontractors on public works projects to pay a prevailing wage to all their workers.cal.to enforce this requirement,the body awarding the contract the awarding body is allowed to withhold funds from a prime contractor should it determine that the contractor or one of its subcontractors has violated the prevailing wage law.the state is authorized to withhold an amount equal to the total amount that all the workers have been underpaid,as well as up to per day,per worker in fines for each instance in which the contractor fails to pay the prevailing wage.a withholding order can only be issued after a full investigation by dlse or the awarding body,unless the withholding is from the final payment to be made to the prime contractor.if the violator is a subcontractor,the prime contractor is authorized to withhold an equivalent amount from its payments to the subcontractor.all of these provisions must be incorporated into all public works contracts.cal.admin.code,title.
a notice to withhold to an awarding body is a standard procedure utilized by dlse,but no notice or hearing is required prior to its issuance.dlse is not required to produce any evidence of a violation of the law,no specific standard is applied in determining whether to issue a notice to withhold,and no procedure exists to guard against the issuance of improper or excessive notices to withhold although as a general rule,information from a must be verified with an independent source and recommendations to withhold must be reviewed by a supervisor.g g fire sprinklers,bradshaw,supra,at.
the court went on to explain its understanding of the remedies available to recover withheld funds the exclusive remedy after withholding is a lawsuit by the prime contractor against the awarding body for recovery of the money withheld.such a suit must be filed within days of the withholding,and the contractor bears the burden of establishing that there was no violation.dlse may defend the lawsuit upon request by the awarding body.id.subcontractors are not given the right to bring suit,although a prime contractor is allowed to assign its right to sue.id.if a suit is not brought within days,the state disburses the withheld funds to the underpaid workers if a suit is brought within this period,then the money is held in escrow until its resolution.g g fire sprinklers,bradshaw,supra,at.
based on this understanding,the court concluded s ubcontractors are afforded neither a prenor hearing when payments are withheld.once the state determines that a violation of the prevailing wage law has occurred,it may withhold and disburse money directly to the workers and may impose fines both without providing any hearing at which the subcontractor might challenge the validity of the state finding.accordingly,subcontractors have no opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time in a meaningful manner.citation.this scheme violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.g g fire sprinklers,bradshaw,supra,at,fn.omitted.the court rejected the state argument that due process was satisfied because an aggrieved party could bring a suit against the contractor on the contract,on the ground that it doubt ed the viability of a subcontractor hypothetical suit against a prime contractor based on theories of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing or equitable subrogation.the state and amici curiae have been unable to cite a single california case utilizing either theory in this context.the prime contractor could easily defeat any breach of covenant suit by demonstrating that its withholding of payment was authorized by law.see and the facts of this case clearly do not meet the traditional elements of equitable subrogation.citations.at,fn.
the united states supreme court vacated and remanded the ninth circuit decision for reconsideration in light of its decision in american mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d,a case in which the court upheld a pennsylvania law that required employers to pay for all reasonable and necessary medical treatment for injuries,but permitted the insurer to withhold payment if it disputed its reasonableness or necessity.the ninth circuit did as instructed,but continued to adhere to the view that the subcontractors due process rights were violated because the california statutory scheme afforded no hearing at all when state officials directed that payments be withheld.g g fire sprinklers,bradshaw cir,fn.omitted.the court also continued to believe that the withholding represented state action the withholding in sullivan was carried out by a private insurer exercising its discretion in a way permitted by state law.the withholding here was specifically directed by state officials in an environment where the withholding party has no discretion at all.id.at.
that second decision was reversed on april,by the supreme court in lujan.essentially,the supreme court reversed because it disagreed with the ninth circuit understanding of california law.because we believe that california law affords respondent sufficient opportunity to pursue the claim for payments due under the contract in state court,the california statutory scheme does not deprive the subcontractor of its claim for payment without due process of law.citation.lujan g g fire sprinklers,supra,at.at.
the court specifically considered the impact of sections and of the labor code which provide that the contractor and his or her assignees may sue the awarding body on the contract for alleged breach thereof for the recovery of wages or penalties,and that suit on the contract against the awarding body is the exclusive remedy of the contractor or his or her assignees with respect to the recovery of withheld wages and penalties.as we have seen,the ninth circuit had concluded the exclusive remedy after withholding is a lawsuit by the prime contractor against the awarding body for recovery of the money withheld subcontractors are not given the right to bring suit,although a prime contractor is allowed to assign its right to sue.g g fire sprinklers,bradshaw,supra,at.the supreme court expressed concern about what might happen if the subcontractor could not obtain assignment of the right to sue the awarding body under the contract,but ultimately concluded that in that situation,subcontractors may pursue their claims for payment by bringing a standard suit against the contractor under california law.lujan g g fire sprinklers,supra,at.at.although that view was necessarily tentative,since the final determination of the question rests in the hands of the california courts,the subcontractor having failed to convince the court that this avenue of relief is closed to it failed to meet its burden to prove that the statutory withholding scheme was unconstitutional.ibid.
to support its tentative view that california law permitted the subcontractor to pursue a claim directly,the supreme court cited j k painting bradshaw th,d.in j k painting,a painting subcontractor,paintco,instituted an action to challenge the practice of imposing penalties for prevailing wage violations at the maximum statutory rate and sending a notice to withhold to the prime contractor including that amount prior to conducting a thorough investigation.in the action,paintco sought a writ of mandamus,ordering the commissioner of labor to exercise her discretion as required by statute and initiate a full investigation into the alleged prevailing wage violations of petitioner,and all others similarly situated,and make a determination before imposing any penalties under labor code,th at,d.although the opinion does not specifically so state,discussion of section of the code of civil procedure within the text indicates that the petition for writ was brought under code of civil procedure section,the provision governing traditional mandamus.see j k painting,at,d.
the commissioner contended that paintco lacked standing since the funds were withheld from the general contractor and that mandamus was inappropriate because paintco had one or more plain,speedy,and adequate remedies at law,including a statutory suit,under an assignment from the general contractor,for the recovery of penalties from the awarding body recordation of a stop notice against the project for nonpayment under the subcontract and suit against the general contractor under the subcontract.j k painting bradshaw,supra,th at,d.
the court considered and rejected these procedural defenses because the general contractor withheld funds from paintco as section expressly empowered it to do,paintco was directly aggrieved by the withholding,and possesses a direct interest in a determination of its lawfulness.j k painting bradshaw,supra,th at,d.further,none of the proceedings mentioned by the commissioner as adequate substitutes for a writ proceeding would afford the relief sought by paintco,a determination that the practice regularly employed by the commissioner to collect penalties is unlawful,and a writ commanding that it cease.id.at,d.a statutory suit against the awarding body would be limited to the recovery of the wages and penalties,and would permit n o other issues to be presented to the court.the statutory procedure is at least equally limited,and indulging the doubtful assumption that it might otherwise be applicable could well become before an aggrieved subcontractor even learned funds were being withheld a suit against the contractor on the subcontract can not afford any relief against the awarding body or the commissioner,and would typically be subject to arguably preclusive defenses based either on customary contract clauses or on the provisions of the prevailing wage law itself j k painting,at,d,fns.omitted.
the commissioner further argued that paintco writ petition was precluded because section explicitly provides the exclusive remedy for one in the subcontractor position.j k painting bradshaw,supra,th at,d.as the supreme court recognized in lujan,the court did not agree with that assessment paintco falls within the statute only if it was an assignee of the general contractor claims for the withheld funds.the statute perhaps should,but does not,declare that a subcontractor becomes an assignee of the contractor rights by operation of law where,as here,the contractor passes retained penalties to the subcontractor by withholding.the commissioner therefore fails to establish that the subcontractor can or should be viewed as an assignee of the general contractor statutory right of action.j k painting,at,d,fns.omitted.noting that t he real gist of the commissioner argument appears to be that the statute impliedly required a subcontractor in paintco position to obtain an assignment from the contractor,and that failure to do so was fatal to any other attempt to secure relief,the court went on to state no such requirement is expressly imposed,and a legislative intent to create remedial exclusivity will not be inferred where the remedy in question is patently inadequate.citation.a remedy which depends for its very existence on the will or whim of another certainly appears patently inadequate,fn.
as we understand the supreme court decision in lujan,the withholding of construction funds due to a suspected prevailing wage law violation prior to any type of hearing and in the absence of a prompt hearing does not give rise to a due process violation as long as some avenue of relief is available to permit the subcontractor to reclaim the sums withheld.according to the supreme court,it is up to california courts to ensure some avenue of relief is open.the court indicated that the availability of a standard breach of contract suit against the contractor would suffice.in addition,it cited with approval the decision in j k painting in which the court held that a petition for ordinary writ under code of civil procedure section could be maintained directly against the state agency under certain circumstances.
for the reasons discussed in g g fire sprinklers and j k painting,we see serious limitations with the breach of contract avenue.there are numerous unresolved legal issues that could prelude recovery on a suit for breach of contract by the subcontractor against the contractor.for example,the contractor might raise a defense under a pay when paid provision.one appellate court has held that pay when paid clauses are invalid capitol steel fabricators,mega construction th,d,but in doing so it recognized that existing supreme court authority does not resolve the issue.id.at,d see clarke safeco ins.cal th,d,invalidating a pay when paid clause in a suit against a surety in a suit under a payment bond and a private works contract.the statement in labor code section that withholding sums from the subcontractor to cover penalties shall be lawful could be raised as a defense.a contractor might also raise a waiver or estoppel defense if a breach of contract suit were to be filed within four years the contractual statute of limitations,but too late for the contractor to recover from the agency under other provisions.on a more pragmatic note,a dispute between a state agency and a subcontractor concerning payment of prevailing wages can not be efficiently resolved by a breach of contract suit against the contractor.generally,the contractor acts as a conduit in withholding payments.it does not conduct the investigation or determine the appropriate penalty and,therefore,would have very little knowledge of the pertinent facts.as a nonparty to the litigation,the agency would not be subject to ordinary discovery,and essential documents and witnesses testimony would have to be obtained through the cumbersome process of subpoena.
legislation enacted last year may have rendered these issues moot for future litigants.the amendments to the relevant statutory provisions added new sections added by stats,ch,and of the labor code,effective july,added by stats,ch,which clarify that an administrative hearing on the merits must be afforded both contractors and subcontractors in appellant position.under new section,if the labor commissioner determines after an investigation that there has been a prevailing wage violation,the commissioner is to issue a civil wage and penalty assessment to the contractor or subcontractor or both.the assessment shall advise the contractor and subcontractor of the procedure for obtaining review of the assessment,italics added.under new section,the affected contractor or subcontractor can obtain review of the assessment by written request to the commissioner within days after service of the assessment,subd.a,italics added.the subject of the hearing will be whether the basis for the civil wage and penalty assessment is incorrect with the contractor or subcontractor having the burden of proof on that issue,subd.b.within days after the hearing,the director shall issue a written decision affirming,modifying,or dismissing the assessment.ibid.thereafter,the affected contractor or subcontractor may obtain review of the decision of the administrative law judge by filing a petition for a writ of mandate to the appropriate superior court pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure within days after service of the decision,subd.c.
with these recent developments in mind,we turn to the issues raised by the trial court order.
insofar as the individual respondents are concerned,the section claims completely lack merit.appellant attempted to assert a section claim against the individual defendants based on their allegedly inadequate investigation of the facts and the positions they took during the administrative hearing concerning the proper interpretation of the laws regulating prevailing wage payments.the cause of action under section contained the following allegations curtis testified to her thorough review of appellant contract and scope of work as well as providing the correct wage determination testified to her calculations and investigations which in themselves were erroneous and factually inaccurate rascoe signed the document that initiated the taking as well as acknowledge d on that document that he had investigated the facts.
as respondents rightly point out,persons involved as judicial officers or witnesses in judicial or quasijudicial hearings are entitled to immunity from civil rights suits pierson ray,d briscoe lahue,d holding that even a witness who commits perjury is entitled to immunity,and negligent acts can not give rise to a section claim daniels williams,d.more fundamentally,the allegations contained in appellant pleadings do not come close to the level needed to constitute a serious section claim.the individual respondents were not violating appellant civil rights by taking the position that his journeyman workers were plasterers and deserving of a higher wage any more than appellant was violating his workers civil rights by taking the opposite position.all the allegations prove is that the parties disagreed about how to apply relevant law to known facts.if honest disputes about legal and factual matters were all it took to support a section claim,we would be awash in them.
appellant attempts to assert other types of claims against the individual respondents also lack merit to be valid,a pleading must contain factual allegations supporting the existence of all the essential elements of a known cause of action.plaintiffs can not simply cite a few facts and then invent causes of action to cover them.reckless disregard of property rights,constitutional misconduct,malicious misconduct,malicious interference of economic capacity,and breach of duty are not recognized causes of action under california law.misrepresentation is a valid type of claim,of course.however,essential elements of a misrepresentation claim are clearly missing under the facts set forth by appellant.statements made at an administrative hearing that facts have been investigated and wage laws have been violated do not constitute actionable misconduct under any theory.appellant attempt to involve the individual respondents in his lawsuit serves no conceivable purpose,and muddies the real issues he raises concerning the proper interpretation of the prevailing wage laws.
insofar as dlse was concerned,the demurrer should not have been sustained on statute of limitations grounds.the source of appellant complaint against dlse was related to the october,hearing.he denied he was given a fair hearing or meaningful opportunity to be heard.referring to section et,of title of the california code of regulations,respondents contend that specific statutory regulations were established to ensure that appellant would be afforded his administrative hearing and that the october hearing ensured that appellant due process rights were protected when the department of industrial relations and dlse conducted a hearing to determine the reasonableness of lausd withholding,as was required by g g sprinklers.appellant disagrees,stating in his brief that respondents did not provide a prompt hearing to determine the true owner of the funds that were withheld 
as we have seen,the ninth circuit held in g g fire sprinklers that due process required a prompt hearing addressing whether a prevailing wage violation had occurred to support the withholding of funds.as we have also seen,the united states supreme court overturned the holding in g g fire sprinklers but did so with the proviso that some authentic avenue for recovery of the funds must be made available to affected subcontractors under california law.finally,we have seen that the legislature now mandates a hearing on the issue of whether the basis asserted for the wage and penalty assessment is correct or incorrect.
the hearing provided by the emergency regulations is wholly inadequate and does not comply with either the courts rulings or the statute.section of title of the california code of regulations provides the hearing pursuant to this section shall only determine whether reasonable cause exists for the withholding,retention,or forfeiture of funds pursuant to labor code.a hearing pursuant to this section shall not be deemed to be dispositive as to the contractor or affected subcontractor compliance with prevailing wage laws.any decision rendered shall have no res judicata or collateral estoppel effect,and will not preclude the labor commissioner from pursuing any action provided by labor code or any other statutory or common law remedy against any party.neither the failure of a party to request a hearing nor the labor commissioner decision after a hearing shall preclude the contractor or affected subcontractor from pursuing any other remedy provided by existing law,tit,subd.e,italics added.in other words,instead of a administrative proceeding to resolve the issue of whether the prevailing wage laws had in fact been violated,the regulations offer a preliminary hearing.they leave to some other forum in which the parties are pursuing an unidentified and possibly nonexistent remedy provided by existing law the chore of deciding whether a violation did or did not actually occur.
nor did the hearing officer purport to resolve whether or not appellant had violated the prevaili
