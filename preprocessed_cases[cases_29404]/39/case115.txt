this is an appeal by james jackson following jackson conditional guilty plea pursuant to a plea agreement to three counts of a twenty count indictment alleging violations of for making false statements on a matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,legislative,or judicial branch of the government.jackson unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the indictment in the district court.jackson false statements consisted of his submissions of false timesheets to his employer,northrop grumman corporation ng,a subcontractor for the prime contractor,computer sciences corporation csc,on a contract with the national security agency nsa.jackson contends that these statements were not made in relation to a matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch because,under the circumstances,nsa had no power to exercise authority.we reject jackson argument and affirm.
a grand jury of the united states district court for the district of maryland indicted jackson on twenty counts of violating for submitting false timesheets to his employer,which ultimately resulted in the expenditure of nsa funds.jackson moved to dismiss the indictment pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure b on the ground that it failed to allege an offense over which the united states has jurisdiction.jackson argued that his submission of inaccurate timesheets to his employer,which in turn was a subcontractor to a general contractor to a united states agency,were not statements within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states under.the district court denied the motion,finding that the expenditure of nsa funds was sufficient to invoke nsa jurisdiction.according to the district court,the agency ultimate duty to safeguard the proper spending of federal funds provides the required jurisdictional nexus.quoting united states ross,cir.the district court found nsa power to exercise authority further augmented by its authority to revoke jackson security clearance,thereby denying him access to the work site a nsa facility,as well as by its authority to terminate its contract with csc.
following the denial of his motion to dismiss,jackson entered into a plea agreement with the united states that called for jackson to enter a conditional guilty plea to three of the twenty counts,while preserving his right to contest on appeal the district court order denying his motion to dismiss the indictment.jackson then pled guilty pursuant to the plea agreement,and the district court received a stipulation of facts in support of the plea,which the parties further stipulated were not all the facts the government would have proven had the case proceeded to trial on a plea of not guilty.
according to the stipulation,at all relevant times nsa has been a component of the united states department of defense,which is part of the executive branch of the united states government.in or about july,nsa contracted with csc to obtain certain messaging services.csc provided those services under the terms of a contract the contract.csc entered into a subcontract with a division of ng pursuant to which ng employees worked on the contract.ng employed jackson to work on the contract at nsa headquarters at fort george meade,maryland.the nsa associate directorate for security and counterintelligence nsa security granted jackson access to the nsa site.
ng paid jackson based on timesheets that jackson submitted electronically every.those timesheets were supposed to reflect the hours that jackson worked on the contract during each pay period.based in part on the hours that jackson recorded on his timesheets,ng periodically invoiced csc for the hours worked on the contract.csc,in turn,periodically invoiced nsa for the hours that jackson reported working.nsa paid csc for the hours,and csc paid ng,which paid jackson.
between september and january,jackson submitted numerous false timesheets to ng claiming that he worked approximately hours more than he actually worked on the contract.csc ultimately invoiced nsa for the hours jackson falsely claimed to have worked and this led to nsa paying csc for work jackson did not perform.the government contends that this caused nsa to pay approximately for unperformed work.jackson disputes this amount,but acknowledges that the overpayment was between and.
nsa did not learn of jackson unworked hours until after it had already paid csc for those hours,and after csc in turn had already paid ng for them.according to the stipulation,if nsa had determined that the terms of the contract were not being met,nsa contracting officer would have worked directly with csc contracting office to determine how best to address the problem.if csc failed to remedy the timesheet issue,nsa would have had the option of either terminating the contract with csc or demanding repayment from csc for hours jackson did not work.if an nsa auditor had received an allegation that jackson was not working the hours he claimed in his timesheets,the auditor would have had the authority to obtain timesheets and billing records in order to determine the amount of overpayment so that nsa could seek to recoup that amount from csc.
by the time nsa office of inspector general began its investigation of jackson timesheets,he was no longer working on the contract due to a reduction in force.if,at any time while he was still working on the contract,nsa security had learned that jackson had not actually worked all of the hours he had claimed in his timesheets,nsa security could have suspended or revoked his access to nsa facilities and information.this would have prevented jackson from performing any additional work on the contract.
jackson pled guilty to three counts involving three pay periods in july and august of.for that period,jackson falsely claimed to have worked a total of and a half hours that he did not actually work.ng invoiced csc for those hours,and csc in turn invoiced nsa for them.
jackson argues that nsa was created by executive order,not by statute,and that therefore,it has no statutory basis to access his timesheets.it follows,he contends,that absent statutory authority a key underpinning to the government rationale is clearly missing from this case and the conviction should be reversed.appellant brief at.we find this reasoning flawed on a number of levels,reject it,and find that jackson falsified timesheets,which ultimately were invoiced by csc to nsa,are matters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch under.
section a makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully make a materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,legislative,or judicial branch of the government of the united states.the supreme court has held that the within the jurisdiction language of the statute merely differentiates the official,or authorized functions of an agency or department from matters that are peripheral to the business of that body.united states rodgers.accordingly,the term jurisdiction should not be given a narrow or technical meaning for purposes of.id.at.the term refers to the department or agency power to exercise authority in a particular situation,id.at,and that power need not include the power to make final or binding determinations.id.at.
before applying that practical,standard to the particular situation at hand we note that jackson argument,which focuses exclusively on nsa authority in relation to his falsified timesheets,does not properly frame the issue.in,congress amended the jurisdictional element of.see false statements accountability act of,stat.codified as amended at.the previous version specified that the matter pertaining to the false statement must be within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states.the amendment,however,broadened the scope of the statute to include any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,legislative,or judicial branch of the government of the united states.united states atalig,cir.in light of the amendment,the question of jurisdiction here,when properly framed,is whether jackson falsified timesheets fell within the jurisdiction of the executive branch.id.at.
