metric constructors,entered into a contract with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa to build the space station processing facility sspf at the kennedy space center in florida.meisner electric,performed electrical work on the project under a subcontract from metric.after its work on the contract was completed,meisner filed claims through metric against the government,requesting an equitable adjustment in the contract price.the contracting officer denied the request,and metric filed this action in the united states court of federal claims.
the government argued that a july document executed by meisner had the effect of releasing metric and the government from all further liability on the contract,and that metric action in the court of federal claims therefore had to be dismissed.the court agreed and held that the july document constituted a full release of metric and the government and therefore foreclosed any further claims on the contract by metric on meisner behalf.metric appealed.
this case,like many contract disputes,turns on the interpretation of a document the july release that was poorly drafted and thus left the parties in a state of legitimate disagreement as to its meaning.while we sympathize with the trial court effort to make sense of a document that is difficult to interpret,we conclude that the document did not have the legal effect of releasing the government from any further claims asserted by meisner through the prime contractor,metric.we therefore reverse the summary judgment in favor of the government and remand the case for further proceedings before the court of federal claims.
the pivotal question in this case is whether the july release that meisner issued to metric released metric from any further liability on its subcontract with meisner and thus extinguished metric right to pursue a claim against the government on meisner behalf.to resolve that question requires a review of the background of the release as well as an examination of the precise language used in the disputed document.
nasa entered into the contract with metric to build the sspf in early.shortly thereafter,metric entered into a subcontract with meisner to do the electrical work in the facility,for a price of.
work under the electrical subcontract did not proceed smoothly.there were many changes to the contract,which increased the subcontract price to more than.when the work was completed,meisner contended that a total of remained to be paid on the subcontract,not counting requests for equitable adjustment.however,in part because of a dispute between meisner and another subcontractor,metric advised meisner that it could not make any further payments to meisner at that time.metric added that it would be making settlement offers to meisner on all the extra work orders and would adjust meisner subcontract accordingly.
in march,metric forwarded a subcontract change order to meisner that increased the revised amount of the subcontract and,according to metric,resolved all of meisner extra work over invoices on this project with the exception of one small invoice.several months later,meisner sought metric aid in requesting an equitable adjustment from nasa relating to costs and schedule impacts throughout the performance of the subcontract.
on april,metric and nasa reached a settlement on an equitable adjustment claim related to meisner work on the contract for the sspf substation transformer.nasa agreed to pay to resolve the claim,and metric agreed to pay of that amount to meisner.nine days later,metric and meisner entered into an agreement,termed the liquidation agreement,which referred to meisner claims for additional compensation under its subcontract based on actions and inactions by nasa.the agreement sought to establish the procedure for adjudication of meisner claims and for establishing and releasing metric and meisner respective liabilities as to those claims.metric agreed to pay meisner that metric had withheld based on the dispute between meisner and another subcontractor.in addition,metric agreed to present meisner claims to nasa and assist in prosecuting those claims,subject to metric being permitted to retain an portion of any recovery for itself,as general contractor.
on the same day that the liquidation agreement was signed,meisner issued to metric a form document entitled affidavit and release and subtitled partial payment.the document invoiced the payment of the by metric to meisner and granted metric a release.the release recited that meisner warranted that all labor,materials,and other expenses related to the subcontract had been paid for,and that meisner released metric and the owners of the project from all claims whatsoever arising out of or relating to the subcontract or purchase order to the extent of payments actually received.the release also waived any lien rights with respect to the project to the extent of payments actually received and agreed to indemnify metric against any claim or lien asserted through or under meisner with respect to the project.
in may of,nasa issued a formal change order to metric in the amount of for the substation transformer claim settlement.consistent with its agreement with meisner,metric then passed on of that amount to meisner.in connection with the receipt of that sum,meisner on july,issued another document similar to the april release.the july release was identical to the april release in several respects it was entitled affidavit and release and subtitled partial payment it contained language releasing metric and the project owner the government from all claims whatsoever arising out of or relating to the subcontract or purchase order to the extent of payments actually received it waived any lien rights with respect to the project to the extent of payments actually received and it promised to indemnify metric against any claim or lien asserted through or under meisner with respect to the project.
a year and a half later,metric submitted a request for equitable adjustment to nasa on meisner behalf,seeking compensation for a variety of direct costs and disruptions to meisner performance.the contracting officer denied the request in most respects.metric then converted the request to a claim,and when the claim was denied metric filed its complaint as a suit in the court of federal claims.in a suit,a prime contractor that is liable for damages sustained by its subcontractor may bring claims against the government on behalf of the subcontractor.see mitchell constr.danzig.a suit is necessary because subcontractors in a government contract are not in privity with the government and may not sue the government directly.
shortly before metric filed its equitable adjustment complaint,this court ruled in metric favor on a separate appeal from an adverse decision by the armed services board of contract appeals.that appeal involved a deduction that nasa had taken from metric contract for failing to install new light bulbs throughout the sspf upon completion of the electrical subcontract.this court held that the contract did not require meisner to do that work.see metric constructors,nasa.as a result,nasa issued a change order in august increasing the contract price by,and meisner received payment in that amount from metric.
before that appeal was decided,the government moved for summary judgment in the present action on the ground that the july release discharged metric and the government from any further liability on the subcontract.the government argued that because the release completely absolved metric of further liability to meisner,the claims for equitable adjustment that metric had brought on meisner behalf were barred under the severin doctrine,which provides that if a subcontractor in a government contract has released the general contractor from any liability on a claim,the general contractor can not pursue that claim against the government.see severin united states.
the trial court agreed with the government argument,granted summary judgment,and dismissed the complaint.the court construed the july release as a full release of metric and the government from liability for all cla
