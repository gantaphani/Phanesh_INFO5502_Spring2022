in january,then governor pedro rosselló of puerto rico,a member of the new progressive party npp,announced a plan to create a children museum in puerto rico.the museum,modeled on similar initiatives in boston and elsewhere,was to include interactive exhibits,a theater and other attractions.it was to be built and operated using a portion of puerto rico share of the master tobacco settlement of november.
in april,the tourism company,a state agency,created a public corporation,prisma el exploratorio,exploratorio,to develop the preliminary phase of the children museum.prisma zona says the plan was eventually to turn over ownership and control of the museum to a private entity to free it from political partisanship.the following month exploratorio secured a million line of credit with the government development bank the bank another state help pay for the design and construction of the museum facilities the line of credit was to be repaid using the tobacco settlement proceeds.ground breaking for the museum was held on october.
on july,puerto rico created the children trust fund,a public corporation,and assigned to it puerto rico share of the tobacco settlement.act of july,codified at lpra et.the statute created a board of directors for the trust fund,consisting of four ex officio members the governor,the secretary of justice,the president of the bank,and the director of the office of management and budget and three private persons appointed by the governor,and gave it broad authority to allocate trust funds to improve the welfare of puerto rico children.id.the bank provides all of the trust fund staffing,conducts its management,and serves as its disbursement agent and financial advisor.id.
on september,the trust fund board adopted regulations,pursuant to its statutory authority,establishing requirements for the receipt and use of trust funds.in addition,the board approved exploratorio request for up to million to cover museum expenses.prisma zona says the board also resolved to transfer the grant to the private entity that would eventually succeed to the project.
earlier in that same month,several private citizens formed prisma zona exploratoria de puerto rico,prisma zona,the plaintiff in this action,to take over the construction,ownership,and operation of the children museum.the company founders and management had close ties to the npp and its board of directors was selected by governor rosselló.the present case revolves around this new entity effort to secure control over the children museum and its funds and the rebuff of those efforts by a new administration under a different party.
in may,prisma zona began negotiations with the tourism company and its subsidiary exploratorio to acquire the museum assets and to assume the responsibility for its development.on june,it requested million from the trust fund to pay for the museum assets and to complete its construction and an additional million to operate it for three years.the trust fund board approved prisma zona requests on august.that day,governor rosselló as president of the trust fund board sent prisma zona a letter informing it of the board approval but noting additional required steps,including review of prisma zona budget and finalization of a contract containing details on the procedures for the disbursement of funds.
on november,the trust fund issued million in bonds to fund its projects and transferred nearly million to the bank to cancel exploratorio outstanding line of credit.both the trust fund and the bank which managed the bond sale represented in various documents including a prospectus,tax certificate,and bond contract that a portion of the bond sale proceeds would be used for the acquisition,construction,and equipping of a children museum in isla grande,santurce,puerto rico,to be owned and operated by prisma zona.
on november,prisma zona reached an understanding with the tourism company and exploratorio to acquire the museum project the transfer agreement.the following month prisma zona began negotiating a service contract with the trust fund.the trust fund prepared two form contracts one each for the capital and operational grants and sent them to prisma zona for its review on december.prisma zona says it made only minor changes to these documents before faxing them back to the trust fund the same day.the trust fund never responded.nonetheless,prisma zona alleges that at this time the parties had agreed to the terms of the service contracts and the only action needed was the ministerial act of signing the agreement.
as these events were unfolding,puerto rico was holding its elections.during the campaign for governor,sila calderón,the popular democratic party pdp candidate,promised to investigate a number of rosselló administration projects,including the children museum,for corruption and misuse of public monies.calderón defeated the npp candidate at the polls on november,and took office on january.
in its subsequent complaint prisma zona alleged that from the outset the new pdp administration attempted to undermine prisma zona role in the museum project because of its ties to npp and former governor rosselló.in particular,prisma zona said the bank as the trust fund disbursement agent has refused to pay museum invoices that prisma zona has submitted since january and that the bank subjected it to a sham audit.prisma zona also alleged that in may,the tourism company filed a frivolous suit in commonwealth court,seeking to invalidate the transfer agreement.thereafter the puerto rico superior court declared the transfer agreement void under puerto rico law.compañía de turismo de puerto rico prisma zona exploratoria de pr,april.
prisma zona filed this civil rights action in district court on june,naming as defendants the trust fund,the bank and various individuals in the calderón administration prisma zona says defendants refusal to carry through with the transfer of assets and funding was motivated by prisma zona political ties and violated its first amendment,due process,and equal protection rights.for relief,prisma zona seeks imposition of a constructive trust,disbursement of the trust funds,a generally phrased injunction against the alleged harassment,and punitive damages.after limited discovery,the district court dismissed the suit under rule b.prisma zona,d at.
the district court ruled that prisma zona did not have a binding contract with the trust fund obligating it to fund prisma zona.prisma zona,d at.the court further held that absent such a contract or its effective equivalent,an ongoing commercial relationship,the trust fund was free not to contract with prisma zona even if political motives prompted that decision.id.at.finally,the court said that even if first amendment precedents were extended to cover new entities seeking to contract,the defendants had a mount healthy defense because they would for independent reasons have refused to disburse the funds.id.at see mount healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.
the legal landscape for prisma zona first amendment claim is a set of supreme court decisions starting in the.politically motivated hiring,firing and contracting by governments has a long history in the united states civil service reform statutes are largely a response to this tradition.but beginning with elrod burns,d,the supreme court has added a new layer of protection based on first amendment grounds.see also rutan republican party of,d branti finkel,d.how far that protection extends,often a debatable matter,is an issue of law which we review de novo.
prisma zona claims that a completed contract exists between it and the trust fund.although a binding contract is not necessarily a condition of first amendment protection,it would give prisma zona a much firmer basis in supreme court precedent to argue that it was protected from a politically motivated refusal to deal,see,bd.of county comm rs umbehr,quite apart from its use as an independent basis for relief under local law.we accordingly begin with that question here.
in a nutshell,prisma zona applied to the trust fund for funding to buy the museum assets,complete construction and operate the project for three years.the trust fund governor on august,that the board had favorably considered your proposed initiative,but his letter continued 
the granting of assistance service,funding is subject to a review of the budget and the details of the initiative.prior to receiving the funds requested,you must meet with the officers of the trust to verify information and budget and to finalize the contract of assistance service.the contract must contain details on the procedures for the disbursement of funds.
the letter set forth other conditions that would govern the grant and said that if prisma zona indicated its agreement,the trust fund would arrange for a further meeting.
prisma zona indicated its agreement and in december the parties moved toward adoption of two detailed service contracts,one to fund capital commitments and the other for operating expenses.from the government standpoint,a private provider such as prisma zona agrees to provide services in exchange for the grant.however,the trust fund drafts were delivered only on december,they were returned with suggested changes by prisma zona,and no final service contracts were signed.instead,on january,a new administration took power in puerto rico and the trust fund declined to proceed.
on this appeal,prisma zona says that the original august letter and its acceptance constituted a binding contract promising funding,that this contract was not conditioned on the adoption of service contracts,and in any event the latter were virtually complete by the end of december save for a few details that were not material.prisma zona argues that under puerto rico law,contract formation is a question of fact,turning on the intent of the parties,and at the very least the fact question could not be resolved on a motion to dismiss but entitled prisma zona to a jury trial.
whether or not one calls the august letter and reply a contract,the critical question given the relief sought is whether the trust fund ever assumed a binding obligation to make grants to prisma zona.as to this,the august letter is explicit on its face conditions funds could be provided until the parties had finalized the service contracts.further,as the district court pointed out,the trust fund own formal regulations provide that a service contract will be entered into between the trust fund and the beneficiary entity and set forth issues that had to be addressed,specific clauses delineating the responsibilities of the parties.prisma zona,d at accord regulations for the requisites of eligibility and the criteria for statutory monitoring under the statute for the children fund,c trust fund regulations.
alternatively,prisma zona suggests that the letter and reply were a contract to make a contract.this assumes,as we will do at this stage,that prisma zona could develop factual evidence of such an intent on both sides.but even if assuming further this theory is allowable despite the trust fund regulations just this is far from contract to make a contract is enforceable only where all material terms have been agreed upon.corbin,contracts,at,perillo ed.prisma zona own statements,and the service contract drafts which it attaches,show that material issues were still open.
most obviously,the service contract drafts left blank a number of important terms,such as the amount of the grant.in addition,in returning the service contract drafts with proposed changes,prisma zona asked for a number of substantive changes.it wanted to limit the trust fund ability to terminate the grant for cause to an exercise of reasonable discretion.the trust fund drafts required prisma zona to indemnify the trust fund for legal expenses arising out of the a trivial matter,as this case illustrates.in response,prisma zona required the trust fund to use the government legal representation before incurring separate expenses that prisma zona would have to cover.parties still short of agreement as to such substantive terms have not completed their bargaining.
nor is prisma zona position helped by the surrounding circumstances that it says bear out the claim of an existing contract.for example,the bond prospectus apparently said that funds would go to prisma zona to operate the museum the securities law is a statement as to what was intended,not a statement that the necessary contracts had already been negotiated.similarly,prisma zona says that the trust fund in fact paid out almost million for prisma zona acquisition of the museum,but this appears to have been an payment from the trust fund to the tourism company to reimburse it for funding the museum initial investment.
all such events show is what is already conceded,namely,that the rosselló administration intended that the various agencies involved cooperate to transfer the museum and additional funding to prisma zona.indeed,the process was not only intended,but steps just short of a final legal commitment continued even after the november election.nevertheless,the service contracts were not completed,let alone signed,before the new administration took office in january.thus,there was no binding legal obligation to fund prisma zona 
prisma zona has another string to its bow.it says that it need not have a right to a benefit in this case,the contractual right to funding to be protected under the first amendment against a politically motivated denial of that benefit.as an abstraction,this is so several early cases involved political firings of employees who lacked civil service or contract protection.branti,at.elrod,at.plurality opinion.today protection also extends beyond discharging current employees to employee hiring and promotion decisions.rutan,at.
although current or employees have been specially favored,the court has also afforded some protection to businesses that deal with the government,truck,city of northlake,d removal from list of private towing services umbehr,at.of trash hauling contract,although here the coverage is less certain once one goes beyond existing commercial relationships,see id.at.the next area of contest appears to revolve around those who wish for the first time to bid for government contracts.on this issue,the supreme court has not yet spoken definitively,and the circuits appear to be divided 
happily,such large questions as to whether the elrod line will continue to expand need not be decided to dispose of this case.we will assume,purely arguendo,that a state government could not invite bids to supply pencils to the state with the caveat that no company headed by a democrat could apply.further,at this stage of fact development,prisma zona is entitled to the may or may not be party politics played a role in the calderón administration refusal to make the previously intended grant.
nevertheless,whatever may be true of pencil contracts,we decline to hold that the first amendment requires politically immaculate state in cases like this.even in core cases involving politically motivated hirings and firings,the supreme court has itself recognized that a wholly antiseptic application of the elrod principle is unrealistic.instead,party affiliation is an appropriate consideration in hiring and firing dec
