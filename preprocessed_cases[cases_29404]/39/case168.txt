in and,the boone county,kentucky,fiscal court bcfc opened two construction bids in order to build a new courthouse and a new jail expert masonry,emi,an ohio company,brought this suit challenging the process by which bcfc awarded the masonry contract for those projects to defendant don salyers and his company,don salyers masonry,dsm,a company based in boone county,kentucky.emi initially challenged the jail project only,but later amended its complaint to add the earlier courthouse project to the lawsuit.
in february,bcfc advertised for bids for the courthouse project.dsm submitted the lowest bid for the masonry work,in the approximate amount of million,and emi submitted the bid,in the approximate amount of million.bcfc awarded the contract to dsm.although bcfc required successful bidders to submit performance bonds in the full bid amount,dsm submitted a bond only in the contract amount that is to say,the bond excluded the materials costs.bcfc accepted the bonds,but no one appears to have noticed the discrepancy in the amount of the bond at the time.emi did not challenge this bid until it amended its complaint in august,although the courthouse project had already been completed.
in june,bcfc published a request for proposals to build a new jail and sheriff office.the jail project bid included a set of standard instructions printed in stating that each bid had to be accompanied by a bid bond,that successful bidders were required to furnish a performance and labor and material payment bond,and that any bid not accompanied by the required bid security or that was otherwise incomplete or irregular was subject to rejection.these instructions also noted that bcfc reserved the right to reject any or all bids,and that bcfc shall have the right to waive informalities and irregularities in a bid received and to accept the bid which,in bcfc judgment,is in bcfc own best interests.however,it was the intent of bcfc to award each contract to the lowest qualified bidder provided the bid has been submitted in accordance with the requirements of the bidding documents and does not exceed the funds available.the specifications for the jail project also noted that the bond shall be in the combined amount of the materials designated in its bid to be acquired by purchase order by the owner and all remaining items of cost 
on july,dsm submitted a bid for the jail project without a bid bond.when the bids were opened,dsm had submitted the lowest bid for the masonry work,and emi had submitted the second lowest bid,having bid approximately more than dsm.emi responded by requesting permission to examine the bid packages,and though boone county administrator james parsons initially refused,saying they are not public documents for everyone to finger through,another county official later relented.that was when emi discovered that dsm had failed to submit a bid bond.dsm was the only bidder that failed to post a bond with its bid.
bcfc responded to emi subsequent complaint by rejecting all bids on the grounds that the bid had not been properly advertised,and bcfc then modified the bid announcement by allowing bidders to post bid security in the form of either a bid bond or certified check.when the bids were resubmitted on august,dsm submitted a cashier check in lieu of a bid bond.dsm was again the lowest bidder and emi was again second,though emi had narrowed the gap to approximately.on september,and considering the august recommendation of david codell,who was charged with the construction of the jail project,bcfc passed a unanimous resolution awarding the jail project to dsm,subject to dsm providing payment and performance security in the bid amount of approximately million.
codell demanded from dsm all documentation necessary to prepare the jail project contract on september,and,five days later,he demanded dsm executed bonds.he did not receive them.on september,codell and bcfc contracts administrator robin curry instructed dsm to commence work on the jail project on september.however,dsm still failed to provide the requested security.in an unusual turn of events,curry personally visited dsm office on october to discuss the company failure to provide security.on october,codell recommended to curry that dsm bid be rejected because they have not been able to provide any type of performance and payment bond.on that same day,curry drafted a memorandum to boone county administrator james parsons recommending that dsm bid be denied because dsm failure to provide security places boone county at risk and has caused a substantial increase in the masonry costs.he noted that w hile we would prefer to have a boone county operated company perform this work,dsm has failed to meet the bid specification.bcfc apparently enjoyed the right to declare that dsm had forfeited its bid security in the amount of approximately and apply that amount toward the jail project,but bcfc chose not to do so.codell and curry both recommended at this time that bcfc award the jail project to emi.
for the october bcfc meeting,a draft resolution was prepared to adopt curry recommendation to award the jail project to emi.curry himself called emi president paul brown on october to inform him that he had requested that bcfc reject dsm bid for lack of adequate security.codell also called emi vice president on october to inform him that emi would be awarded the jail project.on that same day,however,county administrator parsons and boone county gary moore called salyers.salyers informed them that dsm had been unable to obtain the requested security,and moore allowed salyers until november to obtain the security.moore then removed the proposed resolution awarding the jail project to emi from the bcfc agenda,contingent on dsm providing the requisite security.on november,dsm obtained payment and performance bonds for the jail project that were said to be approximately million,an amount that excluded the cost of materials.the parties continue to dispute whether dsm bonds ever met the county specifications.
construction manager codell then informed salyers that dsm bond was insufficient,as the bond was in the contract amount excluding materials costs.salyers responded by noting that bcfc had accepted dsm bonds in the contract amount for the courthouse project,and,based on this past practice,salyers asserted that his bonds were satisfactory.codell in turn called county administrator parsons to determine whether the county would deem this state of affairs acceptable,and parsons concluded that the county was adequately secured.dsm was then awarded the masonry work for the jail project.
on december,emi filed suit against bcfc,don salyers,and dsm,alleging antitrust and other federal and state violations in the bidding process.emi specifically complained that bcfc illegally awarded the jail project to dsm in violation of the county limited discretion under state procurement law,that it conspired to make the award in violation of section of the sherman act,and that the award to dsm abridged emi fourteenth amendment due process property interest in the jail project bid,in violation of.emi also alleged state claims of fraud,collusion,tortious interference with business relations,and promissory estoppel.emi amended its complaint in august to add the circumstances of the courthouse project bidding process to its antitrust suit,specifically alleging that bcfc had accepted an inadequate performance bond from dsm in awarding the courthouse project.on may,following significant discovery,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.on november,the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed all of emi claims.emi raises only the antitrust and claims on appeal.

emi alleges that the defendants conspired for bcfc to award the two construction projects to dsm in violation of section of the sherman act.that section states,in relevant part every contract,combination,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,is declared to be illegal.as we have elaborated,
to establish a claim under section,the plaintiff must establish that the defendants contracted,combined or conspired among each other,that the combination or conspiracy produced adverse,anticompetitive effects within relevant product and geographic markets,that the objects of and conduct pursuant to that contract or conspiracy were illegal and that the plaintiff was injured as a proximate result of that conspiracy.

but distinguishing restraints that warrant application of the per se rule from those that qualify for rule of reason analysis is not always easy or straightforward.as courts have taken a more explicitly economic approach to antitrust,the old distinction between per se and rule of reason analysis has lost some of its former clarity,resulting in the advent of the quick look approach wherein the court must decide,in close cases,whether a restraint is facially anticompetitive before applying either per se or rule of reason analysis.see ncaa,at.the rule of reason can sometimes be applied in the twinkling of an eye.as the supreme court has stated 
there is generally no categorical line to be drawn between restraints that give rise to an intuitively obvious inference of anticompetitive effect and those that call for more detailed treatment.what is required,rather,is an enquiry meet for the case,looking to the circumstances,details,and logic of a restraint.the object is to see whether the experience of the market has been so clear,or necessarily will be,that a confident conclusion about the principal tendency of a restriction will follow from a quick or at least quicker look,in place of a more sedulous one.
california dental ass fed.trade comm n,d.therefore,courts can not act perfunctorily when distinguishing restraints that merit a per se approach from those that deserve rule of reason analysis,and only if a restraint clearly and unquestionably falls within one of the handful of categories that have been collectively deemed per se anticompetitive can a court be justified in failing to apply an appropriate economic analysis to make this determination.
by the same token,courts should remain alert to the fact that many restraints are in fact presumptively reasonable.after all,e very agreement concerning trade,every regulation of trade,restrains.to bind,to restrain,is of their very essence.chicago bd.of trade united states.see augusta news news,cir the categorical descriptions of per se offenses are quite misleading for anyone not well versed in antitrust.for instance,in its literal sense is not condemned per se virtually every sale is an agreement on price.for this reason,and it should be needless to point this out,a plaintiff must satisfy each element of the per se or rule of reason prima facie tests,whichever is applicable,in its allegations in order to survive termination.
in analyzing the economics of any given restraint,and determining thereby which kind of legal treatment it merits,it is vital to distinguish between horizontal restraints that involve direct competitors at a given level of the market,and vertical restraints that typically involve entities that are upstream or downstream of one another.under section of the sherman act,certain horizontal agreements are viewed as especially injurious,and courts therefore bar them per se,regardless of any alleged ameliorative rationale.pac.ry.united states,d white white am.hosp.supply,at.these principally include,soc y of prof l eng rs united states,at.united states oil,stop shop blue cross blue shield,at united states dynalectric,cir.lexis,at,market allocation,united states addyston pipe steel,aff,group boycotts,fashion originators guild federal trade comm n,and certain tying arrangements,int l salt,united states.but see jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,d requiring leverage to find tying.
on the other hand,vertical restraints generally represent a less apparent threat to competition,so the supreme court has reversed most of its earlier per se prohibitions of vertical restraints,see miles med.john park sons.per se rule against concerted vertical action to set prices through distribution,determining thereby that the rule of reason should be applied to vertical nonprice restraints,continental,gte sylvania,d overruling united states arnold,schwinn,d,dukane,cir recognizing that the supreme court reinstated the rule of reason for vertical distribution restraints,vertical maximum price fixing,state oil khan,d overruling albrecht herald,d,and purely vertical one buyer and one seller boycotts,nynex discon,d distinguishing the per se prohibition of group boycotts in fashion originators guild of,and klor,stores,d,because the boycotts in those cases included horizontal elements.in fact,it may well be the case that vertical fixing of minimum prices represents the only vertical restraint which remain s illegal per se.state oil khan,at.see liquor duffy,d price maintenance has been a per se violation of of the sherman act since the early years of national antitrust enforcement citation and internal quotation marks omitted bailey windsor america,at the courts may well be moving toward the view that vertical restrictions on intrabrand competition ought to be legal per se,at least where the defendant lacks market power.
here,the plaintiff has alleged that a buyer,who held two separate bidding procedures to hire contractors to work on two construction projects,conspired or schemed with one,and only one,of those bidders,and that,as a consequence,the buyer awarded the contracts to that bidder even though its bid may not have been the best considering the cost of the risk associated with the winning bidder purported failure to provide appropriate security.this supposed arrangement was transparently vertical in nature,as the buyer is downstream from the bidder.the plaintiff did not allege that any other bidders participated in this purported scheme.the scheme does not involve horizontal price fixing,horizontal group boycotts,horizontal,or vertical minimum price distribution restraints.at oral argument,the plaintiff could not identify any decision of this or other courts that would hold this alleged conspiracy to be unlawful under the antitrust laws.as we can not find any other grounds for finding that the alleged scheme was unlawful per se,and because the economics of the supposed arrangement do not on their face require a presumption of anticompetitiveness,we must review the alleged acts under the rule of reason.
