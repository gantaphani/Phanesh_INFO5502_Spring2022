vassilios handakas appeals from the judgment of conviction and sentence entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york weinstein,following his conviction by a jury of inter alia conspiracy to commit mail fraud by depriving the new york city school construction authority sca of its intangible right of honest services,conspiracy to launder the proceeds of the mail fraud,and the structuring of financial transactions to evade currency reporting laws.
the mail fraud conspiracy count arises out of work done for the sca by a construction company and the violation of the prevailing rate of wage contract provision required by new york little act,and other certification and reporting requirements in the construction contracts.the government deprivation of honest services theory was all that was left of the mail fraud charge after a special jury verdict absolved handakas of the alternative theory that handakas conspired to defraud the sca of its money or property.
on appeal,handakas maintains that the two structuring counts are multiplicitous,because the indictment charged that handakas engaged in structuring over two consecutive periods,without alleging that he engaged in two separate structuring schemes that the honest services provision of the mail fraud statute is inapplicable to the conduct charged that alternatively there is insufficient evidence of intent to commit mail fraud and that the money laundering conviction,which is based entirely on the laundering of funds derived from the unlawful activity of mail fraud,must fall for the same reasons.additionally,handakas argues in a pro se brief and in a supplemental brief by counsel that his mail fraud conviction can not stand because the honest services provision of the mail fraud statute is unconstitutionally vague,and that we must reverse the money laundering conviction as well,which is wholly premised on the mail fraud 
we hold that the structuring counts are multiplicitous because they do not allege separate structuring schemes,and that the honest services provision of the mail fraud statute is void for vagueness as applied to handakas.accordingly,we reverse the conviction on the mail fraud conspiracy count,as well as the money laundering conspiracy count dependent thereon,and one of the counts of structuring the sentence is vacated,and the case is remanded to the district court for resentencing on the remaining structuring count and the other counts undisturbed on this appeal.
on appeal,we consider the facts in the light most favorable to the government.see jackson virginia,d.
handakas,in his capacity as president and sole shareholder of astro waterproofing restoration company astro,submitted a number of successful general contracting bids to the sca,a public benefit corporation that oversees construction projects performed on new york city schools.the mail fraud conviction arises out of his wilful breach of certain contractual obligations undertaken by astro.
in awarding its contracts,the sca follows state law mandating that,inter alia the sca award all contracts to the lowest qualified bidder,see pub.auth.law mckinney and the successful bidder pay project workers prevailing rate of wages,and submit certified payroll records that so certify as a condition of receiving payment.lab.law,et.mckinney see also const.under,a ny person or corporation that wilfully pays less than the stipulated wage scale shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished for such first offense by a fine of five hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than thirty days lab.law mckinney.
in the course of the projects,handakas submitted certified payroll records that reflected compliance with the prevailing rate of wage requirement.handakas,in fact,paid his workers substantially less than half the prevailing rate of wage.
additionally,there was evidence that handakas left certain workers names off the payroll and fraudulently substituted other names,that he manipulated the record of the number of hours worked,and that the sca paid handakas based upon his false submissions.it is,however,doubtful that the government is entitled to the benefit of findings and inferences based on this evidence,which bears upon possible financial harm to the sca.although the government argued to the jury that the sca suffered financial loss,that the sca was deprived of money or property as well as honest services,the jury found by special verdict that handakas was guilty of mail fraud only on the ground that he deprived the sca of its intangible right of honest services and not on the ground that the sca was deprived of money or property.
in league with two subcontractors,handakas funneled large transfers disguised as subcontractor payments to himself for personal expenses and to family members in greece.handakas formed a series of shell corporations that received such phony payments from astro and wired the money back to handakas,directly or indirectly,in the united states or greece.
on may,handakas was arrested at an airport,en route to greece,carrying without having made the currency disclosure report required by law.the arrest triggered further investigations,and eventually the indictment.handakas was convicted on all counts of the indictment one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud by depriving another of the intangible right of honest services in violation of,one count of conspiracy to launder money in violation of h,et two counts of illegally structuring financial transactions to evade reporting requirements in violation of a,c one count of failure to file a currency report in violation of c a,a one count of making a materially false representation in violation of a and one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states in violation of,et.
handakas was sentenced to a prison term of months,and was ordered to pay a fine,in restitution,and a special assessment.
the multiplicity challenge to the structuring counts is raised for the first time on appeal.generally,we review challenges not brought to the attention of the district court for plain error.b see also united states thomas,cir.however,there is a strong argument that if the alleged multiplicity is clear from the indictment the failure to raise this objection prior to trial constitutes a waiver.united states chacko,wl,at,see also.b requiring that d efenses and objections based on defects in the indictment or information be raised prior to trial but we will apply plain error review,because the parties agree that plain error is the standard and did not brief the question of whether the alleged multiplicity was apparent on the face of the indictment.
to demonstrate plain error,handakas must show error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson united states,d quoting united states olano,d internal quotation marks omitted,alteration in original.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.quoting olano,at.internal quotation marks omitted,alteration in original.
an indictment is multiplicitous when it charges in separate counts two or more crimes,when in law and fact,only one crime has been committed.chacko,wl,at quoting united states holmes,cir see also blockburger united states.the applicable rule is that,where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions,the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.when the same statutory offense is charged as two separate counts,the proper question is whether congress intended the counts to constitute separate unit s of prosecution.bell united states.if the intent of congress is unclear,the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity,id.at.doubt will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses,id.at.
count two charges handakas with knowingly and intentionally structuring and assisting in the structuring of transactions exceeding in order to evade tax reporting requirements over the period may through may.count three charges handakas with the same offense over the period may through may.
title s ection forbids structuring transactions with a purpose of evading certain statutory reporting requirements.ratzlaf united states,d.the government maintains that counts two and three are separate units of prosecution because the structuring occurred over a period and involved the concealment of more than within each period.however,no provision of the statute indicates that a single course of structuring can be segmented based on intervals or any other intervals of time or by the amount of funds in any interval.
the statute penalty enhancement provision,on which the government apparently relied,provides that a structuring offense is aggravated where the structured funds exceed within a period,and are part of a pattern of any illegal activity.d.but that provision is intended to enhance sentences for more serious structuring offenses it is not a device for segmenting and compounding a single offense.
on appeal,the government looks elsewhere for support.it notes correctly that courts often look to the source of the funds structured rather than the number of deposits,in deciding the allowable unit of prosecution.appellee br.at discussing united states nall,cir.the government then argues that the source of funds for each count was distinct because 
handakas wrote separate checks of under each.therefore,each check cashed for him by the subcontractors was a separate transaction,with a separate source of funds,the check itself,physically distinct from the other checks.
id.at emphasis added.this an individual deposit can in fact constitute an allowable unit of prosecution,id.at the distinction,based on nall,between the number of sources and the number of transactions.nall,at holding that there was only one source for three separate bank deposits where all of the money came from one lump sum payment to the defendant,and that,accordingly,there was only one structuring count.
the drawing of each check can not constitute an allowable unit of prosecution,because the structuring itself,and not the individual deposit,is the unit of crime.united states davenport,cir emphasis added.each and every structuring offense,by nature,entails multiple transfers of funds in amounts small enough to avoid detection.ratzlaf,at.defining the structuring of transactions as the break ing up of a single transaction above the reporting threshold into two or more separate transactions united states scanio,cir p ersons structure their currency transactions by engag ing in multiple transactions each involving slightly under so as to avoid triggering the financial institutions filing obligations,overruled on other grounds by peck united states,cir.accordingly,the number of structuring offenses,units of prosecution is not determined by the number of fractional,transactions made for concealment.see nall,at holding that government improperly charged three structuring violations where defendant made three deposits and source of each deposit was the same lump sum,identical except for the date of the deposit davenport,at the government position leads to the weird result that if a defendant receives and splits it up into deposits he is ten times guiltier than a defendant who splits up the same amount into ten deposits.
because we find no precedential or statutory support for the multiple structuring charges,conviction on two separate counts constituted an error that is plain.united states olano,d see also johnson united states,d holding that an error is plain if the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal.
as to whether the error affect s substantial rights,id.at,handakas bears the burden of showing prejudice that affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.united states gore,cir.depending on how the counts were grouped in the investigation report,the duplicative structuring count may have had no impact on handakas sentence the supreme court has held,however,that prejudice inheres in a multiplicity error regardless of its impact on the sentence 
the remedy of ordering one of the sentences to be served concurrently with the other can not be squared with congress intention.one of the convictions,as well as its concurrent sentence,is unauthorized punishment for a separate offense.the second conviction,whose concomitant sentence is served concurrently,does not evaporate simply because of the concurrence of the sentence.the separate conviction,apart from the concurrent sentence,has potential adverse collateral consequences that may not be ignored.for example,the presence of two convictions on the record may delay the defendant eligibility for parole or result in an increased sentence under a recidivist statute for a future offense.moreover,the second conviction may be used to impeach the defendant credibility and certainly carries the societal stigma accompanying any criminal conviction.thus,the second conviction,even if it results in no greater sentence,is an impermissible punishment.
ball united states,d internal citations omitted emphasis in original see also united states coiro,cir citing ball,at.although the parties have not briefed the impact of the second structuring count on handakas sentence,we hold under ball that the multiplicity error is prejudicial.
it remains to be decided whether we will exercise our discretion to notice the plain error,which we may do if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.olano,at.alteration in original.because we are already remanding on other grounds,handakas will in any event be resentenced no interest of the prosecution,the public,or the courts would be served by subjecting handakas on resentencing to punishment for two structuring offenses when he committed one.under these circumstances,we think it would adversely affect the fairness and integrity of the sentencing process to require the district court to do that.
accordingly,we remand the two structuring convictions with instructions to have the district court exercise its discretion to vacate one of the convictions.ball,at.see also coiro,at quoting ball,at.
the elements of mail fraud are a scheme or artifice to defraud,furthered by the use of the mail,to deprive another of money,property,or the intangible right of honest services,see also united states zagari,cir.the first element requires i the existence of a scheme to defraud,ii specific intent to defraud on the part of the defendant,and iii material misrepresentations.united states autuori,cir citing united states,cir neder united states,d.the second element is satisfied if the mail is used or if its use is reasonably foreseeable.pereira united states.see also durland united states.holding that mailings need not be effective.the first two elements are easily satisfied on this record.
as to the third element,the statutory wording requires that there be a deprivation of money,property,or the intangible right of honest services.at trial,the government contended that the sca suffered loss on all three scores.the theory of honest services argued to the jury by the government was that t he sca had a right to determine how its contracts would be fulfilled,and that handakas took away that right.joint supplemental app.at.
as to whether the sca was deprived of money or property,conflicting evidence was adduced at trial.that question was then decided via a special verdict form,supplied by the district court,which separately asked whether the sca was deprived i of money or property,or ii of honest services.the jury checked off only that the sca was deprived of honest services.the district court thus carefully assured that each theory of the prosecution would be separately considered and decided.as a result,this case compels us to review in isolation a conviction for theft of honest services.
on appeal,the government suggests that the jury was confused.specifically,the government argues that the jury must have found that the wages paid to astro workers resulted in subpar work and thus in an injury to the sca money or property,and that the money or property finding was not checked off only because the jury deemed one checkmark to be enough.however,the verdict form was clear enough and the jury was instructed,largely in words of one syllable,that y ou can answer yes to both or yes to or yes to neither at.
evidence on both sides was offered as to each theory of loss the form separately canvassed the jury the charge lucidly explained the options and how to express them and the government sought no improvement in the form or the charge.the government must accept and live with an adverse jury finding.see united states powell,d noting the unreviewable power of a jury to return a verdict of not guilty for impermissible reasons quoting harris rivera,d.accordingly,because the conviction rests wholly on the honest services theory and because narrower grounds do not exist for reversal on the mail fraud count,we must decide the question as to whether the term honest services is unconstitutionally vague as applied to handakas.
the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments require the legislature to specify the elements of criminal offenses.there are no constructive offenses and,before one can be punished,it must be shown that his case is plainly within the statute.fasulo united states.a criminal statute is void for vagueness if it fails to give notice of the conduct prohibited or fails to channel the discretion of the prosecution 
as generally stated,the doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.
kolender lawson,d see also vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d smith goguen,d grayned city of rockford,d papachristou city of jacksonville,d.a court must first determine whether the statute gives the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited and then consider whether the law provides explicit standards for those who apply it.chatin coombe,cir quoting united states strauss,cir.
in short,the statute must give notice of the forbidden conduct and set boundaries to prosecutorial discretion.
the doctrine of honest services was originally law.courts construed the term any scheme or artifice to defraud to include schemes to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.see,united states clapps,cir united states bohonus,cir united states isaacs,cir united states states,cir.
over time,the honest services doctrine became applicable to four general categories of defendants government officials who defraud the public of their own honest services elected officials and campaign workers who falsify votes and thereby defraud the electorate of the right to an honest election private actors who abuse fiduciary duties by,for example,taking bribes and private actors who defraud others of certain intangible rights,such as privacy.mcnally united states,d stevens,dissenting surveying the scope of the doctrine.
within these four categories,the doctrine grew in an uneven way,and and court after court warned of prosecutorial abuse.united states brumley,cir en banc listing cases applying honest services in varying ways see also united states martin,cir a century of interpretation of the mail fraud statute has failed to still the doubts of those who think it dangerously vague.united states lemire,i f merely depriving the victim of the loyalty and faithful service of his fiduciary constitutes criminal fraud disloyalty alone becomes the crime,and little remains before every civil wrong is potentially indictable.united states rabbitt,cir every case of breach of public trust and misfeasance in office in connection with which some mailing has occurred does not and can not fall within the confines of the mail fraud statute.united states louderman,cir noting that the mail fraud statute should be carefully and strictly construed in order to avoid extension beyond the limits intended by congress united states mcneive,cir noting t he relative lack of definite standards contained in united states edwards,cir noting that the federal mail fraud statute must be strictly construed in order to avoid extension beyond the limits intended by congress see also john coffee,modern mail fraud the restoration of the distinction,comparing the expansion of the intangible rights doctrine in the to the spread of the kudzu vine geraldine szott moohr,mail fraud and the intangible rights doctrine someone to watch over us,harvard on legis,i ncremental progression of the intangible rights doctrine is an excellent example of judicial crime creation.p rosecutors bring previously undefined conduct to trial in the hope that the court will criminalize it.

some circuits have implemented by resurrecting law.thus,the sixth circuit has held that has restored the mail fraud statute to its scope.united states frost,cir see also united states czubinski,cir.and the fifth circuit,after noting that congress could not have intended to bless each and every lower court honest services opinion,observed that congress has set us back on a course of defining honest services and that court has turn ed to that task.brumley,at.however,one of these approaches simply reinstates the entire,dissonant body of prior circuit precedent,while the other invites the creation out of whole cloth of new judicial interpretations of honest services interpretations that will undoubtedly vary from circuit to circuit.the result is a truly extraordinary statute,in which the substantive force of the statute varie s in each judicial circuit.brumley,at jolly,dissenting.for example,compare frost,at requiring a breach of a fiduciary duty to sustain a theft of honest services in the private sector,with united states sancho,cir per curiam rejecting a fiduciary duty requirement and compare united states cochran,cir subjecting omission or misrepresentation to a test of materiality,with frost,at subjecting omission or misrepresentation to a test of reasonable forseeability.
this circuit has foreclosed the use of cases as a tool for construing the revised statute 
before the supreme court decision in mcnally there was law whether,prior to the passage of,the elements of as applied to deprivations of intangible rights required a scheme to breach a fiduciary duty is,however,no longer pertinent congress passed a new law.section specifies that a scheme or artifice to defraud includes a scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.what the government must prove to satisfy this element of the offense is defined by section by judicial decisions that sought to interpret the mail and wire fraud statutes prior to the passage of.
sancho,at.in deciding whether the revised statute provides notice,and limits on prosecutorial discretion,we are therefore left where we start with the statutory wording the intangible right of honest services.
the first inquiry that bears on sufficiency of whether the statute,as it is written,provides notice sufficient to alert ordinary people to what conduct is prohibited.kolender lawson,d see also chatin coombe,cir.notice is essentially a definitional requirement a penal statute must speak for itself so that a lay person can understand the prohibition.id.it is not enough to say that judges can intuit the scope of the prohibition if handakas could not 
mcnally placed the burden on congress to put down in statutory form whatever expanded scope it chose to give to the fraud statutes.in effect,congress was charged with codifying in statutory form the definitions of the conduct which would be prohibited by the concepts of intangible rights,honest services,and good and honest government the requirement imposed by the supreme court to speak more clearly was not for the benefit of the circuit courts which had,in fact,given birth to these concepts in the first place.rather,the requirement was for the benefit of the public,the average citizen who must be forewarned and given notice that certain conduct may subject him to federal prosecution.
brumley,at jolly,dissenting emphasis added.
if we were the first panel attempting to discern the meaning of the phrase honest services in,we would likely find that part of the statute so vague as to be unconstitutional on its face.section specifies that a scheme to defraud includes the deprivation of another intangible right of honest services,and in that way expresses legislative intent to expand the offense beyond deprivations of money or property but it does not say what honest services may be,or when they are withheld deceitfully.
the plain meaning of honest services in the text of simply provides no clue to the public or the courts as to what conduct is prohibited under the statute.judge jolly observed in that the terms intangible right and honest services can not be found in black law dictionary,the united states code,or for that matter any federal statute other than.brumley,at jolly,dissenting.that observation remains accurate today.clearly,honest services has not achieved the status of a commonly accepted and recognized term of art which congress could have been relying upon in using these words the phrase is inherently undefined and ambiguous.id.at,jolly,dissenting.
nor is this a case where further precision in the statutory language is either impossible or impractical.kolender,at.congress contemplated but ultimately rejected more determinate versions of.for instance,senate bill,entitled the act of,was passed by the senate on october.brumley,at jolly,dissenting.however,the house later deleted the text of the bill,and replaced it with the text of.id.at 
congress wrestled with the vagueness problem.at a hearing on the proposed addition of,the following exchange ensued between ronald stroman,assistant counsel for the subcommittee,and john keeney,acting assistant attorney general 
stroman well,honest services of a public official,do you think that is specific i mean what does honest services mean certainly if i am a public official 
keeney well,it means means what the circuit courts of appeals have been saying for years that when a mandel or a kerner corruptly uses his office he is depriving the citizens of that state of his honest services.
stroman i would wholeheartedly agree with that,but certainly the concept of intangible rights has been interpreted by a whole host of cases as well.to use the term honest government and say that is more specific than intangible rights when you have got the same history of case law,quite frankly i do not see the distinction.if i am an official in the government and i see the term honest government,that certainly does not alert me anymore than the existing statute as to what you are trying to cover.i do not know what that means.i would have to read the cases that you referred to.if i read the mail fraud statute,the same situation applies.i would have to read the cases to specifically understand what the statute is attempting to get at.and my point is that if you say that what you are trying to do is create a new statute because it is more specific,quite frankly it is not anymore sic specific.
mail fraud hearing before the subcomm.on criminal justice of the house comm.on the judiciary,sess,at emphasis added.
we have held that an administrative prison rule was unconstitutionally vague as applied where its prohibition could be understood only through the task of statutory interpretation chatin coombe,cir similarly,here,no one can know what is forbidden by without undertaking the task of answering the following questions can case law be consulted to illuminate the wording of can any meaning be drawn from the case law,either the uneven cases or the few cases decided post is one to be guided only by case law within one own circuit,or by the law of the circuits taken together if that is possible a lay individual of ordinary intelligence in handakas position would not know where to begin.id.at quoting chatin new york,wl,at,see also lanzetta new jersey.no one may be required at peril of life,liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.all are entitled to be informed as to what the state commands or forbids.
we are not,however,the first panel of our court to consider the meaning of honest services in.in sancho,the defendant argued that his conduct did not fall within the honest services provision,primarily on the grounds that the consultant he bribed did not owe the intended victim a fiduciary duty.sancho,at.the panel rejected that argument,which was based on case law,holding that such cases are not pertinent to interpretation of honest services in.id.at.it stated that there was no doubt that the consultant was under a legal duty to inform the intended victim of the bribe,and that there was also no doubt that the duty fell within the meaning of honest services in.id.the cases the panel cited in support of its analysis were all cases involving a duty of disclosure enforceable by an action in tort.see fund of funds,arthur andersen,duty to disclose was part of common law professional duties maritime fish,fish,dep t duty to disclose by virtue of employment or agency relationship aaron ferer sons chase manhattan bank,cir duty to disclose by virtue of superior knowledge.
in sancho only progeny,united states middlemiss,cir,the panel,relying on sancho,upheld a conviction for mail fraud involving a scheme that deprived the defendant employer of all the services that a totally faithful employee would have provided and in furtherance of which the defendant acted contrary to the best interest of his employer.id.at.thus,middlemiss also involved the breach of a duty enforceable by an action in tort.see,chemfab integrated liner technologies,dep t.together,then,sancho and middlemiss appear to stand for the proposition that a scheme to harm another by the breach of a duty enforceable by an action in tort may support a conviction for a scheme to defraud another of honest services.
neither sancho nor middlemiss provides a meaning of honest services that controls this case or saves this prosecution the prosecution of handakas arises out of his violation of the duties imposed by article,of the new york state constitution and of the new york state labor law,duties that are not enforceable by an action in tort.for present purposes,we see no principled distinction between the duties breached by handakas and the contractual duties usually collected under the rubric of representations and warranties.for the wrongs committed by handakas,new york law prescribes criminal penalties and may afford contract remedies,but does not afford an action in tort.new york law endeavors to maintain the distinction between contract and tort remedies,and generally bars an action in tort for a breach of contract.see,long island,pilewski solymosy,dep t t he law generally does not permit recovery in tort where the complaint states a legally sufficient claim sounding in contract.
in middlemiss,a company seeking a license at the offices of a public authority conveyed a secret corporate interest to an employee of the authority,who was convicted both of extorting payments from the licensee and of simultaneously committing mail fraud by the theft of his honest services.middlemiss,at.even if the honest services clause could be read to prohibit such conduct,it still would fail to give the slightest notice that breach of contract could subject one to a mail fraud conviction 
if we were to affirm handakas mail fraud conviction on the grounds that he violated a undertaking to pay prevailing rate of wages,or to furnish accurate reports of work performed,we would effect a breathtaking expansion of mail fraud.every breach of a contract or state law committed in the vicinity of a telephone and every false state tax return sent by mail would become punishable as a felony in federal court.see tax law,mckinney 
the government summation on the subject of honest services focused entirely on the deprivation of the sca contractual rights.see.even someone fully familiar with and,and our cases,would lack any comprehensible notice that federal law has criminalized breaches of contract.accordingly,application of those criminal statutes to handakas violates the due process guarantee of fair notice.
the second vagueness inquiry and the more important of the two is whether the s tatutory language is of such a standardless sweep that it allows policemen,prosecutors,and juries to pursue their personal predilections.smith goguen,d see also kolender lawson,d.an enactment fails to provide sufficiently explicit standards for those who apply it when it impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen,judges and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis.chatin coombe,cir quoting grayned city of rockford,d.
an indefinite criminal statute creates opportunity for the misuse of government power.to appropriate judge winter phrase,the honest services doctrine renders mail fraud a which has no use but misuse.see united states margiotta,cir winter,dissenting explaining that w hen the first corrupt prosecutor prosecutes a political enemy for mail fraud,talk of honest services and good government will ring hollow indeed.
chatin highlighted the dangers of an offense that is harnessed into service by the state when other prohibitions will not serve.chatin,at.even without the overlay provided by the amendment on honest services,the mail fraud statute has been aptly described as an prosecutorial expedient by invoking,prosecutors are free to invite juries to apply a legal standard which amounts to little more than the rhetoric of sixth grade civics classes.margiotta,at winter,dissenting.if the honest services clause can be used to punish a failure to honor the sca insistence on the payment of prevailing rate of wages,it could make a criminal out of anyone who breaches any contractual representation that tuna was netted that stationery is made of recycled paper that sneakers or are not made by child workers that grapes are picked by union sum so called consumer protection law and far more.
at trial,the government thought it sufficient to argue that handakas was guilty of conspiracy to commit mail fraud simply by violating his contractual obligation to pay his workers the prevailing rate of wages.that is what the prosecutor argued to the jury 
s ometimes you care about how things are done,and if you spell that out in a contract and you make it clear to the people you are dealing with,as the sca did here,that not only do you want something but you want it done a certain way,you have a right to that,and that what at issue here.the sca had a right to determine how its contracts would be fulfilled.
at emphasis added.
the sca had a property right in its contract handakas took away that right to decide how the sca had its contract performed t he defendant owes a duty of honest services.there is a contract here.
t hat exactly the point.there was a relationship defined by a contract.
t here can be no doubt that what the defendant did here was intentionally seek to deprive the sca of this contract right,the right not just to determine what work gets done,but how it gets done.
these arguments prove too much,however,as the government apparently realized on appeal.by the time the government filed its supplemental brief on this subject,it was and conceded that it misspoke during oral argument when it suggested that a duty of honest services arises in connection with the performance of all contracts and is violated by any contract breach.appellee supplemental br.at.the government improved appellate theory of this prosecution is that the honest services clause may have its limits,but that handakas conduct falls within those limits because of a supposed agency relationship between handakas and the sca.id.at.however,there is no reference to agency or fiduciary relationships in the indictment,or in the charge,or in the summations,or in the government brief in chief on appeal.the government summation on the subject of honest services was focused on the contract right to compliance with representations and warranties 
t here are times when there are things more important than price.we are probably all familiar with instances where you have decided not to buy a particular product because you do like the way workers are treated.years ago there was a boycott of grapes because the workers who picked it were being treated fairly.you read all the time about people who wo buy certain clothing because it made in sweatshops in asia.
the contract argument was thus cast in terms of social conscience and treated honest services as a concept without boundary or standard.

the absence of discernible standards in the honest services doctrine implicates principles of federalism.mcnally,at.as the government summation demonstrates,this prosecution was driven by a conception formed by federal prosecutors that certain new york laws appeal so strongly to the social conscience that violation should be treated as felonious under federal law.new york interest in the payment of prevailing rate of wages is secured and enforced by state laws deemed sufficient by the state.under of the new york state labor law,the comptroller of the city of new york is empowered to make findings of fact and enforce a judgment against contractors who fail to pay prevailing rate of wages.lab.law.additionally,the statute provides that willful violation constitutes a misdemeanor.lab.law.prosecutorial discretion has been exercised here to sharpen the penalty for the violation of certain state laws that,in the estimation of a federal prosecutor,are insufficiently policed or punished by the state itself.this is particularly dubious where interstate commerce is at best tangentially implicated.united states lopez,d holding federal gun free school zone act unconstitutional,because criminal statute exceeded congress commerce clause authority reasoning that possession of gun in school zone was not economic activity that substantially affected interstate commerce.

the cases cited by the dissent at,which reject either facial challenges to or challenges in other factual contexts,simply do not address the question with which we are presented here.the dissent cites no case in which a mail fraud conviction based on the honest services provision was based upon a scheme to deprive another of the honest performance of purely contractual duties or of statutorily imposed duties to submit information to a state agency.dissent at citing united states frega,cir rejecting challenge where scheme involved bribery of state judges united states frost,cir rejecting facial challenge united states brumley,cir en banc rejecting constitutional challenge based on vagueness where defendant was a state employee who solicited bribes,but noting some defendants on the outer reaches of the statute might be able to complain that they were not on notice that congress criminalized their conduct when it revived the doctrine united states paradies,cir rejecting challenge where scheme involved bribery of a public official united states gray,cir rejecting challenge where scheme involved conspiracy by employees to deprive their employer of honest services united states castro,cir rejecting challenge where scheme involved state judges accepting kickbacks from defense attorneys in exchange for appointments as counsel for indigent defendants united states bryan,cir rejecting challenge where defendant was a state official that rigged bidding for state agency contracts,abrogated on other grounds by united states,d united states waymer,cir rejecting facial and challenges where defendant was a government official that accepted kickbacks.

for the foregoing reasons,we hold that is unconstitutionally vague as applied to handakas and reverse the conviction on the mail fraud count.this ruling obviates consideration of handakas alternative argument that the evidence on this count was insufficient.
to sustain a conviction for conspiracy to launder money,the government must demonstrate that the defendant conspired to transport funds from a place in the united states to or through a place outside the united states,with knowledge that the funds were the proceeds of illegal activity,to conceal the nature of the illegal activity or to avoid a currency reporting requirement.h united states trapilo,cir.
the evidence showed that handakas engaged in two separate types of money transfers he arranged for his personal expenses to be paid out of the accounts of controlled subcontractors and shell corporations,and he had money wired from these accounts to greece.only the latter transfers went abroad from the united states accordingly,they are the only transfers that could have provided the basis for the money laundering conviction.
handakas argues that the international transfers were not currency transactions subject to a required filing of a currency report under a,and the government does not challenge that argument on appeal.the government must therefore argue that the funds transferred were the proceeds of illegal activity.however,the only potentially available predicate for that finding is the mail fraud conspiracy.the government brief concedes this point,arguing only that handakas was properly convicted of the conspiracy to commit mail fraud.having been convicted of that crime,he was also properly found by the jury to have engaged in laundering of the proceeds of that crime.appellee supplemental br.at since the mail fraud conviction has been reversed in this opinion,the money laundering conviction falls with it.
conclusion 
the mail fraud count count one,the money laundering count count four,and one of the two structuring counts count two or three are reversed.the remaining counts of conviction are affirmed.the sentence is vacated,and the case is remanded to the district court for resentencing.the district court may in its discretion wish to expedite resentencing from our perspective,it appears that handakas has completed or may soon complete the term to which he may be resentenced.in these circumstances,the mandate shall issue forthwith.
i dissent from the holding that is unconstitutional as applied in this case.i concur,however,in the other portions of the majority opinion.
the majority is concerned that a broad use of the honest services provision of the mail fraud statute could make a criminal out of anyone who breaches any contractual representation.majority op.at.while an overly broad use of may raise a significant question in some circumstances,no such question should be resolved on this appeal.
the majority appropriately notes,but fails to follow,the one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality unless such adjudication is unavoidable.department of commerce united states house of representatives,d emphasis supplied quoting spector motor service,mclaughlin.for reasons given below,the majority adjudication that is unconstitutionally vague as applied in this case is hardly unavoidable.
to begin with,the constitutional issue was not raised in the district court,as the majority apparently concedes this should preclude us from reaching out to decide it.as the majority correctly states in its discussion of the structuring counts,challenges not brought to the attention of the district court are reviewed under the constraints of the plain error standard of fed.b.plain error is error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.johnson united states,d.
even if we make the unlikely assumption that there was an error below regarding the constitutionality of the district court,of course,did not decide the issue,we can not properly characterize such error as plain.the supreme court has held,in applying the plain error standard,that plain is synonymous with clear or obvious,and that a t a minimum,a court of appeals can not correct an error pursuant to rule b unless the error is clear under current law.united states olano,d.any alleged error as to the unconstitutionality of certainly can not be clear under current law when every circuit court to address the specific question of vagueness since the phrase honest services appeared in the statute has found to be constitutional on its face or as applied 
furthermore,it is the law of this circuit that there must be binding precedent mandating reversal before an error can be deemed plain.united states weintraub,cir without a prior decision from this court or the supreme court mandating the jury instruction that defendant,for the first time on appeal,says should have been given,we could not find any such error to be plain,if error it was.the majority cites no judicial decision,let alone binding precedent in this circuit,dealing with that supports its view.it does attempt to distinguish the cases cited at note,supra.see majority op.at.but merely pointing out different factual patterns in cases that held was constitutional does nothing to affirmatively demonstrate that it is clear under current law that was unconstitutionally applied here.in other words,the majority appears to hold that the alleged error is plain under current law because the majority says so.that simply disregards the teachings of johnson,olano and weintraub.
thus,under these cases,the second prong of the plain error test is clearly not met this is particularly true because the majority ruling appears to depart from the analysis used in our recent decision in united states sancho,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d.in sancho,which we are bound to follow as was the district court,we affirmed a jury finding of guilt under.the panel first observed that the essential element of a violation of is a scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.at.the court then looked to new york law to discover whether there was a legal duty in that case by a consultant actually an fbi agent not to conceal from a construction company tcc his discovery of a proposed fraud on tcc concluded that there was such a legal duty under new york law and held that sancho used interstate telephone communications in furtherance of a scheme to deprive tcc of its intangible right to the consultant honest services.id.
this case can not be fairly distinguished from sancho.here there was a jury finding of guilt on a charge of violating.as in sancho,we look to state law to determine whether handakas was under a legal duty to refrain from intentionally paying wages below those required by state law and falsely certifying payroll records that reflected compliance with the wage requirements applicable new york law makes clear that there was such a duty and handakas used the mails in furtherance of a scheme to deprive the new york city school construction authority sca of its intangible right to his honest services.
it is true that handakas was under a contractual duty to refrain from falsifying payroll records and paying rates.it may also be true,as the majority points out,that there is a question whether a contractual duty alone should be enough to allow a conviction.but here,as in sancho,there were duties other than simply contractual ones imposed on handakas.article,section of the new york state constitution,for example,prohibits any laborer,workman or mechanic in the employ of a contractor or subcontractor engaged in the performance of any public work from being paid less than the rate of the prevailing wage.that constitutional mandate is implemented by new york labor law et seq mckinney west,which imposes duties upon various entities to enforce the prevailing wage requirement.
the majority points out that paying wages is a criminal misdemeanor under lab.law.majority op.at.but state law imposes even more extensive duties on contractors such as handakas.for instance,under lab.law,contractors shall keep original payrolls or transcripts thereof,subscribed and affirmed by him as true under the penalties of perjury,showing the hours and days worked by and hourly wage rate paid to each workman,laborer or mechanic.another section of the statute further extends the criminal penalties for false statements.see lab.law any contractor or subcontractor who shall upon his oath verify any statement required to be filed under this act which is known by him to be false shall be guilty of perjury and punishable as provided by the penal law.it is therefore a state felony to submit falsified material information on any filing required by the labor statute.see penal law mckinney defining perjury in the second degree as a class e felony.because the state law duties here are so explicit,this case is governed by the analysis used in sancho.
the majority attempts to distinguish sancho and sancho only progeny,united states middlemiss,cir,on the dubious ground that those cases limited the state law duties that,when breached,may support a conviction for a scheme to defraud another of honest services to duties actionable only in tort.majority op.at.however,nowhere in sancho or middlemiss is there such a limiting principle.rather,each case looked only to whether there was a legal duty to provide honest services,without imposing any requirements on the nature of that duty.in fact,sancho held that a fiduciary duty is not required to support an honest services conviction,strongly suggesting that the type of duty breached is not a limiting factor in the honest services analysis.the majority is thus making a gigantic leap from sancho and middlemiss to the holding that a breach of a state law tort duty is required in a case like this to support a conviction under.in any event,handakas violated both contractual and criminal state law duties,as the majority acknowledges.a
