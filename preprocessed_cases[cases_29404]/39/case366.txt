garco construction,appeals a decision of the armed services board of contract appeals denying garco damages claim arising out of its contract with the army corps of engineers to build housing units on malmstrom air force base.garco argues that a change in the base access policy prevented its subcontractor from bringing many of its workers onto the base,requiring its subcontractor to hire and train more workers,and forcing it to incur additional costs.garco also alleges a constructive acceleration of the contract.because we conclude that there was no change to the base access policy,we reject garco arguments and affirm the board decision.
background 
malmstrom air force base in great falls,montana,is the largest missile complex in the western hemisphere.the base houses the minuteman iii intercontinental ballistic missiles,which carry a nuclear payload.the army corps of engineers put out for bid contract no.to build housing units on the base,and on august,awarded the contract to garco construction.garco subcontracted some of the work to james talcott construction jtc in september.jtc had performed considerable work on the base in the past.
the corps of engineers garco contract contained two provisions especially pertinent here it incorporated federal acquisition regulation far,which provides that contractors are permitted to employ and it required contractors to at all times adhere to the base access policy.the base access policy,in place since at least,indicated 
a dispatcher will run the employees name s through the national criminal information center ncic system for a wants and warrants check.unfavorable results will be scrutinized and eligibility will be determined on a basis by the.
emphasis added.
after work on the contract began,jtc began difficulty bringing its crew onto the base.jtc bussed many of its workers to the base from a local facility,and those workers in particular experienced difficulty accessing the base.other jtc workers who were not from the facility but who had criminal records were also refused base entry.jtc president testified that jtc had not encountered similar access denials in its performance of other malmstrom contracts over the nearly twenty years it had worked on the base.
malmstrom chief of security forces plans and programs at the time,michael ward,stated in a declaration that jtc had been essentially ing security procedures at the base.ward explained that jtc had been gaining base access for its,facility workers by having a retired military member ride on the bus and vouch for everyone on it,which the base permitted at the time.eventually,there was an incident on a garco jobsite where a facility worker beat his manager with a wrench,and ward later discovered that this worker had a violent criminal background.
in may,jtc voiced concerns to garco and the air force regarding the difficulty it experienced getting its workers onto the base,although it acknowledged that violent criminals and sex offenders should not be granted base access.informal communications from the air force indicated that violent criminals and sex offenders would continue to be denied base access.after numerous between the parties,the base commander major general sandra finan who was ultimately responsible for base access issued a memorandum on october,indicating 
the dispatch center will input all listed employees name s and data into the national criminal information center ncic database for a background check in accordance with air force.unfavorable results from the background check will result in individuals being denied access to the installation,including,but not limited to,individuals that are determined to fall into one or more of the following categories those having outstanding wants or warrants,sex offenders,violent offenders,those who are on probation,and those who are in a program.the of sex offender and violent offender can be found at montana code annotated.
emphases added.
two days after finan issued her base access memorandum,jtc submitted a request for equitable adjustment rea of the contract.jtc explained in the rea that its inability to use convict labor on the base greatly reduced the size of the experienced labor pool from which it could hire in the great falls,montana,area.jtc claimed that,as a result,it incurred nearly dollars of additional expenses from additional time interviewing and hiring new workers,paying overtime to new workers,and training new and less experienced workers.notably,the rea only requested additional money it did not request a time extension.
the air force denied the rea,and jtc,through garco,requested reconsideration by the contracting officer.eventually the claim reached the armed services board of contract appeals.the board first granted partial summary judgment,holding that finan october base access memorandum was a sovereign act and the air force was not liable for damages from that date forward.appeals of garco,asbca,cch.in a later decision,the board held that the base access policy in place at contract award in august was also a sovereign act,and moreover,was not changed by the october memorandum.the board therefore rejected garco argument that prior to october,the air force could only deny access to workers who had outstanding wants or warrants.instead,the board found that a wants and warrants check was synonymous with a background check and finan memorandum was simply a clarification of not a change to the base access policy,and therefore the air force was not liable for damages before the memorandum issued either.the board also concluded that the air force increased enforcement of the base access policy did not constitute a constructive acceleration of the contract,and that jtc could not recover under that theory.
garco appeals the board decision,and we have jurisdiction under a and a.
discussion 
on appeal,garco raises two narrow issues,which we address in turn below that finan october memorandum changed the base access policy and the policy it allegedly supplanted did not authorize the exclusion of workers with criminal records and that the air force sovereign act of denying base entry to jtc workers constituted a compensable constructive acceleration of the contract.notably,garco concedes that if we determine finan october memorandum did not change the base access policy,then their arguments fail.see oral arg.at.garco does not challenge the board determination that the base access policy is a sovereign act.
garco first asserts that the base access policy did not authorize the air force to prohibit workers with a criminal record from entering the base until finan october memorandum issued,and therefore jtc request for equitable adjustment or rea should have been granted.as support,garco turns to the language of the base access policy,particularly its reference to the ncic wants and warrants check that the was to perform under the policy.garco argues that this language is plain on its face and means that only a search for outstanding wants or warrants was to be performed.garco argues that anything more,such as a search of a criminal record,falls outside the stated on access.garco also directs us to a line from finan testimony where she stated that denying access from those with a violent background or in programs was a large change to the base access policy.appellant br.citing.as further support,garco notes that finan october memorandum refers to a background check,rather than a wants and warrants check.
addressing garco argument requires us to interpret the base access policy,an agency regulation.this is a legal issue which,under the contract disputes act,we review de novo.dynamics panetta,fed.cir.however,t he agency construction of its own regulations is of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.reizenstein shinseki,fed.cir.quoting cathedral candle int l trade comm n,fed.cir.see also auer robbins.garco does not challenge this proposition,but instead argues that no is due when the agency interpretation contradicts the plain and sensible meaning of the regulation.roberto dep t of the navy,fed.cir.
we disagree with garco that the plain text of the base access policy unambiguously resolves the dispute.as when we construe statutory language,we must consider the regulation as a whole and the term wants and warrants check in the context in which it was used.see textron lycoming reciprocating engine,avco united,aerospace agric.implement workers of,i t is a fundamental principle of statutory construction and,indeed,of language itself that the meaning of a word can not be determined in isolation,but must be drawn from the context in which it is used.internal quotation marks omitted robinson shell oil,the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.while there may be some merit to garco argument that the plain meaning of wants and warrants check in isolation suggests a check only for wants or warrants,the surrounding language casts doubt on that interpretation.
for example,the sentence immediately following the disputed wants and warrants check language reads unfavorable results will be scrutinized and eligibility will be determined on a basis.this directive for a analysis of unfavorable results suggests that the check is more searching than a simple check for outstanding wants or warrants.indeed,the government introduced testimony that anyone with a want or warrant would be immediately detained and would not be scrutinized with eligibility determined on a basis.garco explanation that this sentence could mean that the air force may grant base access to those with old,but still outstanding,warrants is not convincing.at bottom,we find that this sentence cuts against garco plain meaning interpretation such that we must consider the air force interpretation.reizenstein,at considering agency interpretation of its own regulation when the text of the regulation does not unambiguously answer the question presented.
the air force interprets the base access policy as providing for a criminal background check.the air force presented significant evidence to support this interpretation.jtc own statements and actions during the relevant timeframe support the air force interpretation.meeting minutes from a project meeting held around the time jtc executed the subcontract with garco indicate that worker names will be sent to dispatch for background checks.no one with outstanding warrants,felony convictions,or on probation will be allowed on base.the minutes directed the recipients to review these minutes and respond within ten days in writing should any discrepancies or omissions be noted.neither jtc nor garco contacted the air force about how the minutes characterized the base access policy.further,when jtc first experienced base access issues with its workers,it specifically requested that certain workers be granted base access but recognize d that this would not apply to sexual offenders or violent offenders.
in addition to jtc own statements and actions,the government presented testimony from michael ward,chief of security forces plans and programs for the base at the time the dispute arose.ward provided testimony that a ncic wants and warrants check is a term of art denoting a specific type of background check in the ncic system,explaining that b ackground check is a very generic term.wants and warrants is what is titled out of the ncic check that provides the data that is being reviewed.he further explained that the ncic wants and warrants check includes a search for criminal background information 
q what is your understanding of a wants and warrants check 
a a wants and warrants check is the background check.basically what it is,is it the information that is loaded into the actual or the ncic system.probably the name,date of birth,social security number,driver license number,or a combination of that information would reveal the background,any wants or warrants,registration in the any formal programs such as sexual offender or violent offender programs and their criminal history would be listed as well.
ll.emphases added.ward also described an ncic wants and warrants check and a background check as synonymous,ll.finally,he explained that finan october memorandum was not a change to the base access policy,ll.q was this list of those banned from the base in the october memo different than your understanding of malmstrom current policy described in the background paper a no,sir,it was not.
finan testimony supports the testimony of ward.during her testimony,finan described an unfavorable result,which the access policy instructs should be scrutinized,as convictions,arrests,you know,drug use,sex abuse,domestic abuse,anything like that,that would come up on the background check,see also.garco makes much of finan testimony that barring those with a criminal record from entering the base was a large change to the access policy.appellant br.quoting.but this testimony is less precise than garco claims.it is unclear whether finan meant that her october itself effected the change,or if the change was the institution of the base access policy her memorandum clarified.indeed,only moments before mentioning the large change,finan testified that allowing violent and sex offenders on the base would have been a dramatic change to the base access policy at the time she drafted her memorandum,ll.
ultimately,finan testimony about a large change in the access policy which,under garco interpretation,is at odds with the rest of finan testimony does not render the air force interpretation of the access policy plainly erroneous.neither does the fact that finan used the term background check in her memorandum instead of the term wants and warrants check as used in the access policy.the purpose of finan memorandum was to clarify the base access policy,so it makes sense that she would use a different term than the one that was generating confusion.
garco also argues that the air force interpretation is flawed in light of the fact that the contract incorporated far,which permits contractors to employ.we disagree that the incorporation of this provision makes the air force interpretation of the access policy inconsistent with the contract.for example,this provision could apply to jtc employees who were not working on the base.further,as garco has acknowledged,the contract expressly required contractors to comply with the base access policy.and garco does not dispute that finan had the authority to ban from entering the base.we therefore are not persuaded to draw the inference that garco would have us draw from incorporation of the far provision.
after considering the ample support for the air force interpretation,we conclude that the interpretation is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,and we therefore must give it controlling weight.see reizenstein,at.as a result,finan october memorandum was not a change to the base access policy,but rather clarifying guidance on the existing policy,and the board properly denied jtc rea on the basis of a changed base access policy.
garco also argues that the air force sovereign act effectuated a constructive acceleration of the contract.although actions taken by the united states in its sovereign capacity shield the government from liability for financial claims resulting from those acts,the contractor may be allowed additional time to perform.see conner,at,affirming board ruling that the sovereign acts doctrine relieved the government of liability for damages but recognizing that the contractor received additional time to complete its project.garco cites to a provision in the contract that allowed for delay in completing work if unforeseeable causes arose,including sovereign acts.garco posits that by not allowing jtc to bring its more experienced workers on base,the air force compelled jtc to hire more workers,who had less experience and required training.garco reasons that this additional hiring and training increased the time required to complete the work due under the contract.
this argument lacks merit.our conclusion that the october memorandum was not a change to the base access policy significantly undermines garco assertion that there was an unforeseeable action that impacted jtc work.but to the extent garco argues that the unforeseeable action involved changes in the air force enforcement of its base access policy,which jtc contends the air force had not fully enforced during jtc past contracts on the base,we also disagree that such action gives rise to constructive acceleration.the contract assigned the risk of adhering to air force regulations and orders to the contracting party.thus,this risk must be borne by garco.
in any event,garco fails to make a prima facie case of constructive acceleration for an additional reason.acceleration typically requires a party to show both that it made a timely and sufficient request for a time extension and that its request was denied.fraser constr.united states,fed.cir.jtc never formally requested a time extension,and the government,therefore,could not have denied jtc request.
citing john cibinic ralph nash,administration of government contracts ed,garco asserts that a formal request for additional time is not always required if the parties understand there to be a request for additional time.first of all,the cibinic nash treatise garco cites indicates that many cases require that the contractor have actually submitted a request for time extension,which did not occur here.cibinic nash at.moreover,even if we were to accept garco legal position,it would not save garco constructive acceleration claim in this case.while jtc did submit an rea seeking additional money,there is no record evidence that any party interpreted that rea as also being a request for additional time.further,while cibinic nash cites a case from the postal service board of contract appeals where an administrative judge held that a formal request is not always necessary when there is a very clear indication from the contracting officer that no delay in the schedule will be tolerated,such a clear indication did not occur here.for these reasons,we reject garco constructive acceleration claim.
conclusion 
we have considered garco remaining arguments and find them without merit.we affirm the decision of the board denying garco claims for contract damages.
costs to appellee.
the instant appeal is about the sovereign acts doctrine it hinges entirely on whether that doctrine,an affirmative defense,shields the army corps of engineers,the air force,and the secretary of the department of the army collectively,the government from liability for preventing james talcott construction,jtc employees from accessing the malmstrom air force base malmstrom in montana nonetheless,the majority never applies the sovereign acts doctrine to the analysis of the case.
ordinarily,it is incumbent on the defendant to plead and prove an affirmative defense taylor sturgell,citation omitted.our precedent is clear that t he sovereign acts doctrine is an affirmative defense that is an inherent part of every government contract.conner.constr.geren,fed.cir.citation omitted.the armed services board of contract appeals asbca found that the government met its burden of proving entitlement to this affirmative defense,see garco,garco iii,asbca,bca garco,garco ii,asbca,bca garco,garco i,asbca,bca,and the majority bypasses this determination under the guise of waiver in affirming the asbca,see.however,because the sovereign acts doctrine is grounded in the government sovereign immunity,see supra,i believe that finding waiver is inappropriate,see fed.deposit ins.meyer,sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature.indeed,the terms of the government consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain suit.internal quotation marks and citations omitted city of gainesville inv,of course a question of jurisdiction can not be waived.should affirmatively appear,and the question may be raised at any time.citations omitted.
the majority conclusion suffers from two additional flaws.first,although the asbca correctly treated the sovereign acts doctrine as an absolute bar to finding the government liable,see,it failed to consider whether the government satisfied the second factor in the test for applying the doctrine.the majority compounds that error by ignoring the application of the doctrine altogether.second,even though the asbca conclusion that the sovereign acts doctrine applied would preclude a merits analysis and liability determination,the majority misinterprets the asbca opinions below and incorrectly considers the merits.for these reasons,i respectfully dissent.
i.the sovereign acts doctrine 
i begin by articulating the framework we apply to determine whether the government is entitled to the affirmative defense of the sovereign acts doctrine.after articulating this framework,i turn to the asbca analysis.
legal framework 
the supreme court has not established the precise contours of the sovereign acts doctrine.indeed,the supreme court has applied the sovereign acts doctrine in only two cases,the second of which produced a highly divided court without a majority opinion.
in horowitz united states,the supreme court explained that the sovereign acts doctrine distinguishes between the government distinct roles as a private contractor and as a sovereign,providing that the government when sued as a contractor can not be held liable for an obstruction to the performance of the particular contract resulting from its public and general acts as a sovereign,citations omitted.the supreme court did not address the doctrine again for the next seventy years.see winstar,at scalia,stating that the sovereign acts doctrine has apparently been applied by th e supreme court in only a single case,our opinion in horowitz,decided in.
in winstar,justice souter authored a four and as to some portions,three justice plurality opinion explaining that 
t he sovereign acts doctrine balances the government need for freedom to legislate with its obligation to honor its contracts by asking whether the sovereign act is properly attributable to the government as a contractor.if the answer is no,the government defense to liability depends on the answer to the further question,whether that act would otherwise release the government from liability under ordinary principles of contract law.
id.at plurality opinion footnote omitted.the supreme court has not revisited the sovereign acts doctrine since winstar.
lacking a definitive framework for applying the sovereign acts doctrine from existing supreme court precedent we have adopted the standard articulated by the plurality opinion in winstar.see,conner,at stating that this court has treated th e plurality opinion in winstar as setting forth the core principles underlying the sovereign acts doctrine.pursuant to this framework,we evaluate the applicability of the sovereign acts doctrine using a test.klamath irrigation dist.united states,fed.cir.stockton water dist.united states,fed.cir.first,we ask whether the governmental act is properly attributable to the government as contractor or to the government as sovereign,whether the act was designed to relieve the government of its contract duties or was a genuinely public and general act that only incidentally falls upon the contract.stockton,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.second,if the governmental act was a genuine public and general act,we ask whether that act would otherwise release the government from liability under ordinary principles of contract law.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
as explained above,the sovereign acts doctrine is an affirmative defense that is an inherent part of every government contract.conner,at citation omitted.as an affirmative defense,the government,as defendant,bears the burden of establishing its entitlement to the sovereign acts defense.see taylor,at.this burden applies to both factors of our framework.see klamath,at stating that the g overnment has the burden of establishing all elements of the sovereign acts defense.determining whether the government has met its burden is a legal conclusion based on underlying factual findings reviewed for substantial evidence.conner,at see b stating that the asbca decision on a question of fact may not be set aside unless the decision is,inter alia,not supported by substantial evidence.
b.the asbca erred in determining that the sovereign acts doctrine shielded the government from liability 
the majority does not articulate or address the test concerning the sovereign acts doctrine.see generally op.because i believe both the asbca and this court are bound by the framework articulated above,i evaluate whether the government satisfied its burden as to each factor.in my opinion,it did not.
substantial evidence supports the asbca finding that the government acts were public and general acts 
the first factor,whether the sovereign act is properly attributable to the government as contractor,is a subjective inquiry that examines the purpose of the governmental act.see,yankee atomic united states,fed.cir.stating that the parties characterization of the governmental act frames the dispositive issue and then evaluating whether the government was acting for the purpose of increasing prices charged to plaintiffs or solving problems related to uranium enrichment.we evaluate whether the act was genuinely public and general or specifically directed at nullifying contract rights.stockton,at,internal quotation marks and citation omitted see conner,at similar.this inquiry can be informed by whether the governmental act applies exclusively to the contractor or more broadly to include other parties not in a contractual relationship with the g overnment.conner,at.
the dispute here concerns the government decision to deny jtc employees access to malmstrom.although jtc had not encountered difficulty obtaining base access for its employees for prior contracts at malmstrom,the government began denying access to jtc employees with criminal records soon after jtc commenced performance of the contract at issue here,forcing jtc to hire a less experienced work force and increasing jtc cost of performance.the asbca determined that the denial of access to jtc employees pursuant to three documents the july,space wing pamphlet the pamphlet,the july,space wing instruction the instruction,and the october base access memorandum the october memorandum constituted sovereign acts that shielded the government from liability.in support,the asbca noted that each of these documents applies to all contractors and contractor personnel and that t here is no evidence that the policy was intended to nullify contract rights or that it provided to the g overnment an economic advantage,see evaluating the october memorandum,evaluating the pamphlet and instruction.
substantial evidence supports the asbca factual findings that the government base access policy was a public and general act.it is true that there is ample evidence that the government base access policies were subject to the whim s of the wing commander.see stating that,over twenty years and dozens of projects,no jtc employees had been denied access prior to the contract at issue here,stating that the october memorandum was a large change,good luck on this one,the policy appears to be undefined and pretty hard to defend.however,the relevant provisions in both the pamphlet and the instruction applied to contractors generally rather than specifically to garco or jtc,see setting forth the policy for contractors who require entry to malmstrom,and the october memorandum was addressed to all contractors and contractor personnel,emphasis added omitted.in addition,the record is replete with evidence indicating that the purpose of the base access policy was to ensure malmstrom security.see,assessing the security impacts of three separate base access policies,the purpose of a national crime information center check i s to determine if there is any unfavorable information which may be detrimental to the security of the installation and preservation of good order and discipline on the installation.finally,garco has not identified any evidence either below or before this court that demonstrates that the pamphlet,the instruction,or the october memorandum were directed at nullifying garco or jtc contract rights.there is no evidence that the policy articulated in,inter alia,the pamphlet or instruction was intended to nullify contract rights or that it provided to the g overnment an economic advantage,garco presents no evidence contradicting major general finan declaration as to the general purpose of the policy.see generally appellant br.thus,i agree with the asbca that the government denial of access to malmstrom was a public and general act.
substantial evidence does not support the asbca finding that the government acts would release it from liability 
because i would find that substantial evidence supports the asbca determination that the government denial of access to malmstrom was a public and general act,i believe we must consider the second factor of the test,whether that act would otherwise release the government from liability under ordinary principles of contract law.stockton,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this second factor turns on what is known in contract law as the impossibility sometimes impracticability defense.id.to establish this defense,the government must show that both full performance and substantial performance of the contract by the government are impossible.winstar,at carabetta,united states,fed.cir.to make this showing,the government must demonstrate that the event rendering its performance impossible was an event contrary to the basic assumptions on which the parties agreed and that the language or circumstances do not indicate that the government should be liable in any case.winstar,at see nash cibinic the determination of whether the nonoccurence of a specific sovereign act was a basic of the contract will depend on the nature of the act and the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract as well as its terms.if the government does not carry its burden of showing impossibility,then its invocation of the sovereign acts defense fails.see klamath,at stating that the trial court erred in holding that impossibility of performance is not a factor to be taken into account in considering the sovereign acts doctrine.
the asbca neither made any findings as to impossibility nor referenced it at all,see,and nothing in the record indicates that the government raised impossibility before the asbca.on appeal,the government does not argue impossibility or provide evidentiary support for a finding of impossibility.see generally appellee br.indeed,neither impossibility nor its variants appear in the parties briefs or in the joint appendix.see generally appellant appellee appellant reply 
where the asbca has failed to make factual findings as to impossibility in prior cases,we have reached three different results.in one instance,we vacated and remanded for additional fact finding so that the g overment would have the opportunity to carry its burden of establishing that performance of the various contracts at issue was impossible.klamath,at footnote omitted.in another,we reversed and remanded the trial court application of the sovereign acts doctrine because t he g overnment c ould not avail itself of the impossibility defense to save it from this breach of contract claim.city line joint venture united states,fed.cir.finally,in a third,we found that the plaintiff waived its arguments as to impossibility by failing to raise them before the asbca and affirmed the asbca application of the sovereign act defense.see conner,at.
i would find vacating and remanding to be the most appropriate result here see.power light lorion,i f the agency has not considered all relevant factors,the proper course,except in rare circumstances,is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.the reviewing court is not generally empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.appellate courts do not make factual findings they review them.mittal steel point lisas united states,fed.cir.because the asbca did not make any factual findings as to impossibility,i believe that it is inappropriate for
