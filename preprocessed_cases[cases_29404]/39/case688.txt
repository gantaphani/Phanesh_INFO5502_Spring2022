this federal contract case concerns the constitutionality of of the national defense authorization act of the program,stat,as amended,codified at,which permits the united states department of defense dod to preferentially select bids submitted by small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals sdbs.the program operates by increasing the bid of a firm by up to ten percent via a mechanism called a adjustment.rothe development corporation rothe appeals the april,decision of the united states district court for the western district of texas granting summary judgment in favor of the government that the program is constitutional,as enacted and as applied in this case in which rothe lost an air force contract to a sdb due to application of the program.rothe dev.united states dep t of defense,d,rothe i.in reviewing the program,the district court applied a deferential standard of review,and relied extensively on evidence the reauthorization of the program collected in an amicus brief filed on behalf of the government,and in a government study.rothe contends that the program violates its equal protection rights under the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution,because the program lacks the evidentiary foundation required to justify the enactment and application of a classification.in defending the program,the government argues that congress had sufficient evidence from which to conclude that the dod had at least been a passive participant in perpetuating the lingering effects of past,private discriminatory conduct that significantly handicapped minorities from obtaining defense contracts,such that remedial relief was justified,and moreover,that the program was narrowly tailored in addressing this remedial need.the government also argues that evidence the program last reauthorization in justified the program even if we find that the evidence alone was insufficient.because we conclude that the district court improperly applied a deferential legal standard rather than strict scrutiny,and also impermissibly relied on evidence to support the program constitutionality as reauthorized,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a.the.purpose and history of the program 
congress enacted the program to ensure that substantial progress is made in increasing awards of dod contracts to section a entities,a,stat.first enacted by congress for fiscal years through,sets a goal that five percent of the total dollar amount obligated for defense contracts and subcontracts for each fiscal year would be awarded to businesses that are small and are owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.a a.the five percent goal is a goal that is not segmented by industry categories conf.at,reprinted in.the relevant statutory language provides 
goal.except as provided in subsection d,a goal of percent of the amount described in subsection b shall be the objective of the department of defense in each fiscal year for the total combined amount obligated for contracts and subcontracts entered into with 
small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals as such term is used in section d of the small business act d and regulations issued under that section 
a a.in order to meet the goal,regulations promulgated pursuant to authorized the dod to raise the bids of bidders by as much as ten percent above the fair market price per contract subpart id.
the program was initially enacted as a pilot program.in,congress extended the program from until,with the hope that the additional three years would provide the dod,and the defense industry,with the opportunity to vigorously pursue the program fundamental objective to expand the participation of disadvantaged small business concerns in the defense marketplace,at,reprinted in,b,stat.despite the continuation of the program beyond its initial period of authorization,in the first five years of the program,the dod did not meet the goal of increasing participation by sdbs to five percent of its total dollar amount allocated for contracts and subcontracts.as a result,in,congress reauthorized the program for seven more years,through fiscal year,a b,stat.in every year since the reauthorization,the dod has met the five percent goal.in,for instance,the air force awarded at least percent of its total eligible contract dollars to sdbs.
in,congress amended the program to require the dod to suspend the use of the adjustment for one year after any fiscal year in which the dod awards more than five percent of its eligible contract dollars to sdbs,stat.because the dod met the five percent goal in both fiscal years and,the dod suspended the ten percent preference for those last two calendar years.in,congress reauthorized the program for three more years,stat.without congressional reauthorization,the program will expire at the end of fiscal year.
requirements of the program 
the preference program challenged in this case was established pursuant to,and incorporated portions of the small business act act,d and g.section references d of the act,as amended,et,to define a sdb according to the racial or ethnic background of the controlling owner.a a d.a business is small if it is independently owned and operated,if it is not dominant in its field of operation,and if its number of employees or annual gross receipts fall below predetermined levels.a.the act defines socially disadvantaged individuals as those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities.a.economically disadvantaged individuals are defined as those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged.a a.under the act,five groups comprising subgroups,including asian pacific americans,are presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged d c.a member of such a group is deemed to own and control a sdb if he or she owns at least percent of the business,and controls management and daily operations.d c i ii.regulations promulgated pursuant to the statute provide that either a contracting officer,an unsuccessful bidder,or the small business administration sba may challenge an individual presumptive status as socially or economically disadvantaged.bidding sdbs may elect to waive the adjustment.a.
section and its implementing regulations impose a number of requirements in order for sdbs to participate in the program.under regulations promulgated pursuant to the statute,an owner of a sdb must have a net personal worth of less than,excluding the value of his or her place of business and personal residence.b.moreover,individuals who are not members of the presumptively disadvantaged groups can nevertheless be entitled to application of the adjustment to bids of competitors provided they demonstrate that they have been socially or economically disadvantaged because of their color,ethnicity,gender,physical handicap,residence in an environment isolated from the mainstream of american society,or other similar cause not common to small business persons who are not socially disadvantaged.c i.
b.the contract at issue 
rothe is based in san antonio,texas,and is owned by suzanne patenaude,a caucasian female.since,rothe had contracted with the department of the air force to maintain,operate,and repair the computer systems of the switchboard operations and network control center ncc at columbus air force base in mississippi.david and kim sohn of baltimore,maryland,own and operate international computer and telecommunications,ict,a sdb with annual revenues of approximately million.ict also performs computer maintenance and repair work and was rothe number one competitor.
in an effort to improve contractor accountability and quality,the air force decided to consolidate rothe contract with a contract for base telecommunications services bts.on march,the engineering installation wing at tinker air force base,oklahoma,issued a solicitation for competitive bids on the combined contract,and announced that,unlike predecessor contracts,the proposed contract would be let pursuant to the program.five contractors submitted bids.two bidders were sdbs.rothe,which was not a sdb,bid million,and was the lowest bidder.ict,which was a sdb and thus could participate in the program,bid million.through application of the adjustment,rothe bid was increased to million for purposes of the bid selection.on august,the air force awarded the contract to ict,the fictionally lowest bidder.according to the district court,the parties agree that rothe lost the bid only because of application of the adjustment.rothe i,d at.
the contract in this case was scheduled to expire on september.however,the air force exercised an option to extend ict contract through september.ict has not performed any work under the disputed contract since april,however,because first the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit and later this court imposed a stay pending resolution of this appeal.as a consequence,the air force issued a new solicitation for the work covered by the disputed contract.thus,the lawfulness of the award of the contract to ict is not at issue.
procedural history 
on november,rothe brought suit against the dod and the united states department of the air force,challenging the constitutionality of the program both as enacted and as applied under the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause.rothe sought declaratory and injunctive relief barring award of the contract and continued application of the program to future contracts,and monetary damages to compensate it for its bid preparation costs and attorney fees.on november,the united states district court for the western district of texas denied rothe motion for a preliminary injunction.on february,the parties filed for summary judgment.on april,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government and entered its judgment.rothe i.
rothe filed a timely notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit.the government moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.rothe dev.united states dep t of defense,cir rothe ii.on october,the fifth circuit granted the government motion,holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal,but instead of dismissing the appeal,transferred it to this court.id.at.we heard oral argument in this case on november.
standard of appellate review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d anderson liberty lobby,d.in evaluating the grant of a motion for summary judgment,our task is to discern whether the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.matsushita indus,zenith radio,d.in this case,however,the issues are ones of law based on underlying facts that are essentially undisputed.what is sharply disputed are the inferences and conclusions that may properly be drawn from those underlying facts.
jurisdiction 
under a,this court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals and decide all issues raised in cases in which the district court subject matter jurisdiction is based,in whole or in part,on the tucker act,a emphasis added.the tucker act confers on district courts original jurisdiction,concurrent with that of the united states court of federal claims,over a ny civil action or claim against the united states,not exceeding in amount,founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress,or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.id.under the tucker act,an unsuccessful bidder can recover its bid preparation costs from the government on the theory that failure to evaluate a bid honestly and fairly breaches an contract of fair dealing.coflexip,united states.as a suit to recover its bid preparation costs,rothe complaint invoked the tucker act.thus,this court has exclusive jurisdiction over all issues rothe raises in this appeal.therefore,we will not return the appeal to the fifth circuit and will address all issues properly raised.
burden of proof 
as a preliminary matter,we must address whether the district court correctly allocated the burden of proof.rothe argues that the district court erred in placing the burden on rothe to prove that the adjustment was unconstitutional.citing adarand constructors,pena,d adarand iii,rothe contends that it is the governmental actor that must justify its use of an affirmative action program.rothe i,d at.
we believe the district court correctly placed the burden of proof on rothe to demonstrate that the program was unconstitutional.before a court can assess whether a plaintiff has met his or her burden of proof,however,the court must review the government evidentiary support to determine whether the legislative body had a strong basis in evidence to believe that remedial action based on race was necessary.wygant jackson bd.of,d plurality op.thus,the government bears the burden to produce evidence,the burden of going forward with evidence.the challengers,however,continue to bear the ultimate burden of persuading the court that the entity evidence did not support an inference of prior discrimination and thus a remedial purpose,or that the plan instituted on the basis of this evidence was not sufficiently narrowly tailored.id.at,concurring.
legal standard for reviewing federal race based classifications 
congress authority to enact race based classifications 
congress authority to enact classifications flows from either of two distinct sources of congressional power.under article i of the united states constitution,congress can attach conditions when it appropriates for a federal program.when it enacts legislation pursuant to article i,it is free to attach any condition so long as it does so without violating the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause see fullilove klutznick,d.
additionally,of the fourteenth amendment gives congress a separate and distinct source of authority to enact remedial racial classifications section is a positive grant of legislative power to congress,katzenbach morgan,d,that is limited to congressional remedial action against the state and state actors,not private individuals.see,bd.of trustees of the of garrett,d congress authority is appropriately exercised only in response to state transgressions.nor does it apply against federal actors.the limits placed on congress when it enacts a program under have not been clearly defined,as the supreme court has expressly declined to decide whether deference applies.see adarand iii,at.noting that justices have taken different views on the extent to which courts should defer to congress exercise of its authority,but that the court declined to address those differences.
the program was enacted pursuant to congress article i powers to appropriate funds for the armed forces,and is a program that affects private firms that submit bids to contract with the dod.see metro broadcasting fcc,d,dissenting rejecting the argument that applies to federal programs administered by federal officials.thus,in determining whether the program is constitutional,we must review the governing case law to determine the limits the fifth amendment places on congressional power to enact racial classifications under article i.we do not,and need not,decide the proper analysis for cases involving congress power under of the fourteenth amendment.
the fifth amendment as a limit on congressional power to enact classifications 
prior to,the supreme court applied a different standard of review depending upon the constitutional basis for enacting the classification.if the program was enacted by a state or municipality,and thus subject to the limits of of the fourteenth amendment,the court applied the highest level of review strict scrutiny.city of richmond croson,d determining whether a racial classification satisfied strict scrutiny required an inquiry into whether the suspect classification,race served a compelling interest and was narrowly tailored in furtherance of that interest.id.
initially,however,the supreme court construed the limits placed on federal programs under the fifth amendment and thus applicable to federal programs enacted under article i to be different than those under the fourteenth amendment applicable to states and municipalities.until,classifications enacted by the federal government were subject to scrutiny intermediate scrutiny whereby the classification would satisfy constitutional requirements if it was substantially related to an important governmental objective.metro broadcasting,at.
in,in adarand iii a case involving the constitutionality of a federal racial classification enacted under article i,a majority of the court definitively held that all racial they be enacted by a state,a municipality,or the federal subject to the strictest judicial scrutiny adarand iii,at.holding that any person,of whatever race,has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny emphasis added.while the adarand iii court did not detail the precise analysis to apply to a federal racial classification the court express abandonment of prior case law applying different and less rigorous levels of scrutiny to federal racial classifications left no doubt that the court intended there to be only one kind of strict scrutiny,applied with the same level of rigor to both racial classifications and federal racial classifications enacted under congress article i power.id.at.abandoning the metro broadcasting approach because such approach had repudiated the notion that it would be unthinkable that the same constitution would impose a lesser duty on the federal government than it does on a state to afford equal protection of the laws internal citation omitted emphasis added id.at.noting that the fullilove approach applying intermediate scrutiny to federal racial classifications was no longer controlling to the extent it would hold federal racial classifications to a less rigorous standard emphasis added.
moreover,the court reference to its historical practice of applying fourteenth amendment precedent to fifth amendment equal protection problems provides a clear indication that it is the croson earlier to state and municipal provides the benchmark for judging the constitutionality of a federal racial classification.id.at.noting that i n case after case,f ifth a mendment equal protection problems are discussed on the assumption that f ourteenth a mendment precedents are controlling citing karst,the fifth amendment guarantee of equal protection,see also id.at.noting that even after metro broadcasting,the court indicated that croson had at least some bearing on federal action when it vacated a decision upholding such action and remanded for further consideration in light of croson citing porter metro.dade county,d id.citing mann albany,cir croson may be applicable to classifications imposed by congress.
analysis of the legal standard applied by the district court 
although acknowledging that strict scrutiny must be applied in reviewing a federal racial classification,the district court in this case opined that congress,unlike states or municipalities,should be given deference both in articulating a compelling purpose and in showing that its action is narrowly tailored to that purpose.rothe i,d at see also id.noting that i f congress is to be allowed a broad vision of the nation problems,it seems only logical that it be allowed some measure of deference in addressing those problems id.at noting that deference should be given to congressional findings that discrimination has continued and must be addressed.in applying this deferential scrutiny,the district court expressly declined to conduct a analysis of the program.id.at stating that federal racial classifications should not be rigidly held to the standards set forth in croson see also id.noting that the narrow tailoring factors discussed in croson should not be applied in lockstep conformity with croson id.at arguing that croson mandate that a local government make specific findings regarding specific minorities in specific industries should not be applied without alteration,to the acts of congress emphasis in original.
the district court supported its approach by relying exclusively on language in two supreme court plurality opinions,both discussing congress remedial powers under of the fourteenth amendment,not the limits imposed by the fifth amendment on the exercise of its article i appropriating powers.id.at.the district court noted that in both the fullilove and croson plurality opinions,certain members of the court had indicated that since congress enjoyed a more comprehensive remedial power than other governmental bodies with which to enforce equal protection guarantees,its findings would be entitled to greater deference than those of a state or municipal legislative body id.at citing fullilove,at.see also id.at noting that in croson,justice,when writing for only a plurality,had allegedly affirmed the court deference to federal programs,when she observed that congress,unlike any state or political subdivision,has a specific constitutional mandate to enforce the dictates of the fourteenth amendment citing croson,at.plurality.adarand iii,the district court said,had left undisturbed the various justices previously expressed views on congress remedial power.the district court noted that in adarand iii,justice,again writing for only a plurality of the court,merely acknowledged that the court as a whole had not yet come to terms with the question of what deference to give congressional remedial actions.id.the district court thus opined that since no justice on the court had repudiated his or her previously expressed views on the subject,id.at citing adarand iii,at,a simple headcount assures this court that a majority of the supreme court,including justice and the four dissenters in adarand,would favor some standard that allowed congress a broader brush than it would allow the states with which to design remedial measures for the purpose of addressing nationwide discrimination.id.in fashioning this broader brush,the district court concluded that it need not scrutinize as rigorously congress conclusion that remedial action was necessary and that it was narrowly tailored.id.at.
we hold that the district court erred in concluding that federal racial classifications should be reviewed under a deferential analysis that is not applicable to state or municipal classifications.indeed,as justice noted in adarand iii,creating a distinction between state and federal racial classifications lacks support in supreme court precedent and undermines the fundamental principle of equal protection as a personal right.adarand iii,at.plurality.in effect,the district court appears to have discerned in the plurality and dissenting opinions a basis to apply to federal programs a version of strict scrutiny as articulated in croson.we reject the notion of lesser scrutiny,which seems suspiciously like the scrutiny of metro broadcasting.while the district court may be correct that congress may be owed deference when it legislates pursuant to,that issue is not before us today.the program was enacted pursuant to article i,and so,as set forth in adarand iii,congress isentitled to no deference in determining whether congress had a compelling interest in enacting the racial classification,and that the classification was narrowly tailored in fulfillment of that interest on remand,thus,the district court should undertake the same type of detailed,skeptical,analysis undertaken by the croson court,but specifically account for the factual differences between this program and that at issue in croson.id.at.noting that strict scrutiny requires taking relevant differences into account.adopting the strict scrutiny analysis to the specific facts at issue in a case,however,must not result in a lesser degree of scrutiny than was required by the court in croson.strict scrutiny is a single standard and must be followed here.
pre reauthorization evidence 
the district court admittedly engaged in only a cursory analysis of the evidence before congress at the time of the reauthorization of the program,choosing instead to focus primarily on evidence.because the reauthorization of the program in constitutes a new statute,the district court need only have considered whether there was a compelling interest in reauthorizing the program in it is irrelevant for purposes of this case whether the original statute fails for want of a sufficient factual predicate as to the evidence,the district court merely set forth a list of reports and other materials that congress apparently had before it during the initial enactment and last reauthorization of the program.to support its conclusion that congress had a compelling interest in enacting the program,the district court cited three congressional documents.rothe i,d at citing cong.rec.cong.rec.small disadvantaged business preauthorization,hearing before the investigative subcommittee of the house committee on armed services,sess.the district court also cited four congressional documents relating to enactment of a separate minority advantage program,the a program id.citing,sess.only three percent of american businesses were owned by minorities,while minorities made up sixteen percent of the population congressional research service,minority enterprise and public policy,june,sba success in aiding disadvantaged firms described as minimal small and minority business in the decade of the,sess,and,sess.to support its conclusion that asian pacific americans had been discriminated against,the district court referenced findings by the small business administration sba,made prior to congress inclusion of asian pacific americans in the sba presumption in.rothe i,d at see also,stat,a,stat,codified at f.
under croson,in order to determine whether a racial classification is constitutional,a reviewing court must be satisfied that a strong basis in evidence supports the legislature conclusion that discrimination persisted and remedial action was needed.croson,at.citing wygant,at.in order for us to undertake meaningful appellate review,it is essential that the district court set forth detailed findings as to the scope and content of the reports before congress when it enacted the challenged legislation,and set forth whatever inferences may be drawn as to whether such reports could constitute a strong basis in evidence for remedial action.id.at.plurality,noting that the reviewing court should make proper findings which define both the scope of the injury and the extent of the remedy necessary to cure its effects.it is true that the same reports before the district court are before us on appeal,and that whether those reports constitute a strong basis in evidence to support the challenged program is a question of law that we will ultimately review de novo.however,like the supreme court,we believe that it is the province of the district court to evaluate whether evidence within the particular reports and studies before congress was indeed sufficient to constitute a strong basis in evidence of discrimination or its lingering effects.see adarand iii,at.remanding to lower court when lower court improperly applied a lessened level of scrutiny in its analysis of the evidentiary record.
in the present appeal,the mere listing of references by the district court fails,we hold,to provide adequate findings on which to conclude that congress had a strong basis in evidence for reauthorizing the program.under croson,a classification may be enacted to remedy only identified systematic discrimination.accordingly,generalized assertions of legislative purpose or statements generally alleging societal discrimination or an individual anecdotal accounts of discriminatory conduct would have little or no probative value in supporting enactment of a measure.see croson,at.a generalized assertion that there has been past discrimination in an entire industry provides no guidance for a legislative body to determine the precise scope of the injury it seeks to remedy.wygant,at.societal discrimination,without more,is too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy.the evidence cited by the district court does not show that the program was designed to address a remedial need,nor does it provide any indication that the program was enacted in response to systematic discrimination against asian pacific americans or the lingering effects thereof.moreover,while the sba findings support a conclusion that congress believed there was sufficient evidence upon which to include asian pacific americans in the sba presumption,such a conclusion,made in,seven years before the initial enactment of the program and almost twelve years before the time of the reenactment,does not necessarily support a conclusion that congress had a strong basis in evidence for including and,after,for continuing to include the presumption in the dod program.
statistical evidence is particularly important to justify legislation.see croson,at.plurality,noting that a prima facie case of discrimination can arise w here there is a significant statistical disparity between the number of qualified minority contractors willing and able to perform a particular service and the number of such contractors actually engaged by the locality or the locality prime contractors.indeed,nearly every court of appeals upholding the constitutionality of a classification has relied in whole or in part on statistical evidence.see,cone hillsborough county,cir statistical disparity between the total percentage of minorities involved in construction and the work going to minorities shows that the racial classification in the county plan was necessary adarand vii,at disparity between minority availability and market utilization in the highway construction subcontracting industry raises an inference that discriminatory factors have created the disparity.the only statistical evidence cited by the district court is a statement in a house report that only three percent of american businesses were owned by minorities,while minorities made up sixteen percent of the population,sess,cited in rothe i,d at.we conclude that this statistic itself is insufficient to support the constitutionality of the program as reauthorized.this report provides no data on how many minorities sought to own small businesses,nor does it take into account the particular industry of the contract at issue,let alone how many small businesses in this industry were qualified,willing,and able to compete for dod contracts,like the one at issue here.further,the statistic does not take into account the fact that the sheer number of businesses owned by minorities may not be significantly correlated with the volume of business conducted by businesses.moreover,the statistic may be outdated,as it was already twelve years old at the time congress initially enacted the program,and seventeen years old at the time of reauthorization.
there may be other evidence in the reports cited by the district court that could suffice to uphold the constitutionality of the program.however,we believe that it is the province of the district court to make express findings as to whether other evidence that was before congress at the time of the reauthorization of the program is sufficient to support its constitutionality.we thus conclude that the evidence at least insofar as it is relied on by the district court is insufficient to satisfy the strong basis in evidence requirement in croson for determining that there was a compelling interest for reauthorization of the program 
post enactment evidence 
the district court relied heavily on two sources of evidence in upholding the constitutionality of the program.first,the court relied on the evidence cited in the brief of its amicus curiae,the asian american legal defense and education fund aaldef,to bolster its conclusion that asian pacific americans had been discriminated against.rothe i,d at congress has made findings specific to asian americans and evidence bolsters those findings.in a footnote,the district court said that it relied on the brief and evidence cited by the aaldef in reaching its determination that congress ha d a compelling purpose to act to remedy discrimination in government contracting.id.at second,the court relied on a benchmark study conducted by the department of commerce.id.at.the study,based on data collected from a random sample of federal procurements in fiscal year,concluded that although sdbs in the business services industry had the capacity to perform percent of the federal civilian and military contracting dollars,they were awarded only percent of those dollars.id.at citing.
the circuit courts seem to be in substantial agreement that there are at least several permissible uses for evidence.evidence gathered after the initial enactment of a racial classification but before the reauthorization or reenactment of the program may certainly be considered to determine whether the program is constitutional as reenacted.see concrete works of,denver,cir noting that evidence may be considered when the legislative body modified and expanded the scope of a racial classification since the initial enactment.moreover,evidence may certainly be considered in determining whether a racial classification is constitutional as applied.it is for this reason that some circuit courts have considered evidence in determining whether to issue injunctive relief,or in determining whether a program is still narrowly tailored.see contractors ass of,city of,cir contractors ass i consideration of evidence is especially appropriate where the principal relief sought was an injunction.concrete works,at holding that evidence,if carefully scrutinized for its accuracy,will often prove quite useful in evaluating the remedial effects or shortcomings of the program.
the use of evidence to justify the constitutionality of a program,as enacted,presents a more difficult question.the supreme court has consistently held that once an affirmative action program is challenged in litigation,the program can only be upheld if there is a strong basis in evidence that it is remedial in nature.wygant,at.croson,at.whether a legislature similarly must have a strong basis in evidence of discrimination at the time it first enacts a racial classification,or whether it may satisfy the strong basis in evidence standard in litigation by relying on additional evidence is a question of which the circuit courts have expressed different views.
it is clear from the supreme court opinions that a legislative body must have some evidence of discrimination before it in order to constitutionally enact a program.see id.at.plurality op.if the city of richmond had evidence before it that nonminority contractors were systematically excluding minority businesses from subcontracting opportunities it could take action to end the discriminatory exclusion.emphasis added wygant,at.a public employer like the board must ensure that,before it embarks on an program,it has convincing evidence that remedial action is warranted.emphasis added.circuit courts have consistently held that,absent a showing that a legislature had some evidence of discrimination before it when it enacted a racial classification,the program would be unconstitutional.see,coral constr.king,cir a ny program adopted without some legitimate evidence of discrimination is presumptively invalid.
while there is no question that a legislature must have some evidence of discrimination before it may constitutionally enact an affirmative action program,there has been arguable ambiguity as to whether legislatures may only act upon the same strong basis in evidence standard that ultimately must be demonstrated during litigation.statements in croson and wygant arguably can be interpreted to suggest that the evidentiary burden faced by a legislature when it enacts a program is substantially less than when such a program is ultimately challenged in court.for example,in croson,the court noted that w hile the states and their subdivisions may take remedial action when they possess evidence that their own spending practices are exacerbating a pattern of prior discrimination,they must identify that discrimination with some specificity before they may use relief.croson,at.emphasis added.similarly,justice powell plurality opinion in wygant states that the court has insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved before allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination.wygant,at.emphasis added.some circuit courts have read these statements and others to support a holding that the evidentiary requirement imposed on legislatures is significantly lower than the strong basis in evidence requirement imposed when the program is challenged in litigation.see,coral,at w here a state has a good faith reason to believe that systematic discrimination has occurred,and is continuing to occur,in a local industry,we will not strike down the program for inadequacy of the record if subsequent factfinding bears out the need for the program.ensley branch.seibels,cir it is not necessary for the city and board to show that,when they approved the decrees,they already had strong evidence of discrimination.contractors ass of,city of,cir contractors ass ii noting that it is appropriate to consider any evidence,pre or,relevant to the issue of whether such discrimination,or the effects thereof,existed prior to the date the challenged ordinance was first enacted.
more recent supreme court cases clarify,however,that there is no difference in the evidentiary burden that must be faced during litigation,a strong basis in evidence and the evidence that a legislature must have before it when it enacts a racial classification.in shaw hunt,d,the court considered whether the state of north carolina congressional redistricting plan contained impermissible racial gerrymandering id.at.in setting forth the standard governing whether the gerrymandering could be interpreted as necessary to avoid liability under the voting rights act,the court made clear that the state legislature would be required to have a strong basis in evidence that the gerrymandering was a necessary remedy prior to enacting the plan.id.at.t he institution that makes the racial distinction must have had a strong basis in evidence to conclude that remedial action was necessary,before it embarks on an program.id.at.quoting wygant,at.emphasis in original.importantly,the court italicized the word before,emphasizing that the legislature had to have the evidence at the time of its enactment.moreover,alleviating any ambiguity as to the scope of the required evidence,the court made clear that the legislature had to have a strong basis in evidence.this,of course,is the same phrase that the supreme court used in both wygant and croson to describe the amount of evidence that must ultimately be shown during litigation to uphold the constitutionality of the program.the shaw court also emphasized that the reviewing court must assess what actually motivated the legislature,not what may have motivated it.id.at.a racial classification can not withstand strict scrutiny based upon speculation about what may have motivated the legislature.to be a compelling interest,the state must show that the alleged objective was the legislature actual purpose for the discriminatory classification.a plurality of justices in croson reasoned,the purpose of strict scrutiny is to smoke out illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative body is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool.croson,at.plurality.construing federal law,a majority of justices in adarand iii adhered to the croson plurality recognition that governmental motivation plays a prominent role in a strict scrutiny analysis of a federal scheme.adarand iii,at.quoting the language in croson and subsequently stating we adhere to that view today.it is axiomatic that a court can not smoke out illegitimate uses of race in governmental pronouncements with evidence not available to the governmental body prior to promulgation.
moreover,in bush vera,d,an opinion issued the same day as shaw in which the court said that the results of the election could not be used to support a redistricting plan approved in,justice,writing for a plurality,again quoted the strong basis in evidence test from shaw and emphasized the word before.bush,at.noting that the legislature must have had a strong basis in evidence to conclude that remedial action was necessary,before it embarks on an affirmative action program,quoting shaw,at.emphasis in original.
thus,shaw makes clear that the quantum of evidence that is ultimately necessary to uphold racial classifications must have actually been before the legislature at the time of enactment.in light of shaw,we conclude that if the evidence is insufficient to maintain the program when the program is challenged as reauthorized,the program must be invalidated,regardless of the extent of evidence.when a program that has been reauthorized is challenged,all evidence available to the appropriate legislative body prior to reauthorization must be considered in assessing the program constitutionality.requiring a strong basis in evidence before the legislature enacts or reauthorizes a racial classification is essential for verifying that a program is truly remedial in design.see croson,at.plurality,j.moreover,our holding finds support in the language of a decision of the sixth circuit and of several district courts 
having identified what we believe to be the permissible uses of evidence,we now turn to the district court opinion.the district court explicitly stated that in reviewing whether congress had established a compelling interest for enacting a racial classification,it relied on the evidence presented by the aaldef rothe i,d at.the district court also relied on the benchmark study to support the government claim of a compelling interest,id.at,and to show that the program stated numerical goal of five percent minority participation was proportional to the relevant market when the program was reauthorized in.id.at.
we hold that the district court impermissibly used evidence to justify its conclusion that congress acted with a compelling interest when it reauthorized the program in and.on remand,the district court must reevaluate the constitutional sufficiency of the program as reauthorized by reliance only on the evidence.the district court,of course,may rely on evidence for other purposes.evidence would be particularly relevant in determining whether the program was constitutional as applied,whether or not there still exists a compelling need for the program and whether the program is still narrowly tailored.
factors for the district court to consider on remand 
we remand for a determination of the constitutionality of the program under a strict scrutiny standard,particularly in accordance with the principles set forth in croson and adarand iii.as set forth above,congress decision to enact legislation must be reviewed under the same,analysis that applies to state or municipal racial classifications.the constitutionality of the program must be assessed as reauthorized in,as applied to rothe bid in,and at present,to the extent that declaratory or injunctive relief is still sought.following are general principles to be considered on remand.
compelling interest 
croson provides that classifications are strictly reserved for remedial settings.croson,at.plurality.accordingly,the program can not be constitutional unless it was indeed enacted as a remedial measure.in order to ensure that the motive for the program was legitimate and not merely the product of illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype or enacted in response to factors hindering minority participation,the district court must define both the scope of the injury and the extent of the remedy necessary to cure its effects.id.at.if the court determines that the program is remedial in nature,it should specify whether it is a remedy to correct present discrimination,or only to counter lingering effects of past discrimination.if the case is best characterized as a lingering effects case,the district court would need to make an assessment as to whether the evidence is still probative,whether the effects of past discrimination have attenuated over time,or if in determining the constitutionality of the program as applied,whether the lingering effects are still present or were present in when the program was applied to rothe and ict bids.moreover,the district court should also specify whether the government involvement in the discrimination or lingering effects is so pervasive such that the government and in particular,the dod became a passive participant in perpetuating it.see id.at.i f the city could show that it had essentially become a passive participant in a system of racial exclusion practiced by elements of the local construction industry the city could take affirmative steps to dismantle such a system.
the district court properly determined that there are important differences between the program and the program at issue in croson,particularly as to geographic scope.as noted above,these factual differences do not influence the standard of review,which is necessarily strict scrutiny.however,for purposes of determining whether congress had a strong basis in evidence for enacting the program,and whether the program is narrowly tailored,the district court is certainly correct that congress had a broader brush than municipalities for remedying discrimination.rothe i,d at.whereas municipalities must necessarily identify discrimination in the immediate locality to justify a program,we do not think that congress needs to have had evidence before it of discrimination in all fifty states in order to justify the program.see adarand vii,at the fact that congress enactments must serve a compelling interest does not necessitate the conclusion that the scope of that interest must be as geographically limited as that of a local government.contrarily,evidence of a few isolated instances of discrimination would be insufficient to uphold the nationwide program.where to draw the line is in the first instance a task for the district court.
furthermore,the district court should determine whether evidence of discrimination is sufficiently pervasive across racial lines to justify granting a preference to all five purportedly disadvantaged racial groups included under the program.as noted by the croson court,congress may not justify a racial preference that benefits all minorities merely by identifying discrimination as to one racial group.in finding the racial preference in croson grossly overinclusive,the supreme court noted that the richmond city council had only identified instances of discrimination against blacks,with absolutely no evidence of past discrimination against,oriental,indian,eskimo,or aleut persons in any aspect of the richmond construction industry.croson,at.a racial preference can not be remedial when a disadvantaged minority member must share his or her remedial relief with other minorities that have never been the victim of discrimination.id.accordingly,congress must have identified a pattern of discrimination that broadly affected all the minorities who receive a preference under the program.this is not to say that there must have been particular findings either express or implied as to each racial subclass in order to justify the program.rather than identify instances of discrimination against each particular asian subgroup,korean americans,chinese americans,the district court might properly determine that congress had before it evidence of discrimination against asian pacific americans in general.adarand vii,at rejecting contention that congress must make specific findings regarding discrimination against every single of individuals within the broad racial and ethnic categories designated.
in addition to reviewing whether there was evidence of discrimination or the lingering effects thereof against each minority group included in the program,the district court must also determine whether discriminatory conduct or effects were experienced in the specific industry.a reviewing court must not blindly defer to the government definition of the affected industry.see croson,at.the history of racial classifications in this country suggests that blind judicial deference to legislative or executive pronouncements of necessity has no place in equal protection analysis.in this case,the government argues that the industry grouping business services in all federal procurement as defined by the benchmark study is the appropriate industry rothe,in contrast,argues that the industry grouping should be limited to computer maintenance and repair services in the defense industry.we decline to define the relevant industry,because we think that it is incumbent for the district court to review the evidence on which it relied and make findings as to what the relevant industry is and whether there was sufficient evidence of discrimination in which to justify application of a racial preference in that industry,both in,in,and at the present time to the extent rothe still seeks injunctive relief.
furthermore,the district court should determine whether the evidence before it is sufficiently timely and sufficiently substantive,not merely anecdotal to properly support the program constitutionality.we note that much of the evidence referenced by the district court was more than a decade old by the time of the program reauthorization in.whether this evidence remained viable in when the program was reauthorized,in when the program was applied to rothe bid,or in,when a ruling on the requested injunctive relief may issue is a factual question for the district court to resolve.
narrow tailoring 
on remand,the district court must also reassess whether the program is narrowly tailored,both as reauthorized and as applied,under a version of strict scrutiny.there are six factors commonly considered in the narrow tailoring analysis the necessity of relief the efficacy of alternative,remedies the flexibility of relief,including the availability of waiver provisions the relationship of the stated numerical goals to the relevant labor market the impact of relief on the rights of third parties and the overinclusiveness or underinclusiveness of the racial classification.united states paradise,d croson,at.including over and in the narrow tailoring factors adarand iii,at.noting that the lower court on remand should consider whether the legislative body had tried alternatives and whether the program was limited in duration.in this case,the district court thoroughly analyzed and correctly concluded that the program was flexible in application,limited in duration,and that it did not unduly impact on the rights of third parties.rothe i,d at.the district court,however,did not properly analyze three of the other narrow tailoring factors.
examining the efficacy of race neutral alternatives.
in this case,the district court considered whether congress had attempted measures before enacting the program.because it applied a deferential analysis,however,it did not strictly scrutinize whether congress found these alternatives ineffective.id.at noting that deference should be given to congressional findings that discrimination has continued and must be addressed,as evidenced by the repeated renewal of the preference program at issue in this case.on remand,the district court should conduct a probing analysis of the efficacy of alternatives,for instance,by inquiring into any attempts at the application or success of alternatives prior to the reauthorization of the program.the supreme court has also suggested that the legislative body make findings that antidiscrimination provisions have been enforced but unsuccessfully.see croson,at.the complete silence of the record concerning enforcement of the city own antidiscrimination ordinance flies in the face of the dissent vision of a industry which has prevented blacks from obtaining the experience necessary to participate in construction contracting.
evidence detailing the relationship between the stated numerical goal of five percent and the relevant market 
the district court relied exclusively on the benchmark study in assessing whether the five percent goal was proportionate to the number of qualified,willing,and able sdbs in the relevant industry group.rothe i,d at.because the benchmark study was conducted after the reauthorization,it is not relevant to determining,whether,at the time of the program reauthorization,a relationship was shown between the stated numerical goal of five percent minority participation and the relevant industry.thus,on remand,the district court must determine whether there is any evidence linking the numerical goal with the appropriate pool.the district court,of course,may rely on evidence,such as the benchmark study provided the court determines the statistical comparison is appropriate to determine whether in,the five percent goal was still proportionate to the pool of qualified,willing,and able bidders,or whether to grant injunctive relief to the extent rothe still requests it.
the district court here deferred to congress conclusion that the program was not overinclusive.id.at obviously,congress must have a basis for acting to remedy discrimination,and obviously,its acts must be aimed at that discrimination.id.finding sufficient the finding that since all of the minorities included in the program live in the united states and have been discriminated against,the program is not overinclusive.on remand,the district court must strictly scrutinize whether the program was overinclusive,by determining whether each of the five minority groups presumptively included in the program suffered from the lingering effects of discrimination so as to justify inclusion in a racial preference program extending to the defense industry.
moreover,since the program incorporates its presumption of social and economic disadvantage from d,any constitutional defects in enactment of d are relevant to the court analysis.the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit held in adarand vii that to be narrowly tailored,there must be an individualized showing of economic disadvantage for each minority in the d program.adarand vii,at w e must conclude,under croson,that the d method of certification is not narrowly tailored insofar as it obviates an individualized inquiry into economic disadvantage.the court said that to require a separate showing of economic and social disadvantage such as a short narrative statement of economic disadvantage faced would help address the court concern in croson that a government entity undertake the necessary administrative effort to tailor remedial relief to those who truly have suffered from the effects of prior discrimination.id.citing croson,at.
conclusion 
because the district court failed to analyze the constitutionality of the program under the strict scrutiny analysis required by the supreme court in croson and adarand,and relied on evidence to determine the constitutionality of the program as reauthorized,we vacate the district court judgment and remand for the requisite findings to be made.
