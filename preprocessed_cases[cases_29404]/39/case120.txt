in the bidding process through which t s unsuccessfully bid to become usps exclusive provider of mailing supplies,usps chose the ensemble company hereinafter hallmark,a former subsidiary of hallmark cards,which hallmark has now fully absorbed,to be the exclusive provider.as noted above,wg then represented t s in an unsuccessful bid protest action following usps decision to award the contract to hallmark.see t s,united states,fed.cl.
on july,wg submitted a foia request seeking a copy of usps contract with hallmark and other documents related to the sales and revenue generated under the contract usps provided documents responsive to the first three requests on august,and forwarded the other two requests to another internal department.on august,usps denied access to items four and five,citing b,b.on november,usps denied wg administrative appeal.
thereafter,wg filed a complaint in federal court,seeking review of usps partial denial of the foia request.the withheld information at issue is redacted from thirteen pages of spreadsheets relating to usps ready post initiative rpi,a program through which hallmark is the exclusive supplier of packaging products to usps for sale at its facilities the spreadsheets concern purchase information pursuant to the contract.specifically,they include income statements under the rpi and list item retail value of the products shipped.through the rpi,postal consumers can purchase packing materials and arrange for shipment at one location.thus,usps services are directly pitted against competitors such as mail boxes,ups,and other outlets.
usps and wg both filed motions for summary judgment.the district court denied the parties for summary judgment pending completion of discovery.thereafter,the parties renewed their motions for summary judgment,and both parties submitted affidavit testimony and other evidence relevant to the data in question.
after in camera review of the withheld documents,the district court granted summary judgment for usps.the district court held usps properly withheld the data pursuant to foia exemptions and,b,b first,the court found exemption applicable because the postal reorganization act,c,contains an exception to the foia disclosure requirement whereby the postal service is not required to disclose information of a commercial nature,including trade secrets,whether or not obtained from a person outside the postal service,which under good business practice would not be publicly disclosed.dist.op.at quoting c.this provision comports with congress overall purposes in passing the postal reorganization act,which include assuring that usps be run more like a business than had its predecessor,the post office department.franchise tax bd.of cal.united states postal,d see also ass of greeting card publishers united states postal,d noting that under the act congress sought to ensure that the postal service would be managed in a businesslike way internal quotation marks and citation omitted based on usps showing that other companies do not disclose such data,the district court held that exemption was applicable.dist.op.at.
the district court also held that exemption,b,which protects privileged or confidential trade secrets or other commercial or financial information,was applicable the district court reasoned that the contested data was privileged or confidential because disclosure would hamper usps ability to obtain similar information from other private companies,and would likely also harm hallmark competitive position.dist.op.at.
we review the district court decision granting summary judgment de novo.marshall cuomo,cir.foia cases are generally resolved on summary judgment once the documents at issue have been properly identified.see,miscavige irs,cir.foia places the burden on the government agency to sustain its action to withhold information under any of the foia exemptions.a b.in reviewing a district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the government in a foia action,we must determine de novo whether,after taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,there remains no genuine issue of material fact and the government is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.ethyl epa,cir.we review factual conclusions that place a document within a foia exemption under a clearly erroneous standard.id.whether a document fits within one of foia prescribed exemptions is a matter of law,upon which the district court is entitled to no deference.id.finally,we narrowly construe the foia exemptions in favor of disclosure.see stevens perry,cir.
appellant wg first argues that the contested spreadsheet data is not governed by foia exemption.wg contends that the district court erred in failing to include an additional implied requirement of competitive harm in applying exemption,and generally overstated the scope of the exemption.
congress enacted foia,to permit a policy of broad disclosure of government documents in order to ensure an informed citizenry,vital to the functioning of a democratic society.fbi abramson,d citations omitted see also bowers united states dep t of justice,cir foia was enacted as a general disclosure statute pertaining to all federal records.in enacting the statute,congress also recognized that legitimate governmental and private interests could be harmed by release of certain types of information.id.accordingly,congress crafted nine exemptions to foia.b.
exemption provides that foia does not apply to matters that are specifically exempted from disclosure by statute provided that such statute a requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue,or b establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld b emphasis added.usps contends,and the district court held,that the postal reorganization act,c,satisfies the second requirement of exemption.section c of the postal reorganization act provides that under various statutes,including foia,usps may withhold information of a commercial nature,including trade secrets,whether or not obtained from a person outside the postal service,which under good business practice would not be disclosed.c emphasis added 
in reviewing the district court holding that the good business practice exception applied to the spreadsheets,we first recognize that facially there would appear to be some tension between the postal reorganization act and foia generally.on one hand,congress established usps intend ing that it should operate more like a private business than a governmental agency.national western.at see also loeffler frank,d noting that congress designed the postal service to run more like a business than had its predecessor.on the other hand,through foia,the postal service is still subject to public responsibility national western.at.however,this apparent tension between the statutes dissipates upon review of the good business practice exception.congress spoke loudly through the postal reorganization act,providing usps with a broad release from many foia disclosure requirements with which other agencies must comply.stating that shall apply to the postal service but shall not require disclosure of information of a commercial nature which under good business practice would not be publicly disclosed.
in national western,the court stated that the contours of the good business practice exemption were to be gleaned by looking to the commercial world,management techniques,and business law,as well as to the standards of practice adhered to by large corporations.at.appellant argues that the district court erred in finding exemption satisfied,because the court holding was largely based on a finding that other corporations did not disclose such information to shareholders.at the district court,usps established a foundation for the good business practice exception by entering evidence into the record detailing that large corporations do not publicly disclose information similar to the rpi data at issue,a showing which wg failed to rebut.wg claims,however,that the district court should have analyzed whether the data would cause usps competitive harm.it contends that without reading an implied competitive harm requirement into c,the agency would have unfettered discretion to determine what it may withhold,which would essentially render the foia inapplicable whenever the agency wished to withhold embarrassing information from the public.appellant br.at.
in support of its assertion that the district court did not properly apply an implied competitive harm requirement,wg claims that the case law on the good business practice exception is clear that usps can not simply withhold everything a private company might.appellant br.at.wg asserts that national western and piper marbury directly support its argument that the rpi information does not fall under the good business practice exemption.we find these arguments unconvincing.
in national western,a foia requester sought the names and duty stations of usps employees in two cities.usps refused to disclose the list,and the court granted summary judgment for the requester,holding that the names and addresses did not constitute commercial information under c.national western.at.therefore,the court did not reach the issue of whether the good business practice exemption was applicable,but found that brief comments are perhaps necessary because the government has implicitly argued that the public interest will be disserved by the disclosure of this information.id.despite the absence of a holding supporting appellant position,wg relies on national western dicta in which wg finds the proposition that the good business practice standard does not allow the usps to withhold everything a commercial entity might 
citing piper marbury,appellant argues that other courts have rejected similar usps exemption claims.in piper marbury,however,the information at issue was a contract between usps and dhl that the piper marbury firm requested on behalf of its client,ups.usps argued the contract was commercial information that would not be disclosed under the good business practice exemption.the magistrate judge rejected usps claim.the court held that because usps was trying to withhold the entire agreement and not merely particular information in it,the contract in its entirety did not qualify as information under foia or c.wl,at.the court reasoned,the exemptions at issue were meant to protect knowledge,figures or data,and not entire agreements,as is supported by even a superficial reading of the exemptions themselves.id.at.thus,as the district court recognized,see op.at,piper marbury is readily distinguishable because in that case the information at issue was an entire contract,and here usps has already provided the contract under foia.at issue in this case is the data generated pursuant to the the knowledge,figures or data themselves to which the court in piper marbury referred.
not only is wg reliance on national western and piper marbury unpersuasive,but appellant has also failed to make any showing that usps competitors,or any other businesses,do disclose the type of information at issue in this case.whereas the government agency has presented evidence showing that large companies do not disclose such information,wg has completely abandoned its duty to refute that under good business practice such information would not be publicly disclosed.c.the statutory language unambiguously provides that precisely the type of information,which wg neglected to enter into the record,is a relevant consideration.in determining whether exemption applies,it is uncontroverted that the statutory term good business practice should be decided with reference to what businesses normally do.see national western.at noting that to determine what constitutes such practice,the agency can refer to business law and management techniques in the commercial domain.wg failure to build any record whatsoever concerning the business practices of usps competitors is fatal.in fact,at oral argument wg conceded that other businesses do not disclose such information.on this record,we must affirm the district court determination that the good business practice exception of c justified usps invocation of foia exemption.
in its brief and at oral argument,wg continued to rely solely on its assertion that a finding of competitive harm is necessary for usps to invoke exemption.we find this argument unsupported by the statutory text or its application.in making this argument,wg is first unable to locate an implied competitive harm requirement in the statute text or its subsequent application.see,appellant br.at arguing without citation that the postal service must also show that a disclosure would cause it competitive harm thus,in urging this interpretation of the postal reorganization act good business practice exception,wg entirely ignores justice frankfurter three principles of statutory construction read the statute,read the statute read the statute henry friendly,justice frankfurter and the reading of statutes,in,benchmarks,quoting justice frankfurter.
the notion that the postal reorganization act should be read to contain an implied competitive harm requirement is further dispelled by the statute language and the purposes behind the enactment,whereby congress sought to make usps a more businesslike entity.see,sess.senate report p ostal management must now be given the unfettered authority and freedom it has been denied for years to maintain and operate an efficient service,sess,reprinted in,house report stating the act would e liminate serious handicaps that are now imposed on the postal service by certain legislative,budgetary,financial,and personnel policies that are outmoded,unnecessary,and inconsistent with the modern management and business practices that must be available milner bolger,in order to facilitate the sound,businesslike operations mandated by congress,the postal service was given a considerable degree of independence.wg simply fails to show where under the act text,or its implementation by usps,its favored implied competitive harm requirement lies.
moreover,to read an implied competitive harm requirement into the good business practice exception necessarily implies that congress acted superfluously.for wg reading of the postal reorganization act is logically unsound in that it asks us to assume that although the postal service,like other agencies,is already empowered to withhold data pursuant to foia exemption upon a showing of a substantial likelihood of competitive harm,marsh,supra,congress nonetheless passed another withholding provision for usps with precisely the same competitive harm requirement.we decline to make this strained interpretation of c.
rather than analyzing competitive harm as an implied additional requirement for withholding under c,we can conceptualize competitive harm as one of many considerations embedded within the good business practice exception itself.that is,congress passed the exception,recognizing that the type of information which businesses do not ordinarily disclose is kept private,in part,to help maintain a competitive advantage.other private companies do not disclose such information precisely because they are competing.thus,any notion of a competitive harm component to the goo
