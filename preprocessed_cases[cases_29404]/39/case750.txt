through competitive bidding,plaintiff was awarded a municipal contract to maintain a city bus stops.four years later,the city terminated the contract as permitted.without inviting competitive bids,the city entered into a new contract with one of plaintiff competitors.plaintiff filed this action,seeking a writ of mandate and declaratory relief to invalidate the new contract and to compel the city to award the contract through competitive bidding.
in response,the city filed a special motion to strike,contending that the action was a strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp code civ,subd.b all further statutory references are to that code unless otherwise indicated.the trial court granted the motion,reasoning that the maintenance of the city bus stops was an issue of public interest and plaintiff was not likely to prevail on the merits of its claims.under the statute,the city was entitled to an award of attorney fees,which the trial court fixed at over.see,subd.c.
we conclude that,even if plaintiff claims involve a public issue,they are not based on any statement,writing,or conduct by the city in furtherance of its right of free speech or its right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.rather,plaintiff claims are based on state and municipal laws requiring the city to award certain contracts through competitive bidding.thus,the claims are not subject to the statute.it follows that plaintiff does not have to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits at the pleading stage,risking the dismissal of its claims and the payment of the city attorney fees.were we to conclude otherwise,the statute would discourage attempts to compel public entities to comply with the law.accordingly,we reverse.
background 
the allegations and evidence in this case are taken from the pleadings and the papers submitted in the trial court with respect to the motion.
the complaint alleged as follows.steven lenhoff founded graffiti protective coatings,gpc,and developed a confidential and proprietary method for providing high quality cleaning of bus stops at low cost.the city of pico rivera city learned about gpc reputation through the company work in other cities.
in july,gpc submitted a bid to perform the maintenance work on the city bus stops.the contract concerned the performance of a public works project that exceeded per year.under public contract code sections and,the contract had to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.the city used its own informal bidding process,which,whenever possible,had to be based on at least three bids.see pico rivera.gpc was awarded the contract on july.
the term of the contract was one year,to be automatically extended for four additional years,one year at a time,unless either party notified the other of its intent not to extend the contract at least days before the renewal term.
in april,one month before the contract came due for its last extension,carlos velasquez,a gpc employee,was approached by one of gpc competitors,national environmental services nes,a division of joe sweeping.nes told velasquez it would be receiving the city bus stop maintenance contract and wanted to hire him when it began work on the bus stops.telephone numbers were exchanged.nes kept velasquez informed of its efforts to get the gpc contract terminated.
in may,gpc received a notice of nonrenewal from the city.gpc contacted the city director of public works and was told that gpc was the best contractor for bus stop maintenance,gpc should disregard the nonrenewal notice,and the city would not be inviting any new bids.
over the following weeks,gpc called the director of public works several times to check on the status of the contract extension.the director said he was waiting to hear from the city manager.
on july,gpc called the director and was informed that the city planned to perform the bus stop maintenance in house.on july,the director notified gpc that its contract would not be renewed for the remaining year.shortly thereafter,gpc learned that the bus stop contract had been given to nes and that no bidding process had been used.
on july,velasquez told gpc that nes had offered him a job performing the same services he was performing for gpc.velasquez had access to gpc trade secret method for maintaining bus stops and,like other gpc employees,had signed a confidentiality agreement in that regard.nes wanted the specifics of gpc maintenance program and sought to obtain them by hiring velasquez at an inflated salary.velasquez commenced employment with nes on july.the next day,nes began work on the city bus stops.
on april,gpc and its founder,lenhoff collectively gpc,brought this action against nes,velasquez,and the city.gpc alleged five claims against nes and velasquez trade libel,slander,misappropriation of trade secrets,unfair competition,and unjust enrichment.nes was named as the only defendant on a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.against the city,gpc alleged a claim entitled petition for writ of mandate.that claim,based on the public contract code and the city municipal code,sought to compel the city to award the bus stop maintenance contract through competitive bidding.gpc alleged a separate claim against nes and the city for declaratory relief,requesting that the contract between nes and the city be declared void.finally,gpc alleged that the city had breached the bus stop maintenance contract by terminating it.
on june,the city filed a special motion to strike,subd.b,contending that the claims against it were based on its communications with gpc,velasquez,nes,and the public regarding the maintenance of the city bus stops and gpc was not likely to prevail on the merits of its claims.as evidence,the city offered a copy of the bus stop maintenance contract with gpc.
gpc filed an opposition,arguing that the claims were not based on the city right of petition or free speech and that gpc was likely to prevail on its claims.lenhoff submitted a declaration tracking the allegations of the complaint.attached to the declaration was a document dated may,entitled,contract documents and specifications for project,bus stop maintenance program in the city of pico rivera.the document,which consisted of pages,began with a notice that the city was accepting sealed bids for the bus stop maintenance project and stated that the council will award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder.gpc also offered the city may,notice of nonrenewal of its contract with gpc.the notice informed gpc that the city would no longer be bound by the parties contract as of july,and stated that the city intended to issue a new request for proposal for bus stop maintenance services.a request for proposal is a means of inviting bids for a contract.see blue cross of california state of health care services th.
gpc filed a first amended complaint,deleting its claims for breach of contract alleged against the city and unjust enrichment alleged against nes and velasquez.
trial court ruling 
the motion was initially heard on august.after a preliminary discussion,the trial court continued the hearing.on august,the trial court heard additional argument and granted the motion,adopting the tentative ruling as its order.
the trial court concluded that gpc claims against the city were based on conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.the conduct here is the city termination of a maintenance contract and the hiring of defendant nes regarding such contract.the action of the city involves a public interest which may include governmental activities and private activities such that it impacts a broad segment of society it is clear that the maintenance of bus stops and shelters is a public interest.defendant city asserts that without maintenance the bus stops will be affected adversely with trash,smells.this affects safety and may constitute a nuisance.the trial court also concluded that gpc was not likely to prevail on the merits of its claims.
on october,the trial court entered an order and a judgment granting the city motion.notice of entry of the order and the judgment,respectively,were served on november.gpc filed a motion for a new trial,which was denied as untimely.a notice of appeal followed on january.
for its part,the city filed a motion to recover attorney fees pursuant to the statute,which states in part a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees and costs.if the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay,the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion,subd.c,italics added.by order and judgment filed on january,the trial court awarded the city in attorney fees.
discussion 
our review of an order granting or denying an motion is de novo.see flatley mauro cal th.
in deciding whether an action is a slapp,the trial court should distinguish between speech or petitioning activity that is mere evidence related to liability and liability that is based on speech or petitioning activity.prelitigation communications or prior litigation may provide evidentiary support for the complaint without being a basis of liability.an motion should be granted if liability is based on speech or petitioning activity itself.
here,the prelitigation communications between the city and others are helpful in establishing the events leading up to the termination of gpc contract.the communications assist in telling the story.but gpc claims against the city are not based on those communications.rather,liability is premised on state and municipal laws requiring the city to award certain contracts through competitive bidding.a petition for a writ of mandate and a request for declaratory relief,as set forth in the complaint,are appropriate means to determine whether the city complied with those laws.to conclude that gpc claims are subject to the statute would require gpc to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits at the pleading stage,a result that would discourage attempts to compel public entities to act lawfully.
protected activity 
litigation which has come to be known as slapp is defined by the sociologists who coined the term as civil lawsuits that are aimed at preventing citizens from exercising their political rights or punishing those who have done so.
slapp suits are brought to obtain an economic advantage over the defendant,not to vindicate a legally cognizable right of the plaintiff o ne of the common characteristics of a slapp suit is its lack of merit but lack of merit is not of concern to the plaintiff because the plaintiff does not expect to succeed in the lawsuit,only to tie up the defendant resources for a sufficient length of time to accomplish plaintiff underlying objective as long as the defendant is forced to devote its time,energy and financial resources to combating the lawsuit its ability to combat the plaintiff in the political arena is substantially diminished.wilbanks wolk th.

the statute provides that a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or the california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b,italics added.the statute is to be broadly construed to encourage continued participation in free speech and petition activities.wanland law offices of mastagni,holstedt chiurazzi th,accord,subd.a.
t he statutory phrase cause of action arising from means simply that the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech in the context,the critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e city of cotati cashman cal th,first italics added,citations omitted accord,jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,arising from encompasses any act based on speech or petitioning activity episcopal church cases cal th,same city of santa monica stewart th,same.
as used in section,subdivision e,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e,italics added see briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th.

b.the city petition and free speech rights 
in attempting to satisfy the first step of the analysis,the city argues that gpc claims are based on either a written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law or conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e,italics added.we disagree.
assuming that the city decision to terminate the maintenance contract with gpc and to enter into a new contract with nes was considered or reviewed in an official proceeding,gpc claims are not based on a statement or writing made by the city in connection with its selection of a new contractor.see,subd.e,italics added.nor are the claims based on any conduct in furtherance of the city right of petition or free speech.see,subd.e.rather,gpc claims are based on state and municipal laws requiring competitive bidding.gpc does not contend that any statement or writing by the city is actionable.and the city conduct entering into a contract with nec absent bidding was not undertaken in furtherance of the city right of petition or free speech.
in analogous circumstances,courts have concluded that the defendant failed to show that the claims were based on speech or petitioning activity.in city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th,the owners of mobilehome parks filed an action against the city of cotati in federal court,contending that a municipal rent control ordinance constituted a regulatory taking.the city then filed suit against the owners in state court,seeking declaratory relief that the same ordinance was valid.the owners responded to the state suit with an motion,arguing that the city suit was based on protected activity,namely,the filing of the owners federal action.the trial court granted the motion,and the court of appeal reversed.the supreme court held that the city suit was not a slapp because the controversy giving rise to both lawsuits was the disputed validity of the city ordinance.the city suit was based on that issue,not on the owners federal action.see id.at accord,city of riverside stansbury th,city declaratory relief action was based on validity of local ballot initiative,not on petitioning activities of initiative proponents such as gathering signatures and submitting initiative for ballot.
in san ramon valley fire protection dist.contra costa county employees retirement th san ramon,a public employer filed a writ petition against a county retirement board see,alleging that the board had imposed an excessive contribution rate on the employer in violation of the county employees retirement law of.the board filed a special motion to strike,subd.b,contending that the petition was based on its conduct in deciding how much the employer had to pay.the trial court denied the motion.
the court of appeal affirmed,stating t here is nothing about the board decision,qua governmental action,that implicates the exercise of free speech or petition.the board resolution was simply to impose a requirement that the employer pay a contribution to the retirement association of nearly million for proposed enhanced retirement benefits to employees w hile the employer petition arises out of the board adoption of the million contribution rate,the substance of the board action does not constitute the exercise of the board right of speech or petition.san ramon,supra,th at.t he board was not sued based on the content of speech it has promulgated or supported,nor on its exercise of a right to petition.the action challenged consists of charging the employer more for certain pension contributions than the employer believes is appropriate.this is not governmental action which is.id.at.even if the conduct of individual public officials in discussing and voting on a public entity action or decision could constitute an exercise of rights protected under the statute,this does not mean litigation challenging a public entity action or decision always arises from protected activity.id.at pp.
the san ramon court also emphasized the practical consequences of concluding that the statute applied,noting that if a special motion to strike could be brought in every case where a petition for mandate seeks to challenge a government decision,then suits to compel public entities to comply with the law would be chilled.see san ramon,supra,th at pp.fn.
san ramon was distinguished in vergos mcneal th.in vergos,a state university employee pursued an internal grievance against his supervisor for sexual harassment.in an administrative proceeding authorized by the regents of the university of california,the hearing officer denied the grievance.the employee then filed a civil rights suit against the hearing officer,alleging that her decision had failed to protect him from future harassment.id.at pp.the hearing officer filed a special motion to strike,contending that her communications were made in connection with an issue under consideration in an official proceeding.see,subd.e.the trial court denied the motion.the court of appeal reversed because t he gravamen of plaintiff claim is the hearing officer communicative conduct in denying plaintiff grievances.the hearing,processing,and deciding of the grievances as alleged in the complaint are meaningless without a communication of the adverse results.id.at.thus,vergos recognized that the statute applies where liability is based on protected speech.see id.at pp.discussing san ramon.
several courts have addressed the distinction between speech or petitioning activity that serves solely as evidence in proving liability which is not subject to the statute and speech or petitioning activity that is the basis of liability to which the statute applies.
in jespersen th jespersen,the plaintiffs sued their former attorneys for malpractice,alleging that the attorneys had negligently defended them in an earlier civil action,resulting in an order striking their answer and entering their default.in response to the malpractice suit,the attorneys filed an motion,which was denied.the court of appeal affirmed,explaining plaintiffs malpractice action is not based upon the attorneys having filed an answer or in the action in which the attorneys represented plaintiffs.it is not based upon the attorneys having filed declarations,motions,or other papers in that action,or upon their appearance on discovery or other motions.id.at.the attorneys conduct allegedly consisted of a failure to serve timely discovery responses a failure to comply with a court order to serve responses without objections and a failure to comply with a second court order i t appears that the alleged attorney malpractice did not consist of any act in furtherance of anyone right of petition or free speech,but of the attorneys negligent failure to do so on behalf of their clients.id.at.
jespersen commented on the use of activity as evidence of liability the attorneys contend that the evidence of their conduct,a declaration filed in the underlying action,is the protected free speech or petition from which plaintiffs cause of action arises.although this logic escapes us,it is apparently based upon the fact that such evidence was a written statement filed in a judicial proceeding.see,subd.e.the declaration was filed in support of a motion submitted by the attorneys on behalf of plaintiffs pursuant to section to set aside the default.in it,one of the attorneys essentially admitted that she continued to apply her own interpretation to the discovery request,although it was at odds with opposing counsel and the court,and
