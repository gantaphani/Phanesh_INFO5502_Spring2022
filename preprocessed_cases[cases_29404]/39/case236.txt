carl schroeder schroeder appeals his dismissal from a qui tam suit concerning the billing practices of government contractor hill.the appeal turns on an issue of first impression does d of the false claims act fca require the dismissal of a qui tam relator convicted of the conduct giving rise to the fraud,even if he or she only played a minor role we hold that the statute does require such a relator to be dismissed and affirm the district court.
factual and procedural background 
schroeder worked for hill,a contractor for the department of energy doe as a radiological control technician from january to february and then again from may to october.during this time,hill engaged in widespread fraudulent billing of hourly work.
schroeder,like many of his colleagues,submitted false time cards,and,as a result,received at least for falsely claimed overtime hours.in april,the doe office of inspector general oig learned of the time card fraud from an anonymous source and began investigating.oig investigators interviewed schroeder colleagues in november.several of them were escorted,and supervisors informed employees that the employees were under investigation.schroeder admitted to during his december interview with oig.
schroeder contends that he voluntarily approached oig and did not know he was being investigated at the time.these allegations are not supported by the record,particularly the declaration of the investigation case agent,and were rejected by the district court,which found that t he record indicates schroeder did not approach investigators on his own initiative.
as a result of the investigation,the government filed an information against schroeder in september,and he pled guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to commit fraud.the terms of the plea included a pledge to provide substantial assistance to the government,two years of supervised release,and a fine of.
in june,after the initial interviews but prior to the filing of charges,schroeder filed a complaint against hill.schroeder qui tam suit proceeded contemporaneously with the government investigation the united states intervened in august,and shortly thereafter moved to dismiss schroeder as a relator based on his felony conviction.
the district court concluded that the statute is unambiguous and requires dismissal from the action of a person who has been convicted of criminal conduct arising from his role in the fraud that is the basis of his qui tam action.schroeder timely appealed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
because the district court dismissal was a final decision disposing of all claims,we have jurisdiction under a.the sole issue involves the district court interpretation of federal law,which is reviewed de novo.ileto.glock,cir.
section d of title of the united states code provides,in full 
whether or not the government proceeds with the action,if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section upon which the action was brought,then the court may,to the extent the court considers appropriate,reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under paragraph or of this subsection,taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation.if the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of section,that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action.such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the united states to continue the action,represented by the department of justice.
d emphasis added.
the only dispute is whether the second sentence in this subsection requires the dismissal of all relators convicted of criminal conduct arising from the fraudulent conduct at issue in the qui tam suit,particularly minor participants who neither planned nor initiated the fraudulent scheme.the parties do not dispute the ordinary meaning of these words,and several courts have concluded that the provision is mandatory.see roberts accenture,llp,cir ex rel.taxpayers against fraud,cir ex rel.green serv.contract educ.training trust fund,d.
it is well established that the starting point in discerning congressional intent is the existing statutory text and that when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.lamie,citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also mcdonald checks n advance,in re ferrell,cir if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,o ur inquiry must cease.quoting robinson shell oil.
despite this plain language,our inquiry does not cease here,because schroeder argues that requiring the dismissal of convicted relators who played a minor role in a fraud would make the statutory scheme logically inconsistent and produce an absurd result.we disagree with both components of the argument.applying the statute to minor participants in a fraud does not produce an absurd or unreasonable result.the provision states that i f the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of section,that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action.d.it does not contain an exception for minor participants,and the statute does not indicate that it does not apply to relators like schroeder.
schroeder contends that when this provision is read in conjunction with the preceding clause,the statute produces the absurd and logically inconsistent result of allowing the most culpable fraud participants planners and initiators to collect a reduced share of an award but bars less culpable fraud participants minor participants convicted of the offense from recovery altogether.while the two clauses might not perfectly harmonize relator eligibility and awards with culpability,no authority suggests that the provision should be construed according to that criteria.as such,the argument urges us to untenably assume the role of a superlegislature the policy choices of the other branches of government.christian sci.reading room jointly maintained city cnty.of,cir norris,dissenting.
furthermore,the relator award hierarchy chosen by congress may satisfy other values,such as the deterrent effect of preventing criminally culpable individuals from gaining from their conduct,and the investigatory benefits of actions brought by planners and initiators who often have greater knowledge about and the scope of a fraudulent scheme.lastly,the dichotomy drawn by schroeder is a false one,as the statute also requires courts to dismiss planners and initiators convicted of fraud.
schroeder next argument,that applying d to minor fraud participants undermines the fca purpose of encouraging qui tam plaintiffs to help uncover fraud,is unpersuasive for at least two reasons.first,we may not even need to consider the statute purpose because t here is no need to look beyond the plain meaning in order to derive the purpose of the statute a t least there is no need to do so when the result is not absurd.tang reno,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.second,regardless,analyzing the statute purpose only verifies that we should not deviate from the plain meaning.
the text of the statute leaves little doubt that the sole purpose of the amendment that codified d was to restrict eligibility and reduce rewards for certain relators.the only two elements of the amendment reduce awards for relators who planned and initiated the fraud and require dismissal of relators convicted of criminal conduct arising from the violation.schroeder dismissal fulfills one of the two elements and is consistent with the statute purpose.
while the purpose of the act,as amended in,was to strengthen the federal government ability to recover losses sustained as a result of fraud in large part by encouraging qui tam suits,at,a broad congressional purpose is of lim
