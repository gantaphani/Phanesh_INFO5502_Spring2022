background 
factual history 
this case involves a contract between the department of defense and central park for the supply of mixed nuts.on january,the defense logistics agency dla issued a solicitation for cases of canned shelled mixed nuts.the request for proposals rfp contains the following description of the item to be procured 
nuts.mixed,shelled 
w or peanuts,roasted,salted.
lb.size can.cid 
type i or ii,style 
the rfp does not explain the meaning of cid,which stands for a certain commercial item description published by the commerce department.this particular code specifies a mixed nut composition containing not more than peanuts by weight.
central park president,james giesler,gave the rfp to his broker,farner bocken company.farner bocken,in turn,identified a nut supplier,flavor house products.on february,central park submitted a bid in response to the solicitation,offering to supply nuts,mixed,shelled,with reference to cid,at per case to be delivered,and per case to be picked up at the origin.central park bid price,times cases of nuts,yields a total contract price of approximately.central park bid was the lowest received by the government,with the next lowest bid at per case.on february,because central park price for items to be delivered was only slightly higher than for items to be received at origin,john dibabbo,a government contract specialist,contacted giesler and requested him to verify central park quoted prices.the same day,giesler faxed dibabbo a notice stating that the quoted prices were correct.
on march,russell kinney,a survey manager for the government,telephoned a central park employee,doug anderson,in reference to an upcoming inspection of central park and flavor house.during the phone call,anderson stated that he did not believe central park had a copy of the mixed nut specification.on march,giesler phoned james knopf,the regional sales manager for flavor house,to verify its price quote and its ability to perform the contract requirements.the same day,knopf wrote giesler a confirmatory letter,stating w e understand all government specifications and welcome any government visit for inspection.
on march,robert hansen,a government inspector,went to flavor house to conduct a survey.flavor house vice president of sales and marketing,bill mallis,led hansen through the inspection tour.according to mallis later testimony,hansen asked for real specific information regarding the actual product specifications for the mixed nuts.hansen apparently requested a written specification of flavor house nuts from mallis,but mallis did not have one prepared to give to hansen.the next day,hansen filled out an inspection form,checking yes in the box asking whether firm has understands specifications.on march,hansen received a facsimile transmission from mallis,with the third page containing a written specification of the composition of flavor house mixed nuts.the header of the page reads product oil roasted regular mixed nuts peanuts.further down the page,the ingredients are listed,including by weight blanched peanuts,and by weight unblanched peanuts.
neither hansen,nor his superiors to whom he forwarded the faxed transmission,perceived the discrepancy between the maximum allowable peanut content specified by the government rfp and the peanut content listed in the flavor house fax.on april,dla awarded the contract to central park.on june,dla personnel traveled to flavor house to inspect the production of mixed nuts,and it became immediately apparent that the nut mix was nonconforming.
giesler attempted,unsuccessfully,to renegotiate its contract with the government.after the date for delivery of the nuts had passed without performance,the contracting officer issued a show cause notice,and on september,dla terminated central park contract for default.soon thereafter,the government arranged a contract with a previous bidder,john sanfillippo sons.due to an increase in the market price of raw nuts since the start of the original bidding process,the government incurred added costs in the amount of to procure the nuts from sanfillippo.this amount appears to be undisputed.it also appears that the government did not make any progress payments to central park.
proceedings in the court of federal claims 
on september,central park filed suit in the united states court of federal claims.as stated in its second amended complaint,central park seeks,in the alternative damages in the amount of reformation of the contract or rescission of the contract.on june,the government counterclaimed for a judgment of in excess reprocurement costs.
in its september,opinion,on for summary judgment,the court of federal claims found that,although central park had erred in failing to read the specification,the government receipt of the march,facsimile from flavor house gave it constructive knowledge that central park intended to supply a nonconforming nut mix.the trial court determined that the government had a duty to notify central park of this error,and that because the government failed to do so,central park should be granted rescission of the contract.on october,the court denied central park motion for attorney fees and costs.
discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is warranted only where an examination of the record evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party,reveals that no material facts are genuinely disputed and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.cl.c.we review the trial court grant of summary judgment de novo.crnkovich united states.
we review the trial court decision not to award costs and fees pursuant to the standards of the equal access to justice act eaja,a,for an abuse of discretion.neal united states.
b.did central park excusably misread the specification 
parties to a contract are generally bound by its terms.however,we have recognized in limited circumstances that if the government has knowledge,or constructive knowledge,that a contractor bid is based on a mistake,and the government accepts the bid and awards the contract despite knowledge of this mistake,then a trial court may reform or rescind the contract.united states hamilton,see also ruggiero united states.such relief may be appropriate to prevent the government from overreaching when it knows the contractor has made a significant mistake during the bidding process.see ruggiero,at w hat we are really concerned with is the overreaching of a contractor by a contracting officer when the latter has the knowledge,actual or imputed as to something he ought to know,that the bid is based on or embodies a disastrous mistake and accepts the bid in face of that knowledge.generally,a contractor may obtain reformation or rescission of the contract only if the contractor establishes that its bid error resulted from a clear cut clerical or arithmetical error,or a misreading of the specifications.liebherr crane united states,hamilton,at.if the contractor error does not constitute one of these kinds of mistakes,then the contractor is not eligible for reformation of the contract.see liebherr,at hamilton,at.in limited circumstances,however,we have held that,if the government has breached its explicit regulatory duty to examine the contractor bid for mistakes,then the trial court may rescind a contract,despite an otherwise inexcusable error by the contractor.see hamilton,at see also.as will be described below,the facts of this case are distinct from those limited circumstances discussed in hamilton.
because the availability of equitable relief in this case turns on whether central park error resulted from a clear cut clerical or arithmetical error,or a misreading of the specifications,we first consider the nature of the mistake that is implicit in central park bid.there is no dispute that central park did not commit a clerical error or an arithmetical error when it submitted its bid.rather,we must inquire whether central park misread the specification when it submitted its bid.see liebherr,at.
the rfp issued by the department of defense specifies cid as the commercial item description of the requested nut mix.although the trial court suggests that the meaning of this cid reference may not have been commonly known among commercial businesses,it is clear that giesler himself was familiar with this coding system.in his deposition,when questioned whether he personally reviewed the mixed nut specification,he testified that as you know and i know,that you go to the library and pull up the solicitation thing.giesler testified,however,that he gave the solicitation to his broker,farner bocken,without looking up the reference himself.mallis,of flavor house,similarly testified that neither central park,nor farner bocken,ever gave him copies of the specification or other information regarding the required nut mix 
q.if i understand your testimony,it that central park never provided you with any specifications from the government regarding the type of nut that the government was seeking.
absolutely.they never provided me with anything.
is it also fair to say that farner bocken company never provided you with any specification regarding what the government was seeking 
the trial court noted that a s any lover of salted nuts knows,the more peanuts,the less expensive the product.mallis testimony confirms that the price of the nut mix specified by the government would have been substantially higher than the peanut mix.given the low cost of peanuts,it would apparently be in the interest of a nut supplier to include as many peanuts in a nut mix as a buyer would tolerate.central park and flavor house apparently assumed,without any attempt of verification,that a nut mixture containing peanuts would satisfy the department of defense.
the mistake in this case is analogous to the contractor error we discussed in liebherr.in liebherr,the contractor successfully bid to supply the navy with a crane,but failed to read particularized military requirements listed in a specification.see liebherr,at.after winning the contract and subsequently discovering that the crane it intended to supply was smaller than that sought by the navy,the contractor filed a claim for a price increase.we ruled that the contractor mistake resulted from gross negligence in failing to read and consider the specifications thoroughly,and that the contractor assumption that the crane it had intended to supply would meet the navy demands was an error in business judgment.we affirmed the denial of reformation.see id.at.
in this case,the trial court acknowledged that central park probably failed to read the specification,but nevertheless concluded,citing liebherr,that this mistake constitutes a misreading which may warrant equitable relief 
misreading of the specifications includes mistakes such as omissions of costs or mistaken belief about what is called for in specifications.the error central park,flavor house,or both came from a misreading of,or failure to read,the specification.this is a misreading which may entitle a contractor to relief.liebherr crane united states.
giesler,fed.cl.at.such reliance on liebherr is misplaced.indeed,liebherr holds to the contrary.in that case,we explicitly stated that the contractor failure to read the specification can not be said to have resulted from a misreading of the specifications,and that an erroneous bid based,like this one,upon a mistake in judgment does not entitle the contractor to reformation of its contract.liebherr,at.contrary to the suggestion of the trial court,as quoted above,we conclude that the undisputed facts show that central park failed to read the specification,and that central park conduct was not an excusable misreading of the specification,but rather amounted to gross negligence in failing to read the specification and a clear error in business judgment.except under the limited circumstances we described in hamilton,at,as discussed below,such negligence or judgmental errors preclude contractors from obtaining equitable relief.
central park points out that the government failed to attach a copy of the specification to the rfp,as appears to have been its customary practice.a march,letter from russell kinney of the dla to gordon ferguson of the defense personnel support center,explaining the dla tardiness in procuring the nuts,lends support to central park argument.the letter states that the specification should have been made an attachment to the solicitation package,and that kinney was aware,through his march,telephone conversation with doug anderson,that central park did not have a copy of the specification.
although the government apparently should have attached the specification to the rfp,we discern little legal significance in this omission.central park cites no regulation,and we identify none,requiring that the specification be attached to the solicitation.although the government is required to send contractors copies of the specifications upon request,see,it appears that central park never requested one.moreover,giesler testified that he knew the importance of the cid reference,and that he knew how to go to the library and look it up,but that he left this work to farner bocken.his own awareness of the importance of the cid reference is underscored by his call on march,to flavor house,whereby he requested verification of flavor house ability to perform the contract requirements.knopf confirmatory letter,stating that w e understand all government specifications,further extends the series of miscommunications between or among central park,farner bocken,and flavor house.had the government attached the specification to the rfp,it is possible that these miscommunications would not have arisen.nonetheless,central park decision to bid on a mixed nut contract without having looked up the maximum allowable peanut content can not be construed to be a misreading of the specification.indeed,we can not imagine any circumstance in which a can be a misreading.because,as will be described below,central park is not eligible to seek rescission under the narrow grounds we articulated in hamilton,the case relied upon by the trial court,giesler failure to read the specification is fatal to his claim for rescission.despite the trial court holding,liebherr can not be construed to the contrary.
may the contract nevertheless be rescinded in light of the government failure to examine mallis facsimile for discrepancies 
central park argues that it deserves rescission of the contract due to the government alleged failure to examine the march,facsimile for discrepancies between the requested nut mix and the nut mix flavor house intended to produce.central park correctly notes that during the bid submission process,the government has a duty to examine bids for mistakes.previously codified at after the opening of bids,contracting officers shall examine all bids for mistakes.when the contracting officer has reason to believe that a bid is erroneous,the officer is required to request from the bidder a verification of the bid,calling attention to the suspected mistake.id.in limited circumstances,where there is a clear showing that the government failed to discharge this regulatory duty,we have permitted rescission of a contract,despite the contractor having made otherwise inexcusable errors in the bid.see hamilton,at.
the case relied upon by the trial court,hamilton,concerns a contractor that bid on a contract to staff a navy mess hall.see id.although the government had estimated that the job required approximately manhours per day,hamilton allocated only manhours per day to the job in its bid.another bidder,groves,had allotted a similarly small number of manhours to the job,and the government contacted groves,expressly noting the discrepancy between the government and groves estimated manhours.after groves withdrew from the bidding process,the government informed hamilton that its bid was possibly erroneous,but did not specify the discrepancy regarding the estimated manhours,as the regulations required.see presently codified at requiring government to notify bidders of potential mistakes,calling attention to the suspected mistake.hamilton won the contract,and began providing about manhours,but soon reduced its allocation to manhours,as it had originally bid.the government terminated the contract for default,and sued hamilton for excess reprocurement costs.hamilton sought reformation of the contract.we held that hamilton error was an error in judgment,and thus that hamilton was precluded from seeking reformation of the contract.we concluded,however,that the navy had actual knowledge of the insufficiency of the manhours hamilton intended to provide,and that the navy had failed to provide hamilton with the same notice it had given to groves.we thus held that the navy had breached its express regulatory duty to inform hamilton of the known defect in its bid,and consequently that the navy was barred from seeking its excess reprocurement costs.finding that the parties were mutually at fault and that neither party was entitled to recover on its claims,we rescinded the contract.
hamilton,we hold,is a narrow exception to the rule that contractors are barred from obtaining equitable relief when mistakes in their bids arise from other than a clear cut clerical or arithmetical error,or a misreading of the specifications.liebherr,at.the critical features of hamilton are that the government clearly had knowledge of the error in hamilton bid that the bid submission process was still underway at the time of the government alleged breach that the government failed to give hamilton the same notice it had given to another bidder with a similarly deficient bid and that the government was materially and mutually at fault in failing to prevent the losses that occurred.under the weight of this evidence,we held that the government breached its express duty to notify hamilton with particularity of the known mistake in its bid,and we permitted rescission of the contract.see presently codified at.central park argues that this case is analogous to hamilton.for the reasons that follow,we find hamilton inapplicable to the facts of this case.
the government duty to examine bids for mistakes 
it is undisputed that the government has a general duty to examine bids for mistakes.under this duty,the government must examine bids for obvious clerical errors,see,and must examine bids for other errors,such as discrepancies between the contractor bid and the bids of other contractors or the government estimate,see.as set forth in the federal acquisition regulations far,however,the government duty to examine contractors submissions for mistakes only pertains to errors contained in contractors bids.under the far,this duty does not extend to errors that may be contained in a contractor subsequent filings.
our case law interpreting the government duty to examine bids for mistakes uniformly evaluates the duty only in instances where the alleged error was contained in a contractor original bid,not in other subsequently submitted papers.see mcclure constructors,dalton,determining whether contracting officer discharged her duty to inform contractor of disparities between government estimate and contractor estimate liebherr,at noting that the navy immediately noted the wide disparity between contractor bid and the range of the other responsive proposals bromley contracting united states,asking whether contracting officer had constructive knowledge of error in bid due to disparity between contractor bid and other responsive bid hamilton,at asking whether government buyer adequately informed contractor of discrepancy between government estimate of required manhours and manhours allocated to job in contractor bid aydin united states,determining whether contracting officer had constructive knowledge of clerical oversights in bid ruggiero united states,inquiring whether contracting officer had constructive knowledge of improper designation in bid chernick united states,determining whether contracting officer had constructive knowledge of arithmetical mistake in bid wender presses,united states,asking whether contracting officer had constructive knowledge of mistake in bid due to spread in submitted bids.we can discern no support through these cases that the government duty to examine bids for mistakes also requires the government to examine the correctness of all of a contractor subsequent filings.because the government is generally in privity only with prime contractors,and not with subcontractors,the notion that the government has a duty to identify mistakes in subcontractors filings after the opening and verification of the prime contractor bid has even less grounding in the law.
we note that,even had flavor house expressly pointed out the error in central park bid,it is unclear that the government would have had a duty to relieve the parties of the cost of this error.rather,it appears that the government would have had the discretionary authority to make a determination as to whether the mistake may be corrected.see a if a bidder requests permission to correct a mistake and clear and convincing evidence establishes both the existence of the mistake and the bid actually intended,the agency head may make a determination permitting the bidder to correct the mistake.central park,of course,can not seek relief through this provision,as neither it,nor flavor house,expressly disclosed to the government that central park bid was premised on an error.
in this case,to the extent that the government duty to examine central park bid for mistakes arose,the government discharged it.central park bid gives no indication that the nut mix it intended to supply would contain peanuts or any other nonconforming mix.rather,the bid makes reference to cid,and states that the bid is for the supply of the nuts,mixed,shelled of the rfp.central park bid price,moreover,was only about lower than the bid.as noted in the government counterclaim,the government did perceive that central park price for the goods it was to deliver was only slightly higher than for goods that were to be received at origin.because there is usually a substantial disparity between such prices,the government called central park to verify the correctness of its bid in light of this apparent anomaly.central park verified the correctness of its bid by fax the same day.nothing in the record suggests that the government should have been aware,based on central park bid,of its intention to supply a nut mix containing peanuts.
the government duty regarding the survey of flavor house,subsequent to the opening of central park bid 
the crux of the present dispute is whether the government,through its survey of the subcontractor,flavor house,became aware of central park intention to supply a nonconforming nut mix.the purpose of a survey is to gather information about a relatively unknown provider to make a determination regarding the responsibility of the provider in fulfilling its duties under a proposed contract.see.russell kinney,a survey manager,testified that for companies being inspected,the survey presentation is their presentation,their demonstra
