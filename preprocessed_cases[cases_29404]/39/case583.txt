congress passed the small business act of,to aid,counsel,assist,and protect the interests of concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise and to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the government be placed with enterprises.a.in section a of the act,a,congress delegated to the small business administration sba the authority to enter into contracts with any procurement agency of the federal government to furnish required goods or services,and,in turn,to enter into subcontracts with small businesses for the performance of such contracts.fullilove klutznick,d see also f explaining the purposes of section a.in accordance with this statutory mandate,the sba in developed a program to assist eligible small disadvantaged business concerns compete in the american economy through business development.see generally implementing section a programs.it is within the context of the sba section a program that the present case arises.

prior to,c s industrial supply c s was dscc section a program supplier of hose.in,however,c s graduated from the program.see id.a firm that completes its nine year term of participation in the a bd program is deemed to graduate from the program.upon the recommendation of henry cook,chief executive officer of c s,taylor arranged for the approval of capital city to participate in the section a program.capital city thereafter became dscc new supplier of hose.
in,anita luich,a dscc contracting officer,contacted capital city about the procurement of hose.capital city in turn approached flexfab about manufacturing the hose.flexfab refused to deal directly with capital city,however,and instead offered to supply hose to capital city through c s.cook claims to have informed taylor at this point that flexfab would not enter into the proposed arrangement unless the government agreed to pay flexfab directly through an escrow account.according to cook,taylor promised to contact capital city to ensure that any contract provided for the means for payment requested by flexfab.there is no evidence of record,however,that taylor himself had authority to execute contracts on behalf of dscc or that he communicated directly with an authorized contracting officer or any representative of an authorized contracting officer.

by incorporating the provisions of,the contract also allowed for payment at the option of the government through an electronic fund transfer eft.see a payments by the government under this contract,including invoice and contract financing payments,may be made by check or eft at the option of the government.capital city initially registered its own eft information in dscc central contractor registration ccr database.despite a modification to the remittance address in the contract,as discussed infra,capital city never updated the ccr database with new eft information.the incorporated regulation made it capital city responsibility to do so.see id.c in the event that the eft information changes,the contractor shall be responsible for providing the changed information to the designated payment office s.

on september,malinda jeffries,a dscc contracting officer,issued the following modification in an amendment of of contract form 
the remittance address where cited throughout the contract is hereby corrected to read as follows 
old kent bank,corp trust 
grand rapids,mi 
the record is void of evidence that jeffries knew that the modification to the contract was in any way associated with flexfab escrow account.the record reflects that neither cook,nor taylor,nor any flexfab personnel ever communicated with the contracting officers to explain and memorialize the alleged demand by flexfab that it would perform only if paid directly by the government into an escrow account for its benefit.in short,flexfab relied entirely on others,mainly capital city,to assure that flexfab,not capital city,would receive direct payment for the delivered hose.
flexfab thereafter delivered hose to dscc on several occasions.after each delivery,defense finance and accounting services dfas paid capital city electronically,using capital city eft information listed in the ccr database.dfas ultimately paid capital city the full amount due under the contract.capital city later became insolvent and never paid flexfab.on august,flexfab demanded payment of from dscc for the delivered hose.dscc denied the request.flexfab thus brought suit in the court of federal claims,claiming that it was owed the money as an intended beneficiary to the contract between capital city and dscc or,in the alternative,as a direct party to an contract between it and dscc.
turning its attention first to flexfab beneficiary theory,the court of federal claims stated that unless flexfab can make a sufficient showing that dscc intended to benefit flexfab,in other words,that some government agent possessing authority to bind the government agreed to make flexfab a payee under the contract,the government is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.flexfab.at internal quotation marks omitted.finding that flexfab made no such showing,the court held that flexfab beneficiary claim here falls short because flexfab has failed to present any evidence that a government employee with actual authority intended to benefit flexfab through the capital city contract.id.at.turning next to the contract theory,the court of federal claims stated that flexfab has failed to present evidence related to two essential elements of its implied contract claim mutual intent to contract and actual authority to contract on the part of the relevant government agents.id.at.
ruling on for summary judgment,the court of federal claims granted judgment in favor of the government.flexfab appeals.we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to a.
summary judgment is appropriate when examined in a light most favorable to the,the record indicates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.cl.c see also.c same.we review the court of federal claims decision granting summary judgment de novo,drawing all justifiable factual inferences in favor of flexfab.ammex,united states.the underlying question of whether flexfab was a beneficiary under the contract is a mixed question of law and fact.glass united states.the existence of an contract between flexfab and the government is a question of fact.teets chromalloy gas turbine.
though not expressly stated as such,the determination by the court of federal claims that flexfab was not an intended beneficiary raises a serious issue of standing on which the court properly focused prior to and independent of the particular merits of the case.see steel citizens for a better env t,d referring to the issue of standing as a threshold jurisdictional question warth seldin,d in essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.because flexfab was not a direct party to the contract between capital city and dscc,it has standing to enforce the contract only if it was an intended beneficiary.see castle united states,finding that plaintiffs were at most incidental beneficiaries and as such lacked standing to sue for breach of the alleged contract.we therefore focus first,as did the court of federal claims,on the issue of whether flexfab has standing,as an intended beneficiary of the contract between capital city and dscc,to enforce the agreement.we find that the governing legal principles compel judgment in the government favor.
in order to prove beneficiary status,a party must demonstrate that the contract not only reflects the express or implied intention to benefit the party,but that it reflects an intention to benefit the party directly.glass,at see also caguas cent.fed.sav.bank united states,the contract must reflect the express or implied intention of the parties to benefit the third party.quotation omitted williston on contracts ed.the intent of the parties to the contract is therefore the cornerstone of a claim for beneficiary status.
proof of the requisite intent is no small matter,for the supreme court has recognized the exceptional privilege that beneficiary status imparts.see german alliance ins.home water supply.before a stranger can avail himself of the exceptional privilege of suing for a breach of an agreement to which he is not a party,he must,at least,show that it was intended for his direct benefit.the privilege should not be granted liberally.
exceptional though it may be,beneficiary status is not reserved for those parties who benefit expressly under a given contract.we note,too,that t he intended beneficiary need not be specifically or individually identified in the contract,but must fall within a class clearly intended to be benefited thereby.montana united states.evidence of intent can be adduced.roedler dep t of energy.in short,it is sufficient to ask in the typical case whether the beneficiary would be reasonable in relying on the promise as manifesting an intention to confer a right on him.montana,at citing restatement second of contracts b cmt.
though a beneficiary of a contract to which the government is a direct party may assert a claim against the government in accordance with the rules applicable to claims,the law governing beneficiaries is subject to the principle that the government can only be bound by those with authorization to do so.see trauma serv.group united states,a contract with the united states also requires that the government representative who entered or ratified the agreement had actual authority to bind the united states.city of el centro united states,the government representative whose conduct is relied upon must have actual authority to bind the government in contract internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court has warned of the associated risks in dealing with a government agent 
a nyone entering into an arrangement with the government takes the risk of having accurately ascertained that he who purports to act for the government stays within the bounds of his authority.the scope of this authority may be explicitly defined by congress or be limited by delegated legislation,properly exercised through the power.and this is so even though,as here,the agent himself may have been unaware of the limitations upon his authority.
fed.crop ins.merrill.the supreme court admonition in federal crop insurance is firmly grounded in the public policy goal of protecting the public treasury from depletion by claims brought pursuant to unauthorized government contracts.the united states government employs millions of civilian employees.clearly,federal expenditures would be wholly uncontrollable if government employees could,of their own volition,enter into contracts obliging the united states.city of el centro,at.
a party seeking to enter into an agreement with the government can abate the risk by taking particular care to insure that it negotiates with a government agent whose status is that of a contracting officer.see contracting officer means a person with the authority to enter into,administer,terminate contracts and make related determinations and findings.a contracting officer is a government agent vested with the authority to enter into and sign contracts on behalf of the government.see contracts may be entered into and signed on behalf of the government only by contracting officers.john cibinic,ralph nash,formation of government contracts ed.contracting officers have the sole authority to legally bind the government to contracts and contract modifications.given that authority,the contracting officer also has the additional authority to modify contracts.see gene peters united states,stating that the delegation of authority to enter into contracts necessarily and inherently includes the authority to enter into modification of them as well.the contracting officer is thus the authorized face of the government at the contract formation table 
flexfab is not unfamiliar with the aforementioned law applicable to beneficiary status and government contracts.indeed,it previously filed suit against the government in the court of federal claims on facts similar to those at issue in this case,alleging both direct contract and beneficiary theories.see flexfab,united states,flexfab decision.we find the court decision in that case instructive of how we should approach beneficiary claims where the knowledge and intent of those with authority to contract on the government behalf are at issue.the facts of that case are thus relevant,we think,to the question now before us.
flexfab became a subcontractor to gladen industries,gladen in.id.at.under the subcontract,flexfab supplied gladen with vehicle parts necessary for the performance of gladen obligations under three government contracts between gladen and the defense construction supply center dcsc.pursuant to the three prime contracts,gladen was to supply aircraft and submarine parts to dcsc for use in operation desert storm.gladen soon became late in making payments to flexfab,and flexfab responded by refusing to ship additional parts to gladen until flexfab received a guarantee of payment.gladen subsequently fell behind in its deliveries to dcsc.
flexfab,gladen and the government thereafter engaged in extensive negotiations to resolve the standstill in a mutually beneficial manner.flexfab initially requested that it be designated the payee under the contract.dcsc refused because formal assignment of gladen contract rights would require the government to the contract,a procedure thought not feasible during wartime.acting on a suggestion from jeffrey weiden,flexfab treasurer,dcsc instead agreed to modify the prime contracts to designate flexfab as the mailee for all future payments.gladen provided flexfab the authority to endorse the
