business systems engineering,business systems brought this diversity suit against international business machines ibm.business systems alleged,among other things,that ibm had an agreement with business systems to provide business systems with million in work as a subcontractor on a project ibm was completing for the chicago transit authority cta.because ibm had provided business systems with only million in work,business systems claimed that ibm still owed it million.the district court granted ibm summary judgment,and business systems appeals.we affirm.
in december,the cta entered into a contract with ibm under which ibm agreed to implement a new computer system for the cta.a condition appended to the contract required ibm to subcontract not less than of the total dollar value of the contract which was million to disadvantaged business enterprises.business systems was certified by the cta as a disadvantaged business enterprise,and it was one of ten disadvantaged business enterprises that provided technical consultants for ibm to work on the cta contract.
when utilizing the services of a supplier like business systems,ibm would first enter into a base agreement with the supplier that would govern their overall business relationship.such agreements are common in the industry.the customer solutions agreement csa was the specific base agreement governing the relationship between ibm and business systems it was created prior to ibm contract with the cta.according to the detailed terms of the csa,business systems was to provide deliverables and services according to the specifications contained in the relevant statements of work.the csa defined a statement of work as any document which describes the deliverables and services,including any requirements,specifications or schedules.business systems was not to begin the tasks described in a statement of work,however,without a corresponding work authorization,which the csa defined as a purchase order,bill of lading,or other ibm designated document.the csa limited what ibm owed business systems to the amounts specified in statements of work and authorized in work authorizations.it stated that the only amount due to business systems from ibm was the expenses specified in the relevant statements of work and the amount ibm would pay for deliverables and services specified in a purchase order and accepted by ibm.
before the cta executed its contract with ibm and work began,ibm had to submit to the cta a schedule c letter of intent from dbe to perform as subcontractor,supplier consultant signed by each disadvantaged business entity that was to provide work as a subcontractor,as well as a schedule d dbe utilization plan signed by ibm.the original schedule c for business systems,attached as exhibit to business systems original complaint,listed the price of services business systems was prepared to provide for the cta project as.a revised schedule c listed services of and software of as the price of what business systems was prepared to provide for the cta contract.the schedule d ibm submitted to the cta for business systems listed provid ing development resources for conversions,interfaces,and customizations as the type of work to be performed in accordance with the revised schedule c.it also listed million under the heading contract amount.all of the schedules stated that,after the cta executed the contract,the parties would enter into a formal written agreement for the above work.
the cta approved the contract with ibm,and the work on the cta project proceeded as follows.when ibm needed a specific task performed on the cta project by an outside technical consultant,it advertised the open position to one of the approved disadvantaged business enterprises,like business systems.if business systems presented a candidate for the open position that was acceptable to ibm as well as the cta which retained the right to reject any individual candidate put forth by ibm or one of ibm subcontractors to work on the project,then ibm would send business systems a statement of work.those statements of work expressly incorporated all of the terms and conditions of the csa,the base agreement.each statement of work set forth in detail the project scope,tasks that business systems consultants were to perform,the time frame within which the consultants were to perform them,the hourly rate of pay and estimated hours required to complete the tasks,and the conditions under which ibm would deem business systems to have fulfilled its obligations under each statement of work.after business systems received the statement of work,ibm would issue a work authorization in the form of a purchase order authorizing the allocation of funds to business systems.
in total,business systems received statements of work from ibm for the cta project.together with the corresponding purchase orders,the statements of work authorized roughly million in work on the project.it is undisputed that ibm paid business systems for all the work that business systems did pursuant to those statements of work.it is further undisputed that,at certain times during the project,business systems failed to submit candidates to fill an open position on the cta project.business systems also fell behind in paying some of its own subcontractors,causing those subcontractors to threaten to leave the cta project.
at the conclusion of the cta project,ibm had provided work to disadvantaged business enterprises in the amount of of the total contract value,a figure in excess of the requirement set forth in the condition accompanying the contract between ibm and the cta.of the ten disadvantaged business enterprises that participated in the cta project,eight exceeded the dollar value listed on their schedules c and two,however,did not.one of those two was business systems,which only received million in work as opposed to the million listed on its schedules c and 
business systems believed it was entitled to the additional difference between the million listed on its schedules c and d and the million for the completed subcontracting work it had actually received.it therefore filed suit in state court alleging,among other things,that the schedules c and d constituted a written contract that ibm breached by failing to provide business systems with million in work on the cta project.ibm removed the action to the district court and moved to dismiss the complaint.it argued that the schedules c and d were not contracts but merely letters of intent that evidence d the parties anticipation of a future executed contract.the district court agreed with ibm and dismissed the suit.
business systems then filed an amended complaint.in its amended complaint,business systems still alleged that the schedules c and d were part of the written agreement between business systems and ibm.however,the amended complaint also detailed a collection of other documents that business systems asserted evidence d the written agreement between itself and ibm.one of the documents described in the amended complaint was an email from ibm client director jim lautenbach to the cta explaining that business systems participation in the cta project had been set at million by mutual agreement.the email contained a spreadsheet attachment entitled bse work that set forth how ibm and business systems planned to achieve the million objective.under the heading description of work,the spreadsheet listed wage progression study,supplemental training services,it replacement services,post production support,hr functional resources,hr technical resources,and wage progression customization.corresponding to each of those entries under the description of work heading was a spreadsheet entry for related task order,projected bse revenue,and estimated contract date.
ibm unsuccessfully attempted to have the amended complaint dismissed,and the case proceeded to discovery.after discovery,ibm moved for summary judgment on all of business systems claims.in that motion,ibm argued that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on business systems breach of contract claim because the statements of work,along with the corresponding purchase orde
