in this false claims act fca,retaliation action,plaintiff appellant dennis glynn glynn argues that defendant appellee impact science technology ist and its parent company,edo corporation,fired glynn because he reported ist to the government for what he believed to be fraudulent conduct.we agree with the district court that glynn was not engaged in activity that qualified him for protection under the fca provision and affirm the grant of summary judgment to appellees.
ist is a new hampshire corporation that designs and manufactures explosive devices c ieds for the united states government.ist hired glynn in as an engineer after purchasing his company,dedicated electronics,which had previously consulted for ist.ist line of c ieds includes mobile multi band jammer systems mmbjs.mmbjs jam the frequencies used to detonate the improvised explosive devices ieds that have been used with devastating effect on american troops in the wars in iraq and afghanistan.
beginning in,glynn made numerous recommendations and complaints to his supervisor,dean puzzo,ist director of information warfare programs,and scott traurig,ist senior principal systems engineering manager,related to what he perceived as the failure of mmbj devices to function properly at elevated temperatures.he also complained he was not receiving clear guidance about what specifications the mmbjs were supposed to meet and that there was insufficient screening conducted on the equipment.specifically,glynn spoke with traurig at least six times about the need for better specifications and temperature testing.at one point,traurig responded that ist does not use specifications because ist has to operate on the fly.
in april,ist government customer government customer discovered that ist had failed to put a finalized testing plan in place and communicated to ist that its failure was unacceptable.in august,glynn sent an email to puzzo,caprario,and traurig explaining the temperature issues hobbling the jammers.he recommended a particular test to determine whether the mmbjs were operating correctly.puzzo responded by email and communicated to caprario and traurig that we should look at dennis recommendation very seriously.
the remainder of the facts pertinent to this case took place in.in may of that year,glynn was instructed to conduct testing on the multi band tunable noise source module mbtns used in the mmbjs.these modules are an important component of the mmbjs that are designed to emit a that jams the receivers of nearby ieds.traurig instructed glynn to pass the mbtnss only if they performed adequately at degrees celsius.glynn viewed traurig degree threshold as arbitrary,however,and chose to calculate his own threshold.although the mbtnss did not meet the degree threshold traurig had set,glynn chose to pass them.
further temperature testing on the mbtnss in june revealed that one of the frequency channels,the,may generate inadequate output power under elevated temperatures to jam ied detonation signals covered by that band.to fix the problem,ist placed a corrective temperature component into the system.however,ist only applied this fix to units still in stock and not to the jammers already in the field.glynn asked caprario to recall the mmbjs that had already been shipped and were active in the field so that ist could install the corrective component.glynn also asked caprario to inform the government customer of the temperature concerns.caprario did neither.according to glynn,caprario stated that he did not want to upset the apple cart right now,a reference,glynn contends,to the million edo acquisition deal that was in the works at the time and was due to close in september.ist insists caprario explained to glynn that he would not recall any mmbjs because the mbtns temperature issue posed no risk to the overall performance of the mmbjs.
also in june,glynn asked various managers at ist if he could see copies of the mmbj contracts.on june,glynn met with lewis dokmo,ist vice president,and stated his team was having trouble sleeping at night because of concern they were not producing their product according to contract specifications and could be endangering people lives.glynn expressed his opinion that the three people between glynn and dokmo on the ist chain of command traurig,caprario,and puzzo were arrogant pricks who were him misleading information.dokmo told glynn he could see the contracts only if he put his request in writing.however,glynn never submitted a written request.throughout the summer of,glynn raised his concerns to multiple people in the company about temperature issues with the mbtns module and output power on the.
on september,glynn contacted assistant attorney philip halpern and told halpern that he thought ist was shipping systems that were putting our troops in jeopardy.halpern connected him with fbi agent maurice hattier.in a september response to an entitled suspected contract fraud,glynn stated,i t is my opinion that caprario,traurig,and puzzo are putting lives at risk by ignoring the temperature problems with the mmbj systems.they all directly benefited financially from the decision to do so with the recent sale of the company.agent hattier referred glynn to agent benjamin hochberger of the department of defense criminal investigative service,with whom glynn communicated between september and february.beyond the concerns related to the functionality of mmbjs under elevated temperatures,glynn also noted ist perceived failure to create or implement a quality assurance plan qap for the mmbjs and alleged that ist was fraudulent in its billing practices.
on september,glynn told philip joseph,a manager at ist,that he had reported the delivery of faulty systems to the government.even though glynn asked joseph to keep the matter confidential,joseph alerted ist management to glynn report on september.the next day,caprario contacted the government customer to explain that one of ist employees had made an allegation about the mmbjs.
in october,the government customer performed two rounds of testing on the mmbjs.testing on october revealed that mmbjs still in stock at ist that contained temperature compensation pads performed well overall.however,glynn later told agent hochberger that ist did not inform the government customer that these units had a temperature compensation pad while units in the field did not.after glynn explained the discrepancy,the government customer shipped units back from the field and conducted a second round of testing on october.this testing revealed that mmbjs that did not contain temperature compensation pads suffered a nine percent reduction in effective range.however,the government did not consider this range reduction significant,and concluded that these units also passed testing.nonetheless,in direct contravention of the government customer own determination,glynn insists these units shipped from the field failed testing.
glynn alleges ist made the decision to terminate him on october,just two weeks after ist learned of glynn disclosure.he claims ist decided to keep him on through december because they needed him to finish work on an important new module they hoped would replace the mbtns.ist terminated glynn on december.
in,glynn sued ist and edo for unlawful retaliation under the fca and other claims not at issue on appeal.on for summary judgment,the district court denied glynn motion and granted ist motion.glynn timely appeals the district court grant of summary judgment against him.

the fca is designed to discourage contractor fraud against the federal government.mann heckler koch defense,cir.under the fca,private parties can bring qui tam actions in the name of the united states to enforce the provisions of the statute.b.in,congress amended the fca to include an provision to protect whistleblowers.false claims amendments act,stat.codified as amended at h.this provision provides an action to 
any employee discharged,demoted,suspended,threatened,harassed,or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts done by the employee in furtherance of an action under this section 
a successful claim for retaliation under h requires that the plaintiff establish three basic elements he engaged in protected activity by acting in furtherance of a qui tam suit his employer knew of these acts and his employer took adverse action against him as a result of these acts.zahodnick int l bus.mach,cir.while the district court decided against glynn on each of these three prongs,we limit our inquiry to the first prong because our finding that glynn failed to offer sufficient evidence to establish he engaged in protected activity is dispositive in this case.
in his attempt to satisfy the first prong of a fca retaliation claim,glynn puts forward three theories he investigated and opposed ist provision of defective mmbj devices to the government customer he investigated and opposed ist false certification of compliance with the requirements in the mmbj contract and he initiated government investigation of ist fraudulent conduct.we discuss these theories in order below.
glynn first argues that he engaged in protected activity because he was investigating a potentially fraudulent act namely that of a contractor,ist,knowingly supplying the government a substandard product.an employee need not file an actual qui tam suit to satisfy the first prong of the fca test.mann,at.because the statute protects acts in furtherance of a qui tam suit,actionable retaliation can occur while employees are investigating or collecting information about a possible fraud,before they have put all the pieces of the puzzle together.id.at quoting united states ex rel.yesudian howard.we apply the objective distinct possibility standard to determine whether an employee has engaged in protected activity.eberhardt integrated design,cir.to pass muster under the distinct possibility standard,a plaintiff must be investigating matters that reasonably could lead to a viable fca action.id.the employee investigation must concern false or fraudulent claims or it is not protected activity under the fca.id.at.
there is little disagreement that glynn diagnosed a problem with how the mbtns modules reacted under elevated temperatures,helped to develop the temperature compensation pads as a fix for that problem,and then,adamantly disagreed with ist decision not to recall the units in the field to install the compensation pads.he made numerous reports,recommendations,and complaints to various managers establishing his position that ist was putting troops at imminent risk by failing to recall and revamp the units in the field.courts have held that internal reporting can rise to the level of protected activity.see,mckenzie bellsouth,cir yesudian,at.however,as noted above,the employee must be reporting an act that reasonably could lead to a viable fca lawsuit.eberhardt,at.herein lies the problem with glynn argument the temperature issue glynn diagnosed and reported was not severe enough in degree to trigger any contractual obligation on ist behalf.
the june testing that glynn called for was testing,not testing.traurig explained in a deposition that this testing revealed that the output under elevated temperatures was causing too many mbtnss to fail their tests prior to assembly.however,the power output problem did not create failure.indeed,the addition of the temperature compensation pads after the june testing may have improved the module and,as a result,the final product.but,as described below,the systems as a whole still met the government customer standards.
there is a pivotal distinction here between the iterative process of product improvement and fatal performance flaws.product improvement is part of the natural process of research and development.the diagnosis of a problem and subsequent adaptation is mere product improvement if the problem does not cause the product to fall below contractual standards of performance.a fatal performance problem,on the other hand,would cause the product to fail contractual standards.
we must safeguard a contractor ability to make iterative improvements without compromising the utility of the product in the field at the time.as the district court noted,the mmbj devices were part of a design,development,and deployment process.glynn impact sci,d.it would be unreasonable and to expect ist to pull units out of the field every time engineers such as glynn identify a snag or a potential improvement in the product.such an extreme policy would cause unnecessary interruption in the use of these devices and lead to astronomical cost increases.a recall makes sense only if the system as a whole fails to pass muster,and here it did not.
glynn argues that his extensive experience and unique knowledge of these devices substantiated a belief that the temperature problem he diagnosed was a fatal performance issue.the facts undermine his reasoning.first,glynn himself directed an ist employee to pass an mbtns module through temperature testing in may even though it performed at less than degrees celsius because he knew that it would not compromise the overall system ability to meet specifications.his decision to give the green light establishes that he understood that the shortcomings they were dealing with did not translate into dysfunction.
second,the october government testing in response to glynn relating activity does not bear out his allegations that the temperature issues caused performance failure.there were two rounds of government testing in october.the first round tested units still in ist stock with temperature compensation pads in place.the second round tested units recalled from the field that did not have the temperature compensation pads in place.while there was some reduction in power output and several amplifier failures,the government did not find that any of the units in either round of testing failed at the system level.in fact,glynn appeared to acknowledge there was no performance issue with the mmbjs in an to agent hochberger after he learned of the testing results i was told that there were failures of units in the e band of to db.to put this in perspective,it is not a significant deviation from the specification and i am sure that the government customer was pleased with that fact.
nonetheless,glynn clings to the unsupported assertion that the mmbjs failed the october tests.he urges this court to find that his characterization of the october tests creates a genuine issue of material fact that a jury should resolve.it would be unreasonable for a jury to find this was a performance issue when all evidence,except for glynn own opinion on the matter,points to a conclusion that this was a product improvement issue.see guinness plc ward,cir holding that conclusory allegations and speculative assertions without further legitimate support clearly does not suffice to create a genuine issue of material fact.federal rule of civil procedure requires that the party in a motion for summary judgment set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson,at.glynn has not set forth facts,but opinions.the factual evidence in this case,particularly the test results,contradict his opinions.as such,we hold glynn purported investigation activities did not raise a distinct possibility of a viable fca action and are not protected.
next,glynn argues he engaged in protected activity in furtherance of a qui tam suit based on ist alleged false certification of compliance with government contracts.in particular,glynn alleges that ist falsely certified
