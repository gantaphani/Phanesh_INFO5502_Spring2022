this case arises from a bitter bidding dispute for a contract to strip and repaint the commodore barry bridge.the delaware river port authority drpa rejected the lowest bidder,alpha painting construction company,alpha,because it determined that alpha was not a responsible contractor.instead,drpa awarded the contract to corcon,corcon.after its bid protest was denied,alpha filed this lawsuit in district court on an expedited basis seeking an injunction against drpa.the district court promptly held a trial and concluded that drpa acted arbitrarily and capriciously.it then entered an order directing drpa to award the contract to alpha.drpa appeals.
for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court ruling that drpa acted arbitrarily and capriciously.however,because we conclude that the district court abused its discretion by directing that the contract be awarded to alpha,we will vacate that portion of the order and remand to the district court for the entry of a more limited injunction.
background 
factual background 
drpa is a corporate instrumentality that owns,operates,and maintains four bridges that span the delaware river between new jersey and pennsylvania,including the commodore barry bridge,a structure that supports five lanes of traffic.drpa is governed by a board of commissioners and operated on a basis by its staff of engineers,contracting administrators,legal counsel,and administrative support professionals.recently,drpa staff determined that the commodore barry bridge paint coating is deteriorating.drpa decided to repaint the entire bridge,a substantial capital construction project that requires hiring a contractor capable of using highly specialized abrasive blast cleaning equipment to strip and contain the lead paint hereinafter the bridge project.this equipment is necessary to protect workers,the public,and the environment from hazardous lead contaminants.
drpa divided the bridge project into three phases.phase,now near completion,involved stripping and repainting the new jersey approach spans.corcon is performing that work.phase,which drpa is now soliciting,will involve repainting the pennsylvania approach spans.phase,which has not yet begun,will involve repainting the center span portion.the phase contract is the subject of the instant dispute identified herein as contract no.or the phase contract.
in early may,drpa began soliciting bids for the phase contract.on june,the due date for submissions,drpa received seven bids,including alpha and corcon.that same afternoon,drpa assembled the bidders for phase in its conference room to open the bids publicly.among those present were adam jacurak,drpa senior engineer in charge of the phase project,amy ash,drpa director of contract administration,as well as the bidders.ash opened the bid packages and declared alpha the apparent low bidder because it bid the lowest price.corcon bid the second lowest price,more than alpha.
both alpha and corcon have significant experience painting bridges.alpha,a industrial painting contractor,has painted numerous bridges across the country and is prequalified to bid for such work in states.alpha has previously worked for drpa,painting the pennsylvania approach span of another one of its bridges between and.alpha also worked on a project at philadelphia street station in as part of a joint venture with another contractor.alpha has not performed any other work in pennslyvania or new jersey over the last five years.
corcon,a national bridge painting contractor,has also worked for drpa.currently,it is painting phase of the bridge project and there is evidence that it has recently painted other drpa bridges as well.moreover,drpa is collaborating with corcon on an extracurricular film project concerning corcon work on the commodore barry and other drpa bridges 
after drpa determined that alpha and corcon were the lowest and second lowest bidders,respectively,it undertook a review of the bids.over the next two months,after a process largely characterized by inaction and delay,drpa ultimately rejected alpha bid and selected corcon.two determinations form the heart of alpha challenge.first,drpa declared that alpha was not a responsible contractor under its guidelines because alpha failed to remit certain accident experience forms called osha forms and insurance data in the form of experience modification factors,or emfs in its bid package.as discussed infra,drpa uses this data to assess a bidder safety culture.second,drpa declared that corcon was in fact the lowest bidder because of a miscalculation that drpa perceived in corcon bid.drpa conduct leading to these determinations all of which occurred sometime between june and august,was the subject of alpha challenge before the district court.
we too will focus on this time period.at trial,drpa presented documentary evidence including its guidelines,emails to and from certain employees,and emails between drpa and certain bidders,as well as the testimony of four of its employees.we think it most helpful to proceed by first briefly reviewing applicable portions of drpa bidding guidelines.next,we will discuss how drpa analyzes osha forms and emfs.finally,we will recount the specific aspects of drpa two determinations that are challenged by alpha.
drpa bidding guidelines 
drpa bidding guidelines are internal regulations adopted by drpa that govern its procurement of services for work on its bridges when drpa seeks construction and maintenance services,in particular,it uses the competitive sealed bid procurement method.under that method,drpa must issue an invitation for bids ifb detailing the project,collect and publically open sealed bids at a set time and place,and declare an apparent low bidder.then,after a subsequent investigation,the guidelines require that drpa award the contract to the lowest responsible and responsive b idder unless all bids are rejected or the lowest bidder is allowed to withdraw its bid.emphasis added.
the guidelines thus set up a process whereby drpa must perform two distinct review inquiries.first,drpa must determine,within ten days of submission,whether a bid is responsive.see responsiveness of a bid is determined within ten business days from the bid itself.a responsive bid is one that conforms in all material respects to the requirements and criteria in the invitation for bids.drpa may,however,waive technical defects or immaterial items that would otherwise make a bid nonresponsive so long as the waiver does not undermine the competitive character of the bidding process.
second,drpa must separately determine whether the lowest bidder is responsible.a responsible bidder possess es the capability to fully perform the contract requirements in all respects and the integrity and reliability to assure good faith performance.internal quotation marks omitted.unlike responsiveness,this requirement goes to the capacity of the bidder rather than its willingness to perform on drpa terms.id.c apacity to perform involves not only its ability to meet quality,quantity and time requirements,but its business integrity to assure honest,good faith performance.id.drpa may not presume that all bidders are responsible,but instead has an affirmative duty to make this determination with respect to the lowest bidder and to document its reasons for doing so in the contract file.id.
if drpa determines that the lowest bidder is responsible,drpa must accept that bidder.drpa may reject a bidder as not responsible and select a higher bidder,but only if its investigation discloses a substantial reason for doing so.id.emphasis added.the guidelines are clear that drpa should not base a determination of nonresponsibility on a single bad item or report unless the behavior or financial condition is of a sufficiently serious nature as to call into question the ability or integrity of the bidder to perform the contract.emphasis added.
the guidelines go on,in a lengthy chapter dedicated entirely to the responsibility inquiry,to describe the rigorous,investigation that drpa should undertake to fulfill this duty.the guidelines state that drpa is not limited in its investigation to reviewing information provided by the bidder with its bid and should take any steps it determines are necessary to ensure that a bidder is responsible.such steps include request ing a bidder to supply financial,educational,and experience information as well as references or requesting further clarification from the bidder as appropriate during its review.drpa may also perform news and internet searches or public record database searches,and may review corporate filings,published consumer ratings,and certifications,just to mention a few.
drpa review of osha forms and emf factors 
according to drpa,an important part of its responsibility investigation involves determining whether the bidder has a history of performing safely on the job.to facilitate this review,the ifb states that all bidders will supply with its b id,accident experience in the form of the standard osha report and its experience modification factors emfs for all work completed in the state of new jersey and the commonwealth of pennsylvania,covering the preceding three reporting years.drpa then uses these emfs and osha forms to assess the safety culture of the bidder.
osha forms are completed by the contractor annually and provide a summary of the total number of company employees,total hours worked by those employees,the number of injuries reported,and a brief description of each injury.
emfs are a creature of the insurance industry.they are numerical multipliers generated yearly by ratings bureaus,and they are assigned to every company that performs work within a particular state.the emf calculation that produces this multiplier takes into account the frequency and severity of workers compensation claims filed against the company in that state.it does not account for workplace injuries to or injuries that do not result in a workers compensation claim.insurance firms then use a company emf to adjust the amount of workers compensation insurance premium it has to pay for that year.for example,a company assigned a emf pays the standard market rate for insurance.a company assigned an emf of less than will get a credit on its premium and will pay less than the standard market rate for its insurance,while a company assigned an emf greater than will pay more.
some states assign new contractors or contractors who have never performed work in that state an emf of.but other states,like pennsylvania,report that a new contractor does not qualify for an emf because it does not meet pennsylvania payroll threshold to qualify.from an insurance premium perspective,however,a company that does not qualify is indistinguishable from a firm assigned a emf because both would pay the standard market rate of insurance 
how drpa actually goes about employing this information to assess safety culture was the subject of much discussion at trial.as best we can tell,once drpa receives bids for a given project,the senior engineer separates the bid into its constituent parts and sends the osha forms and emfs to drpa department of risk management and safety.marianne staszewski,the department director and the department only employee,then performs a risk management review of the osha and emfs,which essentially amounts to determining whether the bidder has a positive safety culture.
drpa review,however,seems more perfunctory than analytic.in order to determine the safety culture of the bidder,staszewski averages the three emfs supplied with the bid.if the average is or greater,she concludes,in her words,that the contractor has had significant frequency or severity of losses within the last three years which translates into not working safely on the job.if the emf average is less than,she approves the bidder because she is satisfied that it is not suffering frequency and severity of losses.id.during this process,staszewski also considers the quantitative aspects of a bidder osha the number of employees,hours worked,injuries reported to contextualize its emf score,although it was not clear from her testimony how this impacts her final analysis she does not consider the portion of the osha form that describes the reported injuries 
we now turn to the two disputed portions of drpa review in this case.
drpa evaluation of alpha and corcon osha and emfs 
with respect to alpha bid on june,the day of the bid opening,drpa staff undertook a quick responsiveness review to determine compliance with.jacurak and ash testified that they flipped through alpha bid and noticed that it did not include osha forms.drpa,however,did not declare alpha bid not responsive to the ifb.instead,jacurak and ash notified drpa general counsel to get guidance.very little emerged about these discussions at trial,but apparently,counsel instructed the staff to circulate both alpha and corcon bids,rather than just alpha,to drpa various departments for a responsibility determination.
three weeks later,on july,jacurak emailed staszewski with alpha emf letter attached alpha had submitted a letter from its insurance broker which stated that alpha did not qualify for experience emf rating s in,and in either pennsylvania or new jersey.it is undisputed that alpha had not performed work in pennsylvania or new jersey as an individual entity in the last five years,although it had done work in pennsylvania as part of a joint venture in and which resulted in the joint venture being assigned an emf of and,respectively staszewski determined that she could not effectively review alpha safety record under her emf policy because alpha did no work in the state of pennsylvania,did no work in the state of new jersey,and thus ha d no work experience over these three years,from which she could conclusively determine its safety culture.
after roughly three more weeks of silence,on july,ash prepared and sent alpha a letter rejecting its bid the july rejection letter.the letter first cited the requirement that the bidder supply osha forms and emfs.then it stated that alpha failure to provide the osha form and its inability to provide experience modification factors back through prevent ed drpa from substantially evaluating alpha safety record.as a result,drpa declared that it found alpha not responsible for the subject project,and therefore,that alpha bid was rejected.id.
at trial,the parties vigorously disputed whether alpha actually submitted its osha forms,an inquiry which consumed much of the district court time.tom kousis,alpha project manager in charge of its phase bid,testified at length that he remembered submitting the forms.he pointed to a box on the bid form that he checked contemporaneously to his binding the bid package together.jacurak and ash maintained that none were submitted.because no copies of alpha paper bid were made and all submissions were unbound during the subsequent bid review phase,it was impossible to determine from the documentary evidence whether alpha had submitted these records.
the remainder of the testimony at trial focused on drpa determination that alpha was not responsible.alpha counsel tried to pinpoint exactly who made this guidelines determination.but no one seemed to know.staszewski testified that she had no idea who made that determination in this case,and had only the faintest clue who does so in the ordinary course.her understanding was that amy ash would make that call.ash,however,declined having anything to do with the responsibility determination.she testified that jacurak told her the director of risk management,staszewski found alpha to be nonresponsible.jacurak reported that is either i have to say it between legal and contracts administration.drpa general counsel did not testify,nor is it clear what business input,if any,he or she had in these determinations.
alpha counsel also questioned whether staszewski,who the district court described as visibly flummoxed at trial had identified anything in alpha submission or otherwise that suggested it was not a safe contractor.she maintained that alpha record,without emfs,was inconclusive and therefore could not be approved.when asked about alpha record painting bridges,she claimed that it was not pertinent to her analysis for drpa new jersey and pennsylvania bridges,although she conceded that it might be relevant to assessing alpha safety.she insisted that it was not feasible to even ask alpha about its record,intimating only that her superior told her once not to contact bidders during her review.she also admitted to knowing that alpha had previously performed work in pennsylvania in as part of a joint venture.
alpha counsel also asked staszewski whether,as a consequence of her emf analysis,drpa would only approve contractors that had previously performed work in new jersey or pennsylvania in the last three years.she said no.in fact,staszewski admitted that it was possible that a new contractor that had never been assigned an emf in pennsylvania or new jersey and had done no work there could be approved under her emf policy,although she could not list,when asked,what other factors she might consider in so finding.
staszewski disclosed that she did contact alpha insurance broker to confirm that alpha had not performed any work in pennsylvania or new jersey.she did not contact alpha directly.no one at drpa did.to the contrary,because he had not heard from drpa since being declared the lowest bidder,kousis repeatedly called and emailed drpa staff to inquire whether drpa had sufficient information to complete its review.most calls and emails were ignored.kousis reached jacurak once by phone sometime in july,but jacurak did not mention that alpha failed to submit its osha.
not much else exists in the record regarding drpa review of alpha.other portions of the bid were sent to other drpa departments,but the status of their review is not known.drpa chief engineer,michael venuto testified that because staszewski withheld her approval,he never contacted alpha references from other jobs,performed due diligence with respect to noise control,assessed compliance with coast guard requirements,or investigated alpha ability to provide staging.
with respect to corcon,its bid was missing the requisite emf its broker letter provided usable emfs for and only.upon noticing its absence,staszewski called corcon broker,who provided an updated insurance letter containing the missing emf.staszewski then concluded,after averaging corcon emfs,that it embrace d a safety culture.she then approved its bid from a safety review perspective.it is not clear from the record,what,if any,other responsibility investigation drpa undertook with respect to corcon.
drpa modification of corcon bid on august,
alpha also challenged drpa subsequent modification of corcon bid,which had the effect of making corcon the lowest bidder.the ifb required bidders to propose a price for mobilization and costs,which,according to the ifb,was not to exceed of the total bid price.section q.corcon bid exceeded this limitation.jacurak testified that he noticed this on june,when he performed an initial review of the price schedules.however,he did not declare corcon nonresponsive to the ifb.
instead,on august,nearly two months after discovering the discrepancy and about two weeks after alpha filed its bid protest,drpa sent letters to all bidders stating that drpa had discovered that three bidders one of whom was corcon may have incorrectly computed the mobilization and line item.it then cited ifb,which states in full 
the bidder shall state in the form of proposal the price per unit of measure or lump sum price,in words and in figures,for each scheduled item of work,and the total price for the performance of the work,as determined by multiplying each estimated quantity by the price per unit of measure bid therefore and adding together the resulting amounts and any lump sum prices required.for the purposes of comparison of bids received,the total price,correctly computed,stated in the proposal will be considered to be the amount bid for the work and the award will be made on that total price.
italic and bold emphasis added.relying on the italicized portion,and in particular the bolded phrase,correctly computed,drpa asked each firm that bid more than of its total bid price to confirm that the mobilization costs quote was,in fact,a miscalculation.drpa then declared corcon the lowest responsible bidder.finally,after approving corcon bid,drpa staff recommended corcon to the board of commissioner operations and maintenance committee.
proceedings before drpa board of commissioners 
alpha protested the july rejection letter on july,in a letter to drpa,noting in particular that if drpa decision was based on responsiveness,it should have been made earlier and that drpa could have easily asked for the documents.drpa general counsel denied a hearing and rejected the protest,although he permitted drpa to file a written appeal to drpa board of commissioners.
the operations and maintenance committee took up alpha appeal and the recommendation to accept corcon bid at a special meeting dedicated solely to these matters on august.alpha did not attend this meeting.the meeting began at am and the committee immediately moved into executive session.no transcript or minutes were taken.the committee then went back on the record at am,approved drpa recommendation to award the phase contract to corcon without discussion,and adjourned at am,three minutes later.
drpa full board considered the committee resolution to accept corcon bid on august,at its regularly scheduled meeting.at the meeting,alpha counsel gave a lengthy and detailed statement outlining its protest.the board then moved into executive session for minutes,although,again,no minutes were taken.when it emerged,it resolved to accept corcon bid without acknowledging alpha or hearing any public discussion of the committee resolution.it then directed drpa staff to enter negotiations with corcon.
alpha federal lawsuit 
on august,alpha filed suit in the district court for the district of new jersey on an expedited basis claiming that drpa award violated its guidelines and thus was arbitrary and capricious under new jersey,pennsylvania,and federal common law the complaint requested injunctive relief including an order directing drpa to award the contract to alpha.
the district court held a bench trial.in a lengthy opinion,the district court separately considered and rejected both of drpa stated reasons lack of osha forms and lack of emfs although it focused on drpa emf policy alpha painting constr,delaware river port,nlh amd,wl,at.it found drpa reliance on emfs troubling.because emfs only accounted for workers compensation injuries,it deemed them an underinclusive proxy for a bidder safety record.it also found,based on the testimony of alpha insurance broker,that alpha failure to qualify for emfs was not indicative of a poor safety record.alpha record was no different,in the district court view,from the hypothetical new contractor,who staszewski said could be approved under her test.thus,it ultimately concluded that n othing in the record before drpa prior to its final decision to characterize alpha as justified that conclusion and nothing before the district court support ed it either.id.at.
the district court also rejected drpa claim that the agency had authority to modify corcon mobilization and cost quote.it concluded that drpa did not have authority to make that change under ifb and that drpa delay in exercising this alleged authority,despite being aware of the defect on june,suggested that the modification was a pretext to ensure that corcon was awarded the contract 
with respect to the remedy,the district court found that irreparable harm would result if drpa were not enjoined from proceeding on the contract with corcon and reasoned that there is no need to start the bidding process over,as such a remedy would be adverse to the public good,and unfair to alpha.id.at.to the contrary,it found alpha was fully capable and qualified to perform the work required under the contract,and was ready to mobilize immediately.id.as support,it cited that alpha osha forms showed alpha had only one workers compensation injury reported nationally over the last three years,while corcon had seven on the phase project alone that alpha had been issued and certifications from the society for protective coatings which confirm ed that alpha is capable of removing industrial hazardous paint,id.at and that alpha has significant experience painting bridges.the district court then entered an order permanently enjoin ing drpa from awarding contract no.phase ii to any entity other than alpha,and drpa shall award contract phase ii to alpha.
this expedited appeal followed.

drpa raises numerous challenges to the district court order,but we consider only three material to resolving its appeal drpa claims a that the district court abused its discretion by declaring that drpa arbitrarily and capriciously rejected alpha and selected corcon b that it was reversible error to fail to join corcon,who drpa claims was a necessary party under fed.civ.and c that the district court erred when it directed drpa to award the phase contract to alpha.we consider each below.
drpa rejection of alpha and selection of corcon 
with respect to the first issue,drpa maintains that it was not arbitrary and capricious to label alpha not responsible or to modify corcon mobilization line item.both determinations had the effect of making corcon the lowest,responsible bidder.
a district court review of an agency procurement decision is extremely limited in scope.princeton combustion research,mccarthy,cir.because such decisions implicate an agency expertise,we must be careful not to substitute our judgment for the agency.id.at the same time,we may not shirk our judicial duty to ensure that a government agency has complied with applicable bidding rules and regulations,which exist in part for the public benefit by ensuring that the agency obtains the most advantagous contract available.thus,a district court may not overturn a procurement decision unless the aggrieved bidder demonstrates that there was no rational basis for the agency decision.sea land,brown,cir.see also glancy sons,dep t of veterans affairs,cir.coco.pierce,cir.recoginzing that discretion to award injunctive relief in procurement cases is restricted to circumstances where the governmental agency action is illegal or irrational.
however,if the agency provides a rational basis for its action,our inquiry comes to an end.see princeton combustion,at holding that,as a matter of law,where the procurement decision was rational,a reviewing court may not award injunctive relief despite the presence of procurdural irregularities in the procurement process 
accordingly,we turn now to drpa arguments that it had a rational basis under its guidelines for its actions.
alpha failure to submit osha forms and emfs 
drpa argues that it has a rational basis for labeling alpha not responsible.we can not see how.drpa essentially faults the responsiveness of alpha bid package and relies exclusively on alpha failure to provide osha forms and emfs.but drpa did not label alpha.instead,it rejected alpha as not responsible.we have closely scrutinized the record and have been unable to find any justification casting doubt on alpha capability or capacity to perform abrasive lead paint stripping and repainting moreover,we do not think drpa guidelines allowed it to reject a bidder as not responsible based on this type of justification 
we begin with marianne staszewski,as her testimony was a focus of the parties briefing and drpa contentions at oral argument.she did not identify any facts that could support drpa responsibility finding.staszewski simply did not approve alpha because it had not supplied the bid safety information she was accustomed to receiving.that conclusion ultimately and for reasons unknown manifested as drpa affirmative finding that alpha was not responsible in the july rejection letter.drpa maintains this was rational.however,we fail to see how alpha failure to qualify for emfs permitted drpa to conclude that alpha was not responsible.at least in terms of insurance risk,alpha emf history made it no different from a new contractor who had never performed work in pennsylvania or new jersey both would pay the same standard market rate of insurance yet staszewski said that she could not approve alpha record,but could possibl y approve a hypothetical new contractor without emfs.she offered no reasoned explanation why.surely,the absence of emfs in a bidder record does not show frequen t and sever e losses on the job,which was staszewski central safety criterion.an absence of emfs shows nothing one way or the other,and therefore was not evidence of alpha inability to do the work safely.
what we find so puzzling is that drpa was aware of at least some evidence from which it could evaluate alpha past safety performance.for example,staszewski knew about alpha joint venture work on another project in pennsylvania.the joint venture was assigned an emf of,which fell well below staszewski rule.she simply did not consider it.moreover,drpa maintains on appeal that it is infeasible to inquire into alpha bridge painting experience,despite some evidence that most states subscribe to a national and uniform rating service.drpa has not persuasively explained why this data was not at least relevant to assessing alpha safety culture 
at most,alpha bid was not responsive under the guidelines.its alleged failure to submit osha forms and emfs or a suitable equivalent failed to conform to clear text.drpa all but concedes this point,and essentially argues that it may also label a bidder not responsible at any time in the procurement process for the same reason.
this line of argument,however,conflicts with drpa own guidelines.the guidelines establish that responsiveness and responsibility are mutually exclusive inquiries.drpa had ten days from bid submission to declare alpha to the ifb.it did not elect to do so here nor do we think it could have done so on july,days after this window closed.drpa instead labeled alpha not responsible.this designation triggered a different set of obligations and standards under the guidelines.drpa had an affirmative duty to determine the lowest bidder responsibility,and could only reject its bid and select a higher bid if its investigation unearthed a substantial reason why the bidder was not capable or did not have the capacity to do the work.indeed,the guidelines specifically contemplate that drpa might have to look outside the four corners of the lowest bidder submission to fulfil that duty,including requesting further clarification from the bidder as appropriate.
here,for reasons that still elude us,drpa appears to have simply given up once it determined that alpha emf record was inconclusive.drpa did not contact alpha to request further clarification.jacurak,drpa senior project engineer who knew about alpha paperwork deficiencies,did not ask kousis,alpha project manager,about them during their call drpa also failed to perform many other responsibility inquiries,as drpa chief engineer venuto noted,such as contacting alpha references.no public searches were done no news searches no certification assessments.certainly nothing in the guidelines prohibited these sorts of inquiries.rather,they are encouraged,if not mandated.in short,drpa appears to have actually gone out of its way to avoid relevant safety history information with respect to alpha.
there is yet another problem with drpa argument.even if we were to agree with drpa that it could designate a bidder as not responsible because the bidder safety record was unknowable from the four corners of its submission,drpa does not seem to have applied that rule consistently in this case.corcon failed to submit three years of emfs providing only two usable years and.drpa should have rejected corcon for the same reason.we therefore agree with the district court that drpa application of its rules in this case gave unequal treatment to alpha and corcon.nazareth hosp.sec y dep t of health human,cir.quoting muwekma ohlone tribe salazar,cir.agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency offers insufficient reasons for treating similar situations differently.
in sum,neither staszewski nor any other employee or document proffered a rational basis pursuant to drpa emf policy or otherwise for labeling alpha not responsible.drpa testimony in fact revealed that no one knew who ultimately translated staszewski conclusion that alpha record contained insufficient materials to assess responsibility into the july rejection letter,which affirmatively determined that alpha was not responsible.we find that the district court was correct in concluding that drpa acted irrationally.
drpa modification of corcon mobilization and cost price 
drpa next challenges the district court finding that drpa acted without authority when it subsequently limited corcon mobilization and clean up line item.jacurak recognized on june,that,contrary to what the ifb required,corcon had bid more than of its total bid price for this line item.although drpa characterized this as a computation error within the meaning of ifb,drpa did not move to correct the alleged miscalculation until two months after learning about it,and only until after alpha had filed a bid protest.the district court concluded that drpa discovery was merely a pretext to ensure that corcon was awarded the contract.on appeal,drpa does not try to explain away the suggestive timing of this revision.instead,it contends that section q and of the ifb expressly permit it to reduce corcon bid so that it complies with the ifb.drpa br.
this argument,however,borders on the frivolous.section q,which defines how drpa will pay its contractor for each unit of work performed,says nothing about drpa power to modify a bidder final quote during its subsequent investigation.section,which is titled preparing proposals,is similarly unavailing because it merely instructs contractors how to add or multiply their bid prices.in this context,the phrase correctly computed can only plausibly refer to a limited authority to correct mathematical errors in the contractor computations of his total bid price.the following section,actually explains this.see if,during the tabulation of bids,the total price on any proposal is found to be incorrectly computed,drpa reserves the right to make such changes as are necessary in the extended amounts and total price,on the basis of the unit and lump sum prices given in words and the approximate quantities stated for the scheduled items therein.emphasis added.moreover,much like drpa responsibility determination,the decision to modify corcon bid appeared out of thin air.there is nothing in the ifb or otherwise that gives drpa such expansive authority.the district court correctly concluded that drpa lacked the authority to modify corcon bid.on august,alpha was still the lowest bidder.
in sum,we agree with the district court that drpa conduct over this period,taken together,suggests that it has gone out of its way to award the phase contract to corcon and not alpha.we are equally alarmed that drpa board of commissioners gave virtually no attention to alpha protest.and,after months of litigation,much still remains unclear.what is clear,however,is that drpa actions defy reasonable explanation.accordingly,we hold that drpa rejection of alpha and its eventual award to corcon was illegal and irrational,coco,at,and that the district court order setting it aside was not an abuse of discretion.
corcon as a necessary party under rule 
next,drpa urges that we vacate the district court order because corcon,who was not joined in this action,was a necessary party under federal rule of civil procedure a b i.this rule provides that a party must be joined if the party has an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person absence may as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect the interest.fed.civ.a b i.we fail to see,however,how corcon had a protectable interest relating to this dispute that would have necessitated its joinder.
drpa relies on independent enterprises pittsburgh water sewer authority,wherein we rejected a disappointed bidder procedural due process claim,cir.because the bidder bid had never been accepted by the state authority,we held that it had no legally enforceable interest in receiving the contracts.id.at.in so finding,we said that one who bids on a public contract has no legitimate expectation of receiving it until the contract is actually awarded.id.emphasis added citing highway express lines winter.drpa seizes on this distinction between bidder and awardee to argue that because corcon was awarded the contract,it obtained an enforceable property right.
we disagree.we had no occasion in independent enterprises to explore,much less decide for rule purposes,what it meant to actually award a contract.id.whatever that threshold may require,we think it clear that drpa guidelines do not vest any property right in a drpa awardee.drpa board resolution merely authorize ed drpa staff to negotiate a construction contract with corcon.supp.app.it did not create any contract rights.moreover,the guidelines accord significant discretion to drpa to negotiate with and even reject the eventual awardee specified in that resolution.for example,drpa may seek to negotiate discounts with the awardee,see,or may even reject the awardee as not responsible later in the process and until the contract is fully executed,emphasis added.drpa has not fully executed a contract with corcon and thus it had no protectable property right.coco,at recognizing that negotiations after initial acceptance of a bid postponed the date of the final award.
even if it did have a property right,alpha persuasively points out that corcon interests were fully represented by drpa,which zealously sought to uphold its designation of corcon as the lowest responsible bidder.see,lake shore land,cir.the fact that the absent person may be affected by the judgment does not of itself require his joinder if his interests are fully represented by parties present.
we note,too,that drpa own representations in this case tend to undermine its claim that corcon has a right to the phase contract.during trial,drpa represented to the district court that it would not award the contract until the litigation had been resolved.moreover,during the pendency of this appeal,drpa sent at least two letters to bidders requesting that they agree to an extension of the date of award.supp.app.we decline to vacate the order on this ground.
finally,we must decide whether the district court erred when it directed drpa to award the phase contract to alpha.because we conclude that the district court exceeded its authority by deeming alpha responsible under drpa guidelines,we will vacate the portion of the order directing the contract award and remand for the entry of a more limited injunction.
we have said that even when a disappointed bidder has shown an agency procurement decision to be irrational or illegal,prudent judicial discretion may still refuse declaratory or injunctive relief because of overriding public interests,at.this is because j udicial intrusion into government purchases necessarily delays completion of the contract and increases costs,with little measurable benefit to the public,div.friedkin,cir.thus to determine whether injunctive relief should be granted,district courts should weigh the practical considerations of efficient procurement of supplies for continuing government operations,the public interest in avoiding excessive costs,and the bidder entitlement to fair treatment through adherence to statutes and regulations,at.
this case implicates a subsequent question in the remedy analysis what is the appropriate scope of injunctive relief.the district court
