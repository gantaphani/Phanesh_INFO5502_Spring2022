plaintiffs appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the attorney general of louisiana.this case arises out of the master settlement agreement msa reached in the between the four largest tobacco manufacturers and the several states.the plaintiffswho are not signatories to the msasued the louisiana attorney general,alleging that the msa and the louisiana escrow statute,et,violate the compact clause,first amendment,federal cigarette labeling and advertising act fclaa,commerce and due process clauses,and federal antitrust laws.for the following reasons,we affirm.
in,several states,including louisiana,brought lawsuits against the four largest tobacco manufacturers philip morris,reynolds,lorillard,and brown williamson collectively referred to as the original participating manufacturers opms.the states alleged that the opms tobacco products,as well as the marketing related to their tobacco products,cost the states billions of dollars in increased health care costs.
in,the opms reached a settlement agreement,the msa,with governmental entities collectively referred to as the settling states,including louisiana.the msa released the opms from past,present,and future legal claims.in return,the opms were prohibited from participating in certain types of state and federal lobbying,engaging in litigation adverse to the msa or its enacting state statutes,and various types of advertising.the opms also were required to make annual payments into a fund hereinafter the msa fund based on their present market share.money paid into the msa fund is paid out in fixed shares to the individual settling states.
smaller tobacco manufacturers that were not part of the opms were permitted to join the msa as subsequent participating manufacturers spms.the msa created two groups of spms.the first group hereinafter the grandfathered spms included those spms that signed on to the msa within the first days of its execution.as a means of encouraging smaller tobacco manufacturers to become grandfathered spms,the msa provides that grandfathered spms do not have to pay into the msa fund,so long as their market share does not exceed the greater of their sales or of their sales.the second group hereinafter the spms are those spms that joined the msa after days of its execution.spms must pay into the msa fund based on their annual market share,but unlike grandfathered spms,they need not remain at the same market size as when the msa was executed.both grandfathered spms and spms must abide by the aforementioned prohibitions in lobbying,litigation,and advertising that opms are subject to under the msa.
in return for the above concessions,the msa encourages,but does not demand,that the settling states pass a model statute hereinafter the escrow statute.the escrow statute requires that tobacco manufacturers not participating in the msa referred to as manufacturers npms and selling tobacco products in the state either join the msa or make an annual deposit into a qualified escrow account based on the quantity of cigarettes the npm sold in the state during the previous calendar year.to encourage the settling states to pass the escrow statute,the npm adjustment was created.the msa provides that if any of the opms,grandfathered spms,or spms collectively the pms lose its market share,a firm of economists will be hired to determine whether the loss in market share is due to the aforementioned restraints in lobbying,litigation,and advertising required by the msa.if those restraints are determined by the economists to be a significant factor contributing to the loss of market share,then the pm may reduce the amount it pays into the msa fund.this reduction is the npm adjustment,which is borne only by the settling states that have not enacted the escrow statute.louisiana enacted an escrow statute,et.under the louisiana escrow statute,if an npm fails to join the msa or fails to make the appropriate annual deposit into a qualified escrow account,the npm is subject to civil and criminal penalties.however,if an npm pays more to the qualified escrow account than it would have to pay if it were a spm,the npm is entitled to a refund of the excess amount it paid.c b.
since its implementation,several npms and smokers have challenged the validity of the msa and state escrow statutes before a number of courts,including,most recently,this court this case is yet another challenge to the msa and louisiana escrow statute.
the plaintiffs filed suit against the defendant,louisiana attorney general buddy caldwell,seeking to invalidate the msa and louisiana escrow statute on the grounds that they were unconstitutional because they violated the compact clause,the first amendment,the commerce clause,and the due process clause.the plaintiffs further alleged the msa and escrow statute violated federal antitrust laws,the fclaa,and the bankruptcy code.
following proceedings before the district court,both parties filed motions for summary judgment.finding there were no genuine issues of material fact,and that the plaintiffs claims failed as a matter of law,the district court granted the attorney general motion for summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiffs claims with prejudice.the plaintiffs timely filed this appeal.on appeal,the plaintiffs press all of the aforementioned challenges except for their allegation that the msa and escrow statute violate the bankruptcy code.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.breaux halliburton energy services,cir citing lemaire.dep t of transp,cir.
we first address the plaintiffs assertion that the msa violates the compact clause,art.i,cl,because it is an agreement among the settling states that has the potential to interfere with the plaintiffs constitutional rights and has not been approved by congress.the district court found that the proper analysis to determine whether congressional approval is required under the compact clause is the test provided in united states steel multistate tax commission,whether the compact enhances state power quoad the national government.because the msa only increases states power the pms and not in relation to the federal government,the district court concluded there was no violation of the compact clause.
the fourth circuit in star sci.reached this same end.see at.the star sci.court stated 
although the master settlement agreement implicates the compact clause,we see no reason to conclude that it encroaches on federal power.in tax commission,the supreme court upheld a compact resulting in reciprocal state legislation and establishing an administrative body to coordinate state taxation of certain entities.the court noted that the compact might result in an increase in bargaining power of the member states with respect to the corporations subject to their taxing jurisdictions,but it found such an increase in power to be acceptable because the test is whether the compact enhances state power quoad the national government.similarly,the master settlement agreement may result in an increase in bargaining power of the states the tobacco manufacturers,but this increase in power does not interfere with federal supremacy because the master settlement agreement does not purport to authorize the member states to exercise any powers they could not exercise in its absence.
at.see also vibo conway,d,finding that the msa does not violate the compact clause because a n increase in the states collective bargaining power does not result in an accompanying decrease of federal power.
we agree with the reasoning expressed by the fourth circuit and the district court in the instant case,and accordingly find no merit in the plaintiffs compact clause challenge.
the plaintiffs also argue that the msa and escrow statute are per se violations of the sherman act,because the structure of the msa creates a national cigarette cartel designed to increase the prices paid out to the opms and protect the opms market share.the plaintiffs further assert that the only defense potentially available to the attorney general is the implied immunity found under parker brown,but that such immunity does not apply in this case where louisiana ac
