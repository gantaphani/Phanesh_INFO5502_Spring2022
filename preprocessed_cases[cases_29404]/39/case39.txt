plaintiff michael ladas,a former employee of defendant itt power solutions,power solutions,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut,alfred covello,judge,dismissing his qui tam action brought on behalf of the united states under the false claims act,et or fca,against power solutions et for alleged fraud in representations made to the united states in connection with certain equipment supplied to the government pursuant to a procurement contract.the court dismissed ladas substitute second amended complaint or ssac in part pursuant to fed.civ.b,ruling that ladas had released his claims against power solutions and its parent corporation and thus lacked standing to bring claims against them,and in part pursuant to fed.civ.b on the ground that the fraud claims were not pleaded with the requisite particularity.on appeal,ladas argues principally that his claims against power solutions and its parent are not barred by his release agreement and that his complaint satisfied the requirements of rule b.he also contends that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing him to amend the substitute second amended complaint.for the reasons that follow,although we do not endorse the district court ruling on the enforceability of the release,we affirm the dismissal of the substitute second amended complaint without leave to amend further for failure to plead fraud with the requisite particularity.
background 
the substitute second amended complaint,along with portions of the motion papers supporting defendants motions to dismiss and the opinion of the district court granting those motions,as well as the briefs and most of the record on this appeal,have been filed under seal they are hereby deemed unsealed to the extent that their contents are quoted or described in this opinion.the following description reflects allegations in the substitute second amended complaint,taken as true for purposes of reviewing a dismissal pursuant to rule b,see,mills polar molecular,cir.
a.the government contract and the equipment produced 
in,power solutions,itt corporation itt,was awarded a contract to provide the united states with equipment that included certain devices and apparatus to supply the devices with power the contract.the contract required that the devices,their component parts,and their supporting apparatus meet particular specifications for,inter alia,form,fit,and function,as well as for logistics with regard to replacement parts.equipment produced after any change to the manufacturing materials or process that had potential for causing a deviation from contract specifications was required to be subjected to product qualification tests such changes were also required to be submitted to the government for its approval.
power solutions entered into a subcontract with defendant innovative mold solutions,ims,pursuant to which ims would manufacture casing components for the devices apparatus.components manufactured by ims were delivered to power solutions,which sent them to another itt business unit for assembly of the devices and the accompanying apparatus hereinafter the assembly division,and for shipment to the government.delivery of the equipment to the government began in the fourth quarter of.
in november,ims made substantial changes in the manufacture of the case component,using a less expensive adhesive material and changing the process it used to apply that material.an engineering professor had alerted an employee that a change in application method would require significant additional testing to ensure the apparatus reliability and endurability but no new product qualification testing was performed,and the changes were not submitted to the government for approval.the ssac alleged that ims made the changes in in collusion with the assembly division and did not disclose these changes to power solutions.
the ssac alleged generally that ims changes affected compliance with contract specification requirements and would affect the function of the equipment,causing the devices to function incorrectly or not at all.power solutions engineers were aware that a process change had occurred with potential to significantly affect the quality and function of the apparatus and in a meeting with ims,they complained of defects in some of the components ims had shipped.ims denied having made any changes.power solutions rejected the defective parts based on their noncompliance with an internal itt specification.
in february,power solutions began documenting problems with the case components,noting various types of degradation.power solutions general manager decided,however,that the ims components should be sent on to the assembly division without awaiting complete test results.in may,power solutions contacted ims supplier to review the process being used,and learned that ims had taken over that supplier role more than two years earlier.ims then,realizing what power solutions had learned,finally admitted that ims had introduced changes in.employees of the assembly division met with ims to discuss the matter ladas,who was responsible for ensuring and improving the quality of power solutions products,was not included in the meeting.
ladas was director of quality at power solutions from until march he reported to the head of quality assurance at the assembly division.in,after power solutions personnel had become aware of the significant changes to ims manufacturing process,the power solutions department advocated disclosure of the contract violations to the government as required by the contract and drafted a request for a government waiver of the deviations and a proposal for corrective action.the deviation waiver request was initially approved by the assembly division but was never sent to the government.
instead,employees sent the government a white paper the white paper and an accompanying letter collectively the letter stating falsely that itt had only recently become aware of a change in the ims application process a change they described misleadingly stating that no tests had identified degradation or failure in the metalized area of the components,and stating falsely that the adhesive used had not changed.the letter stated that there was no major or functional change having any potential to affect any specification requirement.itt continued to ship devices to the government,fraudulently certifying that they had been produced in accordance with contract specifications and requirements.the government placed at least one additional order after receiving the letter.
after learning of the assembly division false,deceptive and misleading letter to the government,the power solutions department prepared,in or about march,a second deviation waiver request for submission to the government,detailing the true changes.ssac.this request also was not sent to the government.
b.the release of ladas and the dismissal of the present action 
on march,ladas employment with power solutions was terminated.ladas signed a separation agreement separation agreement or agreement in which he,inter alia,agreed to release all claims or demands he may have arising out of or relating to his employment,including any rights or claims he may have under federal laws the release.the agreement,which is in the district court record as an unsealed document,stated that the release shall be construed in the broadest sense possible and shall be effective as a prohibition to all claims and causes of action of every character,nature,kind or description,known or unknown,and suspected or unsuspected.
ladas commenced the present qui tam action under the false claims act in july and a month later filed an amended complaint.ladas alleged that power solutions,ims,and itt had knowingly made to the united states false or fraudulent claims for payment,in violation of a a had knowingly created and used,or caused to be used,false records or statements material to such claims for payment,in violation of a b and had conspired to make such claims or statements,in violation of a c.in or about,itt its business including power solutions and the assembly division to a new company,exelis.exelis was thereafter substituted for itt as a defendant.
defendants after being served with process in late following the government election not to intervene moved to dismiss the amended complaint those motions were mooted by the district court granting a motion by ladas to file a further amended pleading.ladas filed the substitute second amended complaint in november,and defendants moved to dismiss the ssac.ims sought dismissal pursuant to rules b and b for failure to state a claim and for failure to plead fraud with sufficient particularity.power solutions and exelis moved to dismiss pursuant to rule b on the ground that ladas lacked standing to pursue claims against them because of the release to which he agreed in the separation agreement,and pursuant to rule b on the ground that the ssac fails to identify a single false claim submitted to the government,or even one device sold to the government that did not meet contract specifications and fails to identify a single false certification of compliance,express or implied itt defendants motion to dismiss the second amended complaint,dated december,at.
in a sealed ruling on the defendants motion to dismiss,dated september.ruling,the district court granted the motions to dismiss pursuant to rules b and b,and ladas has appealed.after oral argument of this appeal,ladas,with the consent of the united states,withdrew his appeal as to ims,with prejudice he now challenges the dismissal of his claims only against power solutions and exelis.
ii.discussion 
ladas contends principally that his claims against power solutions and exelis are not within the scope of the release,or that if they are,the release is unenforceable as a matter of public policy and that the substitute second amended complaint satisfied the requirements of rule b.he also contends that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing him to file another amended complaint.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the dismissal of ladas claims against power solutions and exelis for failure to plead fraud with the requisite particularity and we see no abuse of discretion in the court refusal to allow ladas to amend again.
enforceability of the release 
the district court ruled that ladas lacked standing to bring the present action against exelis and power solutions because he had released itt from any claims arising out of his employment and any claims arising from any federal,state,or local laws,noting that the document contains several references to a release of all claims or a complete release of liability and states that the release shall be construed in the broadest sense possible.ruling at.the court concluded that the release includes the qui tam claims because they are based on information that ladas learned as an employee of itt,and therefore,they are subject to the terms of the release contained in the separation agreement.id.at.relying in part on united states ex rel.radcliffe purdue pharma,cir.radcliffe,cert.denied,the district court also concluded that public policy did not make ladas release unenforceable,noting that 
i n the fca context,courts have recognized that a release of the right to bring a qui tam action is unenforceable where the government would have no other way of learning of the fca violation.ex rel.radcliffe purdue pharma,cir.w hen the government is unaware of potential fca claims the public interest favoring the use of qui tam suits to supplement federal enforcement weighs against enforcing prefiling releases.id.at.
however,where the fraud has been sufficiently disclosed to the government,public policies supporting the private settlement of suits heavily favor enforcement of a prefiling release.ex rel.radcliffe,at 
ruling at footnote omitted.the district court found that 
h ere,the allegations of fraud were sufficiently disclosed to the united states before ladas signed the separation agreement.in june,itt notified the government of the process and epoxy change in the white paper and accompanying note.this disclosure put the government on notice that the epoxy application process had been changed and gave the government sufficient information to investigate the alleged fraud if it chose to do so.
since the government was sufficiently informed of the alleged fraud prior to ladas signing the separation agreement,and the purpose of the fca is not threatened,the court concludes that the release is enforceable.
id.at emphases added.
we disagree with the district court description and assessment of itt disclosures to the government.assuming that ladas release was sufficiently broad to encompass his qui tam claims,we hold that the release is unenforceable as a matter of public policy.
a person pursuing a qui tam action under the false claims act the relator asserts a claim based on a right belonging to the united states.see generally vermont agency of natural resources united states ex rel.stevens.the goal of the fca qui tam provisions is to prevent and rectify frauds by government contractors,by incentivizing private individuals to uncover and prosecute fca claims.see,united states ex rel.dick long island lighting,cir.united states ex rel.ritchie lockheed martin,cir.ritchie united states ex rel.green northrop,cir.green,cert.denied.
in green,the ninth circuit considered whether a release of a qui tam claim,when entered into without the united states knowledge or consent,and prior to the filing of an action based on that claim,is enforceable,at it concluded that such a release would be unenforceable because it would impair a substantial public interest by nullifying the incentives the fca gives to file such claims,id.at.in the case before it,the green court assumed for purposes of analysis that the release in fact encompassed the asserted qui tam claim however,given that the government had only learned of the allegations of fraud and conducted an investigation because of the filing of the qui tam complaint,id.at emphasis in original,the court concluded that that facet of the release was unenforceable as contrary to public policy.
thereafter,the ninth circuit distinguished green and enforced a release where t he federal government had been aware of the relator allegations regarding false certifications.united states ex rel.hall teledyne wah chang albany,cir.hall see id.at the government had full knowledge of the plaintiff charges and had investigated them before the release.in that circumstance,the public interest in having information brought forward that the government could not otherwise obtain was not implicated.id.at.
courts have widely applied the framework reflected by green and hall,focus ing the inquiry on whether the allegations of fraud were sufficiently disclosed to the government to make enforcement of the release consistent with public policy.radcliffe,at internal quotation marks omitted see id.at collecting cases.in ritchie,the court concluded that the releases signed by the relator were enforceable because when they were signed,her employer had already disclosed the fraud allegations to the federal government,at,albeit stating that it believed the allegations lacked merit,see id.at.in response to the disclosures,the government conducted its own inquiry into the matter.although the relator characterized the defendant communication as a whitewash,the court held that the disclosures themselves were sufficient to satisfy the public interest in uncovering fraud.id.in radcliffe,the court concluded that the relator release,signed before his qui tam suit alleging that his former employer purdue had defrauded the government by representing that its drug oxycontin was a cheaper alternative to the drug it replaced ms contin,was enforceable because such allegations were already known to the government.see at beginning in and continuing for the next several years,the government sought millions of documents from purdue and conducted hundreds of interviews,some of which pertained to the relative potency and cost of oxycontin and ms contin.internal quotation marks omitted.the radcliffe court concluded that the allegations of fraud were sufficiently disclosed to the government prior to rad
