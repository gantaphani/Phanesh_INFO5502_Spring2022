albert robles robles appeals his convictions for honest services mail and wire fraud,money laundering,and bribery.george garrido garrido appeals his convictions for honest services mail fraud.we have jurisdiction under.
after robles and garrido were convicted and sentenced,and while their cases were on appeal,the supreme court in skilling united states,d,narrowed the scope of to include only honest services fraud based on bribery and kickback schemes.id.at.the court prohibited prosecutions such as those in this case based on a failure to disclose a conflict of interest as unconstitutionally vague.id.at.in light of skilling,we reverse robles and garrido honest services fraud convictions and reverse robles money laundering convictions.we affirm robles bribery convictions under because such convictions do not require the defendant to be engaged in an official act.accordingly,we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
following a jury trial,robles was convicted of counts of honest services mail and wire fraud counts,four counts of money laundering counts and five counts of bribery counts.garrido was convicted of five counts of honest services mail fraud.
robles and garrido convictions arose out of a series of events that took place while robles was treasurer of the city of south gate,california.robles was elected treasurer in and reelected in.he had previously served as mayor and as an elected member of the south gate city council.garrido was a local businessman and friend of robles.robles and garrido were implicated in two schemes to award city contracts to particular companies while reaping substantial benefits for themselves.
sewer repair and housing project schemes counts 
the first scheme,charged against robles alone,involved two corporate entities the southland companies,comprised of several housing development corporations,and psomas,an engineering consulting firm.the southland companies were developing housing projects in south gate,and psomas was interested in sewer repair contracts in south gate.
the indictment alleged that robles used his influence as treasurer to induce the southland companies and psomas into hiring robles friend edward espinoza espinoza as a consultant directed the city council to award contracts to the two companies and concealed or failed to disclose that portions of the city money paid to those companies was funneled to robles and to robles friends and family 
counts through alleged that checks were mailed from the city of south gate to psomas and from psomas to em ventures,a company that espinoza owned and used to receive money from individuals and entities who did business with the city of south gate.counts through and charged that wire transfers were made from three southland housing development projects to espinoza,em ventures,and ete associates,a financial advisory firm that espinoza owned and used to receive money from individuals and entities who did business with the city of south gate.
count specifically alleged that robles failed to disclose in a california form,statement of economic interests,that he received from espinoza a platinum membership in the anthony robbins foundation,a motivational organization,and that robles caused that form to be transmitted in interstate commerce by wire communications by faxing it to sacramento 
counts through charged robles under with money laundering.those counts alleged that robles used the money gained from the honest services fraud to purchase property in mexico and for a platinum membership in the anthony robbins foundation.
waste hauling contract scheme counts 
the second scheme,charged against both robles and garrido,alleged that robles,while he was treasurer,caused the city of south gate to award improperly a contract to michael klistoff klistoff waste company,klistoff sons.
garrido and klistoff had been friends for several years before garrido introduced klistoff to robles.in,at robles request,klistoff began making campaign contributions and to robles and robles general purpose committee,citizens for good government klistoff agreed to make these contributions because he knew robles had influence in south gate and klistoff was hoping to gain access to future contracts.
about ten days before the march election,robles asked the company for south gate,waste management,whose contract with the city was set to expire in eight months,to pay worth of printing bills that robles was about to incur.waste management declined to pay the bills because it was too late to report them as a campaign contribution.after robles was reelected treasurer,robles told waste management that they were not his friends and that,as far as robles was concerned,waste management was out of town.robles told waste management to go away quietly or he would hurt the company in other cities.
in,klistoff told garrido that he wanted klistoff sons to be awarded south gate contract,worth about million.garrido agreed to help klistoff get the contract on the conditions that klistoff hired garrido as a consultant for per year for the duration of the contract,and garrido recycling business would be cut in on the contract if it was awarded to klistoff sons.
robles met with klistoff before south gate sent out its request for proposals for the contract.robles showed klistoff the draft request for proposals,which called for one company to perform residential services and three companies to perform commercial services.klistoff suggested to robles that one company could perform both services.the final request for proposals incorporated klistoff suggestion and called for a single company to perform both the residential and commercial services.klistoff sons submitted its bid for the contract in june.
in july,robles assigned his friend,louis moret,to work on the city contract as the facilitator for the bidding process.moret presented the staff recommendation for the contract to the city council and attended the meeting when the city council voted to award the contract.robles told moret that he had a horse in the race and that horse was klistoff sons.robles was concerned about klistoff ability to make a persuasive presentation to the contract selection committee,so he asked moret to recommend a consultant to help klistoff sons prepare its oral presentation in support of its bid.moret recommended ray garubo garubo as a consultant.shortly thereafter,garrido contacted klistoff and advised him to hire garubo as a consultant to help klistoff sons make an effective and convincing presentation to city officials.klistoff retained garubo as a consultant,but garrido paid garubo consulting fees 
klistoff received information that no competing company was given.robles showed klistoff the other competing companies bids,even though the bids were supposed to be confidential.moreover,at robles request,moret provided robles and garubo with a copy of the confidential questions that the selection committee would ask the bidders to answer during oral presentations.none of the other bidders were provided with these confidential questions in advance of their oral presentations.
after the oral presentations,the selection committee voted to recommend that south gate engage in exclusive negotiations with klistoff sons.the vote was in part based on klistoff oral presentation.the city council approved the selection committee recommendation and ultimately awarded the million contract to klistoff sons.
counts through and charged robles and garrido with honest services mail fraud in connection with the contract scheme.count is based on california form,statement of economic interests,for calendar year in which robles failed to disclose the payments received from klistoff for a computer,software,and a telephone switchboard system.see supra note.the form was mailed.counts through are based on three checks from garrido business,gws nursery and supplies,received by garubo for assisting klistoff sons in its efforts to obtain the contract with south gate.
count refers to a california form,statement of economic interests,for calendar year,in which robles failed to disclose copying services paid for by klistoff on robles behalf.
counts through were charged against robles alone.robles was charged under with accepting bribes from klistoff in connection with the contract.
indictment and trial 
the government filed the original indictment against robles,klistoff,and espinoza in november.it filed a first superseding indictment in december,alleging forty counts against those same defendants.on march,espinoza pled guilty to four counts of the first superseding indictment.on march,the government filed the second superseding indictment against robles,klistoff,and garrido.in june,after klistoff entered into a plea agreement,the government filed a redacted second superseding indictment which deleted klistoff as a named defendant in the caption.the redacted second superseding indictment charged robles with counts of honest services mail and wire fraud,four counts of money laundering,and five counts of bribery.garrido was charged with five counts of honest services mail fraud.
a jury convicted robles and garrido on all counts alleged in the redacted second superseding indictment.the district court sentenced robles to ten years in prison,fines,and restitution.garrido was sentenced to months in prison,fines,and restitution.robles and garrido timely appealed.
robles and garrido honest services fraud convictions 
robles was convicted of honest services mail and wire fraud on counts through,through,through,and.garrido was convicted of honest services mail fraud on counts through,and.honest services mail and wire fraud cases rel y on the idea that a public official acts as trustee for the citizens and the state and thus owes the normal fiduciary duties of a trustee,honesty and loyalty to them.united states kincaid chauncey,cir quoting united states silvano,cir.
honest services fraud before and after skilling 
before,the government prosecuted honest services fraud cases under mail fraud and wire fraud.united states weyhrauch,cir,vacated and remanded on other grounds,d united states bruno,cir.sections and criminalize the use of the mails or wires in furtherance of any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.skilling united states,d quoting and.
although those statutes prohibit the use of the mails or wire services to perpetrate fraudulent schemes to deprive others of money or property,our court and other courts interpreted the statutes to apply to the deprivation of the public intangible rights to public officials honest services.united states milovanovic,cir en banc weyhrauch,at see also bruno,at stating citizens may be defrauded of nonpecuniary interests such as the honest services of their public officials united states gray,cir explaining the intangible rights theory is anchored upon the defendant misuse of his public office for personal profit united states keane,cir noting the mail fraud statute in this circuit has been used to prosecute public officials for depriving their constituents of their right to loyal,faithful and honest public service united states states,cir holding a fraudulent scheme may deceive and defraud the public of certain intangible political and civil rights.
in,however,the supreme court held that was limited to protecting property rights,and suggested that i f congress desires to go further,it must speak more clearly than it has.mcnally united states,d.congress responded by inserting into the federal criminal code the following year.skilling.at see also act of,stat,codified at.by enacting,congress meant to reinstate the body of honest services law.skilling.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.section defines the term scheme or artifice to defraud for the purposes of honest services mail and wire fraud to include a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.id.at quoting.
following the enactment of,courts around the country interpreted the statute to encompass various types of schemes and to make criminal a wide variety of acts.see,weyhrauch,listing cases united states walker,cir noting that t he scope of conduct covered by the honest services mail fraud statute is extremely broad.but see united states brumley,cir holding violation of requires that a state official breached a duty respecting the provision of services owed to the official employer under state law.the ninth circuit recognized two theories of honest services fraud bribery and failure to disclose a material conflict of interest.kincaid chauncey,at.the prosecution of robles and garrido proceeded under that framework.
after robles and garrido trial,the supreme court granted certiorari in the fifth circuit case united states skilling,cir,to determine whether a public official may be convicted of honest services fraud for failing to disclose material information.see skilling united states,d.
in deciding skilling,the supreme court limited the reach of.the court held that criminalizes only bribery and kickback schemes,not failures to disclose a conflict of interest.skilling.at.thus,by limiting to bribery and kickback schemes,and prohibiting prosecutions based on a failure to disclose a conflict of interest,skilling changed the applicable analysis that applies to the present appeal the question after skilling is whether robles and garrido were indicted,tried,and convicted of honest services fraud based on a proper bribery or kickback theory,or whether they were indicted,tried,and convicted on the unconstitutional undisclosed conflict of interest theory.
the impact of skilling 
on appeal,the parties have submitted changing arguments as to whether robles and garrido were charged with schemes involving bribery and kickbacks or involving undisclosed conflicts of interest.before skilling,robles and garrido argued that the government case was founded only on a bribery theory,and that the government evidence was insufficient to support their convictions.the government disagreed,insisting that its case was rooted in robles failure to disclose a conflict of interest.in support of its contention,the government highlighted the district court finding that the indictment,viewed as a whole,alleged a scheme based on an undisclosed conflict of interest.
after skilling,however,the parties traded positions.robles and garrido now argue that the indictment,and the convictions resulting from it,alleged only a failure to disclose a conflict of interest.on the other hand,the government now argues that the indictment is based on bribery and kickbacks.the government also argues that the district court instructions on the failure to disclose theory,while erroneous,did not affect robles and garrido substantial rights because the schemes alleged in the indictment involved both bribes and kickbacks.
standard of review 
c onstitutional error occurs when a jury is instructed on alternative theories of guilt and returns a general verdict that may rest on a legally invalid theory.skilling.at citing yates united states,d.any omission or misstatement of an element of an offense in the jury instructions is constitutional error and,therefore,requires reversal unless we find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.united states kilbride,cir quoting chapman california,d.where there was no objection at trial,however,we review jury instructions for plain error.id.a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court attention.b.to notice error under rule b,we must find that there is error it was plain and the error affected substantial rights.united states recio,cir quoting united states olano,d.even if these three conditions are met,the court may reverse the district court only if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quoting olano,at.
the jury instructions on undisclosed conflicts of interest were erroneous and the error was plain 
the parties agree that the first two prongs of the plain error test are satisfied.an error is plain if it is clearly inconsistent with established law at the time of appellate consideration.johnson united states,d see also henderson united states,d,holding whether a legal question was settled or unsettled at the time of trial,it is enough that an error be plain at the time of appellate consideration.quoting johnson,at.
the court instructed the jury on the mail and wire fraud counts as follows 
in order for defendants robles and garrido to be found guilty of mail or wire fraud,the government must prove each of the following four elements beyond a reasonable doubt 
first,the defendant knowingly made up or participated in a scheme or plan to deprive the city of south gate and its citizens of their right to the honest services of their elected officials secondly,the defendant acted with the intent to defraud,that is,the intent to deprive the city of south gate and its citizens of their right to the honest services of their elected officials third,the defendant used a material falsehood or omitted material information fourth,the defendant used,or caused someone to use,the mails or a wire communication in interstate commerce to carry out or attempt to carry out the scheme or plan.
trial tr,july.
the court defined the intent to defraud the public of honest services as follows 
public officials and public employees inherently owe a duty to the public to act in the public best interest.if,instead,the official acts or makes his decision based on the official own personal interests,such as accepting a bribe,taking a kickback,or receiving a benefit from an undisclosed conflict of interest,the official has defrauded the public of the official honest services even though the city may not suffer any monetary loss in the transaction.
trial tr,july,emphasis added.
thus,the jury instructions improperly allowed a conviction where the official acts or makes his decision based on the official own personal interests,such as accepting a bribe,taking a kickback,or receiving a benefit from an undisclosed conflict of interest trial tr,july,emphasis added.because the district court instructions permitted the jury to convict robles and garrido on skilling now unconstitutional failure to disclose theory,there was error and the error was plain.
the error affected the appellants substantial rights 
an error affects substantial rights if there is a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial.united states marcus,d.to determine if the error affected the outcome of the trial,we consider all circumstances at trial including the strength of the evidence against the defendant.united states chambers,cir alteration in original quoting united states wagner,cir.we review the jury instructions as a whole,not only the erroneous instructions.kincaid chauncey,at.we may also examine the arguments made by the parties.see chapman,at noting that the prosecutor argument repeatedly relied on an error of law.
after reviewing the trial record as a whole,we conclude that there is a reasonable probability that the jury convicted robles and garrido of honest services fraud based on their failure to disclose a conflict of interest.because of the emphasis on the conflict of interest theory in the jury instructions and in the closing arguments,we find that the error affected the appellants substantial rights.
a.the indictment 
we find the indictment ambiguous at best.it arguably encompasses both theories of honest services fraud bribery and kickbacks,and a failure to disclose a conflict of interest.the vast majority of the allegations appear to support only an undisclosed conflict of interest nevertheless,because the indictment could be read to at least imply a bribery or kickback scheme,it is not possible to conclude on the basis of the indictment alone which theory or theories the jury may have embraced in rendering a guilty verdict on the honest services charges.
b.the jury instructions 
the district court jury instructions included only a single reference to bribery and kickbacks in its example of schemes that could amount to honest services fraud accepting a bribe,taking a kickback,or receiving a benefit from an undisclosed conflict of interest.the overwhelming weight of the instructions support only the undisclosed conflict of interest theory,rather than a bribery or kickback theory.the transcript of the jury instructions devoted nine pages to state and local laws governing a public official duty to disclose various contributions,gifts,and conflicts of interest.
in contrast to the detailed discussion of the failure to disclose theory,the district court did not define either bribery or kickback in the context.although bribery was defined in the jury instructions,does not require a jury to find a specific quid pro quo.see united states mcnair,cir concluding that does not require a specific quid pro quo see also id.at collecting cases from other circuits which hold that does not require a quid pro quo a quid pro quo in bribery is the specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act.united states sun diamond growers of california,d.section honest services convictions on a bribery theory,on the other hand,require at least an implied quid pro quo kincaid chauncey,at see section.below for further discussion.
there is evidence in the record that could support a bribery or kickback conviction.appellants do not dispute that payments and contributions were made to robles family and friends,including garrido.for example,espinoza testified that robles instructed him to funnel well over half of the proceeds of his city contract to robles.nevertheless,it is impossible to conclude that the jury convicted robles and garrido based on their participation in either a bribery or a kickback scheme instead of based on skilling unconstitutional failure to disclose a conflict of interest.
c.the closing arguments 
the prosecutor closing argument leaves little doubt that its case focused almost entirely on a failure to disclose theory.the prosecutor repeatedly invoked the public right to know when its public officials stand to benefit from expenditures of public funds.although the prosecutor referred to financial arrangements between robles and certain contractors the southland companies,psomas,and klistoff sons,the prosecutor did not argue that they were the building blocks of a bribery or kickback scheme.rather,such financial arrangements were consistently offered to show that robles had conflicts of interest which were never disclosed to the voters or to other officials of the city of south gate.thus,the prosecutor closing argument strongly suggests that the case was presented to the jury as a failure to disclose a conflict of interest,which is precisely what the supreme court found unconstitutional in skilling.
similarly,the transcript from robles closing argument suggests he believed he was fighting undisclosed conflict of interest charges.his closing argument focused almost entirely on whether he had a duty to disclose the payments,whether the payments fell within the ambit of state or local conflict of interest provisions,and whether the payments were political contributions which were not required to be disclosed on robles personal conflict of interest form or whether they were gifts which had to be disclosed.
the indictment,the jury instructions,and the closing arguments at trial were permeated with the prohibited failure to disclose theory.upholding the convictions where neither the government nor the appellants argued their cases on a constitutionally valid theory constitutes a miscarriage of justice which would seriously affect the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.marcus.at.thus,appellants have met their burden under the plain error standard of review to show that there was a reasonable probability that the instructional error affected the outcome of the trial and that the error seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.
therefore,we reverse robles honest services mail and wire fraud convictions and reverse garrido honest services mail fraud convictions.furthermore,counts,and fail for additional reasons,which we turn to now.
robles honest services conviction on count and robles and garrido honest services convictions on counts and 
robles conviction on count and robles and garrido convictions on counts and were each based on a failure to disclose a conflict of interest in a california form,statement of economic interests,disclosure form.pursuant to skilling,failure to disclose a conflict of interest in a state disclosure form can not support a honest services conviction.see section.above.
moreover,as the government concedes,there is insufficient evidence to support the convictions on counts and under any theory.count alleged that robles failed to disclose that he received from espinoza a platinum membership in the anthony robbins foundation.purely intrastate telephone calls fall outside the reach of wire fraud under.united states izydore,cir.because the form was faxed from south gate,california to sacramento,california,the government concedes that we should reverse robles conviction on count because the government never proved that the form traveled in interstate commerce.
count refers to a california form signed by robles on april,for calendar year,in which robles failed to disclose a gift of copying services received from klistoff.the government also concedes that we should reverse the count conviction because there was insufficient evidence that the copying services were gifts.
because these convictions can not be upheld,we reverse robles conviction on count and robles and garrido convictions on counts and.
robles money laundering convictions 
because we reverse robles honest services mail and wire fraud convictions,his convictions on counts through for money laundering under must also be reversed.convictions under require the government to prove that the offender engage d or attempt ed to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property derived from specified unlawful activity.a.the indictment alleged that the criminally derived property was money derived from robles honest services fraud.accordingly,because the honest services convictions were constitutionally defective under skilling,so too were the convictions.
robles bribery convictions counts 
counts through charged robles alone with bribery in violation of in connection with the contract robles contends that requires a quid pro quo a specific intent to receive a bribe in exchange for an official act.robles argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of bribery under because there is no evidence that he intended to be,or even could have been,influenced in his performance of one of his official duties.robles claims that,as treasurer of south gate,he did not have the authority to approve the contract rather that authority was vested in the city council.moreover,as treasurer,he was required to disburse monies properly approved by the city 
claims of insufficient evidence are reviewed de novo.united states sullivan,cir quoting united states shipsey,cir.there is sufficient evidence if,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.
section concerns bribery in connection with state and local entities receiving federal funds.an official violates if the official corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person,or accepts or agrees to accept,anything of value from any person,intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of an entity in this case,the city of south gate,if the exchange involves at least and the entity receives federal funds in excess of.a b,b.the purpose of the statute is to protect federal funds by preserving the integrity of the entities that receive the federal funds.united states simas,cir citing united states westmoreland,cir.
robles argument that requires an official act confuses influence with the power to act unilaterally.united states gee,cir.a jury could reasonably find that robles intended to be influenced in connection with the city award of the contract even though the authority to award the contract was not part of robles official duties.the government presented evidence that robles showed klistoff a draft request for proposals for the contract,and that the final request for proposals incorporated klistoff suggestion that the contract award one company both residential and commercial services.robles assigned his friend moret to work as facilitator for the bidding process for the contract.robles further instructed moret that his horse in the race was klistoff sons.during the selection process,robles communicated with moret frequently and moret told robles information that was not available to the public.robles requested that moret recommend a consultant to assist klistoff sons in its presentation for the bid,but he did not request assistance for any other bidders.klistoff sons hired the recommended consultant.robles showed klistoff the other companies competing bids,even though the information was confidential during the bidding process.moret provided robles and klistoff son consultant the confidential questions the selection committee would ask the bidders in advance of the presentations,an advantage no other bidder received.thus,there was ample evidence that robles accepted bribes from klistoff with the intention to be influenced in connection with the contract.robles indeed used his considerable influence exclusively for klistoff benefit.klistoff sons was awarded the contract despite not being the lowest bidder.
in support of his argument that requires the government to prove that robles intended to be influenced in connection with an official act as treasurer,robles urges the court to adopt the standards articulated in united states sun diamond growers of california,d.we find sun diamond inapposite.sun diamond concerned a separate federal statute,and the reasoning for requiring an official act under is inapplicable to.section b defines bribery as the act of giving,offering,or promising something of value in order to influence any official act or receiving something of value in return for being influenced in the performance of any official act.b a,a sun diamond,at.the term official act is expressly and broadly defined in as any decision or action on any question,matter,cause,suit,proceeding or controversy,which may at any time be pending,or which may by law be brought before any public official,in such official official capacity,or in such official place of trust or profit.a.bribery under b,therefore,expressly requires a quid pro quo a specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act.sun diamond,at.
importantly,sun diamond was primarily concerned with limiting the scope of illegal gratuities under c.id.at.because c criminalizes the giving of anything of value,with no threshold monetary requirement,underlying sun diamond was a need to distinguish between illegal gratuities and token gifts given by reason of the recipient mere tenure in office.id.at.thus,requiring an official act under c was necessary because a contrary holding would criminalize a wide array of presumptively legal gift giving,like giving officials a hat or a hot dog.united states abbey,cir discussing the reasoning in sun diamond.under c,an official act is therefore the limiting principle that distinguishes an illegal gratuity from a legal one.united states ganim,cir.
section,on the other hand,makes no mention of an official act or a requirement that anything be given in exchange or return for an official act.section does not define or even use the term official act.section sweeps more broadly than either b or c.mcnair,at.because the plain language of does not use the term official act,we must not insert that term into our reading of the statute.id.at noting that defendants failed to show that the statutory language criminalizes innocent behavior.moreover,the need for a limiting principle to distinguish between illegal and legal gratuities,as expressed in sun diamond,is not relevant to violations of because contains both a corrupt intent requirement and a requirement that the illegal gift or bribe be worth ove
