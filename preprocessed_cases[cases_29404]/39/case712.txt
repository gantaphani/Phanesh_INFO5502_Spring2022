in this case,we decide whether the day statute of limitations set forth in government code section applies to an action by a public agency to recover amounts paid to a public utility for capital improvements.we conclude section does apply,and therefore appellant complaint is barred as untimely.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
factual and procedural background 
utility cost management ucm is in the business of reviewing and analyzing utility charges to determine whether there have been overcharges.ucm,as the assignee of kern community college district kern,brought this action on february,to recover certain alleged overcharges paid by kern to defendant indian wells valley water district indian wells.the trial court sustained a series of demurrers and then entered a judgment of dismissal on april.ucm appealed,arguing the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to its third amended complaint.therefore,the third amended complaint is the subject of this appeal.
the complaint alleges that indian wells overcharged kern for water service because some or all of its charges qualified as capital facilities fees and,as such,improperly exceeded amounts permissible under section.the complaint asserted a cause of action for refund pursuant to section,as well as various common law causes of action.the trial court held that the day statute of limitations in section barred the action,citing san marcos water district san marcos unified school district d.san marcos ii.section provides a any judicial action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul an ordinance,resolution,or motion adopting a new fee or service charge,or modifying or amending an existing fee or service charge,adopted by a local agency shall be commenced within days of the effective date of the ordinance,resolution,or motion.b any action under this section shall be brought as a validation action under code of civil procedure section.c this section shall apply only to fees,capacity charges,and service charges described in and subject to sections and.italics added.
the court of appeal reversed,finding section inapplicable.among other things,the court of appeal characterized the action as one challenging an adjudicative decision to impose a fee on a particular water user in a particular case,not a legislative decision to set fees at a certain level for an entire class of water users.therefore,the court of appeal reasoned,the action was not one challenging an ordinance,resolution,or motion,and section did not apply.the court of appeal also focused on the express limitation in section to fees and charges described in and subject to sections and,subd.c.the court concluded the charges ucm sought to recoup were not described in these sections.in reaching these conclusions,the court of appeal expressly rejected the reasoning of utility cost management east bay municipal utility district th,d.
we granted indian wells petition for review and now reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
discussion 
in order to understand fully the issues before the court,we must start with our opinion in san marcos water dist.san marcos unified school dist.cal d,san marcos i,because that decision gave rise to the key statutes on which ucm relies.in san marcos i,we considered whether certain public utility fees constituted special assessments from which public entities are exempt in the absence of a positive legislative authority permitting the assessment.san marcos i,at,quoting inglewood county of los angeles cal,inglewood.we concluded that a utility fee or charge constitutes a special assessment,rather than,for example,a user charge,if its purpose is to defray the cost of a capital improvement that directly benefits the property being assessed.san marcos i,at.applying that standard,we found the public utility fees at issue in that case to be special assessments.id.at.we also found no legislative authority for imposing the assessments on public entities id.at,but we remanded to the court of appeal to determine whether a refund was appropriate.id.at.
on remand,the court of appeal held that the statute of limitations,which then was codified as section but which now appears in section,applied and barred recovery.san marcos ii,supra,d at.the court reasoned that the legislature enacted the relatively short limitations period to give local agencies certainty with respect to the enforceability of their fee resolutions and ordinances and to avoid putting an agency in the position of reimbursing funds that have long since been expended.id.at.
in response to our decision in san marcos i,the legislature adopted the san marcos legislation,providing the authorization for special assessments that we found lacking in that case.stats,ch.section authorizes public utilities to impose a capital facilities fee on public entities except as provided in section,and section defines a capital facilities fee as any nondiscriminatory charge to pay the capital cost of a public utility facility.section enumerates restrictions applicable when a public utility imposes the fees on either a state agency or an educational entity such as kern.in these circumstances,the fee must be necessary to defray the actual construction costs of that portion of a public utility facility actually serving the agency or educational entity,subd.a,italics added.moreover,the fee may not be imposed at all if successfully protested or challenged pursuant to law prior to january,and when it may be imposed,it may not exceed the amount charged prior to our decision in san marcos i july,as adjusted for inflation unless the parties agree to a higher fee,subds.a,b.in addition,upon request or in the event of an increase in the fee,the public utility must identify the amount of the capital facilities fee and has the burden of producing evidence to establish the propriety of the fee,subd.c.
though there was no legislative authority for imposing capital facilities fees on public entities prior to the san marcos legislation,section strictly limits refund actions for recouping fees paid prior to the effective date of the legislation,which was march.these restrictions were presumably adopted because of legislative concern for the fiscal stability and service capabilities of public utility service agencies which have in good faith collected and spent these fees.under section,fees paid before our decision in san marcos i july,are not subject to refund at all,unless protested or challenged pursuant to law on or before january,and fees paid after our decision but before the effective date of the legislation are subject to refund only if they exceeded amounts permissible under section.thus,the legislature expressly intended the authorizations and restrictions set forth in the san marcos legislation to have a retroactive effect.
the san marcos legislation does not expressly state what statute of limitations applies to refund actions.indian wells argues that the trial court was correct to apply the statute of limitations found in section,noting that the court in san marcos ii,supra,d,had applied that provision to a refund action prior to the san marcos legislation and the legislature had implicitly ratified that decision by not stating a different limitations period.the limitations period is particularly restrictive not only because it is relatively short,but also because it runs from the effective date of any ordinance,resolution,or motion imposing fees,not from the date the fee is actually charged to the customer.therefore,application of this provision would require state agencies and educational entities to keep close watch on public utilities at the time they adopt their rate ordinances and to bring prompt challenges,perhaps without a final determination that the fee is excessive or that the agency or educational entity is even subject to the fee.
on the other hand,ucm stresses that the right to impose capital facilities fees was created by the san marcos legislation,and therefore,ucm argues,a refund action for recouping excessive fees is an action upon a liability created by statute to which the statute of limitations found in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a applies.ucm asserts in the alternative that the catchall statute of limitations found in code of civil procedure section applies.obviously,either of these longer limitations periods would significantly increase the liability of public utilities for improperly imposed fees,and their application would mean the trial court in this case erred in sustaining indian wells demurrer to the third amended complaint.
section is part of the mitigation fee act stats,ch,which,like the san marcos legislation,places various limits on the fees and charges that local agencies including utility districts can impose on persons or property holders.most of the mitigation fee act concerns itself with development fees that is,fees imposed on development projects in order to finance public improvements or programs that bear a reasonable relationship to the development at issue.see.nevertheless,the mitigation fee act also addresses itself to some fees or charges that do not necessarily relate to a development project.for example,section places limits on fees for water connections or sewer connections,or capacity charges,subd.a,italics added.connection fees might well apply to development projects,but a capacity charge is simply a charge for facilities existing or to be constructed that are of benefit to the person or property being charged,subd.b,and therefore might apply regardless of whether a development project is at issue.a capacity charge might,for example,include a charge to all property holders in an area not just development projects to pay off bonds issued to construct a water pipeline serving the area.
with this background,we can begin to unravel the issue presented here.at the outset,we note that the plain meaning of section supports its application to ucm claims.as noted,section refers to a ny judicial action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul an ordinance,resolution,or motion adopting a new fee or service charge,or modifying or amending an existing fee or service charge,adopted by a local agency,subd.a.the use of the word any and the inclusion of several disjunctives to link essentially synonymous words all serve to broaden the applicability of the provision.moreover,when the legislature first adopted the san marcos legislation,the text of section was codified as section,which was part of chapter of title,division,part of the government code,entitled limitation of actions to review local agency fees and charges.stats,ch.this chapter title suggests the legislature intended former section now section to apply to refund actions like this one,because this litigation is clearly an action to review local agency fees.finally,it bears some significance that the legislature adopted the san marcos legislation as the very next chapter in the same part of the government code as these limitations provisions.stats,ch.
moreover,prior to enactment of the san marcos legislation,the court of appeal had already found the statute of limitations applicable to refund actions analogous to this one.san marcos ii,supra,d.the san marcos legislation is therefore notable for its failure to designate a different statute of limitations.in addition,after the court of appeal decided san marcos ii,the legislature repealed section,which contained the predecessor version of the statute of limitations,and reenacted the same provision,without change,as subdivision a of section.stats,ch.in so doing,the legislature implicitly ratified the court of appeal decision finding that statute applicable to refund actions such as this one.see,people ledesma cal th,d,people bouzas cal d.
ucm argues,however,that section is inapplicable by its terms because the fees ucm seeks to recoup are not described in and subject to section or,subd.c.we disagree.the fees at issue here,to be recoverable at all,necessarily constitute special assessments in excess of what the san marcos legislation permits san marcos i,supra,cal d at,see also inglewood,supra,cal.at,and according to the definition we enunciated in san marcos i,a fee constitutes a special assessment only if its purpose is to defray the cost of capital improvements that directly benefit the property.san marcos i,at,see also id.at.this description places these fees directly within the definition of capacity charges that are subject to section.section defines c apacity charges as charges for facilities existing or to be constructed that are of benefit to the person or property being charged,subd.b,and there can be no doubt that the term facilities in this context includes the sort of capital improvements to which we were referring in san marcos indeed,the mitigation fee act,of which section is a part,expressly defines public facilities as including public improvements,public services and community amenities,subd.d,italics added.therefore,under the definition of special assessment we adopted in san marcos i,the fees ucm seeks to recoup are unquestionably described in and subject to section,subd.c.
ucm,however,repeatedly insists that the fees are subject to the san marcos legislation,not section.we agree that the fees at issue here are subject to the san marcos legislation,but we do not see why they can not also be subject to section,and ucm does not explain why.instead,ucm merely points out that its complaint does not allege a violation of section,a fact that we find irrelevant.significantly,the phrase subject to does not mean violative of or exceeding the limit set forth in,but merely governed by.see webster collegiate dict.we see no reason why a fee can not be subject to the restrictions stated in section,and not in breach of those restrictions.similarly,though section makes explicitly clear that it appl ies only to fees described in and subject to sections and,subd.c,it does not state or suggest that it applies only to refund actions predicated upon those sections.
ucm also notes that in,when the legislature repealed former section and reenacted the same language as part of section,it stated in an uncodified section of the bill that nothing in this bill shall alter the provisions of the san marcos legislation.stats,ch.the legislature apparently added this provision in response to a letter from the university of california,in which the university asked for an amendment stating that section does not apply to f ees described in the san marcos legislation.ucm concludes that the legislature adopted the university request,and therefore that section does not apply to fees like those at issue here that are subject to the san marcos legislation.
in making this argument,ucm attempts a little lawyerly sleight of hand,quietly interposing the university word apply for the legislature word alter,though all the time purporting to remain loyal to the statutory text.the exact nature of the university of california concern is unclear from the content of its short letter,but whatever that concern may have been,the legislature saw fit merely to say that section does not alter the san marcos legislation.stats,ch.we can infer,then,that section may,in at least some cases,apply to fees subject to the san marcos legislation,so long as it is not construed as altering that legislation.here,for example,the fees at issue are subject to both the san marcos legislation and section,but to the extent there is a conflict between the two statutory schemes,the san marcos legislation is controlling.
we conclude therefore that the fees ucm seeks to recoup are described in and subject to section,and therefore the restriction set forth in subdivision c of section is satisfied.
ucm also relies on a distinction the court drew in hill city of fresno th,d between adjudicative and legislative decisions.the mitigation fee act includes two provisions limiting the time within which actions may be brought one is section,which is at issue here,and the other is section.facially,these provisions overlap to a certain extent,and to resolve the conflict,the hill court concluded the statute of limitations in section applies to suits challenging legislative decisions,whereas the statute of limitations in section applies to suits challenging adjudicative dec
