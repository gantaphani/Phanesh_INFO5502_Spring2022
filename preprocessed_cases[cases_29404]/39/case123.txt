this case arises from a qui tam action brought by relators david wilson and james warren under the false claims act against kellogg brown root,kellogg brown root services,kbr,and services employees international,collectively kbr.relators allege that kbr fraudulently induced the united states into awarding it an army task order in connection with its work as a civilian contractor in iraq.they also allege several claims stemming from their termination by kbr.
since initiating this litigation,relators have consistently sought to shoehorn what is,in essence,a breach of contract action into a claim that is cognizable under the false claims act.this misguided journey must come to an end.if every dispute involving contractual performance were to be transformed into a qui tam fca suit,the prospect of litigation in government contracting would literally have no end.the district court properly recognized this danger,and we affirm its judgment.
this case concerns the contractual relationship between kbr and the united states government.in december,kbr entered into a logistics civil augmentation program logcap contract with the department of defense.the agreement called for kbr,acting as a civilian contractor,to provide operational support to the united states military in wartime situations.in exchange,kbr was to be reimbursed costs up to an maximum amount and paid a base fee of one percent of those costs.in addition,kbr could be awarded up to an additional two percent of costs based on performance assessments by the army and its logcap award fee evaluation board.
under the logcap contract,the military requested specific services or commodities through various task orders.in task order,the army called for kbr to provide transportational services in connection with the conflict in iraq.in particular,kbr was to transport fuel and other supplies from kuwait to iraq and between bases within iraq.task order was also accompanied by several statements of work sows that further detailed kbr responsibilities and obligations.kbr commenced performance under task order and its sows in february.
the logcap contract,task order,and the various sows contained several provisions that imposed general safety and maintenance requirements on kbr.for example,the logcap agreement stated that kbr will ensure the safety and health of personnel,equipment and supplies that the contractor has direct control over,within the area of operation.it also established that a ll contractor owned motor vehicles shall meet required vehicle requirements within the area of responsibility,shall be properly equipped and designed to ensure protection of government property,and shall be maintained in a safe operating condition and good appearance.
similarly,an sow dated july,applicable to task order from february,through december,kbr to provide the equipment,tools,parts and personnel needed for the maintenance and repair of the vehicles used to transport fuel and other supplies under the contract.a subsequent sow,dated december,applicable to task order from january,through december,many similar provisions,including the obligation to operate a vehicle maintenance facility in the theater of operation.
when ordering supplies or services through a task order,the military issues a dd form to be executed by the civilian contractor.a dd form is a standard document in which the contractor expressly accepts the terms and conditions of the numbered purchase order and agrees to perform the same.in the present case,such terms and conditions include the safety and maintenance provisions noted above.
although kbr started performing under task order in february,it did not execute a corresponding dd form until july.this dd form,however,was effective february,when kbr commenced performance.according to relators,kbr could not have been paid for its work in connection with task order until it signed the relevant dd form.
in,kbr hired david wilson and james warren to drive supply trucks in iraq.both wilson and warren employment contracts contained an arbitration clause in which each agreed to participate in the company dispute resolution program and arbitrate any and all claims that the employee might have against kbr related to one employment,including one termination.
during their time in iraq,wilson and warren drove a convoy route between base cedar ii,which is located south of baghdad,and base anaconda,which is north of baghdad.according to relators,kbr neglected to perform several routine maintenance procedures on the trucks in their convoy.for example,they allege that kbr failed to change the oil or replace the fuel filters and damaged windshields of the convoy trucks.although wilson and warren acknowledge that kbr operated maintenance depots at both military bases,they claim that the maintenance crews did little more than change a tire and a bit of electrical work.
based on their observations,wilson and warren complained to superiors about what they considered the lack of proper maintenance.in addition,after a series of thefts from the convoy trucks,they complained to kbr about inadequate security.
kbr terminated wilson on march,and warren three days later.wilson and warren claim they were discharged because of their complaints to management about the poor maintenance and security.
on may,wilson and warren filed suit against kbr under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act fca.see.in addition to their fca claims,relators also alleged several counts,including wrongful termination,quantum meruit,and retaliatory termination in violation of the fca.
after their initial set of fca claims were dismissed by the district court relators moved for leave to file a third amended complaint.in this proposed complaint,relators alleged that kbr fraudulently induced the united states into awarding it task order by knowingly misrepresenting that it would comply with the order maintenance requirements.the crux of relators claim is a dd form signed by kbr in july.according to relators,when kbr signed the dd form,and thereby accepted the task order subject to its terms and conditions,kbr knew it had not since february and would not fulfill the applicable maintenance and safety requirements under the contract.thus,relators posit,the completed form constituted a fraudulent representation by kbr to the united states in order to receive payment under task order.because such payments were contingent on kbr execution of the dd form,relators contend that kbr fraudulently induced the united states in violation of the fca.
after conducting a hearing,the district court denied the motion for leave to file an amended complaint,deeming it futile under foman davis,d.specifically,the district court held that the amended complaint failed to state a claim under.b since the dd form executed in july did not constitute a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct under harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir harrison i.instead,the court explained,relators allegations were at best a claim for breach of contract that the government has not asserted.in the alternative,the court held that relators had not pled fraud with sufficient particularity under.b.
with respect to the employment counts,kbr filed a motion to stay the claims on the ground they were subject to binding arbitration pursuant to relators employment contracts.the district court granted the motion,finding that relators and kbr had agreed to arbitrate such employment disputes and that the arbitration agreements were enforceable under either the federal arbitration act or texas state law.
the district court entered a final judgment on the fca and employment counts on april.relators presently appeal the district court denial of the motion for leave to file a third amended complaint and the district court decision to stay the employment counts pending arbitration.we address each issue in turn.
relators first contend that the district court erred when it denied their motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.as noted above,the complaint alleged that kbr fraudulently induced the united states into awarding it task order in violation of the fca.according to relators,kbr fraudulently represented in a dd form that it would comply with the contract maintenance requirements,all the while knowing it would not do so.we review the district court denial of the motion for an abuse of discretion.laber harvey,cir en banc citing foman,at.
under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,a court should freely give leave to amend when justice so requires.a.although such motions should be granted liberally,a district court may deny leave if amending the complaint would be is,if the proposed amended complaint fails to satisfy the requirements of the federal rules.united states ex rel.fowler caremark rx,llc,cir laber,at.
because relators proposed amended complaint does not properly state a claim under rule b and lacks sufficient particularity under rule b,we find the district court correctly determined that further amendment would be futile.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.
the false claims act imposes civil liability on any person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to the united states government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval or knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government.a.as we explained in harrison i,the term false or fraudulent claim includes those instances when the contract or extension of government benefit was obtained originally through false statements or fraudulent conduct.harrison i,at.that is,the fraud may have been in the inducement.id.
in order to prove a fraudulent inducement claim,a plaintiff must demonstrate that there was a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct made or carried out with the requisite scienter that was material and that caused the government to pay out money or to forfeit moneys due,that involved a claim.id.at.for the reasons discussed below,relators fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under the fca,see.b,and instead allege a breach of contract action that only the government may bring.
the first deficiency in relators fraudulent inducement claim is that the dd form signed by kbr in july was not a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct for the purposes of the fca.as noted above,a dd form is a document that accompanies a corresponding task order and through which the civilian contractor accepts the order subject to all its terms and conditions,including the safety and maintenance provisions discussed above.
to satisfy this first element of an fca claim,the statement or conduct alleged must represent an objective falsehood.see united states ex rel.lamers city of green bay,cir see also united states ex rel.drc,custer battles,llc,d,it is that the fca requires proof of an objective falsehood.as a result,mere allegations of poor and inefficient management of contractual duties are not actionable under the fca.see harrison i,at.likewise,imprecise statements or differences in interpretation growing out of a disputed legal question are similarly not false under the fca.lamers,at see also hagood sonoma county water agency,cir.
relators contend that the completed dd form constitutes a false statement because kbr agreed to the maintenance conditions in the contract even though it knew it would not,and later did not,abide by those terms.however,this assertion rests not on an objective falsehood,as required by the fca,but rather on relators subjective interpretation of kbr contractual duties.given the imprecise nature of the general maintenance provisions at issue here,it is not exactly clear what would qualify as adequate or inadequate maintenance under task order.moreover,although relators posit that kbr did not properly perform under task order,the united states actual party to the not expressed dissatisfaction with kbr performance in the form of a breach of contract action.consequently,the question of whether kbr performed sufficient maintenance under the contract represents,at the very least,a disputed legal question about the inefficient management of one contractual duties.this is precisely the sort of claim that courts have determined not to be a false statement under the fca.see hagood,at harrison i,at.
the allegations in relators third amended complaint thus stand in contrast to the sort of false statements we found actionable in harrison i.in that case,the fca relator claimed that the defendant made several objectively misleading statements in an attempt to fraudulently induce the government to award it a department of energy contract.for example,the defendant allegedly represented that a particular project would take no more than years to complete,even though it knew it would take significantly longer.harrison i,at.similarly,the defendant purposefully underestimated specific overhead costs when submitting a bid,a practice commonly known as.id.at.we found that such representations,if indeed untrue,constituted false statements under the fca.id.at.
unlike the statements in harrison i,the representations at issue here do not include objective falsehoods.relators do not claim that the maintenance provisions in the contract set forth anything resembling a specific maintenance program for the convoy trucks.likewise,they make no contention that representations were made concerning specific acts of maintenance that kbr knew it lacked the capacity to perform.instead,kbr alleged defalcations involve several general and relatively vague maintenance provisions,such as keeping vehicles in a safe operating condition and good appearance.these sorts of claims do not qualify as objective falsehoods and thus do not constitute false statements under the fca.harrison i makes clear that fraud may only be found in expressions of fact which admit of being adjudged true or false in a way that admit of empirical verification.id.at internal quotations omitted.
while the phrase false or fraudulent claim in the false claims act should be construed broadly,id.at,it just as surely can not be construed to include a breach of contract action that is devoid of any objective falsehood.an fca relator can not base a fraud claim on nothing more than his own interpretation of an imprecise contractual provision.to hold otherwise would render meaningless the fundamental distinction between actions for fraud and breach of contract.see strum exxon,cir.this we refuse to do.
in addition to the dd form not constituting a false statement under the fca,relators fraudulent inducement claim suffers from a second flaw the completed form was not material.under the fca,a statement or course of conduct is material if it has a natural tendency to influence agency action or is capable of influencing agency action.united states ex rel.berge bd.of trs.of the of,cir internal quotations omitted harrison i,at quoting berge.because fraudulent inducement claims are concerned with whether the contract or extension of government benefit was obtained originally through false statements or fraudulent conduct,harrison i,at emphasis added,the form materiality depends on whether it could have influenced the government decision to award task order to kbr.since relators allege no facts suggesting that it did,they likewise fail to satisfy this element of a proper fraudulent inducement claim.
the main hurdle confronting relators is the timing and sequence of the relevant events.it is undisputed that kbr started performing under task order in february.however,the dd form at issue here was not signed until july,than five months after kbr started performing under the task order.therefore,relators do not,and could not,allege that the executed dd form influenced the department of defense decision to initially award task order to kbr.it would be dubious at best to suggest that kbr originally obtained the task order by executing a form five months after it began performance.
relators instead contend that the dd form was material because kbr could not have been paid for its work under task order without completing the acceptance form.however,this does not suffice.even if kbr could not have been paid witho
