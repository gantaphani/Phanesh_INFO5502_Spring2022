this case presents the latest twist in the relationship between the city of cincinnati and professional football,a relationship that spans years and at least stadiums,the third of which is the subject of this controversy.the hamilton county board of commissioners sued the cincinnati bengals,the national football league and its other that they violated the federal antitrust laws by using a monopoly over professional football to obtain a heavily subsidized lease for the bengals newly built,stadium at the expense of hamilton county and its taxpayers.
the district court concluded that the statute of limitations bars the claim.because hamilton county filed this lawsuit after the limitations period had run,because the county has failed to demonstrate that the limitations period should be tolled due to the defendants allegedly fraudulent concealment of material information regarding the antitrust claim and because the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the county civil rule f motion for additional discovery,we affirm.
long before ickey woods shuffled across the end zone,long before kenny anderson and boomer esiason led the bengals to super bowls xvi and xxiii a team from another circuit,the san francisco,won both games,football fans along the ohio river cheered for the cincinnati celts.started in as a member of the nascent american professional football association,the city first professional football team finished with a record that year,its one and only season in the queen city.see cincinnati pro football history,available at last visited june.whether for want of a stadium or not,the cincinnati celts played all four of their games that season on the road.so far as professional football was concerned,that was it for years.
what began as the american professional football association in became the national football league in.in,the nfl brought a new team to town.named the cincinnati reds,this football team lasted two seasons before folding.id.four years later,a rival league,the american football league afl,gave cincinnati its first bengals team,which played in the league for one season,then played as an independent team for a season after the afl folded.id.the afl emerged anew in,and the bengals played in the league for a season before the afl folded anew.id.after the afl experienced yet another rebirth,the bengals played for two additional seasons.but when world war ii forced the afl to fold in,so too did the another years.id.
in,paul brown,the founder and first head coach of the cleveland browns,brought modern professional football to cincinnati through an franchise.although suggestions for team names came pouring in one was the cincinnati buckeyes,brown opted to use the bengals because it provided a link with past professional football in cincinnati.id.the team played its first season in,became a member of the nfl when the two leagues merged in and has been playing in cincinnati ever since.
the bengals have played in three different home stadiums.true fans do not speak of football stadia.from to,the team played at nippert stadium,where the largest crowd on record totaled fans.see bengals stadium firsts lasts,available at.com team history stadium firsts.asp last visited june.the bengals played their first game at riverfront stadium later renamed cinergy field on august,a stadium it shared with baseball cincinnati reds,and their last game there on december.the biggest came during an october between the bengals and their rivals,the cleveland browns.id.
on august,the bengals opened their first season at paul brown stadium,which sits along the northern side of the ohio river in hamilton county which includes cincinnati,covers acres,stands feet tall,features seats and presumably has ample luxury box seats.see paul brown stadium,available at stadium.asp last visited june.the team finished its first season in the new stadium with a losing record,but it is hamilton county that claims it was the real loser because it signed a lease with the bengals for the stadium that it now calls unconscionable.second amended complaint.
to understand this charge and the climate in which it was made,we need to backpedal a few steps.after the nfl awarded expansion teams to charlotte and jacksonville in,the three cities that failed to obtain a team baltimore,memphis and louis tried to lure existing teams from their existing cities.several bengals among on this environment,threatening to leave their host cities unless they obtained a new stadium.
claiming that his team could not remain competitive without a new stadium because riverfront stadium has virtually no luxury seating and the league smallest seating capacity,ja,bengals owner mike brown the son of paul brown threatened to move the team if cincinnati or hamilton county would not build a new stadium.at an owners meeting in,brown announced that cincinnati had breached its lease agreement when it was late by one week in paying in concession receipts.according to brown,this breach entitled the bengals to relocate to a different city.
at an owners meeting the following month,brown declared that if the city failed to provide the team with a new stadium,the bengals would consider moving to los angeles.brown later visited baltimore,which offered to build the team a million stadium with a practice facility and a pledge of million in income.
on june,brown gave cincinnati what amounted to an ultimatum if the city did not agree to a new stadium deal within five days,the bengals would start negotiating with baltimore.cincinnati city council and the hamilton county commissioners relented,opting to fund the new stadium with a proposed county increase.in march,the referendum passed with support.
during negotiations over the new stadium lease,the county retained two national experts in developing and leasing stadiums.as negotiations proceeded,it became clear to the county that the bengals goal was to acquire sufficient revenue under the new lease to move the team from the last quartile of nfl teams in revenue to the second quartile.county officials asked to see the bengals financial records during the negotiations but the team refused,explaining that the disclosure of this information would violate league policy.the parties executed a lease for the new stadium in may.
four years later,in may,the los angeles times published an article disclosing the revenues and profits of nfl teams,which it had obtained from the record in a lawsuit between the nfl and the owner of the oakland raiders.the data showed that the bengals ranked eighth in profits in and ninth in out of teams.
on may,six years after the parties signed the stadium lease,hamilton county commissioner todd portune a former cincinnati city council member,though not a hamilton county commissioner at the time the parties executed the lease,filed this lawsuit in federal district court against the nfl,the bengals and the other nfl teams.the hamilton county board of commissioners eventually was substituted as the plaintiff in the case.
the second amended complaint alleges that the defendants violated of the sherman act,see,by engaging in a contract,combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade,precluding hamilton county and others who sell or lease stadiums from being able to obtain competitive prices for their products and services.second amended complaint.it also alleges that the defendants violated of the sherman act,see,because their monopoly power in the professional football market allowed them to foreclose competition and gain a competitive advantage in the nfl stadia market.second amended complaint.it also alleges that the bengals and the nfl continuously misstated and concealed their financial position from until the present day,making affirmatively fraudulent or misleading statements regarding the bengals financial position that would necessitate moving the team to another locale.second amended complaint.as relief,hamilton county asked the district court to void the stadium lease,to award it in excess of million in compensatory and punitive damages and to treble the award.see a.
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,arguing that the statute of limitations had run on the claims.in ruling on the motion,the district court determined that any injury hamilton county suffered occurred when the lease was executed in may.op.at,that the execution of the lease triggered the start of the period and that the plaintiff filed suit two years after the limitations period had expired.it nonetheless denied the motion,reasoning that hamilton county should be permitted discovery to support its theory that the limitations period should be tolled.
for the next two years or so,discovery proceeded in fits and starts and was suspended for a time while the parties tried to mediate their dispute.after the mediation effort failed and after the parties had conducted initial discovery,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on the issue,denied the county rule f motion for additional discovery and dismissed the case.
by statute,antitrust claimants have four years from the date an action accrues to bring a lawsuit.see zenith radio hazeltine research,d.accrual occurs when a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiff business.zenith radio,at.no one disputes the source of the injury in this case the stadium lease no one disputes when the injury occurred when the parties signed the lease in may and no one disputes that the county filed the lawsuit more than four years after may it filed the lawsuit in may.what the parties dispute is whether the limitations period should be extended because,according to the county,the bengals fraudulently concealed information material to its antitrust claims during and after the lease negotiations.
to toll a limitations period on this basis,a plaintiff must show wrongful concealment of their actions by the defendants failure of the plaintiff to discover the operative facts that are the basis of his cause of action within the limitations period and plaintiff due diligence until discovery of the facts.dayco goodyear tire rubber,cir see also pinney dock transp.penn cent,cir.the county can not satisfy this test because it knew the operative facts that are the basis of its cause of action within the limitations period.dayco,at.before,during and immediately after the negotiations over the may stadium lease,the county well understood the material facts underlying its antitrust claim evidence of the nfl potential monopoly power and its use of that power to extort in the words of the county stadium leases from host cities.
first,these same allegations were the subject of a highly publicized and ultimately unsuccessful antitrust lawsuit filed by the louis convention and visitors commission against the rams two years before the execution of this lease.see louis convention visitors comm football league,cir affirming district court grant of judgment as a matter of law for the nfl on a lawsuit brought on december.county officials knew about this litigation.see,ja county negotiator peter bynoe acknowledging he was aware of the rams litigation ja county financial advisor and negotiator mitchell zeits acknowledging he knew about the rams litigation and discussed it with county officials.
second,county officials recognized and in at least one case embraced the characterization of the nfl stadium negotiation tactics as extortionary.see,ja minutes from county commissioners meeting on november,during which commissioner john dowlin stated that he spoke with the mayors of baltimore and chicago and that both mayors used the word extortion in connection with nfl teams tactics for obtaining better deal s in their host cities ja minutes from county commissioners meeting on january,reflecting that commissioner dowlin called for somebody to stand up against the extortion of ball team owners.
third,before becoming a hamilton county commissioner,city councilman todd portune two pertinent motions on the issue.in one,portune the original plaintiff in this case urged the city to join cleveland in a lawsuit geared toward stopping the browns from leaving cleveland.see ja motion stating that c ities are being held up by the professional leagues and team owners acting in a conspiracy to exploit the taxpayers of cincinnati and other member cities.in the other,portune urged the cincinnati city council to take national leadership in forming a league of cities and counties to provide unity in defending against the professional sports team blackmailers who threaten moving their teams unless they paid ransom in the form of billions of taxpayer funds for stadia.ja.portune discussed the motions publicly and told county officials about them.see ja deposition of portune during which he was asked if he discussed the motions publicly,to which he replied,i sure we did.another city councilman asked the city solicitor to provide a report declaring that the nfl is a cartel,a rival league can not obtain franchises,and a s a result of the monopoly owners can extract enormous subsidies from taxpayers.some call it extortion.ja.
fourth,county officials knew that congress had been contemplating legislation addressing antitrust issues in professional sports.see ja bynoe testifying he was aware that congress was conducting hearings on franchise relocation issues in professional sports and that he was aware that some of the proposed legislation focused on antitrust related issues ja letter to county commissioner bob bedinghaus and county administrator david krings accompanying a copy of a congressional research service report entitled bonds and the economics of professional sports stadiums ja commissioner bedinghaus letter in response,deeming the report very informative and stating he will keep it in mind as the county move s forward with stadium financing.
fifth,newspapers across the nation carried articles reporting on and editorials decrying the nfl monopolistic behavior.see,ja baltimore sun article dated october,ja usa today article dated october,ja cleveland plain dealer editorial entitled break nfl stranglehold,which was dated november,and which sparked the cincinnati city councilman to seek the report from the city solicitor declaring the nfl a cartel.portune maintained a file of such articles and other documents,which he introduced into the official city council record.ja portune testifying in deposition that he took it upon himself to introduce things that were relevant so that there was a record of the materials that had been received.
all of this shows that the county in may had ample information to file a complaint that the nfl had a corner on the professional football market and used the cartel to extort stadium leases.and all of this suggests that the county knew the material facts underlying its antitrust claims long before the limitations period had run,precluding it from relying on the doctrine to save this lawsuit.
the county to its credit does not disclaim knowledge of these facts.it instead denies that these are the operative at least all of the operative its claim.what remained unknown was financial information about the bengals profitability,which the defendants refused to disclose during the lease negotiations.br.at.as the county sees it,the bengals painted a misleadingly bleak picture of their financial health,leading the county to believe that the team was suffering serious financial woes and could not survive without a new stadium as it turns out,the bengals ranked in the top half of the nfl in profitability and thus did not need a new stadium with a favorable lease at all.br.at.the county maintains that it did not learn about the bengals profitability until may the los angeles times released information about the finances of all of the nfl teams.without this information,it submits,it could not allege a cognizable antitrust injury and,without the existence of an antitrust injury,the claim would fail at the pleading stage.
even if we could conceive of causes of action in which profitability might be an essential piece of information necessary to plead antitrust injury,this antitrust claim is not one of them.to plead antitrust injury,the claimant must allege that it was injured and that the injury was attributable to conduct by the defendant.atl.richfield usa petrol
