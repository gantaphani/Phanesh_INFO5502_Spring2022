plaintiff experimental holdings,ehi appeals the district court dismissal of its disappointed bidder claim and its state law claim alleging violations of kentucky law covering the award of public contracts.because the procedural requirements of kentucky lease procurement law do not afford ehi a property interest in getting the state to lease ehi real property,the district court properly dismissed ehi claim.it was also proper for the district court to dismiss ehi state law claims,but on grounds different from those given by the district court.
the division of probation and parole for kentucky department of corrections doc needed to lease a new place to house its kenton county office and requested that bids be solicited so that an adequate property could be located.as required by kentucky law,the division of real properties dorp was responsible for conducting the search for a space and for handling the bidding process.this initial search,conducted in,was limited to property in kenton county.however,dorp failed to receive any suitable bids.in july,doc submitted a revised space request.this time,doc requested a smaller space than initially requested.once again,dorp invited property owners to submit offers for the lease contract.some time later,according to jerry briscoe,a property management program analyst for dorp,the project was declared an emergency after the past advertising attempts had failed to yield acceptable bids.
after locating property owned by egc construction corporation egc,located at west street in nearby newport in campbell county,kentucky,dorp expanded the search area to encompass areas outside kenton county.following this expansion,dorp identified two additional properties that met the doc specifications ehi property located at monmouth street in newport in campbell county,and properties property located at ewing boulevard in florence in boone county.
on or around march,dorp conducted site evaluations of the three properties and determined that egc floor plan failed to meet the doc square footage requirements.dorp therefore eliminated egc from further consideration.ehi alleges that,in response to this action,doc commissioner john with the decision to eliminate briscoe and requested that egc be made eligible again.as a result,briscoe informed egc that half of the first floor area would have to be redrawn egc later informed dorp that it altered its floor plan in order to comply with this request.on march,dorp invited the three,ehi,and submit best and final offers for the lease contract,in accordance with certain specifications.this solicitation stated that the lease proposal form best and final proposal should be submitted in its entirety.
the bids were opened on april.when opened,ehi bid was annually per square foot for square feet.egc bid was annually plus of common expenses for square feet.properties came in at annually per square foot for square feet egc had failed to comply with the strictures of the bidding process because it provided for an annual cost of plus of expenses,rather than the total set cost.
on april,briscoe called egc representative,shad sletto,to inform him of this shortcoming.sletto asked for the square footage and prices of the other bids and briscoe gave this information to sletto.later that day,egc sent briscoe a fax,informing him that doc share of the expenses would amount to per year,bringing egc total bid to,or per square foot for square feet.thus,egc foot was less than ehi bid.the inference that ehi makes is that,by having access to all of the relevant information,egc was able to tailor its bid to undercut by a small amount ehi bid,which in other relevant respects was comparable to egc bid.
ehi alleges that it was called by briscoe and informed that egc needed to clarify its bid.however,when ehi requested details of the other bids just as egc had done,briscoe expressly declined to provide this information,claiming that it would be inappropriate and impermissible under the rules applicable to competitive bidding to share such information.
according to ehi,egc was then informed of another problem with its had failed to include enough square footage.thus,egc was permitted to increase its best and final offer from to square feet.egc was also permitted to lower its foot to about,resulting in about the same total annual lease cost as egc prior bid.ehi alleges that egc was lowered in order to keep costs below ehi.
the award of the contract to egc was finalized on june,on june,ehi filed a protest pursuant to krs.in its protest,ehi claimed,inter alia,that the contract was not the best value for the commonwealth of kentucky.in addition,ehi protest included a request to alter part of its inaccurate and inflated realtor fee.on june,defendant john farris,the secretary of the finance and administrative cabinet,sent ehi a determination of protest letter denying ehi protest and its request to alter its bid.farris explained that the process was conducted as an emergency procurement,and thus was governed by different provisions of kentucky law than those governing general bid solicitations of this kind.with this in mind,farris rejected ehi claim that its bid would result in savings for kentucky taxpayers,reasoning that ehi argument relied upon the provisions that were not applicable to emergency situations.however,in rejecting ehi request to lower its bid due to the inaccurate realtor fee,farris explained that a provision of the statute that farris had previously said did not govern the bidding process precluded ehi from changing its bid.in other words,farris denied ehi protest by applying provisions that he had said did not apply.
on july,ehi brought its first complaint against the defendants in their official capacities.this initial complaint alleged two counts a deprivation of property without due process,brought under,and a violation of krs,the state statute governing the procurement process.
on july,defendants moved to dismiss ehi complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.specifically,defendants claimed that ehi did not possess a constitutionally protected property interest,and that the bidding process was governed by krs,which covers emergency procurements,and not.defendants also claimed that the suit was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.
on august,ehi filed an amended complaint.in the amended complaint,ehi claim remained largely the same as it was in the initial complaint,with the addition of claims against the defendants.however,ehi altered its state law claim to allege a violation of krs et,the entire section of the kentucky revised statutes that provides the rules governing public contracts for the lease of real property.ehi claimed that defendants conduct was in violation of kentucky law because it was intentionally negligently misleading fraudulent,and also,that such conduct was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to applicable kentucky law.
on august,defendants filed another motion to dismiss,relying on substantially the same reasoning as in their previous motion to dismiss.in response to ehi addition of a claim for damages against the defendants in their individual capacities,defendants raised the defense of qualified immunity.
on october,the district court issued its opinion and order,in which it granted defendants motion to dismiss.first,the district court rejected ehi claim,explaining that defendants had not procured the lease according to the normal operations laid out in krs.rather,defendants had procured the lease pursuant to,an emergency provision that grants state officials broad discretion when choosing a lease contract.in response to ehi contention that the factual issue of whether an emergency existed could not be disposed of on a b motion,the district court explained that exhibits that ehi attached to its amended complaint,in which state employees described the procurement as an emergency procurement,demonstrated that defendants were operating pursuant to the emergency provision after establishing that defendants were acting pursuant to emergency procedures,the district court explained that those
