call henry,appeals from a court of federal claims cofc decision dismissing its breach of contract claim against the united states government.the cofc correctly determined that call henry failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted,because the government has no contractual obligation to reimburse call henry pension withdrawal liability costs that were incurred pursuant to the pension plan amendment act of,et.we therefore affirm.
background 
on april,call henry entered into a contract with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa to provide inspection,maintenance,and testing services.this was a,contract with a base performance period of three years and up to seven option periods.call henry contract was subject to the service contract act of sca,et,and its regulations.
a.the service contract act 
as relevant here,the sca requires that a service contract include provisions specifying the contract wage determination,which sets the wage rates and fringe benefits that must be paid to various classes of covered service employees.covered service employees are entitled to a wage determination providing wages and fringe benefits equal to or greater than the minimum wage provided pursuant to the fair labor standards act flsa,the prevailing rates provided in the locality where the services are performed,as determined by the department of labor dol or the rates contained in the predecessor contract collective bargaining agreement,see also lear siegler,rumsfeld,fed.cir.
among other things,the sca insures that service employees who were protected by a collective bargaining agreement with one contractor are not deprived of the wages and benefits negotiated in that collective bargaining agreement when the contract they work on is awarded to a new contractor.otherwise,if an incumbent contractor agreed to a collective bargaining agreement that provided for wages and benefits greater than the prevailing wage rate,a challenger could the incumbent for the contract by providing its employees with lower wages and less valuable benefits.by requiring a successor contractor to provide wages and fringe benefits of equal or greater value than the predecessor contractor,the government protects covered service employees from losing the protection of their collective bargaining agreements.the government also protects itself from successor contractors who might introduce performance risk in the form of underpaid or labor.
these requirements are reflected in federal regulation far clause entitled service contract labor standards,which is incorporated by reference into call henry nasa contract 
service contract act of,as amended may.
c compensation.
each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the of labor,or authorized representative,as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract.
f successor contracts.if this contract succeeds a contract subject to the act under which the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement,in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits,neither the contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract,less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement,to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract,including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement.
b.the service contract act price adjustment clause 
one of the principal policy implications of the sca is that the government,as a customer,is willing to pay a premium for services in return for its contractor obligation to compensate service employees adequately and fairly.accordingly,the government is willing to increase contract price when contractors incur increased costs as a result of complying with an increase in the wage determination applicable to their contract.in effect,the contractor is entitled to a price adjustment to reflect increased labor costs associated with complying with an increase in the flsa minimum wage rate,dol prevailing wage rate,or the predecessor contract collective bargaining agreement.the mechanism for providing that price increase is the sca price adjustment clause.
for and option contracts,such as the one at issue in this case,the applicable sca price adjustment clause is far paragraph d of that clause provides a framework for increasing the unit labor rates in a service contract when certain events occur that increase the costs of complying with an increased wage determination.paragraph d acknowledges cost increases due to an increase in the flsa minimum wage or dol prevailing wage rate.it also recognizes cost increases that occur by operation of law,such as when a successor contract is bound by the wages and benefits provided in a predecessor contractor collective bargaining agreement 
fair labor standards act and service contract act price adjustment multiple year and option contracts may.
d the contract price or contract unit price labor rates will be adjusted to reflect the contractor actual increase or decrease in applicable wages and fringe benefits to the extent that the increase is made to comply with or the decrease is made by the contractor as a result of 
the department of labor wage determination applicable on the anniversary date of the multiple year contract,or at the beginning of the renewal option period 
an increased or decreased wage determination otherwise applied to the contract by operation of law or 
an amendment to the fair labor standards act of that is enacted award of this contract,affects the minimum wage,and becomes applicable to this contract under law.
call henry successor contracts,collective agreements,pension withdrawal,and mppaa withdrawal liability 
the base performance period of call henry contract with nasa was a successor contract.by operation of law,the wage determination applicable to the base performance period was provided by the predecessor contractor collective bargaining agreement.under the predecessor contract,call henry service employees were members of the international brotherhood of teamsters local union the teamsters.instead of providing wages and benefits through an alternative,call henry chose to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters.the first such agreement was effective from to teamsters agreement,and it required call henry to join and contribute to the teamsters pension plan.
the teamsters pension plan is a pension plan,which is subject to the pension plan amendment act mppaa.among other things,the mppaa protects employees receiving benefits under a pension plan by requiring any employer who withdraws from the plan to pay withdrawal liability to the pension fund.this withdrawal liability is paid by the withdrawing employer in order to fund its share of the pension plan obligations incurred during its association with the plan.connolly pension benefit guar,b the withdrawal liability of an employer to a plan is the amount determined to be the allocable amount of unfunded vested benefits.
in,nasa executed the first option period.that option contract was a successor contract to the base performance period.see b see also lear,at.therefore,by operation of law,the teamsters agreement provided the wage determination applicable to the first option period.
it is critical to distinguish between call henry obligations to its service employees pursuant to the teamsters agreement,call henry contractual obligations to nasa,and call henry statutory obligations under the mppaa to the teamsters pension plan.call henry was bound by the
