plaintiff appellant,traylor brothers,traylor,appeals from the district court final judgment and order denying traylor additional compensation for alleged extra work performed pursuant to a construction contract between traylor and defendant appellee,the board of commissioners of the port of new orleans port.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm.
facts and procedural background 
on april,the port announced the nashville avenue terminal complex wharf and shed c project project and solicited bids nationwide.the work involved driving piles both in the mississippi river and on land,laying a concrete deck on top of the piles,and building a large terminal shed on top of the deck with railroad tracks and a large truck loading area.drainage and ancillary services for plumbing,electricity,portable water,and fire protection were also required.the port provided a set of contract documents bid package for all prospective bidders,which included the plans and specifications for the project.the documents also advised the bidders that there were unknown infrastructures at the site and that there were numerous steel and timber piles removed to the approximate existing mudline in the area of the required dredging.the port agreed to compensate the contractor up to for removal,relocation,or for reconstruction of unknown infrastructures encountered during the construction phase which were not indicated or shown,or differs substantially from the contract document.the port defined unknown infrastructures as any objects encountered during the required work excluding objects and materials indicated on the contract drawings reasonably known by the contractor through a inspection of the site which conflict with new construction.emphasis added.for a more detailed map of the area,the bidders were referred to the port maps and archives room.the documents also provided that any costs incurred due to cutting off piles were to be the responsibility of the bidder.after visiting the construction site,traylor submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the contract construction was to begin on july,and was to be completed on january.if the project was not completed timely,the contract provided for liquidated damages in the amount of for each day of delay.
traylor subcontracted with james company tl to do the dredging work for the project.shortly after construction commenced,traylor began to encounter a significant amount of obstructions which traylor maintains were not evidenced in the plans and specifications for the job.it contends that these obstructions discovered during the dredging work performed by tl,and during traylor pile driving work,caused a ripple effect and set off delays,which impacted the entire project.traylor further alleges that prior to inviting bids,the port had information regarding these latent obstructions including blue prints,drawings,and overlays,which it failed to produce prior to accepting traylor bid.the largest problem encountered was the existence of a concrete slab in the middle of the dredge site.the port was informed of the slab on december,and on march,it was removed by an outside subcontractor.because of the delay in removing the obstruction,tl demobilized and left the site on march.however,tl later returned to the site and completed the dredging on september.the project was eventually finished in march of,over a year after the expected completion date.
tl brought suit against traylor and its surety aetna casualty and surety company aetna,traylor insurer,in state court seeking additional costs incurred due to the delay in dredging.as a result,traylor and aetna filed a third party demand against the port for any amounts traylor might owe to tl and for additional compensation due traylor for delay in construction.traylor then removed the case to federal court.before trial,tl settled and dismissed its claim against all parties.after tl filed its stipulation of dismissal,aetna dismissed its third party demand against the port and the port filed a against traylor for liquidated damages.the claims were heard by the district court without a jury.
at trial,traylor argued that the port knew that there were significant obstructions in the site area,but failed to advise traylor of the obstructions in its plans and specifications.traylor contended that it had no obligation to investigate or otherwise rely on information not set out in the plans and specifications provided by the port concerning possible obstructions.representatives of the port testified that if any obstructions are shown in the plans,or otherwise identified in the contract,the obstructions can not be considered unknown infrastructures,thus,the cost for removal and disposal would not be borne by the port.they further interpreted the contract to mean that even if an obstruction is not evidenced in the bid package,the obstruction is still not an unknown infrastructure if it could have reasonably been discovered by searching the port maps and archives room.
the district court awarded traylor plus interest and costs,finding that the port wrongfully assessed traylor with barge demurrage charges.however,the district court dismissed traylor claim for additional compensation and the port claim for liquidated damages.thereafter,traylor filed a motion for new trial,which was denied.however,the district court amended traylor award to include interest under louisiana law.traylor now appeals

discussion 
unjust enrichment 
under an unjust enrichment theory,traylor argues that it is entitled to compensation for extra work performed,which was necessary for the completion of the project.the contract defines extra work as work neither shown on the drawings nor reasonably implied elsewhere in the contract and for which no price had been named in the agreement.to establish a claim for unjust enrichment,the plaintiff must prove the defendant was enriched,the plaintiff was impoverished,a connection between the enrichment and resulting impoverishment,no justification exists for the enrichment and the impoverishment,and there is no other remedy at law.schiro del bianco,nsl,so d,citing minyard curtis products,so d.
traylor asserts that the port was unjustly enriched because it received a completed wharf structure traylor was impoverished because the port refused to compensate it for additional costs incurred due to cutting of concrete piles and there was no justification for the enrichment because the port had knowledge of certain obstructions,the port selected the piles and the length,and the port set the pile driving criteria.
the port maintains that traylor has not met its burden under this theory for several reasons.first,it argues that it has not been enriched,as it only received what it paid for under the contract a completed wharf structure.in addition,the port contends that even assuming arguendo that there was an enrichment,a claim for unjust enrichment was nullified by the contract.we agree.traylor has not met the first and second elements of an unjust enrichment claim.the port was not enriched it received what it bargained for under the contract,a wharf structure,and nothing more.in addition,since the contract provided a remedy for any additional costs incurred by traylor,it has failed to meet the fifth element,no remedy at law.morphy,makofsky masson,canal place,so d,action de in rem verso,a counterpart to unjust enrichment,is not available where there is an independent remedy at law,a contract exists.accordingly,we find that traylor is not entitled to additional compensation under this theory.
ii.adequate plans and specifications 
next,traylor argues that the plans and specifications provided by the port,prior to the submission of its bid,were insufficient in that they failed to give an accurate account of the conditions of the project site.because of the alleged inadequate contract documents,traylor asserts that it suffered substantial unforeseen costs,which should be borne by the port.the district court treated traylor claim as one for equitable adjustment due to changed conditions and delays.louisiana law has not yet established the elements necessary for the above cause of action.however,in analyzing the claim,the district court adopted the elements set out by the federal circuit court in stuyvesant dredging united states.under stuyvesant dredging,in order to recover for equitable adjustment,the conditions actually encountered in the field must have been reasonably unforeseeable based on all of the information available at the time of the bid.id.emphasis added.in addition,the contractor has to establish that it reasonably relied on the contract and related materials and that it suffered damages as the result of the material difference between the expected and encountered conditions.id.
duty to investigate 
the district court determined that the contract adequately advised traylor of possible unknown infrastructures on the site and referred traylor to the maps and archives room for detailed maps of the area.it also found that traylor had a duty to investigate the site and to review information concerning a prior structure on the project site,which was available at the port office,to ensure that the site conditions stated in the plans and specifications were accurate.finding that traylor failed to conduct an adequate investigation,the district court concluded that it was not entitled to damages.
the relevant provision contained in the bid package provides as follows 
the contractor is obligated to visit the site and study existing conditions.the board assumes no responsibility for the discrepancies or differences between existing conditions and conditions indicated on drawings or combination of original construction plans available for review at the board office and recent surveys conducted by the board.every reasonable effort has been made by the board to indicate and describe existing conditions at the project site with an acceptable degree of accuracy,but the contractor is held responsible for performing his work under existing conditions as he finds them at the time of performing work,and payment of extra work will not be allowed because of reasonable discrepancies or differences,which are encountered at the time work is performed.emphasis added.
the contract also advised that there were numerous steel and timber piles removed to the approximate existing mud line in the area of the required dredging and that the demolition of an existing structure on the project site would be accomplished prior to the expected commence date of the project.
traylor argues that the bid package itself did not sufficiently notify traylor of the kind,number,and size of the obstructions that it may encounter.it asserts that everything necessary for a bid must be provided in the bid package and that it had every right to expect that the site would be free from obstructions other than those evidenced in the plans and specifications distributed by the port.if the plans and specifications fail to completely and accurately present the scope of the project and the problems that may be encountered,traylor claims that any additional costs incurred must be borne by the port.traylor challenges the district court consideration of any knowledge that traylor may have obtained regarding the obstructions had it conducted a thorough investigation of the project site as a basis for denying it additional compensation.traylor maintains that its right to recover additional compensation does not depend on what it knew or should have known about the project site before submitting their bids.it explains that the contract is governed by industry practices and public law,which provide that the risk of differing site conditions are placed on the owner for circumstances beyond the contractor control.thus,traylor concludes that its knowledge at the time of bidding is irrelevant.
in support of its position,traylor relies on con plex,division of industries,louisiana department of transportation development,so d.in con plex,the department of transportation dot advertised for bids to construct a bridge and to remove an existing pontoon bridge.con plex obtained a set of plans and specifications and conducted a contractually required inspection.relying upon the aforementioned plans and specifications and a site inspection,con plex submitted a bid and was awarded the job.upon commencing removal of an existing bridge on the site,it became apparent that the plans and specifications relating to the project did not accurately reflect the number or size of pilings to be removed.the court held that the dot failed to provide adequate plans and specifications and to warn prospective bidders of the true number and location of pilings to be removed.accordingly,the court held that con plex was entitled to additional compensation.traylor avers that since there is no meaningful distinction between con plex and the present case,it is entitled to an award of damages.
traylor reliance on con plex is misplaced.in con plex,the dot did not allege that con plex failed to adequately investigate the site prior to submitting its bid.instead,it contended that the language of the contract entered into by the two parties put con plex on notice that the plans and specifications did not indicate all the piles then in existence,and that the site inspection required by the contract cured any failure or deficiency in the plans and specifications.the trial court determined that dot violated the public bid law when it prepared a contract which passed on or imposed a duty to inquire upon the bidders.expressly rejecting this theory,the state appellate court affirmed the trial court judgment,but only on contractual grounds.specifically,the court determined that the terms of the contract did not adequately warn con plex of the site conditions,and that the language of the contract was ambiguous.here,as in con plex,traylor had a contractual duty,prior to submitting its bid,to adequately examine the site to determine whether it was possible to perform the job.one notable difference between con plex and the present case is that con plex was hired to both remove an existing structure and to build a structure at the same location,a bridge,whereas here,traylor was only hired to build a structure,the wharf.the divergence that is fatal to traylor claim,however,is that the contract in this case,unlike in con plex,sufficiently warned traylor of the obstructions that may be encountered.specifically,the contract advised that there were numerous steel and timber piles removed to the approximate existing mudline in the area of the required dredging and that there were unknown infrastructures for which the contractor would be compensated up to for the removal,relocation,or for reconstruction of unknown infrastructures encountered during the construction phase.the only obstruction that traylor could logically argue constituted an unknown infrastructure was the concrete slab in the dredging area.this obstruction,however,was removed at the port expense traylor does not dispute that it was advised of the obstructions for which it now complains.instead,it maintains that the number of the obstructions encountered were far greater than anticipated.during trial,michael traylor michael,a civil engineer,who was the lead estimator of the project bid team for traylor,testified as follows 
court when the port tells a prospective bidder contractors shall be advised that there are numerous steel and timber piles removed to the approximate existing mudline in the area of the required dredging,what does that mean to you 
michael it means that there are some old piling out there.numerous is a very questionable number.i would have guessed about fifteen,twenty wood piles that were removed for some reason,to the mudline.
court what do you base that guess on 
michael there is no way to guess,really,i would just assume that,you know,to be competitive in bidding a job.i looked at it and i said to my self,these piles,you do know exactly how many there are.but i talked to tl and they said that they have done lots of bridge dredging and they would give us a competitive price.and they were fine with this specifications and it was a riverside excavation specification.
court and if your guess is wrong,as it was here,who do you think is responsible for the error 
michael my guess,i saying what my guess is,at this point of time,of twenty,i personally believe that if they put a very vague thing like numerous in here,especially since it is in the river excavation,the things are going to be removed 
court you did see any need or any of your engineers or even tl saw no need to find out more information about how many or to what extent that phrase meant,numerous steel and timber piles 
michael we did not.
if the district court finds that the contract is clear and unambiguous,the specific provisions within the contract should not be disregarded under pretext of pursuing its spirit.cashio shoriak,so d.rather,once the court concludes that the contract is unambiguous,the terms of the contract must be enforced as written.louisiana ins.guar.ass interstate fire cas,so d.
in the present case,the district court never made an expressed determination of whether the term numerous as used in the bidding package is vague or ambiguous.although the court did not explicitly so hold,it is reasonable to conclude that the court found that the term was neither vague nor ambiguous since it concluded that the contract sufficiently put traylor on notice of the obstructions.while michael testified that the term numerous within the meaning of the contract is vague,traylor has neither briefed nor argued this issue on appeal.it is that when a party fails to brief an issue,it can not be considered on appeal.matter of.mortgage services corporation,cir i ssues not raised or argued in the brief of the appellant may be considered waived and thus will not be noticed or entertained by the court of appeals.because traylor is precluded from asserting that the terms of the contract were vague and ambiguous,it has no basis for arguing that the bid package failed to provide sufficient notice of the obstructions.
we further reject traylor contention that it had no duty to investigate the project site.the bid package specifically provided that 
it is understood that contractor has,prior to submission of bid,satisfied himself as to the character,quantity,and quality of the materials to be encountered prior to submitting a proposal,bidders are expected to examine these contract documents in their entirety and to visit the site of the work,and to investigate operations of the board and others at the site.emphasis added.
michael landrieu mayeux,a civil engineer for tl,testified that his investigation of the project site consisted of basically just standing on the river bank and look ing at the water go by.further,michael and tom peterman,traylor manager of the project,who was also a member of the bid team,both testified that while observing the project site,prior to submitting traylor bid,they did not examine the maps in the port maps and archives room,as suggested by the bid package.they simply looked to see if there were any other activities on the site and whether the water was rising.michael also admitted that he was aware that demolition work on the site would take place before the project commencement date,however,he did not inquire as to how much debris,if any,would be left on the site once the structure was removed 
all of the evidence stated above weighs strongly against an award of damages in favor of traylor.the contract informed traylor of both known and unknown obstructions on the site and referred traylor to the port maps and archives room to receive a more detailed map of the premise,which traylor failed to do.apparently conceding notice of the obstructions,traylor attempts to argue that its knowledge of the obstructions prior to bidding is irrelevant because the contract is governed by industry practices and public law,which shifts the risk of differing site conditions to the owner for circumstances beyond the contractor control.
in support of this proposition,traylor again points to con plex.its reliance on con plex is erroneous because the con plex court specifically refused to rule that an owner violates public law when it drafts a contract that passes on,or imposes a duty to inquire upon the bidders.the court only found in favor of con plex because it determined that the terms of the contract did not adequately warn con plex of the site conditions and that the language of the contract was ambiguous.here,the bid package gave traylor sufficient notice of the obstructions it may encounter and referred traylor to the port maps and archives room for more detailed information.in addition,the bid package informed traylor of the demolition contract.nevertheless,traylor did not investigate the operations of others at the site,as advised by the contract.lastly,the district court did not rule that the terms of the contract were ambiguous and traylor does not assert this argument on appeal.thus,con plex does not support traylor contention.
because traylor failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the site,it can not now complain of the character and amount of work it had to perform under the contract.see bd.of port com rs for port of new orleans,so.where in an offer for bidders to a contract the bidders were warned to examine the location of the proposed work and acquaint themselves with existing conditions,plaintiff,having accepted,can not complain of the character and amount of work to be performed under the contract.because the obstructions actually encountered by traylor were reasonably foreseeable based on all of the information available at the time of the bid,it has failed to meet the first element required to sustain an equitable adjustment cause of action.as the district court correctly stated,the evidence clearly reveals that traylor suffered from deliberate ignorance,and therefore,is not entitled to additional compensation.
improper sequence 
the district court also determined that traylor failed to follow the design sequence as set forth in the bid package.the sequence required that the wharf be constructed in the following order dredging,pile driving,and.however,after dredging,traylor placed the,rather than driving the piles.the district court concluded that had traylor followed the specifications,there would have been no problems with the dredging and the design grade would have been maintained.accordingly,the district court held that this was another basis for denying traylor additional compensation.
traylor concedes that it did not perform the work in the sequence set out by the contract however,it asserts that the obstructions disrupted the orderly sequence of the project to such an extent that the proper sequence could not be followed.traylor reasons that because the job could not have been accomplished except at a greater expense to traylor,the plans were defective.the law is clear that,as a general rule,w here one agrees to do,for a fixed sum,a thing possible to be performed,he will not be excused or become entitled to additional compensation because unforeseen difficulties are encountered.shipbuilding bing dampskibsaktieselskab,so,see day united states.however,when the contractor is required to build according to set plans and specifications prepared by the owner,the contractor will not be responsible for the consequences of defects in the plans and specifications.id.citation omitted.an owner can not shift this responsibility to the contractor by simply placing the usual clauses requiring builders to visit the site,to check the plans,and to inform themselves of the requirements of the work.shipbuilding,so.at citing christie united states.
in the instant case,traylor does not allege that the wharf design itself was defective,rather it contends that the number and magnitude of the obstructions encountere
