introduction 
these appeals follow an administrative ruling by the city of san diego city to permanently debar southern california underground contractors,socal from contracting with city.the debarment was based on findings of the san diego city council city council that socal engaged in corrupt practices while administering public works contracts it had entered into with city.the trial court granted socal petition for writ of administrative mandamus code civ,concluding that the decision to permanently debar socal constituted an abuse of discretion and an act in excess of city authority because socal had not engaged in any practices,corrupt or otherwise,involving the administration of its contracts with city,but rather had engaged in such practices only in the performance of the contracts.accordingly,the court ordered city to adopt its proposed alternative resolution to debar socal for a period of three years.the court rejected socal claim that the debarment proceeding denied socal its rights to procedural due process and to a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal.
in its appeal,socal does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings upon which the debarment was based.rather,socal contends it was not given a full and fair opportunity to defend itself.specifically,socal maintains it was denied the right to confront and adverse witnesses and the right to present live testimony before an impartial tribunal.city also appeals,contending the court erred in finding that socal had not engaged in corrupt practices involving the administration of contracts and that its order for permanent debarment was thus proper.
we conclude that the debarment proceeding afforded socal due process and a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal,and affirm the judgment in this respect.however,we further conclude that socal corrupt practices involved the administration of city contracts so as to warrant permanent debarment.accordingly,we reverse the judgment insofar as it imposes on socal a debarment rather than a permanent one.
factual and procedural background 
socal is a contractor that specializes in public underground construction projects.in june,while working on projects for city,socal was debarred for engaging in corrupt practices involving the administration or award of a contract with the city san diego b.the debarment was based on city council findings,made after a hearing,that socal had engaged in a pattern of willful acts of corruption and deception,unethical and unacceptable business practices,and inadequate contract performance on numerous public works contracts with city.in the three weeks before the debarment hearing,city provided socal with a written factual basis and supporting evidence for the proposed debarment,and made available for review and copying all project files for the contracts upon which the proposed debarment was based.at the request of socal,city also made available for deposition six of its inspectors to testify as to the allegations supporting the debarment.
after the city council rendered its decision to permanently debar socal,socal filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus,challenging the debarment.while the writ was pending,socal filed a lawsuit against city in which it alleged that the debarment was illegal.in issuing the writ,the court remanded the debarment matter to the city council for a rehearing,based upon its finding that socal had not been afforded adequate time to prepare a defense,and thus had been denied due process.the court ordered that another hearing be set no sooner than days from the date of the court ruling.
city scheduled the second debarment hearing for may,days after the court ruling.on april,city served socal with manager report,in which the factual basis for the proposed debarment was set forth,together with supporting documents.the proposed debarment was based on the same charges that were raised in the june proceeding falsifying traffic control permits working in the public without traffic control plans or appropriate traffic control,on numerous occasions taking water from city fire hydrants without having water meters,and using meters that were either inoperable or had been reported missing so the use of water could not be billed misrepresenting that work had been completed,and attempting to cover up the misrepresentation submitting numerous false claims for extra work,at significantly inflated labor rates submitting false claims for inflated rates on equipment by physically altering equipment model numbers and submitting false worker compensation claims from city insurance program.
before the second hearing,socal took additional depositions of city employees.city informed socal it could dispute the proposed debarment through a combination of submitting written materials to the city council and making an oral presentation to the city council.socal was given the right to submit unlimited written materials,including legal briefs,witness declarations and deposition transcripts.city advised socal that in order to ensure a full and fair opportunity to be heard before the city council,socal should present its complete position in writing in advance of the hearing,together with all supporting documentation.socal was further informed that f air opportunity for testimony will be accorded subject to the regular meeting rules and discretion of the city council.if socal wishes to have written materials considered,please ensure delivery to the city clerk in order for the city council members to review it prior to the debarment hearing.city twice reminded socal that socal had the right to submit unlimited written materials.with regard to the right to witnesses,city pointed out that socal had been afforded the opportunity to witnesses during their depositions,and that socal could present this testimony at the city council hearing through written statements,declarations and deposition transcripts.
socal,through its counsel,submitted nearly pages of written materials to the city clerk at on the day prior to the scheduled debarment hearing.at the may,hearing,counsel for socal was allowed minutes to present socal case.the hearing was continued for one week to allow time for the members of the city council to review socal written submissions.socal was also permitted to,and did,submit a supplemental brief and additional deposition transcripts after the hearing.at the continued hearing on may,socal attorney made another oral presentation.
following the hearings,the city council adopted a resolution permanently debarring socal.the city council made an alternative motion to debar socal for three years in the event a court were to overturn the permanent debarment.
socal filed its administrative mandamus petition in the superior court,challenging the procedural aspects of the debarment and claiming that city had acted beyond its statutory authority in permanently debarring socal.the court rejected socal due process argument,finding that socal had been afforded ample opportunity to conduct discovery,present evidence and adverse witnesses prior to the debarment hearing.the court further found that socal had not met its burden of showing it had been denied due process on the grounds that certain members of the city council failed to consider socal evidence,or that the city council was biased because socal had filed a lawsuit against city.
however,the court granted socal petition for writ of mandate on the ground that the decision to permanently debar socal under section b for corrupt practices involving the administration of a contract constituted an abuse of discretion and an act in excess of city authority.in distinguishing between the terms administration of a contract and performance of a contract as used in section a and b,the court found socal had not engaged in any practices,corrupt or otherwise,involving the administration of contracts.rather,the court found,socal had provided unsatisfactory performance under the contracts.the court concluded that socal unsatisfactory performance,together with its demonstrated lack of business integrity,warranted a debarment under section a.accordingly,the court ordered city to vacate its decision permanently debarring socal,and to adopt a resolution debarring socal for a period of three years.
socal appeala.the debarment proceeding before the city council satisfied the requirements of due processa.socal was not entitled to a full evidentiary hearing before the city council 
socal contends the debarment proceeding before the city council was fundamentally unfair and resulted in a denial of due process because socal was not allowed to present live rebuttal testimony or to adverse witnesses.socal asserts that being afforded only the opportunity to provide written submissions and to make a limited oral presentation does not satisfy the requirements of due process.
the ultimate determination whether an administrative proceeding was fundamentally fair is a question of law to be decided on appeal.rosenblit superior court d.thus,we independently evaluate socal claims that it was denied a fair hearing.id.at.san diego county deputy sheriffs san diego county civil service com.th,d.
debarment excludes an individual or entity from doing business with the government as a result of wrongful conduct or violations of a public contract or program.golden day schools,state of education th,d.although debarment can have a severe economic impact on contractors,it is not intended as punishment.it is,instead,a necessary means to enable the contracting governmental agency to deal with irresponsible bidders and contractors,and to administer its duties with efficiency.id.at,d,citing gonzalez freeman.however,because debarment implicates a liberty interest,a contractor has a due process right to a fair hearing when a government entity seeks to debar it from contract eligibility.golden day schools,state of education,supra,th at,d stacy witbeck,city and county of san francisco th,fn,d.although a government contractor can not be debarred without procedural safeguards,there is no constitutional entitlement to the full panoply of judicial trial procedures such as.stacy witbeck,city and county of san francisco,supra,th at,d.
due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews eldridge,d.unlike some legal rules,due process is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time,place and circumstance.citation.id.at.rather,it is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.citation.ibid.determining whether a particular administrative procedure is constitutionally sufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private interests involved the private interest that will be affected by the official action the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used and any probable value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.id.at.
socal cites goldberg kelly,d to support its position that due process requires that it be afforded the opportunity to confront and adverse witnesses at the debarment hearing before the city council.in goldberg,new york city welfare recipients challenged the adequacy of procedures for notice and hearing in connection with the termination of their public assistance payments.while acknowledging that some governmental benefits may be administratively terminated without affording the recipients a evidentiary hearing,the supreme court held that due process required such a hearing when public assistance payments to welfare recipients may be discontinued.id.at.significantly,in arriving at this conclusion,the court stated t he crucial factor in this factor not present in the case of the blacklisted government contractor,is that termination of aid pending resolution of a controversy over eligibility may deprive an eligible recipient of the very means by which to live while he waits.since he lacks independent resources,his situation becomes immediately desperate.his need to concentrate upon finding the means for daily subsistence,in turn,adversely affects his ability to seek redress from the welfare bureaucracy.italics added.the court held that as applied to the particular characteristics of a welfare recipient,principles of due process required timely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for a proposed termination,and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally.id.at.
noting that new york city procedures did not permit welfare recipients to present evidence orally or to confront and witnesses,the court in goldberg explained the context of its holding the opportunity to be heard must be tailored to the capacities and circumstances of those who are to be heard.it is not enough that a welfare recipient may present his position to the decision maker in writing or through his caseworker.written submissions are an unrealistic option for most recipients,who lack the educational attainment necessary to write effectively and who can not obtain professional assistance.goldberg kelly,supra,at,italics added.further,written submissions do not provide the flexibility of oral presentations or permit the recipient to mold his argument to the issues the decision maker appears to regard as important.id.at.thus,a welfare recipient must be allowed to state his position orally.informal procedures will suffice in this context due process does not require a particular order of proof or mode of offering evidence.citation.ibid.additionally,the court held,due process requires that welfare recipients be afforded the opportunity to confront and adverse witnesses.id.at.
here,as noted in goldberg,the administrative procedure followed did not deprive socal of the very means by which to live goldberg kelly,supra,at.socal is a sophisticated business entity and had the professional assistance of counsel.socal was given timely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for a proposed debarment.goldberg kelly,supra,at.socal was afforded an effective opportunity to confront adverse witnesses at depositions.and,unlike the welfare recipients in goldberg,socal was able,through its counsel,to effectively present its position in writing,and present arguments and evidence orally before the decision maker.id.at.the procedure followed here was tailored to socal capacities and circumstances,and thus provided sufficient due process safeguards.goldberg kelly,supra,at.
in mathews eldridge,supra,d,the supreme court addressed the issue whether due process required an evidentiary hearing in the context of an administrative termination of disability benefits.id.at.the court distinguished goldberg,where welfare assistance is given to persons on the very margin of subsistence,noting that eligibility for disability benefits is not based on financial need.id.at.accordingly,there is less reason here than in goldberg to depart from the ordinary principle,established by our decisions,that something less than an evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.id.at.
in considering the fairness and reliability of the existing administrative procedures for disability recipients,the mathews court observed that the potential value of an evidentiary hearing was substantially less than in the welfare context.the court noted that written submissions provide the disability recipient with an effective means of communicating his case to the decision maker.the state agency identifies with particularity the information relevant to the entitlement decision,and information critical to that decision is ordinarily derived from medical sources.these sources are likely to be able to communicate more effectively through written documents than are welfare recipients or lay witnesses.mathews eldridge,supra,at.in addition,before benefits are terminated,the disability recipient is afforded full access to the information relied on by the state agency.the recipient is given reasons for the tentative assessment and an opportunity to submit additional arguments and evidence.id.at.the court found that this procedure enables the recipient to mold his argument to respond to the precise issues which the decision maker regards as crucial.id.at.
moreover,the mathews court noted,requiring an evidentiary hearing in all cases before terminating disability benefits would entail fiscal and administrative burdens out of proportion to any countervailing benefits.further,the court observed that t he judicial model of an evidentiary hearing is neither a required,nor even the most effective,method of decisionmaking in all circumstances.mathews eldridge,supra,at.all that is necessary to comport with due process is that the procedures be tailored,in light of the decision to be made,to the capacities and circumstances of those who are to be heard,citation to insure that they are given a meaningful opportunity to present their case.id.at.
here,the administrative proceeding in which socal participated comported fully with the requirements of due process,as articulated by the court in mathews.the manager report identified with particularity the information relevant to the proposed debarment and summarized city evidence against socal.city provided supporting documents upon which it would rely,and allowed socal to review city complete files pertaining to the subject contracts,prior to the debarment hearing socal was given the opportunity to conduct discovery,and was permitted to present unlimited documentary evidence,witness statements in the form of declarations,and the testimony of adverse witnesses it had.through its written arguments,both factual and legal,socal was able to respond to the specific charges underlying the proposed debarment.mathews eldridge,supra,at.in addition to providing written submissions,socal was afforded the opportunity to make two oral presentations,to mold its argument to the issues city regarded as important.goldberg kelly,supra,at.in sum,socal had a meaningful opportunity to be heard and thus received due process.
socal cites golden day schools,state of education,supra,th at page,d,for the proposition that due process required that it have been allowed to present live testimony and to adverse witnesses at the hearing before the city council.in golden day,the court held that a child care contractor with the state,debarred from applying for further contracts for three years,had a due process liberty interest entitling it to a hearing regarding the justification for the debarment.id.at,d.the procedures afforded in that case consisted of review of the contractor written submissions and an oral presentation during which the contractor or its representative had the opportunity to argue or explain any material submitted in its response.the review panel could set reasonable limits on the scope of the presentation.id.at,d.
in addressing the contractor claim that the hearing was unfair because the contractor was not permitted to adverse witnesses,the court in golden day noted that the contractor had not sought to anyone.however,the court held that the contractor should have been allowed the opportunity to staff persons who had participated in the determination that led to the debarment recommendation.the court ultimately remanded the matter for a new hearing before a panel member who had not participated in the initial decision.id.at,d.
here,unlike in golden day,socal did have the opportunity to city employees who participated in the investigation leading to its debarment.socal took the depositions of adverse witnesses and was able to present their deposition testimony to the city council,and to highlight in its written briefs and oral presentation any inconsistencies,faulty memory or bias on the part of these witnesses.
nothing in golden day or other case law requires that occur at the hearing before the city council rather than at a deposition.in the vast bulk of circumstances,the procedures chosen by the legislature or by the agency are likely to be based on application of a test by an institution positioned better than a court to identify and quantify social costs and benefits.a court should give serious consideration to a legislative or agency choice of procedures only when it has indications that the agency or legislature chose its procedures in bad faith or without considering the implications of its choice of procedures in assessing what process is due,substantial weight must be given to the judgments of the agency.citation.mohilef janovici th,d,italics omitted.
socal offers no evidence to support the conclusion that the city council chose the procedures followed at the debarment hearings in bad faith,or that it failed to consider the implications of its choices.in the absence of such evidence,the court must give great deference to city council choice of procedures.
socal was not entitled to receive due process protections set forth in the code of federal regulations or government code section.
citing the code of federal regulations,socal asserts that city debarment proceeding did not comply with minimum due process standards required by federal law.however,the code of federal regulations applies to administrative agencies of the federal government,not to municipalities or local agencies.see.
similarly,the provisions of the government code cited by socal apply to state boards,commissions,and officers,and not to local entities,subd.a.even if government code section applied,here,socal did receive notice and an opportunity to be heard,including the opportunity to present and rebut evidence.
socal was afforded the opportunity to effectively participate in the debarment hearing 
socal asserts city did not follow its own specific uniform procedures under the san diego municipal code,such as providing an opportunity to participate in the administrative hearing a.however,as we previously discussed,socal was afforded the opportunity to,and did,fully participate in the administrative hearing.
socal compares the procedure for debarment with the procedure for bid protest hearings,which allows for presentation of live testimony and of witnesses,and argues that it should have been afforded the opportunity to present live testimony and.the procedures for administrative enforcement hearings such as bid protests require the appointment of a hearing officer.et in contrast,debarment is determined by the city council,which determines the procedures to be followed,b.the court will not city choice of procedures to carry out its various functions,as long as those procedures comport with the requirements of due process.in assessing what process is due,we accord substantial weight to city good faith judgments.mohilef janovici,supra,th at,d.
this court presumes the city council considered all evidence offered by socal 
socal contends that allowing written submission of briefs was an unsatisfactory method of resolving city debarment decision because there was no guarantee the members of the city council would review these materials.however,city is entitled to the benefit of the presumption that its official duty has been regularly performed,gentry city of murrieta th,d.following the presentations at the original hearing on may,the debarment hearing was continued for one week specifically to allow the city council additional time to thoroughly review the documents submitted,including exhibits.
we presume city considered all of socal evidence,as it was required to do,in arriving at its debarment decision.comments by certain city council members cited by socal are taken entirely out of context and do not support socal speculative argument that the written submissions were not read,or that only a cursory review of the materials was made.further,it is not within the province of the court to inquire into what evidence was or was not examined or relied on by a council member in reaching his or her decision.city of fairfield superior court cal d.
socal received a hearing before an unbiased tribunal 
socal contends it did not receive a hearing before a reasonably impartial,noninvolved tribunal because city was both prosecutor and adjudicator,and at the same time,was a defendant in socal pending lawsuit for damages.preliminarily,we
