this is an appeal from the armed services board of contract appeals the board.on appeal,franklin pavkov construction company fpc seeks an equitable adjustment for claims arising from a contract to install four sets of stairs on two dormitory buildings at shaw air force base,south carolina the project.fpc argued that it received defective specifications and defective material,and that it was entitled to other adjustments.the board denied all but one of fpc claims.we affirm the board decision.
background 
on october,the twentieth contracting squadron at shaw air force base,south carolina the government awarded the project to fpc.the project had been previously bid and contracted to a different contractor in.the previous attempt to implement the project was unsuccessful.in,the government had the specification,drawings and materials from the incomplete project.the government modified the specifications and drawings for a second bid process that led to fpc winning the bid for the project in.these are referred to as the specifications and drawings in contrast to the specifications and drawings from the earlier project.in addition,the government revised some shop drawings generated during the unsuccessful attempt to construct the project in.these are referred to as the d h drawings named after the subcontractor who prepared them in.
milling,a government engineer,intended the solicitation for bids to contain i the specifications,ii the drawings five pages,and iii the d h drawings six pages.he provided these materials to the government office of contracting for distribution to potential bidders.the board found that when fpc ordered the bid solicitation package,the government,for unexplained reasons,sent fpc only i the specifications and ii the drawings.the government did not send fpc the d h drawings.the front page of the solicitation delineated the documents and exhibits supposedly attached to the solicitation by including the following language 
specifications for repair stairs at dorms and 
project sha,dated march.
drawings for repair stairs at dorms and 
project sha,pages.
thus,this language indicated that forty pages of drawings were included,although the government intended to include only eleven pages of drawings with the package,and only five pages were sent to fpc.the five pages of drawings sent to fpc,however,were numbered as sheets one through five of five,respectively.the language also indicated that the specifications were attached,although fpc received the specifications.
mark pavkov of fpc bid the project,but his brother,vince pavkov,was to implement the project with another company as a subcontractor to fpc.mark pavkov had his brother vince pavkov visit the job site twice during the bidding process before the government awarded the contract.
on october,the government awarded the project to fpc as a contract for.the completion date was scheduled for november.at a preconstruction conference held november,the government gave vince pavkov five sets of i the specifications and ii the drawings.in january or february,fpc serendipitously discovered the d h drawings by hiring an employee who happened to have worked on the unsuccessful construction of the project.in to early october,when the project was approximately ninety percent complete,it came to vince pavkov attention that the government inspector was making statements contrary to the specifications in fpc possession.the parties compared the specifications in fpc possession with those in the government possession.the government inspector had been using the specifications while fpc had been using the specifications.the government had the materials and components from the earlier contractor unsuccessful attempt in to build the stairs.it listed these in the contract for the project as material that the government would furnish.the list included thirty line items,each with an item number,description and quantity.the list had a qualifying statement that the materials were provided as is and any cleaning,scraping,painting or other forms of reconditioning required to make the material meet specifications shall be the responsibility of the contractor.the contract for the project also included a government furnished property gfp clause.this clause required the government to supply gfp identified in the list.federal acquisition regulations far property short form a a.however,the contract did not explicitly obligate the government to provide shop drawings as part of the gfp.
just before fpc started construction,the government moved the purportedly listed gfp to a but unlocked location to yards from the job site.the government made two attempts to meet with vince pavkov in november to take an inventory of the gfp.vince pavkov cancelled the first planned meeting.at the second meeting in late november,the parties met at the fenced location and began to take the inventory.however,before completing the inventory,vince pavkov had to leave.one of the items that the parties did not inventory were the stair nosings,devices that prevent slipping on the steps.the gfp list indicated that the government was to supply stair nosings,but when vince pavkov later went to retrieve them he found only ten in the area.fpc advised the government of the missing nosings on may,approximately six months after the gfp was delivered.fabricating and procuring the missing stair nosings had a long.in order to avoid delaying the project,fpc obtained permission from the government to use a substitute aluminum channel.
fpc recognized another problem with the gfp.the configuration of some of the parts caused fpc to question whether all of the stairs were typical as shown on the drawings.after it discovered the d h drawings,fpc determined that some stair directions were not typical as indicated.the direction of a set of stairs is the direction in which they rise or fall when viewing the side of the building.a note on the d h drawings indicated that the stair parts may be matched to stairs running in specific directions.this knowledge made the work go more smoothly for fpc.however,for one of the buildings,fpc had to unexpectedly construct new concrete forms for stairs running in the opposite direction in order to use the gfp because some of the stair railings would only fit stairs running in the reverse direction.fpc did not bring the stair direction problem to the attention of the government until the claim was filed.on march,the government deemed all the work acceptable and formally accepted it as of that date.
on march,fpc submitted a certified claim to the contracting officer for additional costs and other adjustments,totaling,and resulting from,among other items,the allegedly defective specifications and the missing gfp.on june,the contracting officer denied fpc claim.fpc appealed the contracting officer decision to the board.
the board ruled against fpc for all but one count of its claim.see franklin pavkov constr,asbca lexis,cch,asbca,wl.fpc had alleged that the absence of the specifications and the d h drawings amounted to a defective specification.the board held otherwise.predicated on a review of the differences between the and specifications,the board reasoned that fpc bid,based on the specifications and drawings,was for a project of greater scope and cost than a project based on the intended bid solicitation package of the specifications,drawings and d h drawings.however,the government only required fpc to perform the project of the intended bid package.thus,fpc could not have possibly suffered increased costs due to the absence of the specifications and d h drawings.id.at.
the board found the differences between the and specifications to be as follows a the specifications gave a list of gfp that included a column indicating the number of items anticipated in total for the job,whereas the list fpc received only included the quantity that the government would furnish b for steel joists,metal roof deck and certain steel stairs work,the specifications required fpc to generate and submit shop drawings whereas the specifications indicated that the government would provide these drawings to fpc c the specifications required the submission of manufacturer product descriptions and installation instructions for metal floor deck whereas the specifications indicated only that any additional metal floor deck required beyond the gfp should match the gfp d the specifications required a warranty for the roofing,but the specifications did not and e a different contracting officer signed each version of the specifications.id.at.in particular,the board reasoned that fpc could not base its defective specification claim on the additional information in the specifications because the contract had an order of precedence clause that listed the specifications last,and because the specifications would have reduced fpc costs.id.at.finally,the board reasoned that the project was not impossible to perform without the omitted information.id.at.
with respect to the gfp,the board held that delivery occurred when the government and vince pavkov met in the location near the job site to inventory the material in late november,before commencement of the work.id.at.the gfp clause in the contract required fpc to give written notice if the gfp is not suitable for its intended use.the board reasoned that the notice must be timely and therefore that the contract implicitly required fpc to inventory the gfp even though the contract did not explicitly have a clause requiring the parties to conduct a joint inventory.fpc gave the government notice of unsuitable gfp in may,six months after the government and vince pavkov first met in the area.the board found that this notice was not timely.id.the board denied fpc requested relief except as to one count 
on appeal,fpc asserts that it is entitled to equitable adjustment for three reasons the government drawings and specifications were inadequate and incomplete because it failed to furnish fpc with a complete set of drawings and specifications and this delayed and disrupted fpc progress on the project the gfp was inadequate and incomplete because it did not comply with the drawings and this caused fpc additional cost to build additional concrete forms and the government never properly discharged its duty to deliver the gfp and is therefore responsible for the costs to replace the missing material.we have jurisdiction under.see g a.
ii.standard of review 
under the contract disputes act,we review the board decision according to the following standard 
t he decision of the agency board on any question of law shall not be final or conclusive,but the decision on any question of fact shall be final and conclusive and shall not be set aside unless the decision is fraudulent,or arbitrary,or capricious,or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith,or if such decision is not supported by substantial evidence.
b.accordingly,we review the board legal determinations de novo,see ingalls shipbuilding,dalton,and we will not disturb the board factual findings unless they are not supported by substantial evidence,see cessna aircraft dalton,newport news shipbuilding dry dock garrett,andersen consulting united states,we defer to the board finding of fact unless unsupported by substantial evidence.citing united states dekonty.
iii.discussion 
adequacy of drawings and specifications 
on appeal,fpc contends that the board misapplied the spearin doctrine.see united states spearin.under the spearin doctrine,when the government provides a contractor with defective specifications,the government is deemed to have breached the implied warranty that satisfactory contract performance will result from adherence to the specifications,and the contractor is entitled to recover costs proximately flowing from the breach.see,spearin,at.essex electro eng rs,danzig,usa petroleum united states,ordnance research,united states.fpc argues that the board impermissibly injected an impossibility element into the doctrine by stating that it was not impossible for fpc to complete the work with the information contained in the specifications and drawings.
we take the board analysis of the defective specification issue to mean that this is not a situation where the specification is defective,or,that to the extent the specification is arguably defective by omission,there are no additional costs flowing proximately from the defect.in either case,we agree with the board ultimate conclusion.thus,the board comments that the project was not impossible do not create reversible error.
the issue is whether a specification can be defective by omission of information at the solicitation stage when the government intended to provide the information,but where the contractor instead was provided a subset of the information from which the contractor developed and furnished a bid.the answer will turn on the nature of the omitted information and the other facts and circumstances of the situation.here,the contract was a firm,contract that required fpc to furnish all labor,material,equipment,and transportation and perform all operations necessary to repair the stairs.pavkov at.in essence,as contractors must when they bid work,fpc took a certain amount of risk by submitting a bid and ultimately entering into the contract on the basis of the information before it the specifications and drawings.even though it did not have the specifications or the d h drawings,fpc had other opportunities to gather information during the bid process,including visits to the job site by one of its representatives.moreover,there were no government responsibilities expressed in the specifications for it to prepare or supply the additional information contained in the specifications and d h drawings.
the contract stated that the government would provide specifications,which it did at the preconstruction conference.even though those specifications were the specifications,fpc does not argue that it was somehow held to a higher standard of performance,or required to supply materially different deliverables on the basis of the specifications.the record does not show that the government held fpc to performance standards articulated in the specifications but not expressed in the specifications,and that this increased fpc costs.the record does not show that the government demanded anything on the basis of the specifications that increased fpc costs.recovery for defective specifications requires proof that the defective specifications increased costs.fpc only argues that its costs would have been reduced if it had received the specifications because of the information contained therein.however,as the board reasoned,the specifications required fpc to do more work,not less,and therefore it had in fact submitted its bid knowing the scope of work required for it to deliver the performance noted in the specifications.
even if fpc costs would have been lower if it had the benefit of the specifications and d h drawings,this does not make the specifications defective because the purpose of the spearin doctrine is to allow contractors to recover when the government does not fulfill its responsibilities in preparing and supplying specifications.even though the government intended to distribute the specifications and d h drawings,this intent does not mutate into an obligation to do so.because fpc entered into a contract on the basis of the specifications,and because the board had substantial evidence to determine that the differences in the specifications did not increase fpc costs and that the specifications in and of themselves were not defective,we agree with the board conclusion that any defect by omission in this situation is not a defect allowing for recovery 
delivery of gfp and notice of missing items 
fpc next argues that the government never completed delivery of the gfp.its logic is as follows.the contract did not state a time or location for delivery.thus,a reasonable delivery is required.only after delivery is accepted does the risk of loss shift to fpc.the gfp remained in the care,custody and control of the government until fpc came to the area and retrieved it piece by piece.thus,fpc alleges error by the board in its holding that delivery occurred when the government and fpc met in the area to inventory the gfp in november,which was
